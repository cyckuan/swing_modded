<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; After a round of applause that included both
standing ovations and icy silence, Elia Kazan accepted the
Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award on Sunday without mentioning
blacklisting or the McCarthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In what was perhaps the most anticipated acceptance speech of
the 71st Academy Awards, the 89-year-old director just said thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the academy for its courage, generosity,''
Kazan said. ``Thank you all very much. I think I could just slip
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's brief speech was preceded by a round of applause that
put Hollywood's biggest stars on the spot as television cameras
panned the auditorium to show who was standing, who was clapping _
and who was sitting quietly in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were seated with arms folded or by their sides
were actors Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   Those offering a standing ovation included actor-director Warren
Beatty and actors Kurt Russell, Helen Hunt and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow director Steven Spielberg and his actress wife, Kate
Capshaw, applauded but did not stand.
</P>
<P>
   The award was bestowed by actor Robert De Niro and director
Martin Scorsese, who praised Kazan's contributions to film and
introduced a montage of Kazan's work, including 1947's
``Gentleman's Agreement'' and 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' _ both
of which earned him directing Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   The 47 years since Kazan's testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee _ in which he named eight
colleagues as members of the Communist Party _ have failed to quiet
the controversy within Hollywood over the McCarthy hearings and
blacklisting.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub over Kazan's award within the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion was all but confined to the few moments of his
presentation. But comedian Chris Rock couldn't resist a joke:
``Keep Kazan away from De Niro, 'cause De Niro hates rats.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could host Whoopi Goldberg, who joked that she thought ``the
blacklist was Hattie McDaniel and me,'' a reference to the first
African-American Oscar winner, a Best Supporting Actress nod for
``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sidewalks outside the Chandler Pavilion, hundreds of
demonstrators were as divided as those inside.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, with the exception of
one scuffle between anti-Kazan demonstrators and the California
Young Americans for Freedom, who came toting signs in support of
the controversial director.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police officers arrested one man for beating YAF
Director Darren Marks over the head with a placard. ``One guy took
a swing at my head, and somebody else busted a sign over my head,''
Marks said later.
</P>
<P>
   His placards hailed Kazan as an American hero: ``Kazan: Defender
of Free Speech,'' ``Hollywood Communists worked for Stalin,'' or
more low-brow statements like ``Kazan's the Man'' and ``Commies
Drool, Capitalists Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were even more signs calling Kazan and the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences villains: ``And the informer is
... Elia Kazan,'' ``Honor the blacklisted,'' and, in a contemporary
twist, ``Elia Kazan, the Linda Tripp of the Film Industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're similar because they both squealed on their friends,''
said Julia Stoville of San Pedro. ``I can see Kazan getting Oscars
for his films, but not for his life's work, which includes going to
the House Un-American Activities Committee and naming names. He
ruined people's lives. He should apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milvaney of Glendale wore black tape across his mouth
(most of the time) to protest Kazan's Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically destroyed those people,'' Milvaney said. ``But
the good thing is we're finally talking about Kazan and the
blacklists, which is Hollywood's darkest shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hager, a Woodland Hills resident who joined the Ayn Rand
Institute's pro-Kazan picket line, said he believes Kazan did the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he did was tell the truth. It's the Hollywood leftists who
should apologize. They were the villains. They were aiding and
abetting the Soviet Union. Mr. Kazan should get the Presidential
Medal of Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters began gathering around noon, building to a rowdy
frenzy by 3 p.m. as the stars arrived. The demonstrators jockeyed
for the best position to espouse their views, spilling out onto the
sidewalks at Hope Street and First Street.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the groups became so focused on each other they seemed
to forget about the steady procession of stars filing into the
Oscars across the street. The stars responded in kind, pulling up
with their tinted limousine windows rolled up.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's supporters say the filmmaker is an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``These communists were working for Stalin in secret,'' said
Jeff Greene, who brought his wife and two children to wave signs in
support of Kazan. ``If you're going to hate America, at least do it
publicly. It took a lot of courage for Kazan to speak out against
these communists.''
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m., when the cameras and the stars were inside, the
protesters quickly dispersed. &UR;

`SHAKESPEARE' EDGES OUT `PRIVATE RYAN' FOR BEST PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an upset, ``Shakespeare in Love'' was selected
best picture on Sunday night at the 71st annual Academy Awards,
defeating Steven Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg was given the Oscar for best director, one of five
Academy Awards for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' but the winner of the
evening was ``Shakespeare,'' which gained seven Academy Awards,
including best actress for Gwyneth Paltrow. .
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp disappointment to executives at Dreamworks and
Paramount who produced ``Saving Private Ryan,'' and had expected,
like numerous others in Hollywood, that the acclaimed World War II
drama would win the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected triumph of ``Shakespeare in Love'' was especially
sweet to Harvey Weinstein, co-owner of Miramax, who lavished
millions of dollars on a campaign promoting the the film in
Hollywood trade papers and newspapers _ and was criticized by
Dreamworks for doing so and forcing Spielberg's company to spend
more on its academy campaign. As late as Sunday morning, most
studio executives, producers and talent agents were convinced that
the Spielberg film would triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The other nominated films were ``Elizabeth,'' ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' and ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The top acting awards went to Ms. Paltrow and to Dame Judi Dench
in a supporting role for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Roberto Benigni
as leading actor for ``Life Is Beautiful'' and James Coburn in a
supporting role for ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial _ and dramatic _ moment of the awards
show was the honorary Oscar to Elia Kazan, the 89-year-old director
of ``On the Waterfront'' and other classics. Martin Scorsese and
Robert De Niro presented the Oscar for lifetime achievement to
Kazan, who named names before a congressional panel investigating
Communists in the entertainment business in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns by academy officials that some members of the
audience would protest, Kazan received a standing ovation. Some
members of the audience, such as the actors Nick Nolte and Ed
Harris, sat silent. Steven Spielberg applauded but did not get up.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan thanked the audience for their ``courage and generosity.''
After hugging Scorsese and De Niro, Kazan slowly walked off the
stage with his wife, Frances Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg, the host, dominated the show with a myriad of
costume changes, faintly off-color jokes (some of them at her own
expense) and one-liners about Linda Tripp and Kenneth Starr. At the
opening, Ms. Goldberg drew prolonged applause and laughter as she
appeared in an elaborate Elizabethan gown. Ms. Goldberg paid
tribute to the number of films nominated involving Shakespeare and
Elizabeth I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best actors in the world were nominated this
year,'' said Ms. Goldberg. ``One or two of them were even
American.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of the evening were Ms. Paltrow and Benigni. Ms.
Paltrow was given the Oscar for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and wept
as she thanked numerous colleagues and family members. Almost
instantly, the award turned the 26-year-old actress into one of
Hollywood's bigger stars.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni won awards for best actor for his performance in ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' and also collected the foreign-film Oscar. The
comedy-drama from Italy is about a man who seeks to protect his son
from the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Loren presented Benigni with the foreign-film award.
Benigni, who created the film, climbed over several seats and waved
enthusiastically as he skipped onstage to accept the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too much _ your generosity,'' said Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   The elfin and exuberant Benigni, a top comedy star in Italy, is
the first actor to win an Oscar for a foreign language film since
Miss Loren won for ``Two Women'' in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy Awards began with Oscars for two veteran actors.
Coburn was selected best supporting actor in the drama
``Affliction,'' and Dame Judi won best supporting actress for her
portrayal of the imperious Queen Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The award to Coburn, who played an alcoholic and abusive
patriarch in ``Affliction,'' symbolized a comeback for the
70-year-old actor, who overcame a 15-year battle with arthritis
that nearly ended his career. The award was, in some ways, a homage
to the 40-year career of the rangy, gravel-voiced actor, a star of
westerns the 1960s who developed into one of the most versatile
character actors in films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I
finally got one right, I guess,'' said Coburn, who had never before
been nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them you do for money,'' he said, ``some of them you
do for love. This is a love child.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi had been nominated last year as best actress in John
Madden's ``Mrs. Brown,'' in which she played Queen Victoria. She
then implored Madden to cast her in his next film, ``Shakespeare in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a
little bit of him,'' said Dame Judi as she held up her gold
statuette for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   Dominating the awards, and stirring a protest today outside the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center of Los Angeles
County, was the unanimous decision by the 39-member board of the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Jan. 7 to present
the Oscar to Kazan, who directed ``A Streetcar Named Desire,''
``Gentleman's Agreement,'' ``East of Eden'' and other films. Karl
Malden, the actor and a friend of Kazan's, proposed the award.
</P>
<P>
   Even his critics acknowledged that Kazan was one of the foremost
postwar film and theatrical directors whose influence on filmmaking
and acting still resonates. But Kazan, who is 89 and ailing, has
not been forgiven by formerly blacklisted writers and directors and
others for his decision to appear as a sympathetic witness before
the House Un-American Activities Committee. In 1952 he informed on
eight old friends from the Group Theater who, along with him, had
once belonged to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Kazan award, one of the most controversial in the history of
the Oscars, overshadowed another honorary Academy Award this year _
the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to Norman Jewison, whose
credits include ``The Cincinnati Kid,'' ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof'' and ``Moonstruck.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards were telecast for the first time on a Sunday, instead
of the traditional Monday, on ABC and around the world. The show
also started half an hour earlier than in the past, at 5:30 p.m. on
the West Coast, to accommodate television viewers in the East for
whom the event often ran past midnight, with many of them tuning
out.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to Sunday was largely dictated by television _ the
view at Disney-owned ABC that Sunday night would lure more home
viewers who would stay up and watch the extravaganza at the close
of the weekend. A second factor in the shift was that the ceremony,
which had been held on Mondays since 1959, caused rush-hour traffic
jams in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marking the awards this year was a spirited and, at times,
heated competition among three films, ``Saving Private Ryan,''
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is Beautiful.'' For months, the
front-runner was Steven Spielberg's acclaimed and harrowing drama
about eight World War II infantrymen who were sent into German
territory to rescue a family's sole surviving son.
</P>
<P>
   But Miramax, owned by the Walt Disney Co., began a high-profile
publicity campaign for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a witty comedy
involving a fictional romance between Shakespeare (played by Joseph
Fiennes) and a restless young woman (Ms. Paltrow). The results were
impressive: ``Shakespeare in Love'' garnered 13 nominations,
including ones for best picture and best actress, while ``Saving
Private Ryan'' received 11.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, with no clear winner, Dreamworks and
Paramount, producers of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' and Miramax have
sought to outspend each other with Hollywood trade paper and
newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax also spent millions of dollars promoting ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' a fable about a clownish man (played by Benigni) who
struggles to shield his son from the horrors of a German
concentration camp in World War II. Benigni also directed the film
and was co-writer of it with Vincenzo Cerami.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the competition, especially between ``Saving
Private Ryan'' and ``Shakespeare in Love,'' was unusually
suspenseful. Last year, James Cameron's watery epic ``Titanic'' was
an almost assured winner, and gathered 11 Oscars, including ones
for best picture and director.
</P>
<P>
   The other two films nominated this year for best picture were
Terrence Malick's adaptation of the 1962 James Jones novel ``The
Thin Red Line,'' about an Army troop's rite of passage during the
battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, and ``Elizabeth,'' starring
Cate Blanchett as the steely and commanding Queen Elizabeth I, the
daughter of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences _ which is composed of actors, filmmakers, producers,
writers, studio executives, cinematographers, costume designers and
others _ voted in the 24 Oscar categories.

SAY SO LONG TO THE OLD TELECAST RECORD

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, the Force wasn't on Oscar's side.
</P>
<P>
   It was sometime during the sound effects editing presentation
that we began noticing the time. Not a good sign when you've only
just passed the first quarter of a record-breakingly l-o-n-g show
that lasted four hours and two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 71st annual Hollywood love-fest, the last Academy Awards of
the century, suffered from uneven comedy material, tepid dance and
tribute segments, and the overall feeling of air slowly leaking
from an overfilled balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated reaction among the audience at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion was decidedly mixed as name-dropping director
Elia Kazan received a lifetime achievement award Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameras, true to the producer's promise, panned parts of the
crowd when Kazan, 89 and in poor health, stepped on stage to thank
presenters Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Nick Nolte and Ed Harris sat silently and best director
winner Steven Spielberg's reaction was subdued, while others stood
and applauded in response to the debate over Kazan's decision some
50 years ago to name names during the McCarthy investigation of
communist influence on Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can just slip away,'' Kazan said to his wife before
stepping away from the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   It was over almost as soon as it began.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, show host Whoopi Goldberg had joked, ``I thought the
blacklist was me and Hattie McDaniel.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Kazan segment was over, there were still six
awards to go and the show had already gone almost 30 minutes
overtime. It had taken 20 minutes to get to the first award of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The show went 17 minutes longer than last year's three-hour,
45-minute program.
</P>
<P>
   Elements that, in small doses, would ordinarily be welcome grew
tiresome in repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Italian actor Roberto Benigni's overly ebullient shtick became
exhausting as he clambered over seats to get to the stage, where he
clung to best foreign film presenter Sophia Loren like she was a
life preserver. A short time later, he leapt to the stage again to
accept the best actor award.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, opening the show as Queen Elizabeth _ ``I am the
African Queen'' _ had waited all of three minutes before going for
laughs with a coarse joke about ``the imperial wee wee.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she changed gowns six times during the telecast, the
humor was pretty much cut from the same fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Oscar watchers look forward to the glitches, missed
cues, bad choices and crying jags that can transform the awards
show into farce.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Heche experienced the first technical problems of the night
as she was introducing the winner for technical achievement. When
her clip-on microphone suddenly went on the fritz, she was forced
to hike to a stand-up microphone and restart her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable low came during choreographer Debbie Allen's
interpretive dance segment in which her troupe emoted to the
nominated film scores.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the dancers got to the invasion of Normandy from
``Saving Private Ryan,'' we started hoping someone would invade the
stage and make it stop.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to waterworks, best actress winner Gwyneth Paltrow
won the golden tissue. She spent her entire acceptance speech
crying her eyes out while thanking everyone from the ``Shakespeare
in Love'' crew to her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   You knew the 26-year-old starlet was in trouble when none other
than Jack Nicholson, who presented the award, was the one offering
consolation and a steady arm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Paltrow was probably crying from pure giddiness. It's
expected her fee could soar to $10 million, up from the $2 million
she got for ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar's comedy highlight also involved tears _ the crocodile
tears of Jim Carrey pretending to be broken up over not getting
even a nomination for ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier musical moment had Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston
in a duet of ``When You Believe,'' the best original song winner
from ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Oscar preshow, however, suffered from missed
opportunities. Instead of sticking to arrivals, the network's dull
half-hour preview consisted of vintage newsreel footage of Oscars
past, pretaped interviews and short features hosted by Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It sorely lacked the energy of E! Entertainment Television's
annual red carpet horror show.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was all over for another year, we spied a certain
little golden man sneaking a peek at his watch.
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the academy: Next year, turn the show into a miniseries
and broadcast it over four days. &QL;

COMCAST-MEDIAONE MERGER TALKS REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Comcast Corp. and Mediaone Group Inc., two of the nation's
largest cable operators, were in intense talks late last week about
a possible merger, a person familiar with the discussions said on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the two companies planned to take the proposed
merger to its board over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear on Sunday night if the proposed merger had been
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Should a merger, which some industry executive valued on Sunday
night at $40 billion, be approved, it would create the
third-largest cable company in the country after Time Warner and
Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company would have 11 million subscribers, ranking it
behind Time Warner with 13 million and Tele-Communications Inc.
with 12 million, according to Paul Kagan, who heads a media
consulting firm that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has a market capitalization of $26.8 billion, and
Mediaone is capitalized at $36.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, is controlled by the
Roberts family through so-called supervoting stock in which each
share counts for more than one vote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the person familiar with the discussions, Comcast
would plan to issue new low-voting stock for the Mediaone stock,
leaving Comcast in control of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Comcast president, Brian L. Roberts, nor the
Mediaone president, Charles M. Lillis, could be reached on Sunday
night for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the cable industry has been swept by
consolidation, the benefits of which include, among other things,
the ability to buy programming at lower cost. The mergers also let
cable companies operate cable systems in the same geographic areas
more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Among Comcast's holdings is QVC, a home-hopping network. The
company is also branching into various Internet services. Mediaone,
which is based in Englewood, Colo., provides services to 17 states
and has interests in wireless businesses abroad. Mediaone was spun
off from US West.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast shares closed Friday at $70.125, down 18.75 cents.
Mediaone shares closed at $60.75, down 68.75 cents.

COMPUTER ERROR BRINGS EARLY FOOD STAMP CREDITS AND A SHOPPING
SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shoppers packed grocery stores throughout New Jersey on Sunday
after food stamp accounts were accidentally credited 11 days early
because of an error resulting from an effort to fix year 2000
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   About 180,000 families could have used next month's food stamps
from 6:30 A.M. to 9:30 p.m., when the problem was fixed, state
officials said. The premature credit _ about $275 for a mother with
two children _ showed up in the accounts of the 90 percent of New
Jersey food stamp recipients who get their benefits through
electronic cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely nuts,'' said William J. Glovacz, a manager at
Edwards Super Food Store in Trenton. ``People have carts full of
food. They're shop-happy.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials did not immediately know how many people had
withdrawn the benefits, although the number appeared to be in the
thousands. The officials were still debating what to do about the
mistake, which could put the state in the position of losing
millions of dollars if no penalty is imposed on those who used the
credit to shop for food on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers at a dozen stores reported a startling crowd of
shoppers. The grocers said few people have much of a balance left
on their cards this late in the month. The windfall was discovered
by people who made small purchases on Sunday morning, then received
receipts showing unexpectedly large balances in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread quickly through low-income neighborhoods, and people
phoned friends and relatives throughout the state. Shoppers,
enjoying a good fortune they could not explain, said it was like an
early Mother's Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, grocers said, people did not ask questions. They
just bought.
</P>
<P>
   The Pathmark store in Paterson reported it was busier than on
the day before Thanksgiving, recording sales of more than $10,000
an hour, more than double the usual peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My meat case is empty,'' said Eloy Espinal, a manager. ``They
don't even care what's on sale. Most of them are assuming it was a
mistake, and they think tomorrow it'll be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake occurred after a state government computer in
Trenton was upgraded to protect against the much-publicized year
2000 programming flaw, which could cause many computers to fail on
New Year's Day. For a reason that state officials still could not
explain on Sunday night, when the ``repaired'' computer sent
another computer information about the payment date for next
month's food stamps, it transmitted the date as April 1, 1990,
instead of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in an immediate credit to accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The error offers a foretaste of the possible disruptions arising
from the so-called Y-2K problem. Older computers used a programming
shortcut to identify the years in dates by their last two digits,
meaning they could respond as if 2000 were 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department
of Human Services, said officials had not yet decided whether the
shoppers who used their balances on Sunday would get another credit
on April 1, which is when the food stamps should have become
available. ``This was definitely our mistake,'' she said. ``We
don't know if the client will be held responsible, or if the state
will be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   If the state decides to re-credit the accounts, that would mean
Sunday's mistake could cost as much as $49.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is among the states that have replaced the familiar
paper food stamps with magnetic cards, much like debit cards, that
food stamp users swipe at the cash register. Then they receive a
receipt showing the balance in the account.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as electronic benefits transfer, started in
some New Jersey counties in 1995 and now is used in all but 6 of
the state's 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The computer that credits accounts belongs to a private
contractor in Milwaukee. The repairs to the state computer were
made about two weeks ago, but the flaw was not apparent until
information about April benefits was sent to the contractor early
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   State officials learned of the problem about 8 a.m. when some
food stamp recipients called the contractor's toll-free number to
inquire about the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers said the throngs in their stores reminded them of
the rush before a snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw so many people in the store _ ever,'' said
Clemente Espinel, the owner of Spring Supermarket in Newark.
``Everybody happy. Everybody got a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Garden Market in Camden ran out of milk, bread, eggs, ham and
cheese. ``A lot of people don't think it's the computer,'' said
Carmen Reyes, the cashier. ``They think it's good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pathmark in Paterson, Jeff James, a 32-year-old
warehouseman who had come to use his windfall, said he had
discovered one catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were excited,'' he said. ``But now the lines are too
long.''

LOVE GETS SPREAD AROUND AT OSCARS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pen was mightier than the sword, but an
exuberant Italian turned out to be the most irresistible force of
all Sunday night during the 71st annual Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's sumptuous romantic comedy ``Shakespeare in Love''
surprisingly was named best picture, and its lead actress, Gwyneth
Paltrow, took home best actress honors, while Steven Spielberg won
the directing Oscar for his gripping World War II drama ``Saving
Private Ryan'' during record-length ceremonies held at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, though, belonged to wild and crazy Italian
filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who won Oscars for best actor and best
foreign film for his moving Holocaust film ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni wrote, directed and starred in the fable-like story of a
father who shields his young son from the horrors of a World War II
concentration camp by pretending the whole experience is a game to
win a tank. He became the first star of a foreign film to win the
Oscar for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   When Benigni accepted the acting award, he said, ``This is a
terrible mistake because I've used up all my English.'' And indeed,
when he won the foreign film Oscar earlier in the evening, Benigni
gave the kind of warm, enthusiastic and metaphorically nutty
acceptance speech that has been his hallmark through this award
season. This after he nearly became the first Oscar winner to make
it to the stage by clambering over the the backs of theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign film presentation seemed almost geared for Benigni
to win with Italian actress and friend Sophia Loren (who happens to
be the only foreign actor to win a lead acting award) making the
presentation. No one, save, perhaps, for the other nominees, seemed
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Sophia . . . I want you!'' Benigni, 46, joyfully
boomed. ``Thank you, thank you. This is a moment of joy and I want
to kiss everybody.'' Judging from the tearful shots of Loren and
actress Goldie Hawn and several others in the audience (not to
mention the thunderous standing ovation he received), the feeling
was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say, it's the hailstorm of kindness of gratitude
for you,'' Benigni continued. ``I want to dive into this audience.
You know, your generosity is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``I would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and
lie down in the firmament making love to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   British playwright Tom Stoppard, winner of the original
screenplay award for ``Shakespeare'' with Marc Norman, later dryly
commented at the podium, ``I'm behaving like Roberto Benigni
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   All the enthusiasm took time. The laborious ceremony was the
longest in Oscar history, clocking in at an 4 hours 2 minutes. The
record: Last year's ``Titanic'' love-fest at 3 hours 45 minutes.
(Imagine what would have happened if Benigni had won another couple
of Oscars.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you would like to know that while you were watching
this show, another century went by,'' host Whoopi Goldberg joked at
the end of the bloated evening.
</P>
<P>
   Voters spread the love around this year with ``Shakespeare''
taking home seven awards for its 13 nominations, ``Ryan'' five and
``Life Is Beautiful'' three. Miramax, accused by many in the
industry of spending too much on its Oscar campaigns, led all
studios, winning a total of 10 awards.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was also the first in a decade to give the picture
and director honors to different movies. In 1989, ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' won as best picture, while Oliver Stone was named best
director for ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, taking home his second directing Oscar (he also won
in 1993 for ``Schindler's List'') dedicated the award to his
father, saying, ``Dad, you're the best. Thank you for showing me
there is honor in looking back to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow sobbed her way through her acceptance speech, also
thanking her family and saluting her fellow nominees, particularly
Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence,''
Paltrow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' won for supporting actress, costume design, art
direction and original comedy score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like a Dame!'' presenter Robin Williams
exclaimed, announcing Dench as the winner in the supporting actress
category. Dench appeared surprised and almost apologetic as she
accepted her gold statuette from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a
little bit of him,'' Dench said as she held up her award.
</P>
<P>
   Later, backstage, Dench elaborated on her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge surprise,'' Dench said. ``In fact, it's completely
taken my breath away. I can honestly say I didn't think I was in
the running at all. I'm delighted to have it, but I'm very taken
aback by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old British actress was nominated last year for her
lead role as Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown.'' This is her first
Oscar and she clearly believed she had ``Shakespeare'' director
John Madden to thank for the honor, mentioning a letter she had
recently written to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I will do anything in your next film,'' Dench said.
``If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me.
And I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial presentation of the lifetime achievement award
to director Elia Kazan was anti-climactic with audience reaction
generally polite and often enthusiastic. The award seemed like a
political Rorschach test as the camera panned the audience showing
some (Warren Beatty, Helen Hunt) standing and applauding while
others (Nick Nolte, Ed Harris) remained silent in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, disdained by some for naming names during the McCarthy
era, kept his speech short, thanking the Academy for its ``courage
and generosity.'' He indirectly alluded to the controversy by
noting his appreciation for the applause. ``I really like to hear
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category was considered the evening's most
competitive, but it was still a surprise when James Coburn won for
playing Nick Nolte's abusive, alcoholic father in the low-budget
``Affliction.'' The 70-year-old Coburn had never been nominated
during a long career of more than 60 films, including such films as
``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Great Escape'' and ``Our Man
Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for over half my life,'' Coburn said. ``I
finally got one right, I guess. Some of them you do for money and
some of them you do for love. I guess this is a love child.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Coburn admitted he was stunned when he heard his name
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be nominated with four other extremely talented men,
and to win, you can't describe the feeling,'' Coburn said. ``It's
not even an emotion. It's a flash that swoops down on you. I could
hardly talk. I'd like to do it again, because I could probably do
it right this time.'' &QL;

Oscar and she clearly believed she had ``Shakespeare'' director
John Madden to thank for the honor, mentioning a letter she had
recently written to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I will do anything in your next film,'' Dench said.
``If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me.
And I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial presentation of the lifetime achievement award
to director Elia Kazan was anti-climactic with audience reaction
generally polite and often enthusiastic. The award seemed like a
political Rorschach test as the camera panned the audience showing
some (Warren Beatty, Helen Hunt) standing and applauding while
others (Nick Nolte, Ed Harris) remained silent in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, disdained by some for naming names during the McCarthy
era, kept his speech short, thanking the Academy for its ``courage
and generosity.'' He indirectly alluded to the controversy by
noting his appreciation for the applause. ``I really like to hear
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category was considered the evening's most
competitive, but it was still a surprise when James Coburn won for
playing Nick Nolte's abusive, alcoholic father in the low-budget
``Affliction.'' The 70-year-old Coburn had never been nominated
during a long career of more than 60 films, including such films as
``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Great Escape'' and ``Our Man
Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for over half my life,'' Coburn said. ``I
finally got one right, I guess. Some of them you do for money and
some of them you do for love. I guess this is a love child.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Coburn admitted he was stunned when he heard his name
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be nominated with four other extremely talented men,
and to win, you can't describe the feeling,'' Coburn said. ``It's
not even an emotion. It's a flash that swoops down on you. I could
hardly talk. I'd like to do it again, because I could probably do
it right this time.'' &QL;

LOVE GETS SPREAD AROUND AT OSCARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  &HT;     By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pen was mightier than the sword, but an
exuberant Italian turned out to be the most irresistible force of
all Sunday night during the 71st annual Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's sumptuous romantic comedy ``Shakespeare in Love''
surprisingly was named best picture, and its lead actress, Gwyneth
Paltrow, took home best actress honors, while Steven Spielberg won
the directing Oscar for his gripping World War II drama ``Saving
Private Ryan'' during record-length ceremonies held at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, though, belonged to wild and crazy Italian
filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who won Oscars for best actor and best
foreign film for his moving Holocaust film ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Benigni wrote, directed and starred in the fable-like story of a
father who shields his young son from the horrors of a World War II
concentration camp by pretending the whole experience is a game to
win a tank. He became the first star of a foreign film to win the
Oscar for best actor.
</P>
<P>
   When Benigni accepted the acting award, he said, ``This is a
terrible mistake because I've used up all my English.'' And indeed,
when he won the foreign film Oscar earlier in the evening, Benigni
gave the kind of warm, enthusiastic and metaphorically nutty
acceptance speech that has been his hallmark through this award
season. This after he nearly became the first Oscar winner to make
it to the stage by clambering over the the backs of theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign film presentation seemed almost geared for Benigni
to win with Italian actress and friend Sophia Loren (who happens to
be the only foreign actor to win a lead acting award) making the
presentation. No one, save, perhaps, for the other nominees, seemed
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Sophia . . . I want you!'' Benigni, 46, joyfully
boomed. ``Thank you, thank you. This is a moment of joy and I want
to kiss everybody.'' Judging from the tearful shots of Loren and
actress Goldie Hawn and several others in the audience (not to
mention the thunderous standing ovation he received), the feeling
was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say, it's the hailstorm of kindness of gratitude
for you,'' Benigni continued. ``I want to dive into this audience.
You know, your generosity is too much.''
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``I would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and
lie down in the firmament making love to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   British playwright Tom Stoppard, winner of the original
screenplay award for ``Shakespeare'' with Marc Norman, later dryly
commented at the podium, ``I'm behaving like Roberto Benigni
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   All the enthusiasm took time. The laborious ceremony was the
longest in Oscar history, clocking in at an 4 hours 2 minutes. The
record: Last year's ``Titanic'' love-fest at 3 hours 45 minutes.
(Imagine what would have happened if Benigni had won another couple
of Oscars.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you would like to know that while you were watching
this show, another century went by,'' host Whoopi Goldberg joked at
the end of the bloated evening.
</P>
<P>
   Voters spread the love around this year with ``Shakespeare''
taking home seven awards for its 13 nominations, ``Ryan'' five and
``Life Is Beautiful'' three. Miramax, accused by many in the
industry of spending too much on its Oscar campaigns, led all
studios, winning a total of 10 awards.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was also the first in a decade to give the picture
and director honors to different movies. In 1989, ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' won as best picture, while Oliver Stone was named best
director for ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, taking home his second directing Oscar (he also won
in 1993 for ``Schindler's List'') dedicated the award to his
father, saying, ``Dad, you're the best. Thank you for showing me
there is honor in looking back to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow sobbed her way through her acceptance speech, also
thanking her family and saluting her fellow nominees, particularly
Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence,''
Paltrow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare'' won for supporting actress, costume design, art
direction and original comedy score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like a Dame!'' presenter Robin Williams
exclaimed, announcing Dench as the winner in the supporting actress
category. Dench appeared surprised and almost apologetic as she
accepted her gold statuette from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should only get a
little bit of him,'' Dench said as she held up her award.
</P>
<P>
   Later, backstage, Dench elaborated on her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge surprise,'' Dench said. ``In fact, it's completely
taken my breath away. I can honestly say I didn't think I was in
the running at all. I'm delighted to have it, but I'm very taken
aback by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old British actress was nominated last year for her
lead role as Queen Victoria in ``Mrs. Brown.'' This is her first
Oscar and she clearly believed she had ``Shakespeare'' director
John Madden to thank for the honor, mentioning a letter she had
recently written to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I will do anything in your next film,'' Dench said.
``If you want somebody to slouch in a doorway, you can count on me.
And I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial presentation of the lifetime achievement award
to director Elia Kazan was anti-climactic with audience reaction
generally polite and often enthusiastic. The award seemed like a
political Rorschach test as the camera panned the audience showing
some (Warren Beatty, Helen Hunt) standing and applauding while
others (Nick Nolte, Ed Harris) remained silent in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, disdained by some for naming names during the McCarthy
era, kept his speech short, thanking the Academy for its ``courage
and generosity.'' He indirectly alluded to the controversy by
noting his appreciation for the applause. ``I really like to hear
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actor category was considered the evening's most
competitive, but it was still a surprise when James Coburn won for
playing Nick Nolte's abusive, alcoholic father in the low-budget
``Affliction.'' The 70-year-old Coburn had never been nominated
during a long career of more than 60 films, including such films as
``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Great Escape'' and ``Our Man
Flint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for over half my life,'' Coburn said. ``I
finally got one right, I guess. Some of them you do for money and
some of them you do for love. I guess this is a love child.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, Coburn admitted he was stunned when he heard his name
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be nominated with four other extremely talented men,
and to win, you can't describe the feeling,'' Coburn said. ``It's
not even an emotion. It's a flash that swoops down on you. I could
hardly talk. I'd like to do it again, because I could probably do
it right this time.'' &QL;

`NATURE' FORCES ITS WAY TO TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers stormed the nation's multiplexes for
``Forces of Nature'' as the romantic comedy took in an estimated
$13.9 million at 2,058 theaters, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The DreamWorks release, starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck
as a couple thrown together while Affleck is on the way to his
wedding, performed in line with industry expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came across as a clever movie with good chemistry between
the stars,'' said film analyst Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks distribution chief James Tharp said the ``Forces of
Nature'' audience was 65 percent female. ``It's playing very well
among young women,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
predicted ``Forces'' would take in $46 million by the end of its
run but noted that final figures for this weekend could fall short
of estimates due to the Academy Awards telecast. ``It's hard to
determine what impact the TV show will have since it's never been
on Sunday before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gangster-comedy ``Analyze This'' continued to attract moviegoing
mobs with $11.9 million at 2,537 theaters. The Warner Bros.
release, starring Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, has topped $57
million in 10 days and dropped only 23 percent from its previous
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a distant third was Warner's opening of Clint
Eastwood's Death Row drama ``True Crime,'' with a disappointing
$4.9 million at 1,852 theaters despite generally positive reviews
and Eastwood's star power. ``Movies about Death Row generally
haven't done well outside of `Dead Man Walking,' '' Bucksbaum said.
``People are just not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``Baby Geniuses'' continued to overcome
poor reviews in fourth with $4.5 million at 1,698 theaters,
underscoring moviegoers' strong appetite for comedies. ``People
want to be entertained these days rather than shocked and
horrified,'' Rockwell noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's third weekend of ``Cruel Intentions'' came in fifth with
$4.2 million at 2,235 theaters to hit $30 million overall, followed
by MGM's second weekend of ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' with $3.8 million
at 2,286 as the sequel performed the usual fast fade for horror
films.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. also suffered a setback from the opening of its
animated ``The King and I,'' which finished seventh with $3.7
million at 2,352 screens despite a large marketing campaign and the
general success of animated movies last year. Bucksbaum said the
remake of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical might have been too
tame and traditional for children's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids between ages 5 and 10 want to see more sophisticated
movies like `Cruel Intentions,' `The Rage,' `Baby Geniuses' and the
new `Star Wars,' '' he said. ``Audiences can get tired of animation
unless it's really state of the art.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's second weekend of the police drama ``The Corruptor''
came in eighth with $3.2 million at 1,804 screens, followed by
Miramax's 15th weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love'' with $2.8 million
at 1,266 sites to push its 101-day total to nearly $73 million.
``Shakespeare'' has continued to benefit from the buildup to the
Academy Awards and has now doubled its gross since its 13 Oscar
nominations were announced Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' continued
to flounder as the drama sank 52 percent from its debut weekend to
10th place with $2.7 million at 1,907 theaters. But another Oscar
contender, Miramax's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' posted impressive
results in 11th with $2.2 million at 647 locations _ a 22 percent
gain from the previous weekend and enough to pull it past $36
million overall.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan,'' with 11 Oscar nods, also
saw a considerable upward bump of 31 percent with $1.1 million at
548 theaters to push its total to $210.3 million. ``Ryan'' needs
less than $500,000 to top ``Back to the Future'' for the 22nd spot
on the all-time domestic chart.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's horror-comedy ``Ravenous,'' a tale of
cannibalism in the Old West, posted the weekend's most abysmal
results with $950,000 at 1,047 theaters. Gramercy racked up
moderate returns from expanding ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking
Barrels'' with $500,000 at 156 theaters in its third weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $76 million, down about 19 percent
from the same weekend a year ago when the 14th weekend of
``Titanic'' led the box office. Year-to-date grosses have topped
$1.1 billion, trailing the 1998 period by about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Three new movies will open Friday, including Universal's comedy
``EDtv'' with Matthew McConaughey, MGM's police drama ``Mod Squad''
and Disney's animated ``Doug's First Movie.'' Bucksbaum said
``EDtv'' should lead the box office due partly to strong word of
mouth from test screenings and sneak previews while ``Mod Squad''
should benefit from teen and young adult moviegoers being on spring
break.

ALL'S FAIR IN `LOVE' AND WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
must feel collectively good about itself for choosing the literary
over the lethal at Sunday's awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   With seven Oscars, including the best picture prize,
``Shakespeare in Love'' took down longtime front-runner ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which earned a deserved statuette for director
Steven Spielberg and four technical craft awards for the evening's
second highest tally.
</P>
<P>
   However literate ``Love'' may seem, though, can the academy
voters truly convince themselves in the morning that this
seductively clever entertainment even stands close to ``Ryan'' as a
milestone of visual storytelling? The category is, after all,
called best picture, not best written or spoken lines.
</P>
<P>
   But heck, let's be charitable. It's the end of the millennium,
and everybody's a little out of whack about it. There's no reason
why this year's Oscars shouldn't fit right in with the overall
zeitgeist. Indeed, for both good and ill, the 71st Academy Awards
was awash in change of era summings-up, scab-pickings and
generational reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's thanks to his father for teaching him to honor the
past essentially keynoted the whole evening. From John Glenn's
surprise appearance to Martin Scorsese's elegant montage of the
departed Frank Sinatra's best filmed moments; from Gen. Colin
Powell's simple tribute to our greatest generation's wartime
sacrifices to the troublesome emblem of that same age group's
political agonies and human frailties, Elia Kazan; from that Roy
Rogers hymn to cowboy heaven to the too little, too late (but
nonetheless crucial) acknowledgment of our most prescient cinematic
futurist, the never-Oscar'd Stanley Kubrick, it was truly a night
of taking stock.
</P>
<P>
   All Hollywood style, naturally, but a welcome and perhaps even
necessary change from the usual unfiltered self-congratulation. And
thanks to Jim Carrey blurting out the banished, non-p.c. phrase
``And the winner is ...,'' we were reminded of what this show
always was, is and will be really all about.
</P>
<P>
   As for those winners, Roberto Benigni copping the best actor
award for ``Life Is Beautiful'' hopefully means that Americans will
appreciate foreign films to at least partially the extent that the
rest of the world enjoys our movies. (Benigni is the first male
actor to win for a non-English language performance.) That, at
least, is the optimistic way of spinning the fact that difficult
but towering work from ``Gods and Monsters''' Ian McKellen and
``Affliction's'' Nick Nolte scared the voters off.
</P>
<P>
   That said, with Nolte co-star James Coburn's supporting actor
award, the voters seemed to go back to their recently abandoned
practice of noticing long-overlooked veterans. But rather than
making it a purely sentimental journey, they recognized Coburn for
playing an uncompromisingly vicious character _ in an unrelentingly
dark film that represents a newer, healthier academy trend to
acknowledge true and daring independent filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The female acting choices were anything but adventurous, but
delightfully so. And the ``Shakespeare'' ladies, weepy Gwyneth
Paltrow and regal Judi Dench, made a symbolically felicitous age
pair _ Paltrow was the youngest of the best-actress nominees and
Dench the eldest of the supporting actresses. A nice end-of-century
twosome if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite award of the evening: Bill Condon for his brilliantly
adapted, psychologically astute ``Gods and Monsters'' screenplay.
Favorite non-surprise: as previously admitted, ``Shakespeare's''
original (though some claim pilfered) script was a joy to ... well,
behold's not the right word, but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's
cascades of good ones gave us the most fun to be had in a theater
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite snub: The punishingly pretentious ``The Thin Red Line''
got all that it deserved _ zilch.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most anticipated controversy, the lifetime
achievement award to landmark filmmaker and blacklist name-namer
Kazan, proved, well, wimpy. Of course, ending the film clips on the
note of Marlon Brando's pained, post-testifying walk in Kazan's
``On the Waterfront'' could be taken either way. But by adamantly
refusing to directly acknowledge the controversy this particular
honor has dredged up, the academy actually honored, and settled,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting, but no doubt depressing, to read the
postgame partisan quarterbacking. Was presenter Martin Scorsese
trying to hide behind Kazan before the old man forced him to accept
a hug televised worldwide? Did co-presenter Robert De Niro
purposely give his caress at arm's length? And was that
mohawk-gone-weedy haircut of his some arcane, subversive ``Taxi
Driver'' reference?
</P>
<P>
   Out in the audience, Warren Beatty, that most dedicated of
Hollywood leftists who also happens to owe his movie career to
Kazan, appeared to lead the standing ovation (Meryl Streep, Kathy
Bates and Helen Hunt were among the Oscar winners who followed).
The notable non-applauders broadcast were Nick Nolte and Ed Harris
_ and was a statement being made by having ABC's cameras single out
these two never-wons to represent the quiet protesters?
</P>
<P>
   Only Chris Rock had the guts to really say anything, and he took
a cheap shot using the rodent word. If anything hopeful emerges
from this whole, misguided fiasco, it may only be that it doesn't
trigger a whole new generation of recalcitrant recriminations _
like the old ones, which, it has taught us, will never die.
</P>
<P>
   On a cheerier note, the ceremony's expansive spirit was nicely
symbolized by Benigni and Spielberg holding hands when the
Italian's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which the ``Schindler's List''
director had reportedly criticized, won the foreign language film
award _ although that whole category, from presenter Sophia Loren
to the extended screening of ``Life'' footage over clips from the
other foreign language nominees, smelled mighty like a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Like the three Oscars for ``Life,'' the feature documentary
award for the Spielberg-presented Holocaust film ``The Last Days''
continued the academy's habit of honoring works that examine the
century's vilest crime. On the other end of the spectrum, the
documentary short award for ``The Personals'' director Keiko Ibi
surely broke boundaries as the first Oscar ever bestowed on a
former Miss Japan Grande Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not as big a step toward an international film culture
as the night's clown prince, Benigni's, loose-limbed leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Looking again to the future, Irving Thalberg award recipient
Norman Jewison's plea that young filmmakers ignore demographics and
commercialism in favor of good storytelling seemed like the
evening's most futile suggestion, ``Shakespeare'' semi-sweep or no.
But somebody had to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Shakespeare's'' big win could feasibly be attributed
to that other major controversy of this year's Oscar season: its
distributor, Miramax Films', conspicuously costly get-out-the-vote
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition as old as Hollywood to spend a lot of money in
order to attract attention. And if the final Oscars of this century
are any indication, that's one thing we can count on working well
into the Y2K millennium.

<P>
   It will be interesting, but no doubt depressing, to read the
postgame partisan quarterbacking. Was presenter Martin Scorsese
trying to hide behind Kazan before the old man forced him to accept
a hug televised worldwide? Did co-presenter Robert De Niro
purposely give his caress at arm's length? And was that
mohawk-gone-weedy haircut of his some arcane, subversive ``Taxi
Driver'' reference?
</P>
<P>
   Out in the audience, Warren Beatty, that most dedicated of
Hollywood leftists who also happens to owe his movie career to
Kazan, appeared to lead the standing ovation (Meryl Streep, Kathy
Bates and Helen Hunt were among the Oscar winners who followed).
The notable non-applauders broadcast were Nick Nolte and Ed Harris
_ and was a statement being made by having ABC's cameras single out
these two never-wons to represent the quiet protesters?
</P>
<P>
   Only Chris Rock had the guts to really say anything, and he took
a cheap shot using the rodent word. If anything hopeful emerges
from this whole, misguided fiasco, it may only be that it doesn't
trigger a whole new generation of recalcitrant recriminations _
like the old ones, which, it has taught us, will never die.
</P>
<P>
   On a cheerier note, the ceremony's expansive spirit was nicely
symbolized by Benigni and Spielberg holding hands when the
Italian's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' which the ``Schindler's List''
director had reportedly criticized, won the foreign language film
award _ although that whole category, from presenter Sophia Loren
to the extended screening of ``Life'' footage over clips from the
other foreign language nominees, smelled mighty like a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Like the three Oscars for ``Life,'' the feature documentary
award for the Spielberg-presented Holocaust film ``The Last Days''
continued the academy's habit of honoring works that examine the
century's vilest crime. On the other end of the spectrum, the
documentary short award for ``The Personals'' director Keiko Ibi
surely broke boundaries as the first Oscar ever bestowed on a
former Miss Japan Grande Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not as big a step toward an international film culture
as the night's clown prince, Benigni's, loose-limbed leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Looking again to the future, Irving Thalberg award recipient
Norman Jewison's plea that young filmmakers ignore demographics and
commercialism in favor of good storytelling seemed like the
evening's most futile suggestion, ``Shakespeare'' semi-sweep or no.
But somebody had to say it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Shakespeare's'' big win could feasibly be attributed
to that other major controversy of this year's Oscar season: its
distributor, Miramax Films', conspicuously costly get-out-the-vote
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition as old as Hollywood to spend a lot of money in
order to attract attention. And if the final Oscars of this century
are any indication, that's one thing we can count on working well
into the Y2K millennium.

ALL'S FAIR IN `LOVE' AND WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
must feel collectively good about itself for choosing the literary
over the lethal at Sunday's awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   With seven Oscars, including the best picture prize,
``Shakespeare in Love'' took down longtime front-runner ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' which earned a deserved statuette for director
Steven Spielberg and four technical craft awards for the evening's
second highest tally.
</P>
<P>
   However literate ``Love'' may seem, though, can the academy
voters truly convince themselves in the morning that this
seductively clever entertainment even stands close to ``Ryan'' as a
milestone of visual storytelling? The category is, after all,
called best picture, not best written or spoken lines.
</P>
<P>
   But heck, let's be charitable. It's the end of the millennium,
and everybody's a little out of whack about it. There's no reason
why this year's Oscars shouldn't fit right in with the overall
zeitgeist. Indeed, for both good and ill, the 71st Academy Awards
was awash in change of era summings-up, scab-pickings and
generational reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's thanks to his father for teaching him to honor the
past essentially keynoted the whole evening. From John Glenn's
surprise appearance to Martin Scorsese's elegant montage of the
departed Frank Sinatra's best filmed moments; from Gen. Colin
Powell's simple tribute to our greatest generation's wartime
sacrifices to the troublesome emblem of that same age group's
political agonies and human frailties, Elia Kazan; from that Roy
Rogers hymn to cowboy heaven to the too little, too late (but
nonetheless crucial) acknowledgment of our most prescient cinematic
futurist, the never-Oscar'd Stanley Kubrick, it was truly a night
of taking stock.
</P>
<P>
   All Hollywood style, naturally, but a welcome and perhaps even
necessary change from the usual unfiltered self-congratulation. And
thanks to Jim Carrey blurting out the banished, non-p.c. phrase
``And the winner is ...,'' we were reminded of what this show
always was, is and will be really all about.
</P>
<P>
   As for those winners, Roberto Benigni copping the best actor
award for ``Life Is Beautiful'' hopefully means that Americans will
appreciate foreign films to at least partially the extent that the
rest of the world enjoys our movies. (Benigni is the first male
actor to win for a non-English language performance.) That, at
least, is the optimistic way of spinning the fact that difficult
but towering work from ``Gods and Monsters''' Ian McKellen and
``Affliction's'' Nick Nolte scared the voters off.
</P>
<P>
   That said, with Nolte co-star James Coburn's supporting actor
award, the voters seemed to go back to their recently abandoned
practice of noticing long-overlooked veterans. But rather than
making it a purely sentimental journey, they recognized Coburn for
playing an uncompromisingly vicious character _ in an unrelentingly
dark film that represents a newer, healthier academy trend to
acknowledge true and daring independent filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The female acting choices were anything but adventurous, but
delightfully so. And the ``Shakespeare'' ladies, weepy Gwyneth
Paltrow and regal Judi Dench, made a symbolically felicitous age
pair _ Paltrow was the youngest of the best-actress nominees and
Dench the eldest of the supporting actresses. A nice end-of-century
twosome if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite award of the evening: Bill Condon for his brilliantly
adapted, psychologically astute ``Gods and Monsters'' screenplay.
Favorite non-surprise: as previously admitted, ``Shakespeare's''
original (though some claim pilfered) script was a joy to ... well,
behold's not the right word, but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's
cascades of good ones gave us the most fun to be had in a theater
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite snub: The punishingly pretentious ``The Thin Red Line''
got all that it deserved _ zilch.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most anticipated controversy, the lifetime
achievement award to landmark filmmaker and blacklist name-namer
Kazan, proved, well, wimpy. Of course, ending the film clips on the
note of Marlon Brando's pained, post-testifying walk in Kazan's
``On the Waterfront'' could be taken either way. But by adamantly
refusing to directly acknowledge the controversy this particular
honor has dredged up, the academy actually honored, and settled,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting, but no doubt depressing, to read the
postgame partisan quarterbacking. Was presenter Martin Scorsese
trying to hide behind Kazan before the old man forced him to accept
a hug televised worldwide? Did co-presenter Robert De Niro
purposely give his caress at arm's length? And was that
mohawk-gone-weedy haircut of his some arcane, subversive ``Taxi
Driver'' reference?
</P>

 ARTIFICIAL CELLS SOLVE REAL PROBLEMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID PERLMAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a unique quest for new tools to study the
chemistry of life, researchers headed by Stanford University
chemists have created microscopic artificial cells that they call
``the world's smallest test tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``vesicles,'' the tiny fluid-filled cell-like objects
can house the same chemical reactions that go on inside human cells
when the many processes that support human life proceed from birth
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Held together by microscopically thin two-layered fatty
membranes _ much like human cells _ the vesicles can range in size
from the thickness of a human hair to dimensions 100 times smaller,
according to Richard N. Zare, the Stanford chemistry professor who
leads the laboratory where the objects were created.
</P>
<P>
   Although the scientists who created the containers have already
used them to conduct experiments showing how lifelike chemical
reactions can in fact be housed inside the vesicles, they have yet
to undertake experiments that attempt to solve problems of
real-life biology, Zare stressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the vesicles hold the potential for developing important new
avenues of research. In studying the biological processes that go
on in living organisms, scientists generally have only two choices:
to reproduce the reactions in laboratory test tubes or other inert
containers, or to reproduce them in the living organisms
themselves. And although using organisms like bacteria, plants or
animals to test chemicals or transfer genes rarely pose ethical
questions, the human body is far out of bounds for many such
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, chemical reactions in test tube experiments often
don't accurately mimic living processes because the chemicals mix
at much different speeds and sometimes in ways that bear no
relation to what happens in a living system, Zare said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the synthetic cell-like vesicles is ``remarkable for
its technical virtuosity,'' and offers major potential applications
in studying processes that go on inside human cells, said George
Whitesides, a distinguished organic chemist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the vesicles could be used to study how enzymes
called proteases act to digest foreign proteins, Whitesides said.
In test tube experiments right now, researchers are trying to
understand just how the the protease inhibitor drugs act against
HIV, the AIDS virus, and the new cell-like objects could well prove
useful in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Other important studies relating to human disease could well be
aided by the Zare team's work, Whitesides noted: They could be used
to study how neurotransmitters are released when nerve cells
transmit impulses across their synapses, or junctions, he said.
They could also aid in studying how proteins are synthesized, or to
investigate the biochemistry of disease-causing microbes that
inhabit many types of human cells.
</P>
<P>
   The vesicles might even be used eventually as tiny containers to
deliver new drugs into single cells, or for transferring genes from
one cell to another, Whitesides suggested.
</P>
<P>
   In one series of ``microchemistry'' experiments so far, Zare's
team first created vesicles containing a single type of fluorescent
dye and immersed the cell-like containers in a solution containing
a different chemical dye. Then, by zapping the vesicles with a mild
electric current between two electrodes, the scientists caused the
pores of the containers to open so the chemical from the solution
could enter the vesicles and react with the dye inside.
</P>
<P>
   In a second set of experiments, the electrodes sent a stronger
current through two tiny vesicles, each containing a different
chemical. The electric pulse caused the membranes of the two
vesicles to break down so the two containers fused into one,
leaving the two chemicals to react so the scientists could study
the event in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Zare's group at Stanford collaborated in the research with other
teams at the University of Goteborg in Sweden and at Pomona College
in Claremont (Los Angeles County). Their work is reported in the
current issue of the journal Science.  &LR;

MISSILE DEFENSES LEAVE FANTASY BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a far cry from the space-based, rocket-zapping
shield that President Ronald Reagan envisioned 16 years ago in the
depths of the Cold War. But the country is suddenly jettisoning its
qualms about forging a national missile defense and is moving fast
toward building one.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is not an all-out strike from thousands of Soviet
missiles, which prompted Reagan to propose the anti-missile program
popularly known as ``Star Wars'' in 1983. The fear now is that
rogue nations like North Korea or Iran, with little or no warning,
could lob a devastating missile or two into Los Angeles or Seattle.
This anxiety has been heightened by suspicions that China stole
U.S. nuclear secrets in the 1980s to enhance its small nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments helped prompt the Senate and House last week
to vote overwhelmingly in favor of anti-missile defenses as a
matter of national policy, while stopping short of actually
appropriating money for construction. Even the White House has
reversed its opposition to the legislation, lending conditional
support and pledging $10.5 billion in preliminary funding over the
next six years. Clearly, pressure is mounting on President Clinton
to actually build a system, once proven feasible, and he says he
will decide by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are two surprises here. One is that anti-missile defenses,
once strongly opposed and even ridiculed by Democrats and others,
seem to be almost magically melting away as a domestic political
issue. The second is that anti-missile defenses are more
contentious than ever as an international political issue _ even
with Russia, America's main nuclear rival, in eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is now threatening to stop reducing its 7,000-warhead
arsenal if the United States breaks out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which bars national defensive systems. China,
meanwhile, says fielding missile defenses in Asia could seriously
escalate tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov arriving in
Washington on Tuesday for talks, and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji due in Washington in early April, Clinton's foreign policy
aides are bracing for a rough few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But first, why are things growing quiet on the domestic front?
</P>
<P>
   For years, Republicans from Reagan onward tried to make missile
defenses a national priority _ in an era when the threat of attack
was arguably much bigger than it is now _ and for years they were
opposed and even scoffed at by less hawkish opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, a string of startling events prompted a sea
change. A bipartisan commission headed by former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, a Republican, warned in July that within five
years, North Korea and Iran could have the potential to hit the
United States with a ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea stunned U.S.
intelligence analysts by test-launching a three-stage missile with
conceivably enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans claimed vindication, and those claims
have been enhanced lately by opinion polls showing that the public
trusts Republicans over Democrats in matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the developments, many Democrats have been rethinking
their opposition to missile defenses. And the ambitious plans for
such defenses have been scaled back _ brought, literally, down to
earth _ beginning with plans for about 20 interceptors that could
shoot down a handful of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial, recent convert is Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the
ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aug. 31 launch was a watershed moment,'' Kerrey said.
``There is a growing recognition that there's a real danger of
proliferation that produces either an accidental launching or an
attack by a rogue nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey pulled along other centrist Democrats in support of the
Republican-sponsored bill that passed in the Senate last week.
Fearing that the votes weren't there to sustain a presidential
veto, the White House and Senate Democratic leaders settled for two
face-saving amendments that seek to control the cost of any system
and to insure arms control talks with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in Democratic ideology,'' said Frank Luntz, a
Republican pollster. ``The old-fashioned Democratic doves of the
1970s are giving way to centrists who are less hostile to
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that all Democrats have bought into missile
defenses. In fact, half the House Democrats opposed such a move
last week. After $55 billion invested in developing a national
system since the early 1980s (when the Reagan administration
creatively interpreted the ABM treaty to allow research), the
technology is still unproven. Moreover, detractors say, terrorists
and despots could thwart a sophisticated missile defense with other
weapons of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be bypassed with suitcase bombs, pickup trucks and
sea-launched missiles,'' said Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., who is a
physicist. ``It would be billions of dollars down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon brass dismiss the naysayers, arguing that military
contractors and engineers will work out the technical kinks and, by
2005, field a limited system of radars and missile-killing
interceptors _ perhaps in Alaska, North Dakota or on ships at sea _
if Clinton gives the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fast-emerging consensus for missile defenses at home,
however, collides with growing anxiety abroad, particularly in
Beijing and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed a U.S. missile defense system, fearing
that Washington would use it as an excuse to reprise the much
grander Star Wars, which would be dauntingly expensive to match.
</P>
<P>
   While the anti-missile issue is of little concern to ordinary
Russians struggling with dire economic conditions, it is core
national security for Russian politicians, and a matter of
considerable national self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States moving ahead on such a system, Russian
nationalists could use the argument that Russia was losing its
nuclear deterrent _ since an anti-missile defense could encourage a
nation with one (that is, the United States) to risk a nuclear
exchange. That argument could undercut, for example, efforts by the
Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction
treaty between the two countries, or Start 2.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned after last week's U.S. Senate
vote that building even a limited system ``poses a serious threat
to the whole process of nuclear arms control, as well as strategic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And for this reason, arms control advocates are nervous about
doing anything to upset further nuclear arms reductions with
Russia. After all, they say, North Korea may threaten America with
one to five missiles, but instability in Russia is a much greater
risk. ``Our overwhelming and sustained concern has to be Russia,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who voted reluctantly for the
Senate measure. ``They got the most, they got the biggest, and they
got the most accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and a growing number of Democrats say that
building an anti-missile system is just as necessary to insure a
safer world as reducing Moscow's nuclear stockpile, which is
declining with or without a treaty because Russia no longer can
afford to maintain it at Cold War levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance with Russia,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, a
senior Pentagon official under President George Bush and a member
of the Rumsfeld panel. ``We don't want to alienate the Russians,
but on the other hand we can't let them bully us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, U.S.-Japanese plans to develop a missile system to
defend Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. troops in the region
got under way about a decade ago, in anticipation of the possible
missile threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As that threat has become more real, the plans to defend against
it have encountered growing criticism from China _ and even from
key allies. Two weeks ago, South Korea's defense minister said a
joint U.S.-Japanese missile defense would be ineffective against
North Korean missiles, and added that his government would not help
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility that such an anti-missile system
might not be ready for years, when there is at least a chance that
there won't be a North Korea left to worry about. This is a point
not lost on China, which views the proposed missile umbrella
primarily as a threat to its plans to reunify Taiwan with the
Chinese mainland. Since the early 1990s, China has more or less
doubled, to several hundred, the number of missiles on the Chinese
coast pointed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among many national security analysts in Asia is that
missile defenses could do to China what the creation of NATO did to
the Soviet Union: help to trigger a new escalation of arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are for the development of advanced missile defense
systems, we are going to touch off new rounds of an arms race,''
said He Yafei, a senior Chinese diplomat in Washington who has long
experience in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea of including Taiwan under any missile umbrella ``is
an obstruction on our course of unification of our motherland,'' he
added. ``Taiwan is part of China. Politically, that is an
interference, a very serious interference in our internal
affairs.''

MISSILE DEFENSES LEAVE FANTASY BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a far cry from the space-based, rocket-zapping
shield that President Ronald Reagan envisioned 16 years ago in the
depths of the Cold War. But the country is suddenly jettisoning its
qualms about forging a national missile defense and is moving fast
toward building one.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is not an all-out strike from thousands of Soviet
missiles, which prompted Reagan to propose the anti-missile program
popularly known as ``Star Wars'' in 1983. The fear now is that
rogue nations like North Korea or Iran, with little or no warning,
could lob a devastating missile or two into Los Angeles or Seattle.
This anxiety has been heightened by suspicions that China stole
U.S. nuclear secrets in the 1980s to enhance its small nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Such developments helped prompt the Senate and House last week
to vote overwhelmingly in favor of anti-missile defenses as a
matter of national policy, while stopping short of actually
appropriating money for construction. Even the White House has
reversed its opposition to the legislation, lending conditional
support and pledging $10.5 billion in preliminary funding over the
next six years. Clearly, pressure is mounting on President Clinton
to actually build a system, once proven feasible, and he says he
will decide by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are two surprises here. One is that anti-missile defenses,
once strongly opposed and even ridiculed by Democrats and others,
seem to be almost magically melting away as a domestic political
issue. The second is that anti-missile defenses are more
contentious than ever as an international political issue _ even
with Russia, America's main nuclear rival, in eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is now threatening to stop reducing its 7,000-warhead
arsenal if the United States breaks out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which bars national defensive systems. China,
meanwhile, says fielding missile defenses in Asia could seriously
escalate tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   With Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov arriving in
Washington on Tuesday for talks, and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji due in Washington in early April, Clinton's foreign policy
aides are bracing for a rough few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But first, why are things growing quiet on the domestic front?
</P>
<P>
   For years, Republicans from Reagan onward tried to make missile
defenses a national priority _ in an era when the threat of attack
was arguably much bigger than it is now _ and for years they were
opposed and even scoffed at by less hawkish opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, a string of startling events prompted a sea
change. A bipartisan commission headed by former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld, a Republican, warned in July that within five
years, North Korea and Iran could have the potential to hit the
United States with a ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea stunned U.S.
intelligence analysts by test-launching a three-stage missile with
conceivably enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans claimed vindication, and those claims
have been enhanced lately by opinion polls showing that the public
trusts Republicans over Democrats in matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the developments, many Democrats have been rethinking
their opposition to missile defenses. And the ambitious plans for
such defenses have been scaled back _ brought, literally, down to
earth _ beginning with plans for about 20 interceptors that could
shoot down a handful of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial, recent convert is Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the
ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Aug. 31 launch was a watershed moment,'' Kerrey said.
``There is a growing recognition that there's a real danger of
proliferation that produces either an accidental launching or an
attack by a rogue nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey pulled along other centrist Democrats in support of the
Republican-sponsored bill that passed in the Senate last week.
Fearing that the votes weren't there to sustain a presidential
veto, the White House and Senate Democratic leaders settled for two
face-saving amendments that seek to control the cost of any system
and to insure arms control talks with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a change in Democratic ideology,'' said Frank Luntz, a
Republican pollster. ``The old-fashioned Democratic doves of the
1970s are giving way to centrists who are less hostile to
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that all Democrats have bought into missile
defenses. In fact, half the House Democrats opposed such a move
last week. After $55 billion invested in developing a national
system since the early 1980s (when the Reagan administration
creatively interpreted the ABM treaty to allow research), the
technology is still unproven. Moreover, detractors say, terrorists
and despots could thwart a sophisticated missile defense with other
weapons of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be bypassed with suitcase bombs, pickup trucks and
sea-launched missiles,'' said Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., who is a
physicist. ``It would be billions of dollars down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon brass dismiss the naysayers, arguing that military
contractors and engineers will work out the technical kinks and, by
2005, field a limited system of radars and missile-killing
interceptors _ perhaps in Alaska, North Dakota or on ships at sea _
if Clinton gives the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fast-emerging consensus for missile defenses at home,
however, collides with growing anxiety abroad, particularly in
Beijing and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed a U.S. missile defense system, fearing
that Washington would use it as an excuse to reprise the much
grander Star Wars, which would be dauntingly expensive to match.
</P>
<P>
   While the anti-missile issue is of little concern to ordinary
Russians struggling with dire economic conditions, it is core
national security for Russian politicians, and a matter of
considerable national self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States moving ahead on such a system, Russian
nationalists could use the argument that Russia was losing its
nuclear deterrent _ since an anti-missile defense could encourage a
nation with one (that is, the United States) to risk a nuclear
exchange. That argument could undercut, for example, efforts by the
Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction
treaty between the two countries, or Start 2.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Foreign Ministry warned after last week's U.S. Senate
vote that building even a limited system ``poses a serious threat
to the whole process of nuclear arms control, as well as strategic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And for this reason, arms control advocates are nervous about
doing anything to upset further nuclear arms reductions with
Russia. After all, they say, North Korea may threaten America with
one to five missiles, but instability in Russia is a much greater
risk. ``Our overwhelming and sustained concern has to be Russia,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who voted reluctantly for the
Senate measure. ``They got the most, they got the biggest, and they
got the most accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and a growing number of Democrats say that
building an anti-missile system is just as necessary to insure a
safer world as reducing Moscow's nuclear stockpile, which is
declining with or without a treaty because Russia no longer can
afford to maintain it at Cold War levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate balance with Russia,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, a
senior Pentagon official under President George Bush and a member
of the Rumsfeld panel. ``We don't want to alienate the Russians,
but on the other hand we can't let them bully us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, U.S.-Japanese plans to develop a missile system to
defend Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the U.S. troops in the region
got under way about a decade ago, in anticipation of the possible
missile threat from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As that threat has become more real, the plans to defend against
it have encountered growing criticism from China _ and even from
key allies. Two weeks ago, South Korea's defense minister said a
joint U.S.-Japanese missile defense would be ineffective against
North Korean missiles, and added that his government would not help
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the possibility that such an anti-missile system
might not be ready for years, when there is at least a chance that
there won't be a North Korea left to worry about. This is a point
not lost on China, which views the proposed missile umbrella
primarily as a threat to its plans to reunify Taiwan with the
Chinese mainland. Since the early 1990s, China has more or less
doubled, to several hundred, the number of missiles on the Chinese
coast pointed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among many national security analysts in Asia is that
missile defenses could do to China what the creation of NATO did to
the Soviet Union: help to trigger a new escalation of arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are for the development of advanced missile defense
systems, we are going to touch off new rounds of an arms race,''
said He Yafei, a senior Chinese diplomat in Washington who has long
experience in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   And the idea of including Taiwan under any missile umbrella ``is
an obstruction on our course of unification of our motherland,'' he
added. ``Taiwan is part of China. Politically, that is an
interference, a very serious interference in our internal
affairs.''

<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average floats near 10,000. Jobs are
plentiful. Wages are rising. Spending is everywhere. The economy
booms, month after month. And nothing seems to shake the public
sense of prosperity. So why are the oracles of the economy talking
like Nervous Nellies?
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
told Congress in February that the economy ``appears stretched in a
number of dimensions.'' That on top of his insistence last
September that America cannot remain an ``oasis of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Or hear out stock market guru Warren Buffett, who said on
national television not three weeks ago: ``The level of speculation
is high by any historic standard. And you know that doesn't go on
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Or worry with Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics,
who said in an interview last week: ``We have had three awfully
good years now, and an incredible fourth quarter. But any setback
can start the dominoes falling. Who knows what's next.''
</P>
<P>
   The nervousness, in fact, may be appropriate. This is hardly a
standard, predictable boom. Normally, there is a beginning, middle
and end _ the typical post-World War II experience. After a
recession or period of sluggish growth, spending picks up and so
does investment. Low-interest loans and more jobs help the process
along, and the economy expands briskly.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, people find themselves pressed financially.
Worried, they slow their spending, and investment drops off. Or
shortages develop, prices rise and the Federal Reserve, fearing too
much inflation, raises interest rates to discourage the borrowing
that sustains good times. Either way, sluggish growth returns, or a
recession sets in.
</P>
<P>
   But the boom that started in late 1995 broke this pattern. It is
like a perpetual-motion machine, each part keeping the others
moving _ and moving indefinitely, many Americans have come to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this sense that we don't have to worry about problems
or adverse conditions,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the
University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. A ``virtuous circle,''
economists call the new machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, if one part malfunctions, or breaks, the whole
contraption may collapse. ``A vicious circle would replace the
virtuous one,'' Solow said, ``and feed on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual-motion economy, in brief outline, works this way:
The rising stock market generates the household wealth that
encourages the borrowing that pays for the spending that creates
the jobs and the higher wages that generate the confidence that
encourages people to invest in stocks and make the market rise some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us who have been doubters are starting to believe that
this thing can go on forever,'' said Stephen Roach, chief economist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``That is a complacency we may live
to regret. But I cannot really substantiate doubt for a good
analytic reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, a secondary player in standard booms, is the
biggest cog this time around. As stock prices have shot up,
household wealth has more than doubled in recent years. Wages have
risen, but not nearly as fast as the rise in household wealth. And
people are spending their new wealth, either by selling stock or
borrowing against it. Not that the stock is the actual collateral.
Instead, millions of people are putting up their homes as
collateral, but with the thought, say lenders and economists, that
they can sell stock to repay debt if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has become a way of extracting equity from
housing,'' said Wynne Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage and home equity loans, as a result, are the
fastest-rising form of consumer debt in recent months, the Federal
Reserve reports. Why not? After all, stock prices won't go down
that much, in the view of many Americans. ``God, if we could only
bottle all this confidence,'' Curtin said.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetual-motion economy has other intriguing components.
Inflation has stayed low, depriving the Federal Reserve of a reason
to raise interest rates and provoke a slowdown. One big reason for
the low inflation: Businesses here and abroad are producing more
than people want to buy, even high-spending Americans. Oil and raw
materials are particularly inexpensive, and the competition to sell
all the excess production holds down prices. Not even a low
unemployment rate and rising wages offset this downward pressure on
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The low inflation, in turn, produces low interest rates, which
encourage people to borrow and spend on home construction, for
example, and autos. Jobs are created, wages rise, confidence
flourishes and more money is invested in the stock market, creating
more wealth for households to borrow against. The flywheel keeps
turning.
</P>
<P>
   The global economic slowdown offers a separate contribution to
this self-perpetuating mechanism. Asia's economies, including
Japan's, are hurting. Europe is not particularly robust either. So
corporate Asia and corporate Europe have turned to America, selling
their merchandise here at what amounts to discount prices, helping
to keep inflation down.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more link in this circle: Foreign investors take
some of the dollars earned here and, rather than invest them back
home, buy American securities, including stocks _ and share prices
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the boom in America that seems so enduring will come
to an ironic end,'' said John Makin, an economist and senior fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute. ``As the rest of the world
does better, that will put a cap on things here for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Makin is rather mild in his nervousness. So are Joel Prakken and
Chris Varvares, partners at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting
firm in St. Louis. They see a gradual slowdown ahead because they
believe stock prices will stop rising this year, and interest rates
might edge up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't see stock prices falling sharply enough to halt
the perpetual-motion economy. Average stock prices would have to
fall at least 30 percent and stay down for at least six months, an
unlikely event in the view of most Wall Street economists and
certainly in the view of many shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Nervous Nellies are not mollified. What really seems to
worry them is a new article of faith on Wall Street and among many
Americans that if stock prices really drop, the Federal Reserve
will save the day by lowering interest rates, thus adding fresh
impetus to the perpetual-motion machine.
</P>
<P>
   Such an optimistic expectation annoys Fed officials. One of
Greenspan's top lieutenants, Michael Prell, the director of
research, made the point in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might people _ business managers, consumers, investors _ be
taking risks that they would not have taken were it not for an
exaggerated confidence in the ability of the Fed to cushion the
economy and financial markets against any and all shocks?'' Prell
asked. ``If so, there conceivably could be a greater potential
instability in the system than is readily apparent at this time.''

FOLLOWING BABY-SIZE ISSUES INTO VOTERS' HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First he decried the evils of traffic congestion.
Then he vowed to do something about cow manure that pollutes
streams. Then he called for larger print on over-the-counter drug
labels.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the mayor of Los Angeles or a county agriculture
commissioner or a pharmacist in Sarasota, Fla. This was the vice
president of the United States, Al Gore, unveiling his latest
initiatives recently as he competes for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton transformed the presidency (some say shrank
it) from a wellspring of grand ideas to one of itsy-bitsy
proposals, his vice president has gone further. Forget the
bite-size morsels like school uniforms that Clinton doled out four
years ago. To some, Gore is serving up crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond Gore, the smaller-is-better movement threatens to
infiltrate American political discourse. A favorite line of
Republican presidential aspirant Elizabeth Dole is her boast about
how, as transportation secretary, she championed emergency aisle
safety lights on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   These appeals to everyday life may reflect a radical change in
what people expect from their president. They may also be spurred
by an inward-looking culture in which Americans are relatively
content and more preoccupied with challenges of their daily lives
than with the less tangible state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that some leading politicians are as eager to talk about
tiny things as they are about grand matters of war and taxes may
also reflect an era of caution. Humbled, for example, by the
spectacular collapse of Clinton's huge health care overhaul,
politicians these days may be more inclined to propose sure-fire
initiatives than more ambitious or imaginative ones that may be
difficult to enact. These candidates may also be encouraging voters
to hold low expectations about what government can actually
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Even in areas like health care, where there is general agreement
that the system needs an overhaul, political polarization stands in
the way of any meaningful changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more risk in proposing big changes _ it's harder to
get it done,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``And there is in life
a general and very understandable tendency to make an assessment of
what can be done and work on that. I've been working on
entitlements since 1993. I think we're making progress. But it's
not something we can put on a press release.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who is thus far Gore's only
rival for the nomination, derides the concept of baby proposals,
asserting that as president his priority would be ``to cultivate 10
strong oaks rather than sprinkling water on a thousand house
plants.'' Bradley speaks ambitiously of rescuing the quarter of
American children living in poverty and tackling the deepening
crises in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, to be sure, talks about big things. But he risks becoming
known as parochial _ as Mayor Al _ when he dwells on matters that
his predecessors would never have raised.
</P>
<P>
   He produced titters for proposing an ``Airline Passenger Bill of
Rights,'' that calls for such things as increasing the compensation
for lost baggage. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a prospect for the
Republican presidential nomination, actually came up with the idea
first.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kerrey said, he did a radio show in Omaha, Neb., and
the announcers started laughing when the subject of the Airline
Passenger Bill of Rights came up. ``Jesus! I'm sure there's a need
there somewhere,'' Kerrey said. ``But it makes me a little
uncomfortable as an American.'' Mocking the measure, he said, ``All
of a sudden, I'm going to pass a law saying, `Give me sparkling
water instead of plain water!'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore may be practicing smart politics. A common frustration
of elected officials is that they cannot break through and explain
to voters how what they do touches people's daily lives. So when
Clinton in 1996 made small-bore ideas a centerpiece of his
campaign, voters rewarded him. Pollsters have also found that there
is a surge in potential voters who are part of an upper middle
class; these proposals are designed to appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is particularly well placed to promote these
ideas because he and Clinton can dream up _ and announce _ all
sorts of executive decrees that do not require congressional
approval. (Democrats are generally more eager than Republicans to
want to impose new government regulations.)
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and his loyalists warn that matters that to some appear
trivial may, in the eyes of others actually loom large. ``There
seems to be a difference of perspective between politicians and
journalistic elites on the one hand and the American people on the
other as to what counts as an idea that's large enough to be
meaningful,'' said William Galston, a professor of public affairs
at the University of Maryland who was a domestic policy official in
the early days of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Galston, a longtime adviser to Gore, added that politicians need
to adjust to the changing times. ``There is no reason to believe
that Bill Clinton was harmed in any way in 1995 and 1996 by
addressing issues that during the cold war might not have been seen
as presidential,'' he said. ``Obviously, you can go too far down
that road. These are questions of judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, said, ``Our next
president is not going to be Gore or small-minded Republicans. It's
going to be the candidate with one big idea. That's what America is
hungry for.''
</P>
<P>
   But just what constitutes a big idea these days? Gore asserted
that the next president will understand ``how tired working parents
are'' and that they do not want to be ``caught in traffic jams.''
For frazzled working parents with interminable commutes _ many of
whom are important swing voters _ that may be as big an idea as
they get.

FOLLOWING BABY-SIZE ISSUES INTO VOTERS' HEARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First he decried the evils of traffic congestion.
Then he vowed to do something about cow manure that pollutes
streams. Then he called for larger print on over-the-counter drug
labels.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the mayor of Los Angeles or a county agriculture
commissioner or a pharmacist in Sarasota, Fla. This was the vice
president of the United States, Al Gore, unveiling his latest
initiatives recently as he competes for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton transformed the presidency (some say shrank
it) from a wellspring of grand ideas to one of itsy-bitsy
proposals, his vice president has gone further. Forget the
bite-size morsels like school uniforms that Clinton doled out four
years ago. To some, Gore is serving up crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond Gore, the smaller-is-better movement threatens to
infiltrate American political discourse. A favorite line of
Republican presidential aspirant Elizabeth Dole is her boast about
how, as transportation secretary, she championed emergency aisle
safety lights on airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   These appeals to everyday life may reflect a radical change in
what people expect from their president. They may also be spurred
by an inward-looking culture in which Americans are relatively
content and more preoccupied with challenges of their daily lives
than with the less tangible state of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But that some leading politicians are as eager to talk about
tiny things as they are about grand matters of war and taxes may
also reflect an era of caution. Humbled, for example, by the
spectacular collapse of Clinton's huge health care overhaul,
politicians these days may be more inclined to propose sure-fire
initiatives than more ambitious or imaginative ones that may be
difficult to enact. These candidates may also be encouraging voters
to hold low expectations about what government can actually
accomplish.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In New Jersey, former Gov. Jim Florio wants to run
for the U.S. Senate. In California, former Rep. Robert Dornan is
threatening to challenge a fellow Republican congressman. And in
New York, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato keeps floating his name as a
candidate for his old job.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every state has them, defeated politicians trying to
reclaim old glory. Like ghosts of elections past, they rattle their
platforms and demand attention from voters, local officials and the
media. But the people they often end up scaring the most are
members of their own parties.
</P>
<P>
   In Florio's case, many of his fellow Democrats are worried that
he will end up in a replay of his loss in the 1993 gubernatorial
race to Christie Whitman, who Republicans say is leaning toward
running for the Senate next year. Voters are still angry with
Florio for raising taxes, those Democrats say, and are sure to
punish him and possibly other Democratic candidates if he runs
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was someone prominent the Democrats could push
forward against Florio, someone with statewide name recognition,
they would do it,'' said Russ Baker, a professor of political
science at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Dornan, a combative conservative Republican from Orange County,
was unseated in 1996 by Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat. Dornan
disputed the results, failed, tried to get the House of
Representatives to overturn them, failed again, and then challenged
Ms. Sanchez in 1998, failing for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Dornan now says he may challenge Ms. Sanchez again
next year, or possibly take on a fellow Republican, Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, who Dornan says failed to help him in the 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
   To many Republican leaders in California, Dornan is a divisive
candidate whose attacks on immigration have hampered the party's
efforts to attract Hispanic and Asian voters. But their efforts to
block him in 1998 failed when Dornan won the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the groans from Republicans when he said he
might run next year,'' said Amy Walter, an editor of the Cook
Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   When D'Amato was ousted by Charles Schumer last year, many
political analysts chalked it up in part to voter exhaustion with
the brash three-term Republican. So when D'Amato started saying on
national television recently that running next year was ``very
tempting,'' not every New York Republican cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk would be mortified'' if he ran again, said Norman
Adler, a political consultant who works for both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   What makes people like Dornan, Florio and D'Amato hard to ignore
is their ability to move blocs of loyal voters, even small blocs.
And since only a small percentage of the electorate votes in
primaries, those loyalists can carry the day, particularly in
crowded fields.
</P>
<P>
   But why would politicians subject themselves to the rigors of a
campaign after voters had rejected them before? Political analysts
say the comeback personality usually falls into one of two
categories (and sometimes both): the vindication seeker and the
egoist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vindication seekers are the people who lost by just a few
hundred votes, which is a very tough pill to swallow,'' said Ms.
Walter. ``They can't help thinking, `If only 200 people changed
their minds, I would win.'''
</P>
<P>
   The egoist thrives on public attention, seeming unfocused,
unfulfilled and disoriented without it. ``A lot of guys need to
reaffirm their importance,'' said Adler. ``And one way to do it is
to say, `I'm running for something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing seems to inspire not-ready-for-retirement
politicians: the examples of comeback kids who succeeded. Michael
Dukakis in Massachusetts and Bill Clinton in Arkansas were both
defeated after their first terms as governor, then won their jobs
back in the next election. And Richard M. Nixon lost the 1960
presidential campaign and 1962 California gubernatorial race before
winning sweet vindication in the 1968 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the defeated candidates expressed contrition for
being prideful, aloof or hard-charging, and claimed to have become
more in tune with voters' concerns, Baker said. He calls it the
``politics of epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic forgiveness among Americans,'' he said,
``this idea of a second chance, particularly if someone is willing
to humble himself and say they've made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of epiphany seems to be at the heart of Florio's
current pitch for becoming a Senate candidate. Criticized as an
intense, unemotional man who failed to sympathize with middle-class
voters' worries in 1993, Florio now says that five years as a
lawyer in private practice, battling traffic jams and navigating
government bureaucracy, has made him more empathetic to the gripes
of regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a better understanding of the frantic pace of life,''
he said in a recent interview, ``the stresses and strains that real
people go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said Florio will have to battle suspicions that his new
image is ``packaging over substance.'' And Adler said Florio may
have a hard time convincing major contributors that he can win
again, a potentially towering obstacle given the high cost of
statewide campaigns today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most big contributors give not for ideological reasons, but to
people they think will be winners,'' he said. ``And it's very hard
to resuscitate a dead politician.''

I'M THE FISCAL PURIST. NO, I AM. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget deficit is history, and the
strong economy is generating surpluses that could last for decades.
But in Washington, pledges of budgetary austerity are emanating
from both parties in a way they never did when the outlook was
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Republicans are still fixated on a big tax cut, and
Democrats still tend to want to throw money at problems. But both
parties have built their agendas this year around the goals of
reducing the national debt and keeping spending in check.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly great economic benefits to be gained from
keeping the country's financial house in order and using any
windfall wisely. Still, given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was arguably needed most, it seems fair to wonder
whether this bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more
than a passing political fad.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that by the end of the year Congress and President
Clinton will have broken the strict spending caps at the heart of
the current budget law. As the $20 billion burst of last-minute
spending outside the caps last year proved, it's hard to hold the
line when faced with pleas for aid to hard-pressed farmers, or pay
increases for the military, or more money for Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with the country as flush as it is, there is
little evidence that the two parties will be able to turn their
good intentions into agreements on shoring up the twin pillars of
the social welfare system: Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the whole austerity effort, however transitory, is
the broader question of whether it requires a crisis to take tough
action or whether, as Clinton likes to say, the best time to fix
the roof is while the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   If political positioning were the standard, the answer would be
clear. For now at least, Democrats and Republicans alike are
determined to portray themselves as not just fiscally pure but
purer than the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the bidding by proposing that three-quarters of
projected surpluses be set aside, effectively through debt
reduction, to deal with the looming problems in Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered last week with a plan to stop the
longstanding practice by both parties of using Social Security's
reserves to pay for spending and tax cuts. Then, in votes in the
House and Senate Budget Committees, Democrats tried to up the ante
by proposing to bar any tax cuts until the long-range solvency of
both Social Security and Medicare has been assured (the Republicans
defeated the effort).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee voted with
Republicans to reject Clinton's budget proposal because it dipped
into Social Security money for a few years to pay for spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of the maneuvering is an attempt by each party to
define itself for the new politics of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the reality that the deficit exploded on
President Ronald Reagan's watch in the 1980s as they cut taxes,
pumped up the Pentagon budget and did little to restrain domestic
spending, Republicans have long laid claim to being the party of
fiscal responsibility. Having seen the Democrats under Clinton
co-opt them on so many issues, Republicans are eager to reassert
themselves on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not recognized as the party that wants to restrain
spending and cut taxes, what's the purpose?'' said Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the situation is more complicated. On one level,
many Democrats, even some liberals, now seem convinced that the
nation cannot afford to spend with abandon, and that keeping the
federal budget under control yields big benefits to working
families by keeping interest rates, inflation and unemployment
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also believe that using the bulk of anticipated
surpluses in a way that helps Social Security and Medicare works
for them on both political and policy grounds. If they prevail this
year, it will be because Clinton managed to link the idea of debt
repayment to strengthening the two most popular social welfare
programs.
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic perspective, the argument is simple: A
sweeping tax cut now, before the expected surpluses materialize,
risks squandering the best chance to deal with Social Security and
Medicare while requiring painful and unjustified cuts in a wide
array of popular programs. If they can block Republican tax cuts
and in the process erase the tax-and-spend stigma they have been
stuck with for years, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   The professed commitment to austerity within both parties
appears to be driven in part by a palpable sense of skepticism
among voters _ evident in polls and in meetings between elected
officials and constituents _ that the promised surpluses will ever
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration and Democrats more generally have
discovered that the best route to achieving liberal ends may be
conservative means, especially when those ends are defined as
preserving the social welfare programs most highly regarded by the
citizenry,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at
the Brookings Institution. ``That approach has the great benefit of
matching the priority of the public.''

I'M THE FISCAL PURIST. NO, I AM. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal budget deficit is history, and the
strong economy is generating surpluses that could last for decades.
But in Washington, pledges of budgetary austerity are emanating
from both parties in a way they never did when the outlook was
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Republicans are still fixated on a big tax cut, and
Democrats still tend to want to throw money at problems. But both
parties have built their agendas this year around the goals of
reducing the national debt and keeping spending in check.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly great economic benefits to be gained from
keeping the country's financial house in order and using any
windfall wisely. Still, given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was arguably needed most, it seems fair to wonder
whether this bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more
than a passing political fad.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that by the end of the year Congress and President
Clinton will have broken the strict spending caps at the heart of
the current budget law. As the $20 billion burst of last-minute
spending outside the caps last year proved, it's hard to hold the
line when faced with pleas for aid to hard-pressed farmers, or pay
increases for the military, or more money for Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even with the country as flush as it is, there is
little evidence that the two parties will be able to turn their
good intentions into agreements on shoring up the twin pillars of
the social welfare system: Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the whole austerity effort, however transitory, is
the broader question of whether it requires a crisis to take tough
action or whether, as Clinton likes to say, the best time to fix
the roof is while the sun is shining.
</P>
<P>
   If political positioning were the standard, the answer would be
clear. For now at least, Democrats and Republicans alike are
determined to portray themselves as not just fiscally pure but
purer than the other party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started the bidding by proposing that three-quarters of
projected surpluses be set aside, effectively through debt
reduction, to deal with the looming problems in Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered last week with a plan to stop the
longstanding practice by both parties of using Social Security's
reserves to pay for spending and tax cuts. Then, in votes in the
House and Senate Budget Committees, Democrats tried to up the ante
by proposing to bar any tax cuts until the long-range solvency of
both Social Security and Medicare has been assured (the Republicans
defeated the effort).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee voted with
Republicans to reject Clinton's budget proposal because it dipped
into Social Security money for a few years to pay for spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of the maneuvering is an attempt by each party to
define itself for the new politics of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the reality that the deficit exploded on
President Ronald Reagan's watch in the 1980s as they cut taxes,
pumped up the Pentagon budget and did little to restrain domestic
spending, Republicans have long laid claim to being the party of
fiscal responsibility. Having seen the Democrats under Clinton
co-opt them on so many issues, Republicans are eager to reassert
themselves on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not recognized as the party that wants to restrain
spending and cut taxes, what's the purpose?'' said Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the situation is more complicated. On one level,
many Democrats, even some liberals, now seem convinced that the
nation cannot afford to spend with abandon, and that keeping the
federal budget under control yields big benefits to working
families by keeping interest rates, inflation and unemployment
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also believe that using the bulk of anticipated
surpluses in a way that helps Social Security and Medicare works

year, it will be because Clinton managed to link the idea of debt
repayment to strengthening the two most popular social welfare

Medicare while requiring painful and unjustified cuts in a wide

A PRISONER OF FAME AND THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

<P>
   The most exclusive Oscar party of all will not be held in
Hollywood on Sunday night. It will take place in front of a
television set in the depths of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, the largest maximum security prison in the United States
and the setting for ``The Farm,'' which was nominated for best
feature documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau, a black man convicted
of murdering a white woman 38 years ago, who has edited The
Angolite, the prison's award-winning news magazine, for 25 years.
Rideau co-directed ``The Farm'' with New York filmmakers Liz Garbus
and Jonathan Stack, but he is not named on the nomination because
an Academy Awards rule permits only two names per documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from around the world have descended on Angola with
more intensity than anyone has seen in a while, many to cover the
incongruity of Oscar night and the life of a 57-year-old trusty.
The execution of Dobie Gillis Williams at the prison in January
attracted some unusual attention, mainly because Williams'
``spiritual adviser'' was Sister Helen Prejean, author of ``Dead
Man Walking''(Random House, 1993), which was made into a movie that
was filmed at Angola.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Jett, the prison's executive staff officer in charge
of public information, says there hasn't been this much press
interest since Rideau's book, ``Life Sentences'' (Times Books,
1992), was published. It was this collection of Angolite articles
that first attracted Ms. Garbus and Stack.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau's haunting portraits of life and death at Angola became
the basis for ``The Farm,'' which documents the lives of six
prisoners, one dying, another on death row and four others
rehabilitated but with no hope of release in Louisiana's penal
system, which reflects a national trend toward lengthy
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Stack says Angola has always provided ``the kind of material
that makes filmmakers salivate.'' It has the same effect on
journalists. ``The fact is, the Oscars are not that interesting,''
said Edward Hillmore, who visited Angola for The London Evening
Standard. ``But here's a story that has a lot more to it than who's
wearing what designer on Oscar night.''
</P>
<P>
   Angola's pull on journalists and movie people amazes Ms. Jett.
``I went to the opening of `The Farm' in New York,'' she said,
``and at the dinner I sat down at a table with people from Vogue,
and Anne Heche and William Baldwin, you know, and I didn't even get
to eat because people kept asking me about what it's like to work
here and be a woman and the death penalty and oh, my gosh, what
didn't they ask?''
</P>
<P>
   Angola perhaps offers the mystique of exploring what is both
exotic and fearsome _ but, like the revolutionaries with round-trip
tickets in the V.S. Naipaul essay, ``Killings in Trinidad,''
filmmakers and journalists get to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, for Rideau. At 19 he shot two bank employees
and stabbed a third, Julia Ferguson, to death during a robbery.
Rideau, whose death sentence was commuted to life when a 1972
Supreme Court ruling overturned capital punishment, has often
expressed remorse for his crime. His quarter-century crusade ``to
make a difference,'' as he puts it, has earned him acclaim but not
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Of late Rideau has been interviewed by CBS News, the Norwegian
Broadcasting Corp., the German magazine Stern and lawyer Johnnie
Cochran for Court TV, among others. For most of these visitors, the
mystique of the prison has given way to the question of why Rideau
is still there.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 Angolite article, Rideau, who refuses to write about
his own case, said that ``long-term prisoners are hostages of fear
and politics, their fate determined by the vagaries of the
political mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days when Angola was one of the country's most
violent prisons, before rehabilitation became an issue, paroles and
pardons were probably more possible. In the 1930s, Gov. O.K. Allen
released Leadbelly after the future blues legend petitioned him in
song.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Angola is a model prison, proudly running daily tours of
the 5,200-inmate institution, including its state-of-the-art
execution chamber. Yet 88 percent of the convicts will never leave,
according to the state's prisons department, regardless of how
rehabilitated some become.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau's acclaim _ more than his race and that of the victim and
the brutal nature of the crime _ has perhaps increased the prospect
that he will be denied clemency. Two governors have scuttled four
recommendations by the pardon board to release him. And the
lobbying against Rideau from Calcasieu Parish, where he committed
his crime, remains as fervent as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Geneste, a correspondent for La Croix, the French
Catholic daily newspaper, came away from her five-and-a-half-hour
interview with Rideau deeply troubled. ``It was so moving to hear
him saying, `Yes, I was a bad person for sure, but look what I've
done and life is not over,''' she said. ``And I think that we as
journalists definitely have to do something for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A front-page article on Rideau by Ennio Caretto in the Italian
newspaper Corriere della Sera described Angola as ``America's
Gulag.'' ``In Italy,'' he said in an interview, ``in a case like
his, he would have already been returned to society.''
</P>
<P>
   The warden, Burl Cain, said in a recent interview: ``If it were
up to me, I think he could go free and go to some other state where
he could pursue his journalism talents. Wilbert Rideau is not going
to kill anybody again, I don't think, or ever rob anybody. He's not
about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain said he has seen to it that on Sunday night Rideau, the
other inmates and members of the press will have ``a good TV and
refreshments.'' The warden, however, will be at the Oscar
presentations in Hollywood in a newly bought tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   While winning would be good, Cain said, he feels as if ``we've
won already.'' The film, he said, has shown the public ``what it
needed to see _ the old man dying in prison, the people who I feel
are totally rehabilitated, people the public might think would be
monsters being totally normal, everyday people who had done
horrible things but had worked real hard to change their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideau wholeheartedly agrees. The nomination and press coverage,
which still seem ``unreal'' to him, have brought the film a wider
audience, he said last week in a telephone interview. His voice
betrayed what he felt at the prospect of watching from so far away.
``I never expected to go,'' he said. ``It would be nice, however,
if somebody would mention my name up there if we win.''

   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ It is just past 9 p.m., and from all
corners of Disney's Central Florida empire, processions of
automobile headlamps can be seen pushing on, much as in the
concluding scene in ``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the huge entertainment park has closed for the night and
dozens of thousands of people, spent in ways more than one, are
returning home, or to their nearby hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Disney built and they came.
</P>
<P>
   They not only came to Walt Disney World but they also came to
Universal Studios, to Sea World and to myriad other attractions
that, in the last three decades, have converted this section of
Florida from a citrus-dependent province to America's family
entertainment mecca.
</P>
<P>
   While the throngs that fill each theme park portend there are no
more people left on this planet to spin the turnstiles, it appears
to be a misguided assumption.
</P>
<P>
   The construction cranes continue to work feverishly and,
seemingly, rarely does much time pass when the Disney people are
not opening added attractions, last week inaugurating a new thrill
ride at Epcot and an ersatz continent in the Animal Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the heart-stimulating Test Track speed, trajectory
and zigzag ride open then came the crowds. An Orlando newspaper
columnist observed that on the first day of the ride, the line in
which he was waiting reached one hour and 38 minutes long. And the
ride itself was but 4 minutes and 24 seconds duration.
</P>
<P>
   I would not wait that long to play horse with Michael Jordan or
to do high tea with Her Majesty. And I didn't; took one look at the
lengthy queue and moved on to a much shorter-lined 3D show that
aspired to convince me (slap-slap) how important bugs are to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the instant herds of visitors, there must be a
saturation point _ a barrier beyond which there are so many
attractions that there are not enough people (or dollars) remaining
to attend them.
</P>
<P>
   And, with that infinite stream of auto headlights in mind, how
much space remains on the Disney property to build on before it
becomes teeming with people and cars, as has happened to Yosemite
National Park in California.
</P>
<P>
   In the technique of any Disney executive, Al Weiss is not one of
those people who subscribes to fear. Weiss is president of Walt
Disney World Resort and, as such, is in charge of the entire
Florida empire _ all the theme parks, all 14 hotels and
campgrounds, the golf courses there, all those souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked the other day if the saturation point is close by,
and with knowledge that there have been undocumented reports that
the secretl held attendance figures at Disney World last year
showed a single-digit decline, Weiss answered with cautious
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A top-out?'' he asked back. ``Hard to tell. We anticipate
growth from the international market place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the enormous property (30,000 acres obtained for Disney
via a covert buy-up in the first half of the '60s) becomes
overloaded, Weiss contended they could build three more major theme
parks and double the hotel space. Already, rooms either owned by
Disney or under its aegis are at 21,059 with 1,300 more to be
available by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of such success can be terrifying and, yet, if any
organization can handle it, the Disney people can. Their efficiency
is remarkable, so much so that I even admire the creative manner in
which they devise their serpentine waiting queues, although I abhor
spending an abundance of my time there waiting in lines for rides,
transportation, food or even bug shows.
</P>
<P>
   What Disney began here in the '60s can be considered a monster
by some but don't tell it to those saps in line; they're actually
enjoying themselves.

THAT'S NOT A SKIM LATTE. IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   The last time you pulled a shirt out of a drawer, it is possible
you were not simply getting dressed. You were actually living out a
small moment of a lifestyle, one shared with thousands of others,
and one you probably didn't know you were leading.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, retailers and makers of products from T-shirts to
watering cans are broadening their pitch, selling their wares by
marketing an entire way of living.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein isn't content to have its customers wear its
underwear; the company longs to have them serve food on its dishes
and towel off with its bath sheets. Starbucks executives don't want
people to just drink their coffee in the morning; they want them to
eat their ice cream and listen to their music CDs in bed. That way,
Starbucks becomes more than a network of caffeine-delivery outlets
_ it elbows its way into consumers' lives and becomes an essential
part of their day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee is a very emotional and romantic beverage,'' said
Howard Schultz, Starbuck's chief executive and lifestyle marketing
evangelist. ``It is an extension of people's front porch. Our
stores are a place where people are very comfortable, because
people trust us. Starbucks is more than a coffee. It is a feeling,
it is an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like hokum. But tell that to Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co., one of the most famous brands in America, which announced
recently that declining sales and tough competition would result in
the dismissal of 5,900 workers and the closing of 11 plants. Maybe
one of Levi's problems is that it has no cola. It has no
denim-toned house paint. Levi makes what is essentially a
commodity: blue jeans. Its ads may evoke rugged outdoorsmanship,
but Levi hasn't promoted any particular lifestyle to sell other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Once people get to know a brand's most famous product, the
thinking goes, they will trust that brand to deliver any number of
items, even if the original product has no relationship to the
subsequent stuff the company hawks. To wit: Brooks Brothers now has
its own line of wines and Jack Daniel's sells clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great marketers say the brand can be the thing that holds
their group of consumers together,'' said Sam Hill, a principal
partner at Helios Consulting in New York. ``The lifestyle label is
an intelligent reaction by marketers who want a deeper relationship
with consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The retail industry generates $2.7 trillion in annual sales, so
those deeper relationships are worth a great deal. There are two
basic steps in lifestyle branding. The first is to plaster the
brand's name or logo on every imaginable product. Ralph Lauren is
not just a polo pony stitched to the front of shirts and dresses;
it's a name that appears on linens, towels, eyeglasses, bras and
house paint. Gucci sells home decor items that resemble their belt
buckles, and nearly every clothing designer has at least one
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers must also spend a lot of money to create
advertisements that depict their products among people and in
situations that embody what their marketing whizzes call a ``state
of mind'' _ preferably one that appeals to consumers of all ages.
This will ensure that young girls will want to wear your
inappropriately low-cut shirts, because they are older at heart,
and those a bit long-in-the-tooth will buy your wedge-cut sandals,
reasoning that they share a youthful outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for retailers to get lots of people living a
lifestyle is to reach them through a variety of media. Martha
Stewart _ who may actually be the first human to embody a lifestyle
_ has this down pat. She has a weekly television program, a
magazine and several lines of products _ pricey ones sold through
her catalog and magazine, and a set of household items at much
lower prices sold through Kmart stores. The genius of Ms. Stewart's
strategy is that her lifestyle is decidedly upscale, even as she
makes it accessible to middle-class consumers, the nation's biggest
group of purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   To promote a lifestyle, a company must obsessively market its
products through ad campaigns in which the product is not nearly as
central as the people using it. Who cares what jeans the models are
wearing in a Ralph Lauren ad? All that matters is that everyone
looks wholesome, athletic and delighted to be frolicking or
lounging on the grounds of an expensive beach-front property.
</P>
<P>
   In most Nine West ads, it is hard to make out the shoes or bag
for sale. But the women are young and sexy and never far from a
great-looking guy and a romantic setting. A shopper is meant to
believe that if she buys the whole package _ clothes, tables,
sheets and bras _ she will join the elite club of those living out
the brand's lifestyle in its ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people feel about themselves is a much greater predictor
of buying behavior'' than who they actually are, Hill said. ``And
that is really what you care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Lastrina, a spokeswoman for Nine West, which has expanded
from footwear to handbags, sunglasses and belts, said: ``We
position Nine West as aspirational yet attainable. The one
carry-through is that the wearer has a contemporary, modern, upbeat
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Every marketer fantasizes that it knows its customers
intimately. But they are often not quite on the mark. Jill Virkus,
31, a production manager for a publishing company in Chicago, owns
several pairs of Nine West shoes and a purse. Her motive for buying
Nine West seems fairly straightforward. ``I think that their stuff
is wearable and cool looking without being too out there,'' she
said. ``Am I contemporary? Yes. Am I upbeat? Sure. Am I modern? I'm
not sure. That to me is black leather and chrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren is among the most experienced and relentless
retailers pursuing lifestyle marketing. The company's clothing
ranges from the very high end to T-shirts and jeans, and it sells
sunglasses, house paint, home furnishings, shoes and many other
products.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren says he knows whom he's designing his wares for. ``I know
where they live, where they want to go,'' he said. ``I know how
they dress and the kind of restaurants they go to.''
</P>
<P>
   His vision, he acknowledges, is somewhat flexible: ``A guy who
works on Wall Street may go to the Cape as opposed to the Hamptons,
but the Hollywood guys go to the Hamptons. The photographers go to
Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the Ralph Lauren shopper is ``sophisticated and
has his choice of things to buy,'' said Lauren. ``My brand is about
consistency of style and taste, not formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Camille Walker, 27, a nursing assistant in Philadelphia, said
half of her clothes have a Polo label. She also owns sheet sets and
bath mats.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her take on Lauren's vision: ``He advertises to the rich
because he is rich. But mostly poor people wear the sportswear. All
my friends wear the T-shirts and the pants; I am the only one who
wears the designer clothes. Rich people wear his higher-end line,
but Polo is for kids from the ghetto. I don't think he knows that,
but I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I live his lifestyle,'' she added. ``I would
say I just thank God for my health.''

for Sunday, March 21, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scheduled for the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-DEFENSE-REVIEW (Washington) _ The nation is fast moving
toward developing a national missile defense. When viewed as a
domestic political issue, it seems surprising that the former
divisiveness over the question seems to be suddenly, magically
melting away. But don't be fooled. As an international political
and diplomatic issue, the surprise is that it's more contentious
than ever. By Eric Schmitt. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JITTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Dow floats near 10,000. Jobs
are plentiful. Wages are rising. Spending is everywhere. The
economy booms, month after month. And nothing seems to shake the
public sense of prosperity. So why are the oracles of the economy
talking like Nervous Nellies? Because this is not only the biggest
economic expansion in history but also the most atypical. By Louis
Uchitelle. (`a' category). WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-ISSUES-REVIEW (Washington) _ If Bill Clinton shrunk the
presidency from a wellspring of grand ideas to a trickle of
itsy-bitsy proposals, then Al Gore, Elizabeth Dole and other
would-be successors are going further by addressing seemingly
unpresidential issues like traffic congestion and lights in
airplane passenger aisles. These appeals to everyday life may
reflect a radical change in what people expect from a president.
Talking about small issues may be a way of avoiding larger ones
that are more difficult, perhaps impossible, to deal with. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-HANGERS-ON-REVIEW (Washington) _ Former New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio wants to run for the Senate. Former Rep. Bob Dornan
of California and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York signal
that they may want to run again for their old jobs. Like ghosts of
elections past, defeated politicians trying to reclaim old glory
demand attention from voters and the media. But the people they
often end up scaring the most are members of their own parties. By
James Dao. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   BUDGET-AUSTERITY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Pledges of budgetary
austerity are emanating from both parties in a way they never did
when the outlook was bleak. Given that Washington's commitment to
fiscal discipline was notably absent during the 1980s and early
1990s when it was needed most, it seems fair to wonder whether this
bipartisan outbreak of responsibility will prove more than a
passing political fad. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   PORN-PALACE-REVIEW (West Hollywood, Calif.) _ Hustler Hollywood
is a 9,000-square-foot up-market sex emporium. With its
floor-to-ceiling windows and coffee bar, it unashamedly pitches
erotica. Opened last December, its sleek design, aromatic candles
and Kama Sutra massage oils are intended to appeal to women. It is
the flagship of what owner Larry Flynt hopes will be a nationwide
Hustler chain. By Frances Anderton. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-MANUAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1969, Dr. David Reuben
published the groundbreaking book `Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask.' Now, 30 years later, comes
an updated edition. An idea of the revisions can be gleaned by
comparing some of the tamer passages of his book's two editions.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR-PRISON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The most exclusive Oscar party
of all will take place in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at
Angola, the setting for `The Farm,' which was nominated for best
feature documentary. The guest of honor will be Wilbert Rideau,
convicted of murder 38 years ago, who co-directed `The Farm' with
New York filmmakers Liz Garbus and Jonathan Stack. He is not named
on the nomination because an Academy Awards rule permits only two
names per documentary. By Elin Schoen Brockman.

   BRAND-DIVERSIFICATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Retailers and makers of

stuff the company markets. By Jennifer Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-SNAFU-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a form letter from Arizona
State University, a prospective student's Social Security number
was inadvertently substituted for his name. The university says
only a handful of such faulty letters were mailed _ out of
thousands sent out recently by the college's parents association _
and the glitch has been corrected. WITH PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic are similar in that both have become
experts at cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its
diplomatic strategists, tying down its military and daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist. By Alison Smale.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-TAXES-REVIEW (Quito, Ecuador) _ With governments all over
Latin America coming under pressure from the IMF and other lenders
to cut yawning budget deficits, there is a growing recognition that
the region's historical and deeply ingrained aversion to paying
taxes is crippling development and poisoning citizens' attitudes
about their societies and governments. By Larry Rohter.

<P>
   SADDAM-MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ Iraq's Saddam Hussein and
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic are similar in that both have become
experts at cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its
diplomatic strategists, tying down its military and daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist. By Alison Smale.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-TAXES-REVIEW (Quito, Ecuador) _ With governments all over
Latin America coming under pressure from the IMF and other lenders
to cut yawning budget deficits, there is a growing recognition that
the region's historical and deeply ingrained aversion to paying
taxes is crippling development and poisoning citizens' attitudes
about their societies and governments. By Larry Rohter.

   Marijuana Finds Its Niche
</P>
<P>
   It has been smoked for centuries, lionized in poetry and song
(``Everybody must get stoned!''), vilified in film (``Reefer
Madness''). Now marijuana, which can bring both euphoria and a
federal prison term, has secured its place in the medical
literature, with a comprehensive government-financed report that
finds its active components help patients with pain, nausea and the
severe weight loss associated with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The report, conducted by an independent panel of experts at the
Institute of Medicine, set off much hullabaloo when it was
released. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who commissioned the study as
director of the National Office on Drug Control Policy, trumpeted
its conclusion: There is ``little future in smoked marijuana.''
Proponents of legalizing the drug for medical use seized upon the
report as evidence that ``therapeutic cannabis'' is not a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Both were correct. The 250-page report found that the benefits
of smoking marijuana are limited because of the toxic effects of
the smoke, and urged that new delivery mechanisms, particularly
bronchial inhalers of the sort used by asthma patients, be
developed. At the same time, it recommended that the drug be given,
under close supervision and for a limited time, to patients who do
not respond to other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that caused the biggest stir, however, had more
to do with policy than medicine. The authors found no evidence that
giving marijuana to sick people would increase illicit use
elsewhere in the population. Nor, they said, is marijuana a
``gateway drug'' to more dangerous narcotics like cocaine and
heroin. McCaffrey said the next step is more research.

   A Money Titan's Obscurantism
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the first time Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. prepared to go
public, it honored a tradition that dates from its founding as a
private partnership 130 years ago: obsessive secrecy. Now Goldman
has augmented its prospectus with 1,400 pages filed last week with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can learn that Goldman pays $35,862,435 each year to
Metropolitan Life Corp. of New York to rent land. The land is
defined obliquely as ``beginning at the corner formed by the
intersection of the northerly side of Pearl Street with the
easterly side of Broad Street, then still southerly along westerly
line of Stone Street and forming an angle of 153 degrees 30 minutes
16 seconds on its westerly side.''
</P>
<P>
   This land is said to be located in the City of New York, County
of New York, State of New York,'' though the reader is left to
surmise that it is included in the United States. It is possible to
determine after searching the appendices that this area contains
Goldman's headquarters at 85 Broad St.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the condition of Goldman's offices at One Carter
Lane in London notes a troubling-sounding loss of fluid in the
``system one Altu filter indicator,'' and documents scratches on
the transom of an elevator, bay 50, at the same location. But
admirers of Goldman's proven agility will be pleased to read that
``a dedicated movement joint is located in the E-W direction along
the demise line between One Carter Lane and the site of One Old
Change Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospectus says that 41 percent of the Forbes 400 list of
the world's richest people maintain private investment accounts at
Goldman. The firm is spending $150 million to update its computer
systems to handle four-digit dates so they won't crash when the
millennium begins. The firm has committed about $3 billion to
private investments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There were five days last year in which Goldman's traders earned
the firm more than $60 million, but nine days in which they lost
more than more than $60 million. That undoubtedly led to a great
deal of fingernail biting in the area bounded by the westerly side
of Stone Street and northerly side of Pearl Street.

   A Truck, a Train and a Fatal Encounter
</P>
<P>
   An Amtrak train heading from Chicago to New Orleans crashed into
a truck at a crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., 50 miles south of
Chicago, raising fresh questions about the safety of the country's
track crossings. Eleven people were killed and more than 100 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver said the gates started closing after he was
already crossing, but another truck driver behind him reportedly
told investigators he saw the truck enter the tracks despite
flashing warning lights. Investigators were trying to determine if
the driver of the truck, which was loaded with steel bars, was
attempting to go around the gates as they were descending. If tire
tracks found nearby match those of the truck, they would show that
the driver tried to defeat the system, investigators said.

   Bombing Threatened
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said NATO must be ready to carry out
airstrikes against the Serbs, who have acted in a manner that
provoked a military response. Calling his first full news
conference in almost a year, Clinton said, ``Hesitation is a
license to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton not only discussed bombing Kosovo but also addressed his
administration's handling of China's suspected theft of secrets
from U.S. nuclear labs in the 1980s. ``To the best of my knowledge,
no one has said anything to me about any espionage which occurred
by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency,'' he said.

   A Stitch in Time
</P>
<P>
   How to reduce adolescent violence and other risky behavior while
fostering an interest in learning? Starting in first grade,
researchers in Seattle say, treat children with respect, encourage
them to cooperate with one another and their teachers, reward their
accomplishments, give them a quiet place to do their homework and
teach them how to say no without losing friends and status.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. David Hawkins and a team of social scientists at the
University of Washington instituted a test program in first grade
in Seattle's toughest schools and continued it through sixth grade.
At the end, students in the program were significantly less likely
to have committed violent acts, indulged in heavy drinking, engaged
in sexual intercourse or caused a pregnancy or become pregnant than
students at comparable schools with no special intervention.

</P>
<P>
   Despite seven straight years of falling crime, the number of
inmates in the nation's jails and prisons climbed again last year,
to a record 1.8 million, the Justice Department reported. The rise
in the prison population is not the result of more effective police
department policies. It is but largely the outcome of the
get-tough-on-crime movement in this country: politicians
legislating mandatory sentences, prosecutors pushing to make sure
more offenders are locked up, judges giving longer sentences and
parole boards less willing to let convicts out early.

   A retired two-star general who served as the Army's deputy
inspector general pleaded guilty to eight counts of misconduct
stemming from affairs he had with the wives of his subordinates.
The Army hopes the court martial of Maj. Gen. David Hale will put
to rest criticism that senior officers are treated more leniently
than junior personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentence _ a $22,000 fine _ was not as severe as that
given to the Army's top soldier, Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, who was
convicted last year of one count of obstructing justice during an
investigation into sexual harassment. He was reprimanded and
demoted, which resulted in a cut in his pension that over 40 years
will cost him $700,000.

Discounted hard covers are eroding the market, but other

   In 1996, Forbes made his mark hawking the flat tax, which he

   Often, the most intense sports dramas in this sports-mad nation
involve heated disputes among mature adults about whether some ball
or body part landed a smidgen this or that side of the line. Who
can forget the touchdown-that-wasn't in the December Jets-Seahawks
game?
</P>
<P>
   Well, once again, technology will try to dispense perfect
justice. The much-quibbled-over instant replay, banished in 1992,
partly because it slowed games so much, is back _ for a one-year
trial. This time, coaches must call for it sparingly _ just twice a
game, and only if the team has timeouts left. If a call is
overruled, the team keeps its replay credit. And if it's overtime
or the last two minutes of a half, a referee assistant glued to a
monitor can step in.

   Last year U.S. spy satellites found a giant hole in the ground

it looked a lot like a future home for a nuclear reprocessing
plant, a place for the North Koreans to revive their frozen nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the North Koreans have finally
agreed to allow American inspectors to visit the site regularly. In
return they got what they need the most: a promise of continuing
food aid, and an agreement to help teach the country how to plant
potatoes. It may be the first ever spuds-for-nukes deal.

   Often, the most intense sports dramas in this sports-mad nation
involve heated disputes among mature adults about whether some ball
or body part landed a smidgen this or that side of the line. Who
can forget the touchdown-that-wasn't in the December Jets-Seahawks
game?
</P>
<P>
   Well, once again, technology will try to dispense perfect
justice. The much-quibbled-over instant replay, banished in 1992,
partly because it slowed games so much, is back _ for a one-year
trial. This time, coaches must call for it sparingly _ just twice a
game, and only if the team has timeouts left. If a call is
overruled, the team keeps its replay credit. And if it's overtime
or the last two minutes of a half, a referee assistant glued to a
monitor can step in.

   North Korean Assent
</P>
<P>
   Last year U.S. spy satellites found a giant hole in the ground
in North Korea, dug by thousands of military troops. Problem was,
it looked a lot like a future home for a nuclear reprocessing
plant, a place for the North Koreans to revive their frozen nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiations, the North Koreans have finally
agreed to allow American inspectors to visit the site regularly. In
return they got what they need the most: a promise of continuing
food aid, and an agreement to help teach the country how to plant
potatoes. It may be the first ever spuds-for-nukes deal.

<P>
   Dear Parent or Guardian:
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on 987-65-4321's admission to Arizona State
University! We commend you for the significant role that you have
played in helping him to prepare for this exciting and critically
important time. A.S.U. is committed to providing an outstanding
collegiate experience, and we are pleased that he has chosen to
take advantage of this tremendous opportunity. We are fully
prepared to assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful transition
from high school to college.
</P>
<P>
   We also recognize that even though your relationship with
987-65-4321 may change in the next few years, the importance of
that relationship will not diminish. At Arizona State University,
we value your continued participation in his academic, social and
personal development and actively seek your support in that
endeavor. Whether through involvement in the A.S.U. Parents
Association, attendance at numerous events for A.S.U. parents, or
the occasional visit to campus, you will be a partner with the
university in encouraging 987-65-4321 to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   We look forward to seeing you at an orientation program and
during A.S.U. Welcome Week prior to the start of the fall semester.
Information about these programs has been mailed to 987-65-4321.
Many of the activities during both events are designed specifically
for you. In the meantime, contact the A.S.U. Parent Programs office
. . . if you have any questions or concerns.

   The father's reply:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Ms. Olson:
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for offering our son, 987-65-4321, or as we
affectionately refer to him around the house _ 987 _ a position in
the A.S.U. class of 2003. His mother, 123-45-6MOM and I are very
happy that such a prestigious institution of higher education such
as A.S.U. has extended this offer.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting a college for 987, we are looking for a place that
will prepare him for the technological challenges of the 21st
century. We seek a college in which he can learn to master
computers and learn to communicate with clarity and sensitivity. I
can only imagine the competence with which you will, as your letter
puts it so well, ``assist 987-65-4321 in making a successful
transition from high school to college.''
</P>
<P>
   We will miss 987 when he goes off to school, and are very
interested in a college in which he will receive personal
attention. I was particularly touched by your sentence in which you
note that our ``relationship with 987-65-4321 may change in the
next few years.'' This is certainly true. Already we are beginning
to focus as well on his brother, 123-45-6BRO.
</P>
<P>
   I look forward to additional communications from your office.
You manage to convey more in your letters that any other college we
have seen thus far. And believe me, we are still looking.

LATIN AMERICA'S CONTAGION: WHERE TAXES AREN'T SO CERTAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ As the year began, the Ecuadorean government
was nearing bankruptcy, unable to pay teachers, doctors and other
public employees or to repair $2.6 billion in damage inflicted by
El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of global economic contagion? Not directly. It
reflected a much older, if related, problem in Latin America _ tax
evasion. Here it had become so bad that the Ecuadorean Congress
took a truly unorthodox step: It abolished the income tax
altogether in favor of a 1 percent tax on financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's move was ``an act of extraordinary desperation and an
admission of defeat,'' as one U.S. aid official put it last week.
In effect, it wrote off the 60 percent or more of taxpayers here
who are thought to be dodging their obligations, in hopes that the
new tax would be easier to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Americans grumbling over their 1040 returns this month might be
envious. But there is a sobering context: Governments all over
Latin America are coming under pressure from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders to cut their yawning budget
deficits and open their economies to the outside world to prevent
the spread of the financial slump that has humbled Southeast Asia
and crippled Russia (a country with severe tax collection problems
of its own).
</P>
<P>
   Latin America may yet prove particularly vulnerable to this
contagion because development and growth are already crippled by
the inability to collect taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any more vital issue in Latin America
right now,'' said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based policy analysis group Inter-American Dialogue.
``It's a vicious cycle that is very, very hard to break. People
don't want to pay taxes because they say government doesn't deliver
services, but government institutions aren't going to perform any
better until they have resources, which they obtain when people pay
their taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the dimension of the problem is that Brazil,
Ecuador and other governments that have been forced to carry out a
``fiscal adjustment'' have preferred to emphasize spending cuts
over new ways to increase revenues. ``Since there is a culture of
noncompliance in the region,'' said Luisa Rains, an economist who
heads the fiscal division of the Inter-American Development Bank,
``you're going to run into resistance and affect various interest
groups any time you attempt a real tax modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   When Guatemala, another glaring example, signed a United
Nations-sponsored peace accord ending its civil war in 1996, it
promised to nearly double its tax revenues, to 12 percent of gross
domestic product. But the country has failed to comply, and
therefore is unable to adequately finance the education, health and
land reform programs the accord stipulates. A powerful coalition of
agricultural, industrial and financial groups is simply refusing to
pay up and has blocked all efforts at tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala, of course, is not the only Latin American country
famous for the gulf that separates the few who are rich from the
many who are poor, and sometimes governments tolerate tax evasion
because they are simply too weak to do otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, as in Mexico, or in Brazil and other military
dictatorships during the 1970s, they do so with political advantage
in mind. Newspapers and television stations, for instance, were
allowed to evade obligations with the understanding that their
debts would be called in if they published material that angered
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, many large Latin America companies simply hold onto
the income tax and social security payments they deduct from their
employees' paychecks. Bribery of tax inspectors, underdeclaration
of income and hiding ownership of property are other popular forms
of evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Leona Helmsley came out and said only little guys pay
taxes, she ended up with a jail term,'' Ms. Rains recalled. ``But
in any number of Latin American countries, tax codes do not even
treat the failure to pay taxes as a crime that requires you to
serve a jail sentence.'' Even when arrests are made, cases can drag
on for years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their inability or unwillingness to collect income
taxes, Latin American countries have traditionally relied on
measures such as the value-added tax, which runs as high as
Uruguay's 23 percent. But such forms of taxation are highly
regressive, placing a heavy burden on the poor and stoking their
resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be especially acute in this Andean nation of 12
million people, which is in the midst of its worst economic crisis
since the Great Depression. ``Nobody pays taxes,'' a longtime
diplomat here said. ``Those in a position to pay the most pay the
least, and then they cry the most.'' As a result, he continued,
``the poor say, `Why should we pay if the rich don't?'''
</P>
<P>
   The flat tax on financial transactions that Ecuador enacted last
January (and that resembles a measure approved by Brazil's Congress
last week), was supposed to curb the possibilities for evasion. But
once again, the citizenry demonstrated an exceptional ability to
find a way around paying up.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the new tax was imposed, local bank deposits dropped
16 percent. Canny depositors simply converted their sucres into
dollars and then spirited their money out of the country. That led
to a run on the local currency that saw its value drop by more than
40 percent in just a few weeks. So last week, President Jamil
Mahuad again gave up in desperation. He agreed to restore the
income tax, though without specifying how he intends to enforce
collection.

TWO DIFFERENT TYRANTS, VERY MUCH THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
 By ALISON SMALE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the West's halcyon days, spring 1991, when Saddam
Hussein had just been vanquished in the gulf war and Eastern Europe
had apparently jettisoned communism for good, few Americans had
even heard of the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was cultivating ethnic hatreds and threatening war,
but in a seemingly isolated corner of Europe known to few outsiders
and apparently of little concern to Washington. The Iraqi leader,
by contrast, had invaded a neighboring country and lobbed missiles
at Israel, and was found to have a scary near-ability to launch
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, an area of
undeniable strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first post-Cold War decade, however, the
challenges posed by the Iraqi and Serbian leaders appear remarkably
similar, at least in this: Both have become tactical experts at
cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its diplomatic
strategists, tying down its military and periodically daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Milosevic and Saddam seem almost to have been playing
tag team with the United States and its allies. A look back at the
1990s reveals some startling similarities in the ways they operate,
and in the ways the West seems to have missed opportunities to
weaken each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders are skilled autocrats, easily able to exploit the
inevitable differences that crop up in the coalitions, alliances or
international organizations that have tried to rein them in. When
it's convenient, each can count on support from Russia or China. At
home, each is adept at manipulating power and at turning foreign
embargoes, threats or bombing to his own advantage: Who, after all,
would publicly oppose a leader who paints himself as defender of a
victimized nation under foreign attack?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional seeming defeat inflicted from outside,
and the suffering of people in economies squeezed by embargoes and
by the control of these leaders and their cliques, neither man
seems in danger of being dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as that spring of 1991, before the old Yugoslavia
descended into war, demonstrators in Belgrade picked up on the
similarities, chanting ``Slobo-Saddam!'' to demonize their leader.
With the instinct born of the direct experience of repression, they
sensed that both men were master players of high-stakes poker,
prepared to use violence and even to gamble their very countries to
preserve their own power.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that the West, however, appears to have spent
little time understanding: that the key to the survival of
Milosevic and Saddam has been their intimate acquaintance with the
yearnings and frailties of their people (Milosevic has even won
several flawed but not entirely unfair elections).
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who is now president of what is left of Yugoslavia,
has retained power largely by stirring up crisis after crisis, then
uniting Serbs behind his alleged defense of their interests.
Long-term success is not required for his own survival _ he has,
for instance, lost the territories he mobilized Serbs to seize in
Croatia and Bosnia _ so long as the attention of his weary people
can be channeled elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with NATO threatening to bomb Serbia if Milosevic does
not allow the alliance to police his restive province of Kosovo, he
appears secure. Indeed, he retains the power to ignite a far
bloodier war in Kosovo and beyond, a power that commands the West's
attention. He can survive in his self-cast role as his people's
champion against the hostile, powerful outside world.
</P>
<P>
   So too Saddam. Saddam has lost some formal control over Iraq.
Foreign inspectors have probed his arsenals. The CIA has reportedly
tried to muster resistance inside Iraq. For more than two months,
foreign jets have regularly bombed targets inside the northern and
southern reaches of the country.
</P>
<P>
   These regions are home to the Kurdish minority and the Shiite
Muslim majority who oppose Saddam's Sunni Muslim minority, which
has traditionally ruled Iraq. Yet Saddam, whose security apparatus
is far larger and more ruthless than that of Milosevic, also seems
in no obvious danger of losing control. He retains large oil
reserves, and perhaps even an ability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, whose image entirely dominates public life in Iraq,
brooks so little opposition that dissent can be openly voiced only
abroad. America has been slow to engage the admittedly murky and
bitterly divided opposition groups. Belated attempts to do so have
yielded a new radio station, Radio Free Iraq, and a $97 million
Iraqi Liberation Act that so far has dispensed none of the materiel
it pledged to make available to opposition groups. Of the
opposition groups targeted to receive support, at least one
announced from its Tehran headquarters that it had no interest in
Washington's backing.
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, a number of parties that are now arrayed against
Milosevic sprang up largely as he was assuming power in the late
1980s. He has proven skilled at infiltration and at buying off
these rivals. The opposition is now so feckless that even its
members say they have little hope. Students or independent media
that do challenge Milosevic are weak and immediately feel a
repressive hand if they start to make an impact. They also lack any
significant foreign backing.
</P>
<P>
   Individual diplomats and outside groups have tried to support
what Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, has
called ``the other Serbia.'' But during mass demonstrations against
Milosevic that erupted in the winter of 1996, many Serbian students
wondered why the rest of Europe was ignoring their movement. It
was, they felt, as if they were being demonized along with their
leader. The few foreign envoys who do come to Serbia see Milosevic
and pay any others scant heed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. diplomacy say that by ignoring Serbs and Iraqis
who oppose Milosevic and Saddam the West has missed a chance to
advance democracy in the Balkans, where the Serbs traditionally
have played a vanguard role, and in the Middle East, where Iraq's
middle class was once among the most enlightened and educated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, unwittingly, Western policy has helped smash that
vibrant middle class in both countries. Official media drive home
the siege mentality, playing on the threat from outside to squelch
dissent. Tough sanctions have fostered rampant corruption, which
gnaws ever deeper into the moral fiber of societies weakened by
wars the leaders helped to launch.
</P>
<P>
   Emigration has added to the ruin. In both countries, a new
merchant class has sprung up, owing its wealth to smuggling. To ply
their illicit trade, these people must make at least a tacit pact
with their governments and are thus a crucial source of support for
Saddam and Milosevic. They help convey an illusion that the two
countries are still part of the modern world; despite the United
Nations' embargo, almost any consumer wares are available in
Baghdad, as they were in Belgrade when it was under sanctions from
1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iraqi countryside, the government reportedly gives seed,
land or machinery to traditionally respected rural leaders, who in
turn help ensure obedience. In rural Serbia, the source of most of
Milosevic's votes in elections, the leader and his Socialist Party
can use structures inherited from the old league of communists to
exercise similar control.
</P>
<P>
   Can anything now be done to turn the tide in Serbia, or Iraq? In
both countries, hopeful Clinton administration officials suggest
that the demise of Saddam and Milosevic is closer than either may
believe. If NATO does bomb Serbia, the Yugoslav army might turn
away from Milosevic. But even if he is then forced to accept NATO's
soldiers in Kosovo, he will remain in control of most of Serbia,
with all of its new resentments of the West. High-ranking foreign
visitors could invest in a different future by visiting Milosevic's
critics, as was routinely done, say, in Moscow under the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither country will change overnight. One journalist who has
lived in Belgrade all her life recently wrote to a friend about a
change she had seen in the last decade in how Serbs treat each
other. A woman tending flowers in a park had hurled an ax at the
journalist's dog, she wrote. Even after Milosevic goes, she
concluded, ``we will be left with all those semihumans'' that the
recent past has created.

TWO DIFFERENT TYRANTS, VERY MUCH THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl)  
 By ALISON SMALE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the West's halcyon days, spring 1991, when Saddam
Hussein had just been vanquished in the gulf war and Eastern Europe
had apparently jettisoned communism for good, few Americans had
even heard of the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was cultivating ethnic hatreds and threatening war,
but in a seemingly isolated corner of Europe known to few outsiders
and apparently of little concern to Washington. The Iraqi leader,
by contrast, had invaded a neighboring country and lobbed missiles
at Israel, and was found to have a scary near-ability to launch
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, an area of
undeniable strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first post-Cold War decade, however, the
challenges posed by the Iraqi and Serbian leaders appear remarkably
similar, at least in this: Both have become tactical experts at
cornering the world's only superpower, frustrating its diplomatic
strategists, tying down its military and periodically daring the
United States to use force to get its way. Each has laid bare the
lack of a Western strategy to deal with dictators who, simply by
continuing in power, further weaken the ability of their peoples to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Milosevic and Saddam seem almost to have been playing
tag team with the United States and its allies. A look back at the
1990s reveals some startling similarities in the ways they operate,
and in the ways the West seems to have missed opportunities to
weaken each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders are skilled autocrats, easily able to exploit the
inevitable differences that crop up in the coalitions, alliances or
international organizations that have tried to rein them in. When
it's convenient, each can count on support from Russia or China. At
home, each is adept at manipulating power and at turning foreign
embargoes, threats or bombing to his own advantage: Who, after all,
would publicly oppose a leader who paints himself as defender of a
victimized nation under foreign attack?
</P>

and the suffering of people in economies squeezed by embargoes and

EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT CHANGING WITH THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 (editors: text that should be italicized is marked with (BEGIN
ITALICS HERE) and (END ITALICS HERE)  
 (editors: in the book title, an asterisk should immediately follow
the word `Sex' and immediately precede the word `But'; in the

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1969, the California psychiatrist Dr. David Reuben published
a groundbreaking book with the improbable title ``Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering hundreds of blush-inducing questions about the most
basic of human relations (``What does impotence mean?'' ``What
happens during orgasm?''), it was a blockbuster primer for those
confronted by the polymorphous excesses of the Age of Aquarius.
Reuben was touted as ``the new apostle of sanity in sex'' and his
carnal Baedeker became a No. 1 best seller in 51 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades later, we live in a culture of AIDS, Viagra and
presidential oral sex discussed publicly in Congress. So on
Valentine's Day, HarperCollins released an updated edition of
Reuben's magnum opus (hereinafter referred to by its catchy
acronym, EYAWTKAS BWATA). The work is far from 99 44/100 percent
pure, but it is being billed as ``96.9 percent new.''
</P>
<P>
   Some idea of the revisions that Reuben has wrought in his pages,
and in his thinking, can be gleaned even by comparing some of the
tamer bits of his book's two editions (below). Not the least of the
eye-popping changes is the one in price, from $6.95 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In the original ``EYAWTKAS BWATA,'' Reuben
anticipated Dr. Ruth Westheimer's exhortation to ``Have good sex!''
by a dozen years:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The average person has not even begun to experience the range of
sexual gratification of which he is capable. Or as one patient
jokingly put it, ``Sexually, the surface hasn't even been scratched
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this book is to tell the reader what he wants to
know and what he needs to know to achieve the greatest possible
degree of sexual satisfaction. It is designed to answer questions
that have never been answered except in obscure medical books.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Thirty years later, Reuben has added this
disclaimer:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   PLEASE READ THIS!
</P>
<P>
   I am confident that you already know this but I would like to
emphasize it again.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING IN THIS BOOK IS MEDICAL ADVICE.
</P>
<P>
   It is educational and informative. I hope it will encourage you
to discuss any medical problem you might have with your trusted
personal physician. ... Since I can't see you or examine you
through the pages of this book, I couldn't begin to give you the
tiniest bit of medical diagnosis, advice or treatment. ...
</P>
<P>
   Don't try anything in this book without getting the advice of a
doctor you know and trust. Neither I nor my publisher assume any
responsibility for anything that may result from your failure to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)When ``EYAWTKAS BWATA'' was first published,
the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion was four years in the
future. Reuben graphically described the dangers of back-alley or
self-inflicted abortions that many women saw as their only
recourse:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a way to prevent all this terrible suffering?
</P>
<P>
   There should be. ... Because the guardians of public morals, few
of whom have ever been pregnant themselves, have decreed that
abortion is a sin, millions of women each year are sentenced to
terrible danger, crippling illness and financial ruin, and the
bungling, incompetent butchers are able to ply their trade. ... In
an era when man is transplanting organs, exploring distant planets,
and manipulating living molecular structures, it is incredible that
he is not allowed to control his own reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Yet 30 years later, with Roe vs. Wade a fact
of life, Reuben isn't exactly ecstatic over safer, more readily
available abortions:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``You sound like you're against it?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not against it and I'm not for it. Abortion is not something
that anyone takes lightly. Ask any woman who has had one. And ask
the doctors who have done them. It's a procedure that takes a
certain emotional toll on everyone involved, and it's really a
method of last resort. ... One of the most common complications of
abortion is depression and serious emotional problems in the woman
who is operated on. That's compounding the already physical stress
of the operation. A woman who faces _ right from the start _ the
harsh facts of abortion has a much better chance of coming through
it emotionally intact. An abortion usually takes an hour or so. But
the mental suffering can go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Perhaps no part of the original ``EYAWTKAS
BWATA'' was as controversial as Chapter 8, ``Male Homosexuality.''
With pronouncements like ``The majority of gay guys, when they
cruise, dispense with the courtship'' and ``Homosexuals thrive on
danger,'' it depicted homosexual life as unrelievedly bleak and
impersonal:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``But all homosexuals aren't like that, are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they are just like that. One of the main features
of homosexuality is promiscuity. It stands to reason. Homosexuals
are trying the impossible: solving the problem with only half the
pieces. They say they want gratification and love but they
eliminate, right from the start, the most obvious source of love
and gratification _ woman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In 1999, Reuben eschews such
characterizations. The word ``male'' is gone from the chapter
title. And he starts by observing:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality isn't what it used to be. Years ago it was simply
a set of Sexual Practices. Now it is tied in with human rights,
civil rights, political correctness, job rights, freedom of
expression, military service, sexual harassment and a lot of other
things. ... You may believe that homosexuality is good or you may
believe that it is bad. But as a physician and a scientist, I
cannot pass that kind of personal judgment. Therefore nothing in
this chapter should be _ or can be _ interpreted as being against
or in favor of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Pornography was originally broached in
Chapter 10, ``Sexual Perversion'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't pornography harmful?''
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to see how. Pornography simply represents
people as they really are, sexual organs and all. They are shown
doing what they really do: using these organs. Everybody has
genitals and everyone uses them, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In ``EYAWTKAS BWATA'' '99, the subject has
been moved to Chapter 5, ``Aphrodisiacs.'' The value-neutral term
``sexography'' is substituted for ``pornography,'' which now has
specific, negative connotations:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean you are in favor of pornography?''
</P>
<P>
   No. Personally, I hate pornography. ... ``Pornography'' isn't
men and women in all their charm and beauty _ either alone or
sharing the magic of sex with each other. Pornography is sickness.
... It's images of the sexual abuse of children, of sex with
animals, of people degrading and abusing other people with sex as
the alibi.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original ``Sexual Perversion'' chapter
included descriptions of obscene phone calls:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   How do men make a fetish out of a voice?
</P>
<P>
   ... This is the usual pattern: Late in the evening, the
telephone rings. When the woman answers, there is a moment of
silence, followed by an obscene monologue. Typically this consists
of descriptions of sexual intercourse, promises to engage in sexual
relations with the recipient of the call (promises that are never
fulfilled), and sometimes recitations of obscene words. The woman
must react emotionally _ otherwise the caller is disappointed,
hangs up and calls someone else. Most women give him what he is
after _ not sex, but shouting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Today, with some forms of phone sex having
gained a measure of acceptance, Reuben skips the subject entirely.
He introduces the hitherto undiscussed problem of ``plushiephilia''
_ an unnatural attachment to stuffed animals. Of its practitioners,
he notes, ``You may love those cute little critters, but they
literally LOVE them'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   What do you mean, ``literally LOVE them''?
</P>
<P>
   ... Listen to what Arnold says. He is an insurance executive,
and vice president of a big agency. He is 46 and unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big bunny, Ginnie, is really my best friend. She's so warm
and huggable. I just love to feel her fur against my bare skin. She
never rejects me, and when I've had a hard day at the office, she's
there to console me and make me forget all my problems. It's just
pure happiness _ perfect love.''

</P>
<P>
   The average person has not even begun to experience the range of
sexual gratification of which he is capable. Or as one patient
jokingly put it, ``Sexually, the surface hasn't even been scratched
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this book is to tell the reader what he wants to
know and what he needs to know to achieve the greatest possible
degree of sexual satisfaction. It is designed to answer questions
that have never been answered except in obscure medical books.
</P>
<P>
   (END ITALICS HERE)Thirty years later, Reuben has added this
disclaimer:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   PLEASE READ THIS!
</P>
<P>
   I am confident that you already know this but I would like to
emphasize it again.
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING IN THIS BOOK IS MEDICAL ADVICE.
</P>
<P>
   It is educational and informative. I hope it will encourage you
to discuss any medical problem you might have with your trusted
personal physician. ... Since I can't see you or examine you
through the pages of this book, I couldn't begin to give you the
tiniest bit of medical diagnosis, advice or treatment. ...
</P>
<P>
   Don't try anything in this book without getting the advice of a
doctor you know and trust. Neither I nor my publisher assume any
responsibility for anything that may result from your failure to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)When ``EYAWTKAS BWATA'' was first published,
the Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion was four years in the
future. Reuben graphically described the dangers of back-alley or
self-inflicted abortions that many women saw as their only
recourse:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a way to prevent all this terrible suffering?
</P>
<P>
   There should be. ... Because the guardians of public morals, few
of whom have ever been pregnant themselves, have decreed that
abortion is a sin, millions of women each year are sentenced to
terrible danger, crippling illness and financial ruin, and the
bungling, incompetent butchers are able to ply their trade. ... In
an era when man is transplanting organs, exploring distant planets,
and manipulating living molecular structures, it is incredible that
he is not allowed to control his own reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Yet 30 years later, with Roe vs. Wade a fact
of life, Reuben isn't exactly ecstatic over safer, more readily
available abortions:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``You sound like you're against it?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not against it and I'm not for it. Abortion is not something
that anyone takes lightly. Ask any woman who has had one. And ask
the doctors who have done them. It's a procedure that takes a
certain emotional toll on everyone involved, and it's really a
method of last resort. ... One of the most common complications of
abortion is depression and serious emotional problems in the woman
who is operated on. That's compounding the already physical stress
of the operation. A woman who faces _ right from the start _ the
harsh facts of abortion has a much better chance of coming through
it emotionally intact. An abortion usually takes an hour or so. But
the mental suffering can go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Perhaps no part of the original ``EYAWTKAS
BWATA'' was as controversial as Chapter 8, ``Male Homosexuality.''
With pronouncements like ``The majority of gay guys, when they
cruise, dispense with the courtship'' and ``Homosexuals thrive on
danger,'' it depicted homosexual life as unrelievedly bleak and
impersonal:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``But all homosexuals aren't like that, are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they are just like that. One of the main features
of homosexuality is promiscuity. It stands to reason. Homosexuals
are trying the impossible: solving the problem with only half the
pieces. They say they want gratification and love but they
eliminate, right from the start, the most obvious source of love
and gratification _ woman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In 1999, Reuben eschews such
characterizations. The word ``male'' is gone from the chapter
title. And he starts by observing:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality isn't what it used to be. Years ago it was simply
a set of Sexual Practices. Now it is tied in with human rights,
civil rights, political correctness, job rights, freedom of
expression, military service, sexual harassment and a lot of other
things. ... You may believe that homosexuality is good or you may
believe that it is bad. But as a physician and a scientist, I
cannot pass that kind of personal judgment. Therefore nothing in
this chapter should be _ or can be _ interpreted as being against
or in favor of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Pornography was originally broached in
Chapter 10, ``Sexual Perversion'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't pornography harmful?''
</P>
<P>
   It is very difficult to see how. Pornography simply represents
people as they really are, sexual organs and all. They are shown
doing what they really do: using these organs. Everybody has
genitals and everyone uses them, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)In ``EYAWTKAS BWATA'' '99, the subject has
been moved to Chapter 5, ``Aphrodisiacs.'' The value-neutral term
``sexography'' is substituted for ``pornography,'' which now has
specific, negative connotations:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean you are in favor of pornography?''
</P>
<P>
   No. Personally, I hate pornography. ... ``Pornography'' isn't
men and women in all their charm and beauty _ either alone or
sharing the magic of sex with each other. Pornography is sickness.
... It's images of the sexual abuse of children, of sex with
animals, of people degrading and abusing other people with sex as
the alibi.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The original ``Sexual Perversion'' chapter
included descriptions of obscene phone calls:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   How do men make a fetish out of a voice?
</P>
<P>
   ... This is the usual pattern: Late in the evening, the
telephone rings. When the woman answers, there is a moment of
silence, followed by an obscene monologue. Typically this consists
of descriptions of sexual intercourse, promises to engage in sexual
relations with the recipient of the call (promises that are never
fulfilled), and sometimes recitations of obscene words. The woman
must react emotionally _ otherwise the caller is disappointed,
hangs up and calls someone else. Most women give him what he is
after _ not sex, but shouting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Today, with some forms of phone sex having
gained a measure of acceptance, Reuben skips the subject entirely.
He introduces the hitherto undiscussed problem of ``plushiephilia''
_ an unnatural attachment to stuffed animals. Of its practitioners,
he notes, ``You may love those cute little critters, but they
literally LOVE them'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   What do you mean, ``literally LOVE them''?
</P>
<P>
   ... Listen to what Arnold says. He is an insurance executive,
and vice president of a big agency. He is 46 and unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big bunny, Ginnie, is really my best friend. She's so warm
and huggable. I just love to feel her fur against my bare skin. She
never rejects me, and when I've had a hard day at the office, she's
there to console me and make me forget all my problems. It's just
pure happiness _ perfect love.''

   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ It's 11 o'clock on Friday night in a
brightly lighted store on the Sunset Strip. Men and women with
expressions ranging from nonchalance to embarrassment are perusing
the merchandise: saucy lingerie, edible body powders and, behind a
translucent partition bearing the words ``Relax, It's Just Sex,''
hardcore videos and sex toys. Elsewhere, customers are sipping
lattes and looking over shelves of best-selling books, newspapers
and sexually explicit magazines.
</P>
<P>
   This is Hustler Hollywood, a 9,000-square-foot up-market sex
emporium. With its floor-to-ceiling windows and coffee bar, it
unashamedly pitches erotica. Opened last December, it is the
flagship of what its owner, Larry Flynt, hopes will be a nationwide
Hustler chain. Its sleek design, prominently displayed aromatic
candles and Kama Sutra massage oils are intended to appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   The name and its raunchy connotations may be a marketing gamble,
but Flynt said he never considered any other. ``Hustler signifies a
certain something to people, and that is rebellion,'' he said.
``People identify with this type of rebellion and associate the
same thing with the store, so it becomes sort of taboo or forbidden
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   And that forbidden fruit is brazenly marketed, from the vivid
red neon sign outside to Hustler mugs, Larry Flynt T-shirts and
stacks of Flynt's autobiography. When he opened a more conventional
adult store called ``Hustler Magazine Books and Gifts'' in
Cincinnati two years ago, he said, a quarter of the customers were
women.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the West Hollywood store, he wanted to create an
atmosphere different from the typical sex store, he said, ``more
comfortable for women, more like Barnes &AMP; Noble or Neiman Marcus.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the customers on a recent Friday night were women.
``I like the unisex aspect of it all,'' said Caroline Gomez, a
college student. The store was ``really tasteful,'' she said,
``which makes the products look appealing.'' She said she was
attracted to the store because of its controversial owner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hustler can become the chain envisioned by Flynt is not
clear. During the course of its day, from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m., the
store fluctuates from bustling to nearly dead. Still, Flynt said he
plans to open stores in Las Vegas and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ``I'm really very, very disappointed that I
didn't move into the retail business years ago, because I never
realized the marketing power of the Hustler name and logo.''

   &UR; ECHOES OF A NATIVE LAND: TWO CENTURIES OF A RUSSIAN VILLAGE &LR;  By
Serge Schmemann. Vintage, $15. A former Moscow bureau chief for The
New York Times visits his ancestral village, creating _ with the
help of the recollections of its long-suffering inhabitants _ a
miniature history of Russia in the 20th century. ```Echoes of a
Native Land' is that rare achievement: a Russian memoir that
subverts the conventions of the genre and tells us, in clear,
elegant and understated prose, that you can't go home again,''
Michael Ignatieff wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOWN THERE ON A VISIT &LR;  By Christopher Isherwood. University of
Minnesota, $15.95. In four tales set in Berlin, Greece, London and
California, the author of ``Berlin Stories'' explores the sexuality
and inner turmoil of four vastly different protagonists, from a
male prostitute to a German worker taken with the bohemian life.
``This excellent novel ... may be the best Christopher Isherwood
has written,'' Gerald Sykes wrote in the Book Review in 1962. ``Out
of his literary detachment, strengthened by mystical studies, has
come a deeply intelligent and quietly compelling story.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE MEMORIAL &LR;  ($15.95), which
tracks the falling apart of a British family after World War I.
Isherwood's ``concern is with a mood, a collective state of mind,
one which is perhaps more accurately named a state of nerves,''
Edith R. Mirrielees wrote in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FOOTNOTE: A CURIOUS HISTORY &LR;  By Anthony Grafton. Harvard
University, $14. A history professor digs up some surprising lore
as he traces the development of the footnote from ancient Greece to
Gibbon (a master of the genre) to its modern practitioners. The
result is ``a witty and characteristically erudite book,'' David
McKitterick wrote in 1997. ``The pages of `The Footnote' are
peppered with human folly.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GENTLE MADNESS: BIBLIOPHILES, BIBLIOMANES, AND THE ETERNAL
PASSION FOR BOOKS &LR;  By Nicholas A. Basbanes. Owl/Holt, $18.95. This
explores book collecting and those driven to pursue it, and
features a sweeping Who's Who of collectors, living and dead,
visionary and loony. ```A Gentle Madness' is an impressive
achievement in its compilation of vast information, as well as
instructive and interesting,'' Philip Kopper wrote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENDURING LOVE &LR;  By Ian McEwan. Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. A
chance encounter radically changes the lives of a married science
writer and a young man who develops an erotic religious fixation on
him. In 1998 the reviewer Sven Birkerts called this ``a vibrant and
unsettling'' novel that ``reminds us that normal behavior conceals
but does not banish unsavory truths.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RAPE OF NANKING: THE FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST OF WORLD WAR II &LR; 
By Iris Chang. Penguin, $14.95. In 1937, Japanese troops
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of citizens in Nanking, an act of
barbarism rarely spoken of (for different reasons) in both Japan
and China. ``Iris Chang, whose own grandparents were survivors,
recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage,'' Orville
Schell wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARNEY POLAN'S GAME: A NOVEL OF THE 1951 COLLEGE BASKETBALL
SCANDALS &LR;  By Charley Rosen. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. In this
fictional account of basketball's equivalent of the 1919 Black Sox
scandal, an idealistic sports columnist bears witness to the
corruption of the sport by gamblers and players who conspired to
fix games. ``Rosen's novel is a particularly American form of
tragedy, in which the characters do not have to fall from great
heights to fall from grace,'' Allen Barra wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CITY GAME: FROM THE GARDEN TO THE PLAYGROUNDS &LR;  By Pete
Axthelm. University of Nebraska, $12. This is both a chronicle of
the New York Knicks' 1969-70 championship season and a study of the
era's playground basketball culture, focusing on asphalt legends
like Herman ``Helicopter'' Knowings and Earl Manigault. ``The book
offers absorbing insights into the most unique and gripping of all
city sports,'' Rex Lardner wrote in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAESAR: LET THE DICE FLY &LR;  By Colleen McCullough. Avon, $16.50.
The author's fifth novel in her series on the fall of the Roman
Republic features the uprising of Gaul and Caesar's crossing of the
Rubicon, among other episodes. ``Such important events ... unfold
as excitingly as if the history were not yet written,'' Allen
Lincoln wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNFINISHED JOURNEY: TWENTY YEARS LATER &LR;  By Yehudi Menuhin.
Fromm, $19. In this revamped edition of his 1976 autobiography, the
renowned violinist, who died this month at the age of 82, holds
forth on his precocious musical education (he made his debut at 7)
and his long, eventful career. ``Menuhin is ... a giant above us
all when he talks about music,'' Peggy Constantine wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPENDING: A UTOPIAN DIVERTIMENTO &LR;  By Mary Gordon. Scribner,
$13. In this modern fairy tale, a middle-aged painter adopts a
sexually dynamic futures trader as her muse, prompting a struggle
between her artistic purity and the pleasures of the flesh (and the
wallet). ``Gordon is an honest and perceptive writer,'' Hilary
Mantel wrote last year.

NEUTRINOS GOT YOU MYSTIFIED? ASK MY GRANDMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To me, the mystery in the latest neutrino news (Don't you, too,
subscribe to ``Neutrinos Today''?) is why the monstrous telescope
searching for these ephemeral subatomic particles is named after my
niece, who, in turn, is named after my grandmother, Amanda. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe the telescope isn't exactly named after Amanda but
certainly they share the same name _ although I don't think my
niece's name is an acronym for Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector
Array (which has its own Web site at http:/amanda.berkeley.edu). If
anything, my niece's name is an acronym for A Mighty Amazing Niece
Deserving Accolades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But enough about her. If I carry on about her and her remarkable
luck of being able to living within walking distance of Wrigley
Field in Chicago, I'll never get around to why you should care
about the new search for the cosmic neutrino that AMANDA (I'll
capitalize the telescope to differentiate it from any of my
relatives) is working on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it would help if I first explained what neutrinos are.
They're nothing. Well, almost nothing. It was long thought that
neutrinos had no mass, but last year some researchers announced
that, in fact, they do have a little mass. That startled the
scientific world, which still is trying to figure out what, if
anything, it means. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The universe is flooded with these itsy-bitsy things, whatever
they are. In fact, it's estimated that at any point in time about
100 million neutrinos are penetrating your body as they zip in from
outer space. Traveling at (or darn close to) the speed of light,
they also pass right through Earth, undetected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's where AMANDA comes in. This novel astronomical telescope
has been assigned the duty of detecting cosmic neutrinos and their
source. How do you, in effect, hold a moonbeam in your hand? Well,
you begin with 422 glass orbs, each the size of a bowling ball.
Really. That's what AMANDA is mostly made of. They're called
photomultiplier tubes, and they're sunk several kilometers deep
into the ice at the South Pole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of which sort of makes you wonder how scientists dream up
this stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hoofensticker: ``Say, Dr. Tiliwocken, I've got an idea.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tiliwocken: ``What's that?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H: ``Let's string together 422 bowling ball-size glass
balls, bury them deep below the Antarctic ice and see if they'll
detect teeny-weeny things we can't possibly see.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T: ``Why, I think you're onto something! Let's do it! I'll
send an application to the government for a grant right away.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that if you waited around for a
scientific idea that made complete intuitive sense, you'd never do
any experiments. Science is, at its core, an enterprise that
regularly tests unreasonable ideas because the entire cosmos, if
not unreasonable, is at least something the human mind would not
have dreamed up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you or I had created the world, for instance, would we have
arranged for billions of weightless, chargeless, invisible
particles to flood the cosmos? No way. We'd get accused of what
Bill Clinton swears he didn't do _ inhaling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From what scientists can tell, this marauding army of neutrinos
is generated by such far out celestial entities as black holes,
supernovas, quasars, gamma ray bursts and neutron stars. And if
they can figure out where they came from they may get a better
handle on how the universe developed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As intriguing as this is, so far I understand almost none of
this AMANDA stuff. And my smart old Swedish grandmother, Amanda,
isn't around any more to help me. If my niece Amanda has a clue,
I'll get back to you. Or not. &QL;

 &HT;    In deflating economy, it pays to think small
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've done a great job this year. Congratulations! Your raise
will be 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you are lucky. One percent, lucky? It is, if deflation sets
in.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 21st century, a new world where wages and prices
go down even as the economy booms. For the millions of baby boomers
who learned to cope with the brutal price hikes of the 1970s and
the low-grade, but constant, inflation of the 1980s and 1990s, this
new deflationary environment may take some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier generations who survived the Great Depression of the
1930s knew what it felt like to have prices fall. During that
miserable decade, workers were thrilled if their wages merely held
steady. Throughout their lives, those Depression-influenced
Americans tended to pinch pennies and avoid debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic outlook of post-World War II generations was
shaped by the raging inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s, when
consumer prices were shooting up as much as 13 percent a year.
``Buy Now'' was a motto that made sense to consumers who feared the
price would only be higher later. Baby boomers typically tried to
buy the biggest house possible because they knew inflation would
increase the value of their property and diminish the relative
weight of the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Though Americans have spent decades complaining about inflation,
the truth is, inflation can be fun. It can justify the urge to
splurge at the mall or to remodel the kitchen. Business owners get
to report record increases in sales year after year. And workers
can feel proud of their annual raises.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation suits our national character. It means that next year,
everything will be bigger _ sales, profits, wages and real estate
prices. And in this country, bigger always seems better.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, many prices have been falling. The
government says that last year, the Consumer Price Index increased
only 1.6 percent. That figure probably will decline in the coming
year as products ranging from pork roasts to computer monitors get
cheaper. In February, wholesale prices fell 0.4 percent from last
year, according to the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   And now, manufacturers are predicting another round of
price-cutting. Last week, the National Association of Manufacturers
reported that 44.2 percent of 2,500 companies polled said the
prices of their final products are dropping. As a result, 43.2
percent of those polled expect growth of earnings to decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Why are prices falling? Because of greater productivity and
increasing global competition. Take clothing as an example. Instead
of going to a tailor for a handmade suit, today's consumers go to
huge retailers who can buy suits made with computerized equipment
and cheap, foreign labor. Better equipment, more competition and
bigger economies of scale will continue to bat down prices for
goods and foods.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, consumers will love these changes, which will
allow us to buy better-quality goods at lower prices. But how will
we feel when our home's value slides? Will investors remain as
enthusiastic about buying stocks when flat earnings are considered
good news? Will workers feel as confident about the future when
they go for years without a raise?
</P>
<P>
   With deflation, we'll have to remember that smaller profits,
declining homes prices and stagnant wages aren't signs of hard
times. Just very different times.

 &HT;    Jobs prove to be big anti-crime solution
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even in these times of high employment, with many
companies scrambling for workers, some people find it next to
impossible to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   In a metro area where the unemployment rate is less than 3
percent, and where even the convenience stores are bidding for
services, there are people who cannot get a job application.
</P>
<P>
   They include ex-convicts, older job applicants, certain disabled
people who have physical or mental problems, and young black males.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of those we euphemistically call ex-offenders, we
have a growing legion of people who have broken the law and face
tougher sentences for their wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But even as that group grows, many people who come out of
incarceration will not find the means to support themselves
legally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rules of probation require them to find jobs or
make a persuasive case they are either in school or actively
pursuing work.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuant to a new federal law called the Workforce Investment
Act of 1998, Georgia and the other states are assigned a new role _
to oversee new ways to employ or train people formerly imprisoned
or who have other problems that keep them out of the ordinary job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Thurmond, the state labor commissioner, is in charge of
putting together the Georgia program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to make the program local, and to make it deal
with the actual needs of Georgia companies and the actual training
programs that we have available here,'' said Thurmond, previously
in charge of programs in human resources to put welfare recipients
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important aspects of this program will be its
convenience, the fact that the job seeker can come to one place and
hear about employment opportunities and training in the same
place,'' Thurmond added.
</P>
<P>
   Where ex-prisoners are concerned, the obstacles are formidable,
and any help could be a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   A memorable piece in The Wall Street Journal on Feb. 19
chronicled a Korean Athletes Foot store owner in Chicago who hired
gang members and ex-offenders as his sales staff.
</P>
<P>
   As the story made plain, the business was helped by the fact the
sales people were talented and very much in touch with young, often
street-savvy customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the store owner and his staff was
intense, demanding and often troubled.
</P>
<P>
   It was also taxing on the ex-offenders, who had to deal with
huge measures of distrust and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, was that work helped people get back
on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my favorite statistical stories is that for young men
white and black, the crime rate is the same regardless of race, but
for jobless blacks the crime rate is astronomically higher,'' said
Thurmond.
</P>
<P>
   Parole officials say self-reported figures show unemployment for
people on their way to prison is about 65 percent, and for
ex-offenders in the parole system, it is 90 percent and more.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is elementary. In one way of thinking, jobs are a
powerful crime prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   It can work if agencies and businesses are more savvy in looking
for ways to create employment, instead of finding excuses for not
putting people to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take a new outlook and new skills for staff
people in the state government,'' said Thurmond, ``including a
willingness to look for potential in people, and help sell them to
industry as suitable employees.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A place to hang your troubles
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``I had a terrible day,'' a friend moaned to me.
</P>
<P>
   She then recited a litany of miserable mishaps and misadventures
that certainly justified her assessment. Any one of us could have
recalled a similar day from our own lives. I shook my head in
sympathy, but what she said next totally surprised me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided on the way home from work I could recount my lousy
day to my family and make all of us have a rotten evening,'' she
said, ``or I could let it go, not think about it, and enjoy that
time with the people I love.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what she did. They had a lovely dinner together and
then went out to a bookstore to browse contentedly.
</P>
<P>
   We have all heard the advice to leave our job at the office and
not take it home with us. As with all good advice, it's much easier
to say than do.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles we deal with from 8 to 5 are a significant part of
our lives, and whether we leave them at work or not, they have a
way of still being there the next morning when we unlock the office
door. Although they are a signficant part of our lives, they are
not the most important part of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   I have often wondered as our family sits around the dinner table
and we ask abour our sons' days, why they never ask about ours.
They seem to assume their days are worthy of notice, but that our
days are not. That's probably just normal teen-age self-absorption,
but it reminds me that as adults, we shouldn't have that same
self-absorption. In other words, leave it at work.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they don't ask because when they have, we've told them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's much in any person's day that is worth sharing. No
one can go through a day without some redeeming or uplifting
moment. Whether you note and remember it is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning as my husband and I sat reading the morning
paper, our youngest son tumbled out of bed, plopped on the couch
next to me and stretched hugely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh,'' he smiled sleepily. ``It's going to be a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious, and wanting to believe likewise, I asked him how he
knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds are singing. I love waking up to hear the birds
singing,'' he said happily, going off to get his cereal.
</P>
<P>
   Those same birds had been singing 30 minutes earlier when I
tumbled out of bed. Had I heard them? Had I chosen to believe they
were a harbinger of good things to come?
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the end of a very hard week at work, I saw a story
on the Internet that once again reminded me of an essential truth:
We cannot control what happens in our lives, but we can control how
we react to it.
</P>
<P>
   The story was about a carpenter who was hired to restore an old
farmhouse. On the carpenter's first day at work, everything went
wrong. At day's end, the carpenter sat in stony silence as the
farmhouse owner drove him home.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving, he watched the carpenter walk toward his front
door, pause briefly at a small tree and touch the tips of the
branches with both hands. When he opened the door, his countenance
underwent an amazing transformation. Smiles wreathed his face and
he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the carpenter walked the man back to his car. The
man asked him about the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's my trouble tree,'' the carpenter said. ``I know I
can't help having troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure.
Troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children.
So I just hang them on the tree every night when I come home. Then
in the morning, I pick them up again.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Funny thing is,'' he smiled, ``when I come out in
the morning to pick 'em up, there ain't nearly as many as I
remember hanging up the night before.''
</P>

 &HT;    The distraction of boys
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My eighth-graders are reading a novel about a
13-year-old boy who bumps into a dead body (literally) as he and
his best buddy are enjoying an unlawful midnight swim in the local
quarry. Decision time _ do the boys go to the police and report a
floater and get themselves into a peck of trouble with the law for
trespassing, as well as with their parents for not being safe in
bed where they're supposed to be?
</P>
<P>
   The boys make the obvious choice. They hightail it for home,
phone in an anonymous tip, and burrow under the blankets until the
stink blows off.
</P>
<P>
   My classes always enjoy this bit of fluff reading as a break
between Proficiency Tests and a particularly scintillating session
on dangling participles. (While walking up the stairs, the clock
struck midnight.) Being a schoolteacher, however, it is my duty to
spoil their fun with writing assignments designed to stimulate a
higher level of thought as so carefully measured on Mr.
Whatsisname's taxonomy of successful questioning (educanese for:
Don't ask dumb questions like, ``How many fireplugs did Spot visit
the day he followed Dick and Jane to school?'')
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the questions I asked were still too easy for
Rachel, one of my more accomplished young writers, because in
addition to composing a substantial essay on the psychological
difficulties of being 13, doing a water ballet with a stiff, and
waking up the next morning with a new zit (worst-case scenario),
she felt obliged to add the following conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I have found this book to be quite entertaining. I
especially enjoy that it is written from the viewpoint of an
eighth-grade boy since I am also in the eighth grade and have
always wondered how boys my age think or what goes on in their
heads (or rather if anything at all is going on up there. I do
wonder because they are extremely capable of displaying the actions
of complete stupidity ... and then they still have their bad days
too.)''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, even though she has more than fulfilled the
assignment, the essayist obviously becomes enamored of the topic
switch and her writing takes on a life of its own: ``Boys get such
a kick out of the dumbest things _ like at lunch when they take
their Fruitopia cans and stuff them into styrofoam vegetable cups
and then slam their hands on them causing them to make a really
loud noise. Girls hate it but the guys think it is so cool. Boys
are seriously stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   About here, the writer apparently becomes aware of her
digression and tries to tie the loosely related addendum to the
topic. ``Because Tyler and Lymie (the main characters) think like
boys, they make all of the wrong choices. My ignorant little
brother did the same thing when he created a relief map of
Australia on a piece of wood he found in the basement. It was a
social studies project and on the day he was supposed to take it to
school, he asked my dad for help getting it to the car. That's when
Dad discovered what my stupid brother had been doing down there. He
had built mountains and painted oceans on our new front door. My
dad was waiting for a warm day to put it up. It was a very
expensive door because it was an anniversary present for my mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping they'd kill the kid, but no such luck. He
just has to spend the entire summer working on the farm for two
dollars an hour until the door is paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Rachel earns an A, not only for the weight of her
content but the precision of her mechanics. And there's an
ingenuous P.S. addressed to me: ``Ms. Schuett, do they ever get any
better?''
</P>
<P>
   Intending to inspire, I scribble in the margin, ``They grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have known better. First period, Rachel bopped in with
a story she'd ripped out of this morning's paper. An inmate in the
county jail had attempted suicide by wrapping one end of a bed
sheet around his neck, tying a knot in the other end, and trying to
flush it down the toilet. Luckily a guard caught him before they
had to send for the Roto-Rooter man.
</P>
<P>
   Circled in red marker was the prisoner's age (20). In the
margin, Rachel had carefully printed: ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Schuett is a teacher and writer in Gibsonburg, Ohio.

 &HT;    The war of the handheld computers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came the Newton, a hand-held computer which was shaped
like a brick and weighed like one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Apple's Newton never took off, and neither did
the market for hand-held computers. It took a light, pocket-sized
competitor called the PalmPilot to ignite popular interest.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot has sold nearly 3 million units, and its success
awakened the giant in Redmond, Wash., known as Microsoft.
Microsoft's entry into the market has spawned scores of new
hand-held computers, powered by a light version of its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are plenty of models, and they come in all sizes,
colors and configurations. But don't be fooled. There's less
variety than meets the eye. Most hand-held computers are pretty
much alike. They track appointments, keep telephone numbers and let
you take notes. A growing number of hand-helds also let you send
and receive e-mail or browse the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The more-powerful models, which are also larger and heavier,
also let you write memos and create spreadsheets. Hand-helds range
in price from $199 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held market has become a smaller version of the one for
desktop and notebook computers. There are really only two choices:
hand-helds running Windows and the three PalmPilot models, which
use a unique operating system and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar, right? It's Microsoft leading a pack of clones
challenged by one upstart. There is, however, a key difference.
PalmPilot's parent, 3Com, has learned from Apple's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, 3Com designed its PalmPilots to work smoothly with
Windows-driven computers. It released the Palm OS, or operating
system, to all comers, generating a large choice of software for
users. There are some 3,000 titles to choose from today.
</P>
<P>
   In short, PalmPilot has clung to the underbelly of Microsoft
like a remora to a shark. The PalmPilot has fed off Windows'
success but avoided the powerful jaws of its host. At least so far.
</P>
<P>
   While largely similar, PalmPilot and Windows hand-held computers
do have some important differences. The biggest, of course, is the
operating system. That software controls the workings of any
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Most hand-held models now run Windows CE, a slimmed-down version
of the Windows operating system running on 90 percent of all
computers. You'll recognize the familiar Start button on the bottom
screen of any hand-held running Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Windows lets hand-helds run slimmer versions of
Microsoft's other ubiquitous software such as Word and Excel.
PalmPilot models cannot run Word or Excel, although there are other
software programs designed for them that perform the same word
processing and spreadsheet functions.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some hardware distinctions between Windows and
Palm hand-helds. Some of the Windows hand-helds, for example, let
you record simple voice messages. Philips' Nino is one example.
</P>
<P>
   And other, bigger models of Windows hand-helds include small
keyboards so you can write memos and crunch numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Windows CE hand-helds, such as the Nino, let you
record a simple message. Others, such as models by Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, let you write memos and create spreadsheets with
scaled-down versions of Microsoft Word and Excel. Your work can
then be seamlessly shipped onto a desktop or portable computer for
use.
</P>
<P>
   This, Microsoft executives argue, is the key advantage of
hand-held computers running their software. ``You're going Windows
to Windows,'' says Marty Paradise, general manager of Microsoft's
Atlanta-based Southeast District office. ``It's a seamless
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, adds Paradise, there'll be more and better software
for hand-helds running Windows CE because of the millions of
developers already writing for the Windows platform.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot executives, of course, dismiss this advantage. ``It
turns out that what's really important isn't matching operating
systems, but fast, error-free seamless synchronization,'' says E.
Michael Lunsford, a Palm senior product manager.
</P>
<P>
   And, so far, the market for hand-helds has not given the
advantage to hand-helds running Windows. There are three PalmPilots
in circulation for every one Windows CE counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful because we built, from the ground up, a
simple, straightforward, intuitive interface with an operating
system designed for the hand-held space,'' says Lunsford.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's early in the game. Especially for Microsoft,
which tends to gather steam in releasing better and more powerful
versions of its products over time.
</P>
<P>
   A simple test drive of a PalmPilot and a Philips Nino running
Windows shows the strengths and weaknesses of each platform.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot is clearly simpler and more portable. You can run
it without ever reading a manual. But the PalmPilot is not as
powerful as a Windows hand-held. These machines can do many more
things. But with power comes complexity. You definitely need to
read the manual with a Windows hand-held, especially if you're used
to a Mac.
</P>

   And, so far, the market for hand-helds has not given the
advantage to hand-helds running Windows. There are three PalmPilots
in circulation for every one Windows CE counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful because we built, from the ground up, a
simple, straightforward, intuitive interface with an operating
system designed for the hand-held space,'' says Lunsford.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's early in the game. Especially for Microsoft,
which tends to gather steam in releasing better and more powerful
versions of its products over time.
</P>
<P>
   A simple test drive of a PalmPilot and a Philips Nino running
Windows shows the strengths and weaknesses of each platform.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot is clearly simpler and more portable. You can run
it without ever reading a manual. But the PalmPilot is not as
powerful as a Windows hand-held. These machines can do many more
things. But with power comes complexity. You definitely need to
read the manual with a Windows hand-held, especially if you're used
to a Mac.

 &HT;    Eyes of the Nation a superb look at history
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new CD-ROM from SouthPeak International called ``The Library
of Congress: Eyes of the Nation'' is a splendid reminder that the
Smithsonian Institution is not this nation's only repository of
historical documents and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Made up entirely of material from the library, and put together
largely by curators and experts, it is a multifaceted and
compelling look at the history of the United States, from the
continent's discovery to the present decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is divided into five main sections, beginning with an
introductory look at the library's special collections, which is
essentially everything not available to anyone who just drops in at
the library. The main experience is called Eyes of the Nation,
which is a fairly long study of U.S. history written by historian
Alan Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   The American Experience breaks down history by topics:
entertainment, exploration and settlement, the African-American
experience, the Native American experience, the American woman,
arts, entertainment, government, war, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Library of Congress exhibits document five special exhibits on
such narrow topics as British satirical images of the American
Revolution and Rosie the Riveter.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth section is called Gateways to American Memory, and
features essays on four of the most significant graphic periods of
American history: daguerreotypes, the craze for hand-drawn,
bird's-eye-view maps of cities, the work of the Farm Security
Administration photographers and the collection of Detroit
Publishing Co. The latter was one of the biggest postcard
publishers in the nation, and judging from the images displayed
here, its archives are truly a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sections, with the exception of the American
Experience, are narrated very professionally, with appropriate
background music. The narrations are very interesting and not very
long, and when they have concluded the viewer can browse through
the images at will.
</P>
<P>
   The images, incidentally, are not limited to photographs. There
are fantastic antique maps, paintings, sketches and prints, sheet
music, posters, cartoons, and documents. Each can be enlarged to
nearly full screen; some of the more interesting ones can be
enlarged in a zoom mode through which the viewer can manipulate a
box around the screen to see greater enlargement of sections.
</P>
<P>
   All images can be printed out. There is a built-in notepad, and
a means of putting together a portfolio and making a slide show.
Additionally, the whole CD is indexed. There are World Wide Web
hooks to more library information on nearly every general topic
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes of a Nation is the best-designed educational CD-ROM I've
encountered. Navigating through the disc is entirely intuitive and
smooth as silk.
</P>
<P>
   The CD offers a unique perspective on history, but more than
that, I believe, it reminds us of the splendor of the Library of
Congress, the world's largest library.
</P>
<P>
   It will make you want to camp on the library's doorstep and
spend every waking minute inside.
</P>
<P>
   While its $40 list price is a bit on the high side, I can find
only one problem with Eyes of the Nation. It's not long enough. One
can only hope for a DVD version.

 &HT;    Running too fast guarantees short life span
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up in the South during the days of four-wheeled
dinosaurs. The association I have for the word ``speed'' is shaped
by a two-lane highway outside of Arkadelphia, Ark., a road that
magically turned into an illegal and dangerous drag racing strip
around midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days of muscle cars. It all happened so long ago
that even the description of those cars won't mean a thing to most
kids growing up today. We had GTOs with three two-barrel
carburetors that sat atop a log manifold, on an engine with a
three-quarter race cam that gave it a strange loping sound ... like
KER KER KERPLUNKA.
</P>
<P>
   So when I think about a growing problem for computer buyers
today _ hopped-up processor chips that are forced to run at a speed
beyond the design specifications _ I understand how much and how
little has changed. It's still all about speed just for the sake of
going fast. But the new status symbols are computers, not fast
cars.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, we tortured engines to get the most out of them, even
though we knew that shortened their life span. The same thing
happens with hopped-up computer chips: They live a short but
exciting life.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the frightening news, though: Some manufacturers and
retailers hop up the chip before you buy it and don't tell you.
Some unsuspecting customers pay extra for a computer with a high
megahertz rating and are actually buying a slower chip that has
been hopped up. That's where the short life span comes into play.
That hopped-up chip may run fine for a while but _ because of the
stress _ it ought to have a tattoo on it that says ``Born to Die.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand why Intel is worried about these hot-rod chips,
we'll have to talk about that mysterious megahertz rating, and
along the way, you'll learn something you probably didn't know. The
speed of a processor is determined by an oscillator that vibrates
electronically at a set frequency. It is called the ``clock'' for
the chip. Think of it as the pace car that determines how fast the
chip will run.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what newcomers to computing might not understand: Did you
know that a Pentium II running at 300 megahertz is identical inside
to a Pentium II running at, say, 450 megahertz? When I say
identical, I mean precisely that. That 300-megahertz chip comes off
the same production line as the 450-megahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens at Intel and other chip manufacturers: In a
process that any grocery store meat manager will recognize, the
best chips are clocked at the highest speeds and sold for a premium
price. It's just like selecting the best cuts of meat and labeling
them prime. The chips that didn't turn out quite as good are
clocked at lower speeds and sold for less.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer hobbyists have understood this clocking system for
years. And they've taken advantage of it to home-brew computers
that run faster, simply by changing a few settings on the
motherboard of the computer. Intel is not bothered by that at all.
After all, these folks have every right to trade longevity for
speed in their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   But what's scaring Intel these days is that some retailers and
manufacturers are overclocking chips and selling the machines at a
higher price without telling the buyer. In fact, Intel has warned
consumers about the problem and has even created a small program
that can be downloaded by the Intel Web site (http://www.intel.com)
that checks Pentium III chips for overclocking. That program won't
detect overclocking on earlier models of chips, including the
Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a way to protect yourself from overclocked
chips. Even Intel acknowledges that the problem is limited to
small, no-name manufacturers and retailers. So if you're worried
that you might be sold a hot rod of a computer that won't last,
then you can buy with safety from the brand-name companies.

 &HT;    NETWATCHER: MP3 sites are way cool, but don't tell anybody
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 2 o'clock in the morning. Armed with two 20-ounce
bottles of Diet Coke and a bag of Doritos, I am ready to surf the
Web. I'm not looking for portals, the closing figure of the Hong
Kong stock exchange or a new pair of jeans. I'm not looking for a
community, local news or a way to make my busy life more
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for MP3 files, free music I can download and play on
my computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, downloading MP3 files, uploading MP3 files and pretty much
doing anything with MP3 files is illegal. Maybe that's why I'm
doing it at 2 in the morning. I won't even park my car illegally,
even if it's only to run into Starbucks for a tall latte. So, I
feel vaguely guilty doing this, half expecting Joe Friday to bust
into my den flashing a badge, read me my rights and confiscate my
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not advocating anyone else do it, either. But
downloading MP3 files is a big trend now, especially among
students. I tried it myself to see what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 stands for motion-picture-experts group, Audio Level 3,
which probably explains why they shortened it to a few letters. MP3
technology is a compact way to store CD-quality music and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   What it really means is music. All kinds of music, from Madonna
to your friendly garage band playing nightly at the local bar.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the time and the right tools, you too can have the
keys to the Web's musical candy store. If you really want to get
into it, check out MP3.com (http://www.mp3.com), which offers a
beginner's guide, including what's needed to play MP3 files, a
frequently asked questions list and a few files to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   The idea ordinary folks can download music from any of the
zillion MP3 sites on the Web has the recording industry in a tizzy
trying to figure out how to make money from the estimated 10
million to 15 million people downloading music to MP3 players.
(After sex sites, the most popular sites on the Web are MP3 sites
offering downloadable files.)
</P>
<P>
   Dean Kay, president and CEO of Lichelle Music Co. and
co-chairman of music publisher ASCAP's New Technologies Committee,
calls the Web's MP3 craze a counterculture phenomenon. He says the
majority of MP3 junkies are college kids using the extensive
resources of their university computing centers to trade music with
fellow music lovers and Web geeks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 is about rebellion,'' Kay says. ``There's a subversive
nature to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like Lycos, SavvySearch (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .savvysearch.com) and who knows how many others offer search
engines that will help you find which MP3 files are located on
which Web sites. Users of some versions of Netscape's browser can
tap the What's Related button on the far right of the toolbar to
find even more MP3 sites.
</P>
<P>
   A simple search for Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bruce
Springsteen came up with seven pages of MP3 files, including rare
and bootleg tracks Springsteen fans are constantly searching for.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out the
recording industry is not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are like Rykodisc (http://www.rykodisc
</P>
<P>
   .com), which lets you download MP3 files for 99 cents a pop. But
the majority of music is still free _ until the record companies or
someone else catches up with the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kay says many MP3 sites don't stay up long because the Recording
Industry of America finds them and shuts them down. So, if you are
looking for a live version of your favorite song by your favorite
artist, you may find yourself traveling down one blind alley after
another, as MP3 sites appear and disappear as RIAA, ASCAP and
others ferret them out and shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   But the looking is half the fun, even if it leads nowhere. Kay
is right: MP3 junkies are a subversive lot, willing to spend hours
surfing the Web into the wee hours of the night to find that one
rare track or the latest hits from the biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's illegal, but so is buying bootleg CDs at record fairs
or from some guy named Vinnie who's set up shop on eBay or in any
of a million music-related newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are tired of listening to veteran Web surfers yammer
on and on about the good old days of the Web when you never knew
exactly what you were going to find when you fired up your browser,
might want to spend an hour or so in the online world of MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive lists are hard to find, and many of the download
sites you can locate will turn you away because there are too many
people downloading files at one time. Others simply don't exist
anymore, having been caught in the act by recording industry types
wanting to protect the rights of the session musicians and
songwriters who don't earn a dime from MP3.
</P>
<P>
   What the superstars like Garth Brooks or Madonna get is free
promotion, which leads to ticket sales, CD sales and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Some MP3 sites are legal, some aren't. Let your conscience be
your guide. Sooner or later the record companies will find a way to
make MP3 legal and profitable, but in the meantime, it's all out
there on the Web. Check out this little subversive nook while you
still can. But don't say who told you.

 &HT;    NETWATCHER: MP3 sites are way cool, but don't tell anybody
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 2 o'clock in the morning. Armed with two 20-ounce
bottles of Diet Coke and a bag of Doritos, I am ready to surf the
Web. I'm not looking for portals, the closing figure of the Hong
Kong stock exchange or a new pair of jeans. I'm not looking for a
community, local news or a way to make my busy life more
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for MP3 files, free music I can download and play on
my computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, downloading MP3 files, uploading MP3 files and pretty much
doing anything with MP3 files is illegal. Maybe that's why I'm
doing it at 2 in the morning. I won't even park my car illegally,
even if it's only to run into Starbucks for a tall latte. So, I
feel vaguely guilty doing this, half expecting Joe Friday to bust
into my den flashing a badge, read me my rights and confiscate my
hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not advocating anyone else do it, either. But
downloading MP3 files is a big trend now, especially among
students. I tried it myself to see what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 stands for motion-picture-experts group, Audio Level 3,
which probably explains why they shortened it to a few letters. MP3
technology is a compact way to store CD-quality music and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   What it really means is music. All kinds of music, from Madonna
to your friendly garage band playing nightly at the local bar.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the time and the right tools, you too can have the
keys to the Web's musical candy store. If you really want to get
into it, check out MP3.com (http://www.mp3.com), which offers a
beginner's guide, including what's needed to play MP3 files, a
frequently asked questions list and a few files to get you started.
</P>
<P>
   The idea ordinary folks can download music from any of the
zillion MP3 sites on the Web has the recording industry in a tizzy
trying to figure out how to make money from the estimated 10
million to 15 million people downloading music to MP3 players.
(After sex sites, the most popular sites on the Web are MP3 sites
offering downloadable files.)
</P>
<P>
   Dean Kay, president and CEO of Lichelle Music Co. and
co-chairman of music publisher ASCAP's New Technologies Committee,
calls the Web's MP3 craze a counterculture phenomenon. He says the
majority of MP3 junkies are college kids using the extensive
resources of their university computing centers to trade music with
fellow music lovers and Web geeks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 is about rebellion,'' Kay says. ``There's a subversive
nature to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites like Lycos, SavvySearch (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .savvysearch.com) and who knows how many others offer search
engines that will help you find which MP3 files are located on
which Web sites. Users of some versions of Netscape's browser can
tap the What's Related button on the far right of the toolbar to
find even more MP3 sites.
</P>
<P>
   A simple search for Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bruce
Springsteen came up with seven pages of MP3 files, including rare
and bootleg tracks Springsteen fans are constantly searching for.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out the
recording industry is not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are like Rykodisc (http://www.rykodisc
</P>
<P>
   .com), which lets you download MP3 files for 99 cents a pop. But
the majority of music is still free _ until the record companies or
someone else catches up with the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kay says many MP3 sites don't stay up long because the Recording
Industry of America finds them and shuts them down. So, if you are
looking for a live version of your favorite song by your favorite
artist, you may find yourself traveling down one blind alley after
another, as MP3 sites appear and disappear as RIAA, ASCAP and
others ferret them out and shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   But the looking is half the fun, even if it leads nowhere. Kay
is right: MP3 junkies are a subversive lot, willing to spend hours
surfing the Web into the wee hours of the night to find that one
rare track or the latest hits from the biggest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's illegal, but so is buying bootleg CDs at record fairs
or from some guy named Vinnie who's set up shop on eBay or in any
of a million music-related newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are tired of listening to veteran Web surfers yammer
on and on about the good old days of the Web when you never knew
exactly what you were going to find when you fired up your browser,
might want to spend an hour or so in the online world of MP3.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive lists are hard to find, and many of the download
sites you can locate will turn you away because there are too many
people downloading files at one time. Others simply don't exist
anymore, having been caught in the act by recording industry types
wanting to protect the rights of the session musicians and
songwriters who don't earn a dime from MP3.
</P>
<P>
   What the superstars like Garth Brooks or Madonna get is free
promotion, which leads to ticket sales, CD sales and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Some MP3 sites are legal, some aren't. Let your conscience be
your guide. Sooner or later the record companies will find a way to
make MP3 legal and profitable, but in the meantime, it's all out
there on the Web. Check out this little subversive nook while you
still can. But don't say who told you.

 &HT;    Nose around for free allergy advice
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That computer of yours is nothing to sneeze at. But if you're
like most Americans, you'll soon be sneezing _ to one degree or
another _ at almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is pollen of various kinds and, in this part of the
country, the pollen season is almost upon us. All the beautiful
Atlanta plants and trees and grasses will conspire against you _
irritating your sinuses while they delight your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There is help to be found for allergies on the Web. The best
place to start our medicinal visit to the Internet is to a plain
Jane site called Pollen Allergy at
http://www.hoptechno.com/book46.htm.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of multimedia and video clips, this page looks
downright old-fashioned. It's simply text. But the text is from the
National Institutes of Health, and is one of the clearest
explanations you're likely to find for the reason that your eyes
may soon be bloodshot and your nose itchy and prone to sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   This is really a comprehensive site that gives you both the
theory of allergies in words that a layman can understand as well
as practical ways to avoid pollen as much as possible and the
medical treatments available for those who can't avoid being
outside during the peak pollen season.
</P>
<P>
   Let's travel from there to another rather plain page called
Patricia Wrean's Asthma and Allergy WWW Resources page at
http://www.cco.caltech.edu
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)wrean/resources.html.
</P>
<P>
   While this page may not be a feast for the eyes, it lives up to
its name. It is a collection of links to the various allergy
resources on the Net. In fact, this page is so comprehensive you
can use it to find almost any allergy-related topic.
</P>
<P>
   The page is divided into sections that include, but aren't
limited to, asthma, medications, related diseases and medical
conditions, and general medical resources. Just find the topic that
interests you under one of these headings and click to be taken to
the page.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Atlanta-based Web sites are worth visiting when it
comes to allergy information. The Weather Channel site offers
allergy information _ mostly in the form of text and links to other
sites _ at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.weather.com/health
</P>
<P>
   /allergy1.html. While you're there, you can also check out
various maps, including one that tracks respiratory disease hot
spots in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Allergy Clinic has a site at http://www.atlallergy
</P>
<P>
   .com/ that offers some of the most useful information for local
sufferers. It has, at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .atlallergy.com/forms/pollen
</P>
<P>
   .asp, a daily chart that shows pollen levels and describes the
type of pollen that is most common. This is a real help, especially
if you already know what type of pollen causes you the most
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are familiar with how the Web and the Net work already
know the term FAQ. That's Net-talk for frequently asked questions.
You'll find FAQs for almost every topic, including one that
discusses Internet resources (not limited to the Web) about
allergies and asthma at http://www.cs.unc
</P>
<P>
   .edu/(tilde)kupstas/FAQ.html. Reading the material here can save
you a lot of searching and also serves as a good foundation of
knowledge for those who have an academic interest in allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of this page is an excellent collection of
links. You'll see quickly that there's no lack of information about
allergies. But despite all the help, most of the experts agree that
the best you can hope for is to control the symptoms, not
completely eliminate the allergy.

 &HT;    Software that turns a Mac into a PlayStation gets mixed reviews
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to Connectix. This Mac developer is always
pushing the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company designed a great emulator of Windows 95 for
the Mac, and now it's doing the same for Sony PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Called Connectix Virtual Game Station, this emulator software
lets Macs _ at least in theory &Cx1f;  _ run any computer CD game designed
for Sony PlayStation. The implication of this software is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Sony PlayStation ranks either No. 1 or No. 2 in the video
console market at any given time. There are literally hundreds of
game titles for the platform. In one swoop, Connectix has
quadrupled the number of games for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But does Virtual Game Station really work? The answer, based on
some initial reviews on the Web, is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers are reporting that not all PlayStation games will work
with Connectix's software. ``Resident Evil'' and ``Wing Commander
IV'' are two examples of games that do not work, according to some
reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some games run so slowly they're unplayable. One
example is ``Final Fantasy Tactics,'' which took one reviewer 100
hours to complete on a Mac with Virtual Game Station.
</P>
<P>
   You should also know that Virtual Game Station does not work
well, or at all, with Macs that predate the new G3 microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these drawbacks, Virtual Game Station is garnering some
strong reviews. For one thing, reviewers are saying it is
intuitively easy to use and set up.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some games play as well on a Mac as on a Sony
PlayStation. Two examples cited by reviewers were ``Metal Gear
Solid'' and ``NFL Blitz.'' These are graphically complex games
rendered in 3-D, yet they ran like a dream, according to reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers caution users not to buy any games for Virtual Game
Station at first but to rent them. That's because what works and
what doesn't work is so unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing is that Connectix is diligent about upgrading its
software. You can be sure Virtual Game Station will improve over
time. In fact, the company just released an upgrade on its Web site
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Game Station sells for about $50.

 &HT;    Informative book chronicles the state of virtual reality, the

 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for a fun but informative book about the
technology behind virtual reality, check out ``The Visionary
Position.'' It chronicles both the state of virtual reality and the
people behind it. The book is written by Fred Moody, who earlier
wrote the much-praised ``I Sing the Body Electronic,'' a book about
the internal workings of Microsoft. Published by Times Business,
``The Visionary Position'' retails for $27.50.
</P>
<P>
   You know computers have become mere commodities when companies
start giving them away. And that's exactly what is happening. Read
about how you might get one of these free PCs in the April issue of
PC Computing. Beware, though _ there are plenty of strings attached
to any free PC. Computers are given away primarily as a promotion
for another service, such as Internet access.

<P>
   ``The King and I'' is a talking book on a computer CD, designed
for kids ages 4-7. Publisher SoundSource claims, though, that this
is much more than an entertainment title. It says ``The King and
I'' teaches problem solving, planning and observation through
puzzles that are built into the talking story. ``The King and I,''
based on the classic tale of the same name, is available for both
PCs and Macs.

   Grolier Interactive has released the latest version of its
popular multimedia encyclopedia. It works with both PCs and Macs
and features a number of new things. Among them are full-screen
video, digital stereo music and 360-degree panoramas of famous
locations such as the Great Wall of China. The encyclopedia now
features 58,000 articles, 15,000 images, 1,200 maps and 163 videos.

I'' teaches problem solving, planning and observation through
puzzles that are built into the talking story. ``The King and I,''
based on the classic tale of the same name, is available for both
PCs and Macs.

 &HT;    `Rugrats' a fun way to teach use of PC
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Rugrats Adventure Game'' is a fun, interactive way to
introduce children to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the popular TV show and full-length feature film,
the ``Rugrats'' program is easy to use for kids with little or no
computer experience. Multilevel challenges keep the adventure fun
for kids of
</P>
<P>
   different ages and abilities.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 30 puzzles and games embedded in an entertaining
story, the adventure game is a hands-on method to help teach logic
and problem-solving to kids ages 6 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Johnson of southeast Atlanta, who is just learning to use
a computer, wasn't interested in the educational value of
``Rugrats''; he just wanted to have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is cool,'' said the 7-year-old computer novice, who
uses the program for hours at a time. ``I could do this all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats are a group of diaper-clad toddlers who talk and act
like babies in the presence of grown-ups, but when the adults are
gone, the babies talk and act like big kids and get into big
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on the characters and objects in their 3-D world,
Bobby uses the mouse to control the actions and words of Tommy,
Chuckie, Phil, Lil and Anglica, as he guides them through their
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to rescue Reptar, the toy dinosaur, from the
jaws of Hubert the Trash Monster, so that Reptar can save the
planet from alien invaders.
</P>
<P>
   At first, navigating the adventure was a little difficult for
Bobby. Sometimes he got stuck and frustrated. By himself, he
couldn't figure out what to do. But after a little instruction, he
learned that he could get help by clicking on one of the Rugrats.
After that, Bobby was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   One of the program's most useful features is ``game-save,''
which allows kids to stop the adventure at any point, then pick up
later where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``Rugrats'' was a big hit with Bobby, who said he was
going to stay with the program until he helped the babies save the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the bestest game I've ever played,'' Bobby said,
imitating the voice and baby talk of Tommy, the Rugrats' 1-year-old
leader.

 &HT;    Mercedes puts office on wheels
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can shave, sing, talk and sleep, but we really couldn't do a
whole lot of work in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the folks at IBM and DaimlerChrysler, a new gadget
promises to turn the car into a rolling office. This week, the
recently merged international automaker announced an optional
feature in the Mercedes-Benz V-Class multipurpose vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Console creates an ``office on wheels'' designed to
enhance productivity and convenience for business people who spend
much of their day in cars, such as sales agents. The console
includes a desk, IBM ThinkPad Notebook computer with
voice-recognition software, printer, telephone, fax and high-speed
modem.
</P>
<P>
   The console will let drivers send and retrieve e-mail, documents
and calendar items. A passenger will be able to use the equipment
while someone is driving, even when the vehicle is going through
tunnels, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer equipment can be taken out of the vehicle and used
at home or in the next V-Class vehicle, if the first one is sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology potentially could actually add a little joy
to the family road trip.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it based perceived customer interest on
consumer studies that show drivers and passengers are interested in
saving time; the ability to do work conveniently and easily from a
vehicle; the ability to navigate; the ability to track vehicle wear
and tear; and the availability of games and other entertainment
over the Internet during trips.
</P>
<P>
   GM goes online
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, the granddaddy of the automakers, has stepped
onto the Internet retail sales floor.
</P>
<P>
   GM unveiled its online shopping site, GM BuyPower, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .gmbuypower.com.
</P>
<P>
   More than 73 percent of GM's 7,800 dealers are enrolled in the
program. The Web site gives users information about each vehicle
made by GM; access to dealer new-vehicle inventory; the ability to
apply online for GMAC financing; and a place to send e-mail to the
GM BuyPower dealer you choose to get price quotes.
</P>
<P>
   GM BuyPower debuted as a pilot service in four Western states in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The site gives consumers access to the inventories of about
6,000 GM dealers nationwide. GM said its site is the only one that
lets consumers locate the exact vehicle they want and find out
detailed information via the vehicle identification number, or VIN.
</P>
<P>
   The site automates the car- or truck-buying process.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can print a customized brochure, schedule a test
drive, ask a dealer to hold or locate a vehicle, or get a price
quote. Once a consumer has picked the car or truck, including the
options and color, he or she can go to the dealership to fill out
the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Faster laptops
</P>
<P>
   Compaq this month started selling what it calls the consumer
market's fastest Internet notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq Presario 1675, 1670 and 1270 have 380-megahertz and
350-megahertz processors. The new models also have matrix display
screens and a 100-megahertz system bus architecture. A bus is a
data path. Compaq said the 100-MHz bus makes for a faster overall
system and enhanced audio, video and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The notebooks are designed to enhance Internet use. The ``easy
scroll'' feature, located near the touchpad, lets users scan Web
pages and documents. The notebooks also feature Compaq's Internet
Zone, a cluster of four buttons that allows one-touch connections
to the Internet or the Web for searching, secure online shopping
and e-mail. Each Presario notebook comes with an integrated 56k ITU
V.90 modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1675, with a 14.1-inch display, carries an
estimated retail price of $2,399.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1670, with a 13.3-inch display, sells for an
estimated price of $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1270, geared for the mobile user or student, sells
for an estimated $1,699.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Buying slaves is wrong, right?
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a snap being ethical when right and wrong are clear, as too
many of our glib public scolds make out they usually are. But
puzzle this:
</P>
<P>
   Slavery has come back to southern Sudan with a literal
vengeance, a nasty spinoff from the civil war that has been
grinding away there since 1983. The Muslim north is trying to
suppress separatist guerrillas of the Christian and animist south,
a fight that intensified after the extremist Nationalist Islamic
Front took over the Khartoum government in 1989 and imposed severe
Muslim law nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's military and freelance slave traders make periodic
sweeps into the south, capturing civilians, especially young women
and children, to sell as field hands, personal servants and _ most
valued _ concubines.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a sure handle on how many have been sold. A southern
Catholic bishop estimated 3,000 were captured in the unusually busy
first six months of last year. Over the years, tens of thousands
have been enslaved. Slavery is one of the several terrorist horrors
by which Khartoum, rather than by set-piece battles, prefers to
prosecute its war. Starvation is another.
</P>
<P>
   The international response has been inconstant and mostly pro
forma, and in the absence of any truly promising effort to finagle
or force an end to the civil war, humanitarian organizations,
mostly Christian, have been raising funds and buying slaves into
freedom, at prices ranging from $50 to a few hundred, depending
upon market conditions and who's the better haggler.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Solidarity alone has freed nearly 6,000 in the past
four years. Kids at a school in Colorado, bless them, raised an
awesome $50,000 to free Sudanese slaves. One can only honor the
impulse and the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But is that the right thing to do? How can it not be? Mustn't a
life be redeemed from misery if it can be?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but then UNICEF, the estimable U.N. children's fund, has
doubts, bordering on opposition. One spokeswoman went as far as to
call the buy-backs ``intolerable.'' Human Rights Watch also is
uneasy. The group's advocacy director says the practice creates a
``real danger of fueling a market in human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, although Sudan's government is by far the greater
offender, southerners are entering the trade as a straight profit
deal. Buy-back groups can't be sure people aren't being enslaved
just so they can be sold to humanitarians bearing cash. Too, some
freed slaves have been returned home only to be recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure way to stop all this, as UNICEF and others
emphasize, is by a committed international effort to end the war,
which probably means forcing a partition of Sudan. We all have an
obligation to set up a clamor for that. Meantime, and with such a
commitment by no means certain, what's the right thing to do?
</P>
<P>
   I lean against the buy-backs, as risking more harm than good,
but I lean that way uncomfortably and with honor for those acting
forthrightly for the enslaved. Sometimes good can be attempted only
in a Hell of ambiguities.

 &HT;    Internet moving toward diversity
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet's ability to turn people into voices without faces
makes it hard to see that the Net is becoming more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study by Forrester Research Inc., minorities
are getting onto the Internet at an enormously increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Cambridge, Mass., research company points to
factors such as cheaper home computers and increased Internet
access in schools as reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The company found that online penetration is heaviest among
Asian Americans with 64 percent. For African American and Hispanic
American households, the news is in the growth.
</P>
<P>
   African American access to the Internet _ whether it be at home,
school or work _ will rise 42 percent this year. That means 40
percent of African American households will be online.
</P>
<P>
   A 20 percent increase for Hispanic Americans this year will mean
43 percent will be online.
</P>
<P>
   That is compared to an average of 44 percent of households
online next year for all groups.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester researcher Ekaterina Walsh headed the survey of 96,000
households.
</P>
<P>
   She said the survey found Asian Americans and African Americans
had a high rate of technology optimism, even higher than Anglo
Americans, many of whom have had the Internet available to them
more readily because of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have people who are highly educated and very rich, but
who are very skeptical about technology,'' she said. For some
younger minorities, ``there's a greater chance that they'll embrace
a new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   While nobody is claiming that widespread adoption of the
Internet by minority groups is going to wave a magic wand that will
make sure we all just get along, the survey's results are promising
for the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increasing numbers of minorities on the Web,
Forrester says a technological gap _ one that separates those who
can afford the cost of Net access and those who can't _ still
exists. But after 2003, the company predicts, that gap will begin
to close as lower-income groups find ways of using the Internet and
the Net itself becomes ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   The Web, which started off on the promise of becoming a global
community, has become heavily English-based and has generally
lacked a true mix of cultural viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   As more members of minority communities arrive, the Internet
will bloom with richer, more diverse discourses and many more
specialized electronic resources for groups that haven't had them
before.
</P>
<P>
   And for the people who use the Internet, the near-limitless
freedom of communication and the economic opportunities the
Internet has opened up may become the ultimate tools for
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   A factor contributing to the increasing number of minorities
online is the U.S. government's authorization of almost $2 billion
to give low-cost Internet access to schools and libraries, with
priority going to lower-income and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from annual subsidies that can be used to defer
the cost of Internet service and wiring. The so-called education
rate, or E-rate, is paid for by telecommunication companies that
pass the fees along to customers in cellular phone and
long-distance bills.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in prices for personal computers and for Internet
access has also played a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research is quick to point out that the survey has
less to do with race than it does to factors often linked to
minority status _ income, education and optimism about technology.
</P>
<P>
   When income and education are no longer a barrier to access _
lower-income schools have begun to receive help from the government
to provide access and now some of the cheapest home computers cost
less than $500 _ the migration to the Internet becomes an issue of
how ready a group is to adopt technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, for all its hype, has not yet become a tool for
equality. But when people of any ethnic background, any income and
social strata can easily buy and sell online, find employment on
the Web and communicate globally though the Internet, another step
toward equality will be taken.

rate, or E-rate, is paid for by telecommunication companies that
pass the fees along to customers in cellular phone and
long-distance bills.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in prices for personal computers and for Internet
access has also played a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research is quick to point out that the survey has
less to do with race than it does to factors often linked to
minority status _ income, education and optimism about technology.
</P>
<P>
   When income and education are no longer a barrier to access _
lower-income schools have begun to receive help from the government
to provide access and now some of the cheapest home computers cost
less than $500 _ the migration to the Internet becomes an issue of
how ready a group is to adopt technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, for all its hype, has not yet become a tool for
equality. But when people of any ethnic background, any income and
social strata can easily buy and sell online, find employment on
the Web and communicate globally though the Internet, another step
toward equality will be taken.

 &HT;    Mercedes puts office on wheels
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can shave, sing, talk and sleep, but we really couldn't do a
whole lot of work in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the folks at IBM and DaimlerChrysler, a new gadget
promises to turn the car into a rolling office. This week, the
recently merged international automaker announced an optional
feature in the Mercedes-Benz V-Class multipurpose vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Console creates an ``office on wheels'' designed to
enhance productivity and convenience for business people who spend
much of their day in cars, such as sales agents. The console
includes a desk, IBM ThinkPad Notebook computer with
voice-recognition software, printer, telephone, fax and high-speed
modem.
</P>
<P>
   The console will let drivers send and retrieve e-mail, documents
and calendar items. A passenger will be able to use the equipment
while someone is driving, even when the vehicle is going through
tunnels, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
   The computer equipment can be taken out of the vehicle and used
at home or in the next V-Class vehicle, if the first one is sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology potentially could actually add a little joy
to the family road trip.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler said it based perceived customer interest on
consumer studies that show drivers and passengers are interested in
saving time; the ability to do work conveniently and easily from a
vehicle; the ability to navigate; the ability to track vehicle wear
and tear; and the availability of games and other entertainment
over the Internet during trips.
</P>
<P>
   GM goes online
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, the granddaddy of the automakers, has stepped
onto the Internet retail sales floor.
</P>
<P>
   GM unveiled its online shopping site, GM BuyPower, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .gmbuypower.com.
</P>
<P>
   More than 73 percent of GM's 7,800 dealers are enrolled in the
program. The Web site gives users information about each vehicle
made by GM; access to dealer new-vehicle inventory; the ability to
apply online for GMAC financing; and a place to send e-mail to the
GM BuyPower dealer you choose to get price quotes.
</P>
<P>
   GM BuyPower debuted as a pilot service in four Western states in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The site gives consumers access to the inventories of about
6,000 GM dealers nationwide. GM said its site is the only one that
lets consumers locate the exact vehicle they want and find out
detailed information via the vehicle identification number, or VIN.
</P>
<P>
   The site automates the car- or truck-buying process.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can print a customized brochure, schedule a test
drive, ask a dealer to hold or locate a vehicle, or get a price
quote. Once a consumer has picked the car or truck, including the
options and color, he or she can go to the dealership to fill out
the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Faster laptops
</P>
<P>
   Compaq this month started selling what it calls the consumer
market's fastest Internet notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq Presario 1675, 1670 and 1270 have 380-megahertz and
350-megahertz processors. The new models also have matrix display
screens and a 100-megahertz system bus architecture. A bus is a
data path. Compaq said the 100-MHz bus makes for a faster overall
system and enhanced audio, video and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The notebooks are designed to enhance Internet use. The ``easy
scroll'' feature, located near the touchpad, lets users scan Web
pages and documents. The notebooks also feature Compaq's Internet
Zone, a cluster of four buttons that allows one-touch connections
to the Internet or the Web for searching, secure online shopping
and e-mail. Each Presario notebook comes with an integrated 56k ITU
V.90 modem.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1675, with a 14.1-inch display, carries an
estimated retail price of $2,399.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1670, with a 13.3-inch display, sells for an
estimated price of $1,999.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario 1270, geared for the mobile user or student, sells
for an estimated $1,699.

 &HT;    Barbie: Has she come a long way, baby?
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The case is powerful, if largely
circumstantial: The triumph of Barbie reaching her 40th birthday
must mean something important. And a number of apparently serious
scholars are dedicated to figuring out just what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the triumph is unassailable. Barbie redefined babe when
she debuted in a market crowded with toddler dolls that waved,
whined or wet themselves. She may not have been every girl's ideal,
but she wasn't meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   She was every dad's ideal, and dad had two words for anyone who
suggested that a real woman built like Barbie would tip over: Jayne
Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this was 1959, a time when dads still ruled the roost
along with pretty much everything else. This was long before NOW.
Long before anyone imagined it might ever be illegal for a boss to
grunt ``hubba-hubba'' when his secretary sauntered by.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder Barbie, modeled after a German novelty doll
intended for men, was a hit back then. The wonder is that she still
is. Not only has Mattel sold more than a billion Barbies and Barbie
pals, it still sells two every second worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   American girls between 3 and 11 own an average of eight Barbies
each, and their appetite for more is evidenced by the regular
appearance of each new Barbie incarnation on the toy industry's top
10 list.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the most popular doll on the planet,'' said Kathleen
Lawrence, an associate professor of communications at the State
University of New York-Cortland who is on sabbatical while doing an
intensive Barbie study. ``That's a concern, a real issue for
feminists.''
</P>
<P>
   Their cause for concern is what Lawrence calls the stranglehold
that patriarchy still has on our society. Apparently, dad's still
in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbie embodies the idea that there is a purpose for women
that is, for the most part, wrapped up in being doll-like, being
plastic, looking a certain way, being limited to performing certain
tasks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who is three months older than Barbie, is not assuaged
by the manufacturer's attempts over the years to dress Barbie in
professional robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see Barbie as a dentist, but you don't see the work it
would take to get a dental degree,'' she says. ``Playing with
Barbie comes down to changing clothes. Girls get the message: All
it takes for me to change careers is to change my dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, director of the school's Center for Multicultural and
Gender Studies, is planning a Barbie book tentatively titled ``The
Good, The Bad, The Barbie.'' In the meantime, she's working on a
paper titled ``Intern Barbie,'' assessing the influence of Barbie
on Monica and Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   She's convinced most people accept the Barbie ideal of beauty
and that the fantasy can have a harmful effect on emotional or even
physical health.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd have the fat composition of someone 10 percent smaller
than an anorexic model if she were real,'' Lawrence says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Barbie is truly harmful in measurable ways is, at least,
debatable. Academic studies lean heavily on testimonials from women
who felt excluded, threatened, intimidated or angered by Barbie's
overwhelming blondeness. The notion that she is responsible for
anyone's bulimia or low SAT scores is hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   But there's little disagreement that she is an extraordinary
touchstone among under-50 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something the vast majority of students have used in
childhood to think through the construction of their own gender,''
says Marc Steinberg, assistant professor of sociology at Smith
College, a women's school in Massachusetts. ``It's not a passive
object.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg encourages students to study images of Barbie in
various roles and even to play Barbie dress-up. ``The idea is for
students to think about the ways that gender is not something
natural or given but, in fact, a social product,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of images to study. Barbie's transmutational
ability matches any creature from Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   She has been garbed in many roles, from cheerleader to doctor.
She's been reshaped several times toward a more realistic
waist-bust ratio. And, after decades of criticism from non-blondes,
Mattel now allows girls to dabble in genetic engineering by
specifying Barbie's eye color, hair color and one of four skin
colors ranging from pale to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are all the unofficial permutations, some of them
downright odd. Barbie's face has become the Campbell's Soup can of
today's pop artists. The Internet offers hundreds of altered
Barbies, aged Barbies, distorted Barbies. Some people even take
Barbie deconstruction literally; a group calling itself the Barbie
Liberation Organization claimed to have switched voice boxes with a
number of G.I. Joe dolls.
</P>
<P>
   These might seem like acts of Barb-arity, but Steinberg says
they are a symbolic revolt against male dominance. ``The image of
Barbie constricts what women can do in our society,'' he says. ``By
subverting that image, they can undermine the dominant ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   That sure sounds like a cue for a deep breath. Perhaps it's time
for a reminder that, after all, she's just a doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that all the time,'' says SUNY's Lawrence. ``Mostly
from male colleagues. If she's just a doll, why does everyone say
`she' instead of `it'? ''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence says the just-a-doll contingent has even questioned
whether Barbie is a suitable topic for serious study, a question
that she considers a threat to academic freedom and part of an
overall attack on women's studies.
</P>
<P>
   Others, predictably, disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like a question of academic freedom to me,''
says Glenn Ricketts, spokesman for the National Association of
Scholars, an academic reform group that urges a return to rigorous
standards and traditional studies.
</P>
<P>
   The liberal arts in general have gotten excessively
contemporary, Ricketts says. ``What Barbie studies indicate, to me,
is that it's gotten positively trivial. We're studying ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The academic press faced similar charges of triviality with Duke
University's 1995 publication of Barbie's Queer Accessories. ``I
was accused of nearly causing the downfall of Western
civilization,'' says author Erica Rand, associate professor of art
at Bates College in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The book's title is taken from one of its primary topics, the
effect of Barbie on lesbians. Rand interviewed or heard from
hundreds of women, many filled with hostility toward Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   They've told her about throwing Barbie down the stairs or into
the fireplace. Or painting on pubic hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people's reactions are clearly based on other things in
their life,'' she says. ``Some people hated Barbie because she was
given to them as a role model. If a girl wasn't really girly, she
might resent being given this doll to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say Barbie made them feel bad about being fat, or about
being too poor to afford official Barbie clothes and doll houses.
But Rand also hears from Barbie lovers. ``I think it is hard to
take one cultural product and put the blame on it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rogers laughs when asked whether male colleagues have
challenged her Barbie studies at the University of West Florida.
``They know better!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers says she realized the power of Barbie several years ago,
when she delivered one lecture on the doll in her sociology course.
``I never had so many students stay after class,'' she says. ``They
all wanted to tell Barbie stories.''
</P>
<P>
   In Barbie Culture, published by Sage Publications, Rogers
explores Barbie as consumer and body template. But the shocker, at
least for those '50s dads, is her take on Barbie's bombshell image.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie, she concludes, is . . . sexually ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not entirely the mainstream girl she may appear to be to
some people,'' Rogers says. ``If you look at veterinarian Barbie or
astronaut Barbie, where she's all suited up to go into space,
bombshell doesn't quite fit anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she's 40 years old and never married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a man at the center of your life is pretty definitive
of mainstream heterosexuality,'' Roger says. ``You should be
overtly coupled with a man, but she isn't. Ken is, ah, kind of
peripheral.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mattel's official Barbography bundles Ken under the
category of ``supporting cast,'' along with Barbie's sisters and
her admirably diverse friends Christie, Kira and Teresa (who are,
in order, black, Asian and Hispanic).
</P>
<P>
   So, it is possible, Rogers argues, to view the otherwise
heterosexist Barbie as feminist icon, the ultimate independent and
omnicapable woman.
</P>
<P>
   Or, she concedes, to view her any way you like.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why she's sold so well for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can say for sure how old Barbie is supposed to be, what
her social status is, whether she ever gets a bill for all that
shopping. This marvelous murkiness allows every girl to give Barbie
her own meaning, and she probably carries that meaning into
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But what does this say about Barbie? If the doll that has made
so many millions of girls happy and at least some others miserable
has no inherent meaning, if it symbolizes only what each girl wants
it to, then couldn't Barbie be replaced by any other doll?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or a shoe, or a melon,'' says David Geary, psychology
professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Doll play, a form
of practice parenting, is intuitive among girls in all cultures, he
says. Just about anything that can be picked up and cuddled will
do.
</P>
<P>
   Geary's book, Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex
Differences, will not win fans among academics who see Barbie as a
powerful, gender-role influence.
</P>
<P>
   He concludes that gender stereotypes are the result of prenatal
exposure to sex hormones, not parental example or childhood
experience: Boys play with trucks, girls play with dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Geary concedes that Barbie represents male ideals that could
have harmful effects, including eating disorders, but he notes that
men have many ways of letting women know what they expect.
</P>
<P>
   So, what if Financial Genius Barbie simply took her billions and
retired at 40?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other dolls girls can play with,'' Geary says.
``There are still fashion magazines and models and all those
influences. I don't think much would happen.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:Can you find out why Pedialyte cannot be used after 48 hours?
The bottle says to discard it. What gives? It looks fine to me.
</P>
<P>
   A:''As soon as the seal is broken, air contacts the product so
it is no longer considered sterile,'' according to a Ross
Laboratories statement. Beyond 48 hours ``the bacteriological
safety'' of Pedialyte is compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, makers of the popular children's electrolyte maintenance
solution, advises a cup of Pedialyte can sit safely at room
temperature for three hours; however, once a child drinks from a
cup or bottle containing Pedialyte, it is considered safe for only
one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I have a problem with my dogs, a mother and daughter team.
Recently, the daughter tries to keep the mother from eating her
fair share. To keep them from fighting over the food I simply sit
outside until the mother finishes.
</P>
<P>
   What possible reason would the daughter have for not letting the
mother eat? Is there anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's a dog eat ... well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, dogs share the wolf pack's dictum of only one dominant
female. The two may be vying for the position, says Diana Smith of
Hearts and Paws.
</P>
<P>
   The younger dog may be trying to get leadership, sensing the
mother is getting older; the mother may comfortably acquiesce. Have
you noticed any other behavior indicating leadership? Which dog
gets to the door first? The competition may escalate into fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recommends you feed the dogs in different rooms (one
outside, one inside?) if possible. If not, put the younger dog on a
leash to eat to prevent her from munching on mom's rations.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I am very interested in finding information on Bill Bradley's
campaign for president. Where would I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A:The 55-year-old Bradley was born in Missouri and matriculated
at Princeton University and Oxford University. Bradley played
professional basketball for the New York Knicks and served three
terms in the U.S. Senate (from New Jersey).
</P>
<P>
   Write to him in care of Bill Bradley for President, 395 Pleasant
Valley Way, West Orange, N.J. 07052.
</P>
<P>
   Q:My Waterford Crystal bud vase and rose bowl are ``cloudy.'' Is
there a product to clean them? I've tried denture tablets, which
did not work. Please help me!
</P>
<P>
   A:Ooh oh. The denture cleanser is the last stop. Could be too
late.
</P>
<P>
   But here are some ideas from Waterford.
</P>
<P>
   Wash vases in warm, not hot, water with a mild liquid soap. Some
water leaves deposits, which may be removed by using vinegar on a
cloth. Use vinegar every time you clean the vase or bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The interiors of vases may benefit from filling them half full
with warm water, two tablespoons of white vinegar OR ammonia and
1/4 cup uncooked rice. Swirling this mixture around removes
interior residue gently. Rinse with clean, warm water and dry with
a lint-free cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Never place in the dishwasher.Q:I want to know who owns the Hope
diamond and where is it stored at this time.
</P>
<P>
   A:The Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Hope diamond is named for Henry Phillip Hope, who owned the
diamond in 1839. The uncut stone, probably from India, was
described by its original owner, Jean Baptiste Tavernier, as ``a
beautiful violet.'' A beautiful 112 3/16-carat diamond violet!
</P>
<P>
   It sojournedjourneyed through history around the necks of kings
such as Louis XIV and on the headpieces of Americans like such as
Evelyn Walsh McLean. Jeweler Harry Winston purchased the stone from
McLean's estate in 1949 and donated it to the Smithsonian in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The Hope diamond (cut to 45.52 carats) is currently set on a
45-white-diamond necklace, surrounded by 16 white diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Jane Greig, author of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box
670, Austin 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com

RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL: BEHIND THE SCENES WITH DREW BARRYMORE ON
`NEVER BEEN KISSED' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 Includes a color slide of Drew Barrymore with David Arquette in a
scene from ``Never Been Kissed.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Drew Barrymore wasn't always cool.
 &HT;    At Cal Prep School in Stoneridge, Calif., Barrymore was
overweight and awkward. She had braces and skin like a
connect-the-dots game.
 &HT;    ``My lowest moment in high school was when one of the
cheerleaders said I could practice with the team,'' Barrymore
recalls. ``You see, I was always dying to be a cheerleader.''
 &HT;    It turned out to be a cruel trick. The cool girls just wanted to
watch the school dork squirm.
 &HT;    ``That day at practice, the most popular girl in my school saw
fat little me arrive in the gym,'' Barrymore says. ``She stopped
mid-cheer to scream, `What is SHE doing here?' I was mortified, and
then this girl insisted, `Get that idiot out of here!'
 &HT;    ``I ran out in tears,'' says Barrymore, who eventually dropped
out of school. ``It is still the most humiliating moment of my
entire life. I will never forget it.''
 &HT;    And finally she can use it. Her latest film _ ``Never Been
Kissed,'' opening April 9 _ casts her as a Chicago newspaper
reporter who goes undercover as a high-school student for a trend
piece on ``the kids of today.''
 &HT;    On the set _ a dilapidated office building in downtown Los
Angeles _ Barrymore is having flashbacks. She wears an ill-fitting,
drab, light-blue dress that seems to add 30 pounds to her slim
frame. Her lips are covered in garish, red lipstick.
 &HT;    ``Josie thinks that, since she's older, she will be able to join
the cool kids, but when Josie goes back to high school she finds
out that the inner geek has survived,'' Barrymore says. ``She
thinks it will all be different, and it's all exactly the same.''
 &HT;    Well, not exactly. She falls in love with one of the teachers
(Michael Vartan), for one thing. But for Barrymore, the point to
the movie, which also stars David Arquette, Molly Shannon and
Leelee Sobieski, is how much it resonates with her own life.
 &HT;    ``I think it's about how kids just look at the surface,'' she
says. ``It's like high-school students have this blueprint from
magazines about how you're supposed to look and feel. They can't
see beyond this perfect image.''
 &HT;    Barrymore isn't looking especially perfect right now. Her eyes
are actually a bit glazed over, after weeks of juggling her roles
as actress and as the film's producer. So far today, between scenes
she's called record companies about rights for the soundtrack,
argued with studio executives regarding a poster design and, oh
yes, read through a few script rewrites.
 &HT;    Even her lunch hour will be all business, spent with a reporter
and a takeout salad.
 &HT;    ``I have never worked harder in my life,'' she says. ``I've had
many, many sleepless nights.''
 &HT;    Not that she's complaining.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe how many studio executives are actually
listening to what a young woman has to say about a major
investment,'' she says, grinning. ``To me, that's its own victory.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't sure I wanted to produce,'' Barrymore adds, ``because
I always questioned power. It seemed like such a greedy thing. But
now I think power is the ability to change the world for the
better.''
 &HT;    And, yes, she sees ``Never Been Kissed'' as an opportunity to do
exactly that, if only in a small way, while perhaps working through
some of her own demons.
 &HT;    ``One of the things about acting that's so cathartic to me is
that you get to use some of your idiosyncratic behaviors and
mannerisms in a character,'' Barrymore says. ``So there are fears I
truly still embody from high school _ about not fitting in, about
everyone hating me _ that I really get to live through Josie.''
 &HT;    A harried-looking assistant interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Drew, we need you,''
 &HT;    Barrymore gets up and makes the trek to another part of the
building, which has been set up to look like a big-city newsroom,
complete with crumbled Post-It notes and magazines dating back to
World War II.
 &HT;    She spends the next two hours being yelled at by her editor
(John C. Reilly, of 1997's ``Boogie Nights'').
 &HT;    ``I'm probably going to be the most hated man in the country,''
Reilly says during a break. ``I'm yelling at the girl who played
Cinderella.''
 &HT;    Finally the scene works and ``Cut!'' has been called, but
Barrymore still has work to do. A producer's job is never done, she
says as she finally settles down to lunch.
 &HT;    Barrymore even helped come up with the film's title, she adds.
 &HT;    ``It's not that Josie has never been kissed by a boy,'' the
actress explains, digging into her salad in a room which actually
resembles a high-school cafeteria. ``One of the film's themes is
that you haven't really been kissed until you lock lips with
someone you love.''
 &HT;    Obviously, this is a topic on which Barrymore, a born romantic
most recently involved with Luke Wilson, her co-star in ``Home
Fries'' (1998), considers herself an authority.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God,'' she says brightly to anyone within earshot in the
crowded lunchroom, ``is there nothing worse than when you're really
in love with someone, and then they kiss you and you realize
they're a terrible kisser?
 &HT;    ``It's over in, like, one second.''
 &HT;    Two plump Teamsters at a nearby table nod in agreement.
 &HT;    ``I mean, concrete lips and darting tongues,'' the actress adds.
``It can be so awful.''
 &HT;    ``We've all been there,'' a 300-pound grip says, digging into
his salmon.
 &HT;    Barrymore's laugh fills the room, and everyone else joins in.
 &HT;    ``I want people to have a good time on this set,'' she says. ``I
never understood that feeling of incorporating tension into a
project. I want people to look back on this shoot with wonderful
memories.''
 &HT;    Memories, she adds, are what this film is all about. Scarred by
her own high-school recollections, she hopes that ``Never Been
Kissed'' will ease some younger women's passage.
 &HT;    ``I want teens to see this movie and feel good about
themselves,'' she says. ``I want young girls to look at the
so-called `fat' Josie and think, `This is a beautiful girl, and she
doesn't need to go on a diet. She doesn't need to look like a waif
out of a magazine. She's beautiful in all the ways that count.
She's a good person on the inside.'
 &HT;    ``With this movie,'' she concludes, ``I want kids to tell each
other how much they can change the world individually and how much
power they actually possess.''
 &HT;    Barrymore shakes her head sadly. She knows perfectly well that
her movie won't change things much. Jocks will still pick on geeks.
Nerds will still wish they were prom queens.
 &HT;    ``High school is so brutal _ but then again, life is brutal,''
the actress laments. ``I swear, I walked into the high-school set
for this film and I got immediate butterflies and ulcers. And it
was just a set.''
 &HT;    She sighs.
 &HT;    ``I felt the pressure tightening around me,'' she says.
``Pressure to excel, pressure to be smart, pressure to fit in.
Pressure to be wearing the right clothes and have the right body
type.''
 &HT;    Barrymore pauses.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says in surprise. ``High school is like
Hollywood.''

THOROUGHLY `MOD': CLAIRE DANES REVISITS `THE MOD SQUAD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Claire Danes with Omar Epps and Giovanni
Ribisi in a scene from ``The Mod Squad.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Claire Danes is blushing.
 &HT;    ``I was really lame and pathetic,'' she says. ``I played with
Barbies.''
 &HT;    Danes sighs, relieved to have bared her soul at last.
 &HT;    ``I used to lie and say I didn't like them because they weren't
representative of my life and of real women, because they didn't
have bruises on their legs,'' she says. ``But I secretly adored
Barbies.
 &HT;    ``God, that sounds so calculating, but I never played cops and
robbers,'' the actress adds. ``I played teacher, which I guess is
more in keeping with the traditional feminine role.
 &HT;    ``I'm probably making up for all that pathetic stuff now.''
 &HT;    Danes smiles, and it's a genuine, ear-to-ear grin. She's
unwinding in a trailer parked on a street in the East Village
section of Manhattan, after spending a couple of hours shooting an
MTV promotional show on behalf of her latest film, ``The Mod
Squad.''
 &HT;    That's right, ``The Mod Squad.''
 &HT;    The actress, known for such serious fare as the acclaimed ABC
series ``My So-Called Life'' and the films ``Little Women'' (1994),
``Romeo &AMP; Juliet'' (1996) and ``Les Miserables'' (1998), is finally
getting her chance to play cops and robbers. She kicks some serious
butt as delinquent-turned-cop Julie Barnes in a big-screen version
of the oh-so-hip ``Mod Squad'' television series, set to open April
2.
 &HT;    ``I'd seen a few episodes of the show when the movie started to
be born, but I hadn't watched any episodes prior to that,'' says
Danes, a pretty young woman with short blonde hair and huge blue
eyes. ``It's not really my generation's show.''
 &HT;    To try to make it more accessible to her generation,
director/co-writer Scott Silver has updated the story while
retaining elements of the 1968-1972 series.
 &HT;    The action now unfolds in present-day Los Angeles, for example,
though there's plenty of 1970s style on view, from the cars to the
outfits to the architecture. The mod troika remains Julie, Pete and
Linc, though they're now portrayed by Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and
Omar Epps.
 &HT;    ``What made it appealing and exciting to me is that you have a
bunch of groovy, swanky, rebellious kids fighting the system,''
Danes says. ``That will always be seductive. It's a common process
that kids have to work through. You have to kick and scream at the
adults until you can finally become one.''
 &HT;    Danes got a kick out of acting with Epps and Ribisi, she adds,
and loved playing a character so reserved and stoic. She even
welcomed the opportunity to perform stunts and get dirty.
 &HT;    Even better, the actress says, was the chance to display her
sexuality, especially now that her real-life experiences, for the
first time, can inform her onscreen performance.
 &HT;    ``It took me a long time to figure out what sex was,'' says
Danes, who will turn 20 on April 12 and is dating Australian
musician Ben Lee. ``It was really hard to communicate that idea
onscreen without having resolved any of those issues in my own life
and on my time.
 &HT;    ``It's natural for me now to manipulate that, to use it as a
tool to do my acting,'' she adds. ``It was really foreign to me as
a kid. It's a relief to have finally learned that language.
 &HT;    ``Now it's like, `Oh, I get it! I can play that.'''
 &HT;    Danes comes to ``The Mod Squad'' fresh from a whole other life.
Between films, she's in her freshman year at Yale, where her course
load includes such nonglamorous offerings as women's health,
adolescent psychology, graphic design, English, ``Modernism in the
City,'' computer science and ``The Modern Intellectual Agenda.''
 &HT;    Not everyone can handle the demands of college and a
simultaneous film career _ Danes' friend and role model, Jodie
Foster, all but dropped out of Hollywood during her Yale years. But
Danes says it's worth the effort.
 &HT;    ``I like it,'' she says. ``I'm in the middle of midterm week at
the moment, so I'm not as enthusiastic as I was when the semester
began. But it's been really healthy for me. I'm smart _ I learned
that at school, and it was something very reassuring to figure out.
 &HT;    ``I guess I had a complex about being an actress and a blonde,''
she explains, ``because people all of a sudden assume you're a
bimbo. I needed to confront that and prove to myself that I was
totally confident and capable of reading, writing and analyzing.''
 &HT;    Juggling her two lives can be jarring at times, Danes
acknowledges, but she isn't asking for sympathy.
 &HT;    ``People there have full-time jobs or are on a varsity sports
team, and everyone is separating from their parents,'' she says,
noshing on a pack of orange Twizzlers. ``Everyone is overwhelmed,
and you have to struggle to maintain a bit of a life while you're
there. It's easy to lose yourself in the course readings and never
return.
 &HT;    ``Also,'' she adds, ``I haven't had to turn down any great roles
yet to attend school, which is good _ though I am going to take off
a semester to do a movie that should start this summer and go into
the fall.
 &HT;    ``I'm willing to do this for five years, if that's what it
takes,'' she concludes. ``I really miss acting when I'm denied
access to it, and I start getting shaky.''
 &HT;    This summer, Danes says, she's also planning to spend as much
time as possible with her boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``Right now Ben visits me at school whenever he can, and we get
together on weekends,'' says Danes, who lives on campus in New
Haven, Conn., but often spends weekends at home in her Manhattan
loft. ``We've been together two years.''
 &HT;    She smiles softly.
 &HT;    ``He's the one,'' she says.
 &HT;    This summer will also see the long-delayed opening of
``Brokedown Palace.'' Far more serious than ``The Mod Squad,'' it
features Danes and Kate Beckinsale as recent high-school graduates
who are busted for drug trafficking while visiting Thailand and
sentenced to 33 years in prison.
 &HT;    Adding to her busy summer, Danes will be heard _ but not seen _
as the voice of the title character in ``Princess Mononoke,'' a
Japanese animated film that has already grossed more than $150
million in Asia. For the film's American release, Miramax hired
Danes, along with Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver and
others, to dub the dialogue into English.
 &HT;    The shape of her life and career after Yale remain a tantalizing
prospect for Danes, who's in no hurry to make plans. She continues
to be compared to Foster, who directed her in ``Home for the
Holidays'' (1995) and may team with her for a remake of ``All About
Eve,'' but Danes doesn't think the world needs another Foster.
 &HT;    ``The Jodie Foster we've got now is still thriving and still has
a lot more work to do,'' Danes says. ``I don't want to be her
younger doppleganger. I don't know what I'm going to be yet.
 &HT;    ``I did know since I was 5 years old that I wanted to be an
actress,'' she adds. ``I was so directed and focused, and my life
changed because of this dream that became real.
 &HT;    ``Now I don't have that map, that dream to rely on,'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I am an actress and I am doing what I want to do,
but I really don't have a concrete goal to attain. That's a little
frightening, but it's good, too.
 &HT;    ``I'm ready to push my acting to the next level,'' Danes
concludes. ``I feel like I'm evolving as a person at a pretty rapid
rate, and that must affect my work. So I'm interested to see how
all that shapes my work as an adult.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:Can you find out why Pedialyte cannot be used after 48 hours?
The bottle says to discard it. What gives? It looks fine to me.
</P>
<P>
   A:''As soon as the seal is broken, air contacts the product so
it is no longer considered sterile,'' according to a Ross
Laboratories statement. Beyond 48 hours ``the bacteriological
safety'' of Pedialyte is compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, makers of the popular children's electrolyte maintenance
solution, advises a cup of Pedialyte can sit safely at room
temperature for three hours; however, once a child drinks from a
cup or bottle containing Pedialyte, it is considered safe for only
one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I have a problem with my dogs, a mother and daughter team.
Recently, the daughter tries to keep the mother from eating her
fair share. To keep them from fighting over the food I simply sit
outside until the mother finishes.
</P>
<P>
   What possible reason would the daughter have for not letting the
mother eat? Is there anything else I can do?
</P>
<P>
   A:It's a dog eat ... well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, dogs share the wolf pack's dictum of only one dominant
female. The two may be vying for the position, says Diana Smith of
Hearts and Paws.
</P>
<P>
   The younger dog may be trying to get leadership, sensing the
mother is getting older; the mother may comfortably acquiesce. Have
you noticed any other behavior indicating leadership? Which dog
gets to the door first? The competition may escalate into fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith recommends you feed the dogs in different rooms (one
outside, one inside?) if possible. If not, put the younger dog on a
leash to eat to prevent her from munching on mom's rations.
</P>
<P>
   Q:I am very interested in finding information on Bill Bradley's
campaign for president. Where would I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A:The 55-year-old Bradley was born in Missouri and matriculated
at Princeton University and Oxford University. Bradley played
professional basketball for the New York Knicks and served three
terms in the U.S. Senate (from New Jersey).
</P>
<P>
   Write to him in care of Bill Bradley for President, 395 Pleasant
Valley Way, West Orange, N.J. 07052.
</P>
<P>
   Q:My Waterford Crystal bud vase and rose bowl are ``cloudy.'' Is
there a product to clean them? I've tried denture tablets, which
did not work. Please help me!
</P>
<P>
   A:Ooh oh. The denture cleanser is the last stop. Could be too
late.
</P>
<P>
   But here are some ideas from Waterford.
</P>
<P>
   Wash vases in warm, not hot, water with a mild liquid soap. Some
water leaves deposits, which may be removed by using vinegar on a
cloth. Use vinegar every time you clean the vase or bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The interiors of vases may benefit from filling them half full
with warm water, two tablespoons of white vinegar OR ammonia and
1/4 cup uncooked rice. Swirling this mixture around removes
interior residue gently. Rinse with clean, warm water and dry with
a lint-free cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Never place in the dishwasher.Q:I want to know who owns the Hope
diamond and where is it stored at this time.
</P>
<P>
   A:The Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Hope diamond is named for Henry Phillip Hope, who owned the
diamond in 1839. The uncut stone, probably from India, was
described by its original owner, Jean Baptiste Tavernier, as ``a
beautiful violet.'' A beautiful 112 3/16-carat diamond violet!
</P>
<P>
   It sojournedjourneyed through history around the necks of kings
such as Louis XIV and on the headpieces of Americans like such as
Evelyn Walsh McLean. Jeweler Harry Winston purchased the stone from
McLean's estate in 1949 and donated it to the Smithsonian in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The Hope diamond (cut to 45.52 carats) is currently set on a
45-white-diamond necklace, surrounded by 16 white diamonds.
</P>

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: It's tornado time again
 &HT;    By Shelia Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably heard of tornados _ whether it's from reading
the newspaper or watching popular movies such as ``The Wizard of
Oz'' or ``Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   Tornados are violently rotating columns of air. These columns of
air extend from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Tornados can be scary, but understanding how and when they
appear can take some of the wind out of your fear.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado's birthday
</P>
<P>
   Weather conditions have to be just right for a tornado to be
born, says Colin Marquis, a meteorologist at the Weather Channel.
Tornados take shape when an area has warm, moist conditions in the
lower atmosphere and the temperature above it is falling rapidly.
As you move farther from the ground, the atmosphere becomes
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   The strength and direction of winds help determine whether a
tornados forms. If the wind speed increases dramatically as you
move higher and the wind changes direction, chances are a tornado
is forming, says Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   Shaping up
</P>
<P>
   Usually when we think of tornados, we picture a funnel-shaped
cloud. While the funnel is the classic shape, tornados can resemble
gray or black-colored ropes with the same width from top to bottom.
And sometimes, they look chaotic and jumbled.
</P>
<P>
   But the size and shape don't have anything to do with the
strength of a tornado. You can have a very weak wide-bodied one or
a very intense, narrow funnel.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite hangouts
</P>
<P>
   Tornados can occur anywhere in the United States. Most tornado
activity occurs in the Great Plains states, which include Texas,
Nebraska and Oklahoma. Between 1950 and 1994, Texas averaged 122
tornados a year; Oklahoma averaged 51; and Georgia was hit 20
times.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it seemed Georgia got more than its fair share of
these violent winds. In 1998, there were 39 tornados reported in
our state. Marquis said the increase was likely caused by El Nino.
El Nino created unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean, which
later affected other weather patterns, such as tornados and snow.
</P>
<P>
   Tornados usually occur at certain times of the year. Often, they
hit the the Gulf Coast first because it has a lot of warmth and
moisture. There, tornado season begins as early as mid-February. In
Georgia and surrounding states, the season begins in March and
lasts until May.
</P>
<P>
   More brawn than brain
</P>
<P>
   Tornados range in strength from weak to horrific. Meteorologists
use the Fujita Scale to rank the level of intensity. The scale,
which ranges from an F-0 to an F-5, estimates wind speed based on
the damage caused.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1950 and 1994, 74 percent of all tornados were ranked
F-0 or F-1; 25 percent were F-2 or F-3s; and 1 percent were F-4 or
F-5. The higher the number, the more damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent of the people who were killed in tornados
died in F-4 and F-5 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the worst period on record for tornados was in April
1974. On April 3 and 4, 148 tornados hit 12 states, killing 309

DEANA CARTER: EVERYTHING REALLY IS ALRIGHT

 By JANET E. WILLIAMS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Overnight success hasn't changed Deana Carter one bit _ and no
wonder, since her success was actually five years in the making.
 &HT;    That's how much time passed between the day she signed with
Capitol Records and the release of her debut album, ``Did I Shave
My Legs for This?'' (1996).
 &HT;    Being used to delay came in handy with her second album. Despite
its predecessor's success, ``Everything's Gonna be Alright'' was
stalled by several executive shuffles, long enough that the singer
feared that it might languish in a vault for as long as her first
album had.
 &HT;    ``I was freaking out, going `Why do I have to have album delays
every project?''' she recalls.
 &HT;    As it turned out, this time the delay was measured in months,
not years.
 &HT;    ``What I've found out is that the powers that be _ meaning karma
and the spiritual side of life _ always take care of me,'' she
says. ``So if it's delayed, or when things happen to me that I find
abrasive, I try to pull back and go, `OK, what's the big picture?
Am I paying attention?'
 &HT;    ``And it always works out for the best.''
 &HT;    The bubbly blonde _ who is that rarity, a country star who's
actually a Nashville native _ hasn't forgotten her years as a
struggling singer/songwriter. Carter and her husband, songwriter
Chris DiCroce, found themselves at the governor's mansion in
Nashville for a party after the 1998 Country Music Association
Awards, and she felt a sense of deja vu.
 &HT;    ``I was talking to Roy Lott, the head of Capitol,'' she recalls,
``and I said, `You know what? The last time I was here, I was
serving people at a party. I had on my tux shirt and a tie, and I
drove my ratty little Honda up here. I know where your wine glass
goes in the kitchen. I was serving people here, and this is
freaking me out!' We laughed about it.''
 &HT;    Back then Carter wanted nothing more than stardom, but in
retrospect she admits that she still wasn't ready when it arrived.
 &HT;    ``You know what's weird?'' she says. ``I still go back and forth
_ I ping-pong on this. It's like you feel like people aren't really
paying attention to you, because they didn't for so long.
 &HT;    ``Before I could do something, go out with no makeup at all,''
she explains. ``Now every time I do it people go, `You look so
different in person.' It never fails _ you go out without your
makeup on, and what are you going to do but run into somebody you
don't need to see.
 &HT;    ``So I'm still having a hard time realizing that people are
paying attention to me.''
 &HT;    Unlike many stars, she still gets a kick out of being recognized
by fans.
 &HT;    ``People usually come up and say, `Hey, Deana!''' she says.
``I've never met them before, so I think that's kind of cool. They
feel like they know me a little bit. It's never in an invasive
way.''
 &HT;    It helps that she comes from a performing family. Her father is
noted session guitarist Fred Carter Jr. _ the two recently appeared
together on the PBS series ``Austin City Limits'' _ and her younger
brother Jeff plays in her band.
 &HT;    And her mother, Anna, is there to help them all stay grounded.
 &HT;    ``The other day, my mom said something that was like a sledge
hammer in the teeth,'' Carter recalls. ``We were talking about
something, and she goes, `I don't care if you are a star ... ' She
pulled that card on me, and it just made me so mad! But, really,
that my mom would say that is hilarious.''
 &HT;    Her family ties helped Carter through years in which she
supported herself through a succession of what she unceremoniously
calls ``crappy jobs.''
 &HT;    ``I did the janitorial service _ literally,'' she says,
laughing. ``I always joke around about men's urinals and about
those things _ what is the stopper for in urinals? What is going to
go down there that shouldn't? It's a urinal, right? How many pieces
of gum I've pulled out of the stoppers of urinals _ it's just
disgusting.
 &HT;    ``What else? Selling china door-to-door was pretty bad,'' she
says. ``You cold-call people, and then you go over. The gear was
great, it was worth it _ but, oh, I am not a salesman.''
 &HT;    Not all of her day jobs were so unpleasant.
 &HT;    ``I loved waiting tables and I loved bartending,'' Carter says
with a smile. ``That was great. (Former Capitol Nashville chief
Jimmy) Bowen always said, `Don't do business with somebody til you
play golf with them and see how they are. Are they fair? How are
they as a person _ hotheaded, levelheaded?' You learn that by
waiting tables, too.''
 &HT;    Carter credits much of her current success to those days.
 &HT;    ``I waited tables at Zanies, the comedy club here, for a long
time, about three years,'' she recalls. ``I learned so much from
those comedians. I used to be really envious of the way that they
were self-destructive on the stage _ they would sit there and
self-bash and abuse themselves and the human spirit and human
nature.
 &HT;    ``That was hilarious. When you see comedians making fun of what
we all have in common, then you're on the right track.''
 &HT;    Carter tries to bring that same spirit to her music, she says,
especially in her more personal songs, such as ``Absence of the
Heart,'' the first single from ``Everything's Gonna Be Alright.''
 &HT;    ``Musically I have to keep exposing myself,'' she says. ``It's
just therapy, really. It makes me feel better when I sing a song
like `Absence of the Heart' and I see someone crying or relating to
it. I'm really contacting that person, and at least half of that
weight is gone because you know someone else is going through it
too.
 &HT;    ``You don't want them to, but there is so much release in
knowing that you're not the only one. Musically, it's important to
put your guts out there.''
 &HT;    ``Absence Of The Heart'' is one of many strongly narrative
Carter songs. The singer says that she needs a story that she can
relate to if she's to give a song her best.
 &HT;    ``All the singles off the first album were little stories or
specific instances that you could visualize,'' she says. ``You can
plug your life into that. I am a song girl, and I love to be able
to plug my life into it, where I can either escape into the song or
feel like I am reliving something that I've been through before.''
 &HT;    One of the tunes likely to evoke memories for baby boomers is
Carter's cover of ``Brand New Key,'' the 1970s hit. Although Carter
infuses her version with a fun spirit, she doesn't take this song
any more lightly than anything else on the album.
 &HT;    ``A lot of energy goes into that, to have fun,'' she says. ``The
first album, there were serious sides and lighthearted sides, but
there was also a fun element. I wanted to make sure that this album
had that too.''
 &HT;    Although it had been five years since she'd been in the studio,
Carter says that she's generally pleased with ``Everything's Gonna
Be Alright,'' despite its relatively hurried genesis. But next time
out she aims for a more relaxed pace.
 &HT;    ``I love this album, but it came around so much faster than the
first one,'' she says. ``It's kind of like planning your children _
the second one, we were surprised!
 &HT;    ``I want to have a little more time for the next project. I
appreciate foresight and I like to be respectful of that, because I
don't want the music to suffer.''

 Includes a 350-word sidebar and a color slide of Jennifer Grey and
Chris Eigeman in a scene from ``It's Like, You Know.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any day now, someone will announce a television show that has no
cast or setting _ just two cameras filming each other filming each
other filming each other ...
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the medium, television has focused on the
entertainment world _ look at its most legendary sitcom, ``I Love
Lucy,'' with starstruck Lucy Ricardo aching to get a taste of her
bandleader husband's stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But lately it's moved to a new level. Though two of the best
have recently departed _ ``Seinfeld,'' which starred Jerry Seinfeld
as a popular comic named Jerry Seinfeld, and ``The Larry Sanders
Show,'' Garry Shandling's dark, insightful and scabrously funny
look at the talk-show business _ there's plenty more where they
came from.
</P>
<P>
   Al Franken's ``Lateline'' brings the spirit of ``Sanders'' to a
television news program, for example, while ``SportsNight'' offers
a similarly behind-the-scenes look at a cable sports program. Like
``Sanders,'' these shows often feature celebrities guesting as
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This spring the ante is raised even further. ABC's ``It's Like,
You Know'' centers on a Seinfeldesque group of Los Angeles
denizens, including actress Jennifer Grey as herself, while ``Movie
Stars'' is a family sitcom whose family just happens to feature
mom-and-pop superstars. Jennifer Grant, daughter of Dyan Cannon and
Cary Grant, stars, and the cast also includes the real-life
brothers of Patrick Swayze, Sylvester Stallone and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   More self-reference is on the way: Sara Gilbert will star in a
comedy about a late-night-comedy-show writer, and New York actress
Rosie Perez will headline a comedy about the travails of a New York
actress.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the spirit of the big screen, where Robert Altman's
``The Player'' (1992) featured legions of stars cameoing as
themselves, ``Get Shorty'' (1996) viciously spoofed the movie
business and ``Wag the Dog'' (1997) let Dustin Hoffman do a
sarcastic turn on producer Robert Evans. Coming soon to a multiplex
near you is ``Being John Malkovich,'' a quixotic look inside the
quixotic character actor's brain, and ``Free Enterprise,'' in which
William Shatner portrays a version of himself _ a pompous actor who
cons a couple of ``Star Trek'' fans into financing a musical
one-man show reminiscent of the legendarily bad album Shatner
himself recorded in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment Tonight started it,'' says James Widdoes, the
co-creator and executive producer of ``Movie Stars.'' ``The success
of that show and everything that came after it, the magazines and
all that stuff, that began it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People _ viewers, readers _ love to get behind the scenes,''
agrees Ted Harbert, former ABC Entertainment president and
executive producer of ``It's Like, You Know.'' ``That's the reason
talk shows work. That's why award shows work. That's why game shows
like `Hollywood Squares' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the idea of a star playing themself in a fictional sitcom
is, I don't want to go as far is to say irresistible, but you're
going to want to check out what Jennifer Grey says about herself in
the show,'' he says. ``There isn't much in the show that hasn't
happened to one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty fresh idea, and `Larry Sanders' broached it,''
says Grey, whose background, life and even her nose job are mined
for the show's scripts. ``And this specifically has never been done
before. I think that's part of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like'' creator Peter Mehlman, a former ``Seinfeld''
writer, has collected stories from Grey and the rest of his cast to
use in his scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody takes themselves so seriously out here,'' he says.
``Every quote, every newspaper article's like, you know, the end of
the world. I said to Jennifer, `You know, you're going to get all
the stuff, with the nose and everything like that, it's all just
words. Have fun with it _ it's not going to change who you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   The self-reflexive trend comes at a time when the sitcom format
itself seems a bit tired, making it ripe for self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest with you,'' Mehlman admits, ``I'm
trying to avoid getting bored with this form. I was on `Seinfeld'
for seven years _ I'm in great danger of getting bored doing
standard shows. I'm feeling a little restless.''
</P>
<P>
   But can it be healthy for the world of entertainment if its main
subject is increasingly itself? Is immersing ourselves in the
fantasy factories good for our self-image, for maintaining a sense
of perspective in living our own lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very profound question,'' Widdoes says thoughtfully.
``We make things out of whole cloth here, we make entertainment.
Are we curing cancer? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he repeats for emphasis. ``I wish I could do a really
smart comedy about the fact that America's children are getting
dumber every year. I can't come up with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have to do shows that afford me the opportunity to make
sure that my kids get the best education they can.''
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: JENNIFER GREY'S PERFECT ROLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first time actress Jennifer Grey, playing actress Jennifer
Grey, turns up in ``It's Like, You Know,'' Chris Eigeman's
character doesn't think it's her.
</P>
<P>
   He's a huge fan of ``Dirty Dancing'' (1988), which he saw in its
recent re-release, and she looks nothing like she did in that
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nose job!'' Grey exclaims, and hopes the matter will rest
there.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't. Most people, let alone most celebrities, don't
advertise their plastic surgery, certainly not on prime-time
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved how I looked'' before the nose job, she insists.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she says, ``Dirty Dancing's'' phenomenal success
didn't translate into any boost for her career. She didn't work for
a year after it was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I looked specifically Jewish, and I think that
there are not a lot of parts for Jewish girls specifically,'' she
says. ``I really wanted to be able to be considered for all sorts
of parts, to play an unspecific ethnicity ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to help myself get work, and I was trying to
not compromise myself and do the right thing to help myself be a
working actress.''
</P>
<P>
   She took some flak for the decision, but insists that she
doesn't regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of my life, it's part of who I am,'' she says.
``Without having had that happen, I would never have gotten the
lessons I've gotten. I had to completely rebuild who I thought I
was without anyone's input. That's the most valuable thing in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given her a sense of humor about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a part in my contract where I basically have approval
over things directly pertaining to my personal life,'' Grey says.
``But I also find that the more open-minded I can be and the more
freely I can allow them to go nuts and throw wild stuff at me, the
more opportunity I have to have a great time as an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all sitcom actresses, Grey wouldn't mind winning an Emmy
for her work. But if she doesn't get one, will it mean that she
didn't even have the acting chops to be convincing as herself?
</P>
<P>
   Grey laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``I guess it'll mean I've been miscast as
Jennifer Grey. That'll just be one of the knocks I'll have to
take.''

RETURN TO HIGH SCHOOL: BEHIND THE SCENES WITH DREW BARRYMORE ON
`NEVER BEEN KISSED'

 Includes a color slide of Drew Barrymore with David Arquette in a
scene from ``Never Been Kissed.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Drew Barrymore wasn't always cool.
 &HT;    At Cal Prep School in Stoneridge, Calif., Barrymore was
overweight and awkward. She had braces and skin like a
connect-the-dots game.
 &HT;    ``My lowest moment in high school was when one of the
cheerleaders said I could practice with the team,'' Barrymore
recalls. ``You see, I was always dying to be a cheerleader.''
 &HT;    It turned out to be a cruel trick. The cool girls just wanted to
watch the school dork squirm.
 &HT;    ``That day at practice, the most popular girl in my school saw
fat little me arrive in the gym,'' Barrymore says. ``She stopped
mid-cheer to scream, `What is SHE doing here?' I was mortified, and
then this girl insisted, `Get that idiot out of here!'
 &HT;    ``I ran out in tears,'' says Barrymore, who eventually dropped
out of school. ``It is still the most humiliating moment of my
entire life. I will never forget it.''
 &HT;    And finally she can use it. Her latest film _ ``Never Been
Kissed,'' opening April 9 _ casts her as a Chicago newspaper
reporter who goes undercover as a high-school student for a trend
piece on ``the kids of today.''
 &HT;    On the set _ a dilapidated office building in downtown Los
Angeles _ Barrymore is having flashbacks. She wears an ill-fitting,
drab, light-blue dress that seems to add 30 pounds to her slim
frame. Her lips are covered in garish, red lipstick.
 &HT;    ``Josie thinks that, since she's older, she will be able to join
the cool kids, but when Josie goes back to high school she finds
out that the inner geek has survived,'' Barrymore says. ``She
thinks it will all be different, and it's all exactly the same.''
 &HT;    Well, not exactly. She falls in love with one of the teachers
(Michael Vartan), for one thing. But for Barrymore, the point to
the movie, which also stars David Arquette, Molly Shannon and
Leelee Sobieski, is how much it resonates with her own life.
 &HT;    ``I think it's about how kids just look at the surface,'' she
says. ``It's like high-school students have this blueprint from
magazines about how you're supposed to look and feel. They can't
see beyond this perfect image.''
 &HT;    Barrymore isn't looking especially perfect right now. Her eyes
are actually a bit glazed over, after weeks of juggling her roles
as actress and as the film's producer. So far today, between scenes
she's called record companies about rights for the soundtrack,
argued with studio executives regarding a poster design and, oh
yes, read through a few script rewrites.
 &HT;    Even her lunch hour will be all business, spent with a reporter
and a takeout salad.
 &HT;    ``I have never worked harder in my life,'' she says. ``I've had
many, many sleepless nights.''
 &HT;    Not that she's complaining.
 &HT;    ``I can't believe how many studio executives are actually
listening to what a young woman has to say about a major
investment,'' she says, grinning. ``To me, that's its own victory.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't sure I wanted to produce,'' Barrymore adds, ``because
I always questioned power. It seemed like such a greedy thing. But
now I think power is the ability to change the world for the
better.''
 &HT;    And, yes, she sees ``Never Been Kissed'' as an opportunity to do
exactly that, if only in a small way, while perhaps working through
some of her own demons.
 &HT;    ``One of the things about acting that's so cathartic to me is
that you get to use some of your idiosyncratic behaviors and
mannerisms in a character,'' Barrymore says. ``So there are fears I
truly still embody from high school _ about not fitting in, about
everyone hating me _ that I really get to live through Josie.''
 &HT;    A harried-looking assistant interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Drew, we need you,''
 &HT;    Barrymore gets up and makes the trek to another part of the
building, which has been set up to look like a big-city newsroom,
complete with crumbled Post-It notes and magazines dating back to
World War II.
 &HT;    She spends the next two hours being yelled at by her editor
(John C. Reilly, of 1997's ``Boogie Nights'').
 &HT;    ``I'm probably going to be the most hated man in the country,''
Reilly says during a break. ``I'm yelling at the girl who played
Cinderella.''
 &HT;    Finally the scene works and ``Cut!'' has been called, but
Barrymore still has work to do. A producer's job is never done, she
says as she finally settles down to lunch.
 &HT;    Barrymore even helped come up with the film's title, she adds.
 &HT;    ``It's not that Josie has never been kissed by a boy,'' the
actress explains, digging into her salad in a room which actually
resembles a high-school cafeteria. ``One of the film's themes is
that you haven't really been kissed until you lock lips with
someone you love.''
 &HT;    Obviously, this is a topic on which Barrymore, a born romantic
most recently involved with Luke Wilson, her co-star in ``Home
Fries'' (1998), considers herself an authority.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God,'' she says brightly to anyone within earshot in the
crowded lunchroom, ``is there nothing worse than when you're really
in love with someone, and then they kiss you and you realize
they're a terrible kisser?
 &HT;    ``It's over in, like, one second.''
 &HT;    Two plump Teamsters at a nearby table nod in agreement.
 &HT;    ``I mean, concrete lips and darting tongues,'' the actress adds.
``It can be so awful.''
 &HT;    ``We've all been there,'' a 300-pound grip says, digging into
his salmon.
 &HT;    Barrymore's laugh fills the room, and everyone else joins in.
 &HT;    ``I want people to have a good time on this set,'' she says. ``I
never understood that feeling of incorporating tension into a
project. I want people to look back on this shoot with wonderful
memories.''
 &HT;    Memories, she adds, are what this film is all about. Scarred by
her own high-school recollections, she hopes that ``Never Been
Kissed'' will ease some younger women's passage.
 &HT;    ``I want teens to see this movie and feel good about
themselves,'' she says. ``I want young girls to look at the
so-called `fat' Josie and think, `This is a beautiful girl, and she
doesn't need to go on a diet. She doesn't need to look like a waif
out of a magazine. She's beautiful in all the ways that count.
She's a good person on the inside.'
 &HT;    ``With this movie,'' she concludes, ``I want kids to tell each
other how much they can change the world individually and how much
power they actually possess.''
 &HT;    Barrymore shakes her head sadly. She knows perfectly well that
her movie won't change things much. Jocks will still pick on geeks.
Nerds will still wish they were prom queens.
 &HT;    ``High school is so brutal _ but then again, life is brutal,''
the actress laments. ``I swear, I walked into the high-school set
for this film and I got immediate butterflies and ulcers. And it
was just a set.''
 &HT;    She sighs.
 &HT;    ``I felt the pressure tightening around me,'' she says.
``Pressure to excel, pressure to be smart, pressure to fit in.
Pressure to be wearing the right clothes and have the right body
type.''
 &HT;    Barrymore pauses.
 &HT;    ``Wow,'' she says in surprise. ``High school is like
Hollywood.''

THOROUGHLY `MOD': CLAIRE DANES REVISITS `THE MOD SQUAD'

 Includes a color slide of Claire Danes with Omar Epps and Giovanni
Ribisi in a scene from ``The Mod Squad.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Claire Danes is blushing.
 &HT;    ``I was really lame and pathetic,'' she says. ``I played with
Barbies.''
 &HT;    Danes sighs, relieved to have bared her soul at last.
 &HT;    ``I used to lie and say I didn't like them because they weren't
representative of my life and of real women, because they didn't
have bruises on their legs,'' she says. ``But I secretly adored
Barbies.
 &HT;    ``God, that sounds so calculating, but I never played cops and
robbers,'' the actress adds. ``I played teacher, which I guess is
more in keeping with the traditional feminine role.
 &HT;    ``I'm probably making up for all that pathetic stuff now.''
 &HT;    Danes smiles, and it's a genuine, ear-to-ear grin. She's
unwinding in a trailer parked on a street in the East Village
section of Manhattan, after spending a couple of hours shooting an
MTV promotional show on behalf of her latest film, ``The Mod
Squad.''
 &HT;    That's right, ``The Mod Squad.''
 &HT;    The actress, known for such serious fare as the acclaimed ABC
series ``My So-Called Life'' and the films ``Little Women'' (1994),
``Romeo &AMP; Juliet'' (1996) and ``Les Miserables'' (1998), is finally
getting her chance to play cops and robbers. She kicks some serious
butt as delinquent-turned-cop Julie Barnes in a big-screen version
of the oh-so-hip ``Mod Squad'' television series, set to open April
2.
 &HT;    ``I'd seen a few episodes of the show when the movie started to
be born, but I hadn't watched any episodes prior to that,'' says
Danes, a pretty young woman with short blonde hair and huge blue
eyes. ``It's not really my generation's show.''
 &HT;    To try to make it more accessible to her generation,
director/co-writer Scott Silver has updated the story while
retaining elements of the 1968-1972 series.
 &HT;    The action now unfolds in present-day Los Angeles, for example,
though there's plenty of 1970s style on view, from the cars to the
outfits to the architecture. The mod troika remains Julie, Pete and
Linc, though they're now portrayed by Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and
Omar Epps.
 &HT;    ``What made it appealing and exciting to me is that you have a
bunch of groovy, swanky, rebellious kids fighting the system,''
Danes says. ``That will always be seductive. It's a common process
that kids have to work through. You have to kick and scream at the
adults until you can finally become one.''
 &HT;    Danes got a kick out of acting with Epps and Ribisi, she adds,
and loved playing a character so reserved and stoic. She even
welcomed the opportunity to perform stunts and get dirty.
 &HT;    Even better, the actress says, was the chance to display her
sexuality, especially now that her real-life experiences, for the
first time, can inform her onscreen performance.
 &HT;    ``It took me a long time to figure out what sex was,'' says
Danes, who will turn 20 on April 12 and is dating Australian
musician Ben Lee. ``It was really hard to communicate that idea
onscreen without having resolved any of those issues in my own life
and on my time.
 &HT;    ``It's natural for me now to manipulate that, to use it as a
tool to do my acting,'' she adds. ``It was really foreign to me as
a kid. It's a relief to have finally learned that language.
 &HT;    ``Now it's like, `Oh, I get it! I can play that.'''
 &HT;    Danes comes to ``The Mod Squad'' fresh from a whole other life.
Between films, she's in her freshman year at Yale, where her course
load includes such nonglamorous offerings as women's health,
adolescent psychology, graphic design, English, ``Modernism in the
City,'' computer science and ``The Modern Intellectual Agenda.''
 &HT;    Not everyone can handle the demands of college and a
simultaneous film career _ Danes' friend and role model, Jodie
Foster, all but dropped out of Hollywood during her Yale years. But
Danes says it's worth the effort.
 &HT;    ``I like it,'' she says. ``I'm in the middle of midterm week at
the moment, so I'm not as enthusiastic as I was when the semester
began. But it's been really healthy for me. I'm smart _ I learned
that at school, and it was something very reassuring to figure out.
 &HT;    ``I guess I had a complex about being an actress and a blonde,''
she explains, ``because people all of a sudden assume you're a
bimbo. I needed to confront that and prove to myself that I was
totally confident and capable of reading, writing and analyzing.''
 &HT;    Juggling her two lives can be jarring at times, Danes
acknowledges, but she isn't asking for sympathy.
 &HT;    ``People there have full-time jobs or are on a varsity sports
team, and everyone is separating from their parents,'' she says,
noshing on a pack of orange Twizzlers. ``Everyone is overwhelmed,
and you have to struggle to maintain a bit of a life while you're
there. It's easy to lose yourself in the course readings and never
return.
 &HT;    ``Also,'' she adds, ``I haven't had to turn down any great roles
yet to attend school, which is good _ though I am going to take off
a semester to do a movie that should start this summer and go into
the fall.
 &HT;    ``I'm willing to do this for five years, if that's what it
takes,'' she concludes. ``I really miss acting when I'm denied
access to it, and I start getting shaky.''
 &HT;    This summer, Danes says, she's also planning to spend as much
time as possible with her boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``Right now Ben visits me at school whenever he can, and we get
together on weekends,'' says Danes, who lives on campus in New
Haven, Conn., but often spends weekends at home in her Manhattan
loft. ``We've been together two years.''
 &HT;    She smiles softly.
 &HT;    ``He's the one,'' she says.
 &HT;    This summer will also see the long-delayed opening of
``Brokedown Palace.'' Far more serious than ``The Mod Squad,'' it
features Danes and Kate Beckinsale as recent high-school graduates
who are busted for drug trafficking while visiting Thailand and
sentenced to 33 years in prison.
 &HT;    Adding to her busy summer, Danes will be heard _ but not seen _
as the voice of the title character in ``Princess Mononoke,'' a
Japanese animated film that has already grossed more than $150
million in Asia. For the film's American release, Miramax hired
Danes, along with Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver and
others, to dub the dialogue into English.
 &HT;    The shape of her life and career after Yale remain a tantalizing
prospect for Danes, who's in no hurry to make plans. She continues
to be compared to Foster, who directed her in ``Home for the
Holidays'' (1995) and may team with her for a remake of ``All About
Eve,'' but Danes doesn't think the world needs another Foster.
 &HT;    ``The Jodie Foster we've got now is still thriving and still has
a lot more work to do,'' Danes says. ``I don't want to be her
younger doppleganger. I don't know what I'm going to be yet.
 &HT;    ``I did know since I was 5 years old that I wanted to be an
actress,'' she adds. ``I was so directed and focused, and my life
changed because of this dream that became real.
 &HT;    ``Now I don't have that map, that dream to rely on,'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I am an actress and I am doing what I want to do,
but I really don't have a concrete goal to attain. That's a little
frightening, but it's good, too.
 &HT;    ``I'm ready to push my acting to the next level,'' Danes
concludes. ``I feel like I'm evolving as a person at a pretty rapid
rate, and that must affect my work. So I'm interested to see how
all that shapes my work as an adult.''

DEANA CARTER: EVERYTHING REALLY IS ALRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of country singer Deana Carter. 
 By JANET E. WILLIAMS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Overnight success hasn't changed Deana Carter one bit _ and no
wonder, since her success was actually five years in the making.
 &HT;    That's how much time passed between the day she signed with
Capitol Records and the release of her debut album, ``Did I Shave
My Legs for This?'' (1996).
 &HT;    Being used to delay came in handy with her second album. Despite
its predecessor's success, ``Everything's Gonna be Alright'' was
stalled by several executive shuffles, long enough that the singer
feared that it might languish in a vault for as long as her first
album had.
 &HT;    ``I was freaking out, going `Why do I have to have album delays
every project?''' she recalls.
 &HT;    As it turned out, this time the delay was measured in months,
not years.
 &HT;    ``What I've found out is that the powers that be _ meaning karma
and the spiritual side of life _ always take care of me,'' she
says. ``So if it's delayed, or when things happen to me that I find
abrasive, I try to pull back and go, `OK, what's the big picture?
Am I paying attention?'
 &HT;    ``And it always works out for the best.''
 &HT;    The bubbly blonde _ who is that rarity, a country star who's
actually a Nashville native _ hasn't forgotten her years as a
struggling singer/songwriter. Carter and her husband, songwriter
Chris DiCroce, found themselves at the governor's mansion in
Nashville for a party after the 1998 Country Music Association
Awards, and she felt a sense of deja vu.
 &HT;    ``I was talking to Roy Lott, the head of Capitol,'' she recalls,
``and I said, `You know what? The last time I was here, I was
serving people at a party. I had on my tux shirt and a tie, and I
drove my ratty little Honda up here. I know where your wine glass
goes in the kitchen. I was serving people here, and this is
freaking me out!' We laughed about it.''
 &HT;    Back then Carter wanted nothing more than stardom, but in
retrospect she admits that she still wasn't ready when it arrived.
 &HT;    ``You know what's weird?'' she says. ``I still go back and forth
_ I ping-pong on this. It's like you feel like people aren't really
paying attention to you, because they didn't for so long.
 &HT;    ``Before I could do something, go out with no makeup at all,''
she explains. ``Now every time I do it people go, `You look so
different in person.' It never fails _ you go out without your
makeup on, and what are you going to do but run into somebody you
don't need to see.
 &HT;    ``So I'm still having a hard time realizing that people are
paying attention to me.''
 &HT;    Unlike many stars, she still gets a kick out of being recognized
by fans.
 &HT;    ``People usually come up and say, `Hey, Deana!''' she says.
``I've never met them before, so I think that's kind of cool. They
feel like they know me a little bit. It's never in an invasive
way.''
 &HT;    It helps that she comes from a performing family. Her father is
noted session guitarist Fred Carter Jr. _ the two recently appeared
together on the PBS series ``Austin City Limits'' _ and her younger
brother Jeff plays in her band.
 &HT;    And her mother, Anna, is there to help them all stay grounded.
 &HT;    ``The other day, my mom said something that was like a sledge
hammer in the teeth,'' Carter recalls. ``We were talking about
something, and she goes, `I don't care if you are a star ... ' She
pulled that card on me, and it just made me so mad! But, really,
that my mom would say that is hilarious.''
 &HT;    Her family ties helped Carter through years in which she
supported herself through a succession of what she unceremoniously
calls ``crappy jobs.''
 &HT;    ``I did the janitorial service _ literally,'' she says,
laughing. ``I always joke around about men's urinals and about
those things _ what is the stopper for in urinals? What is going to
go down there that shouldn't? It's a urinal, right? How many pieces
of gum I've pulled out of the stoppers of urinals _ it's just
disgusting.
 &HT;    ``What else? Selling china door-to-door was pretty bad,'' she
says. ``You cold-call people, and then you go over. The gear was
great, it was worth it _ but, oh, I am not a salesman.''
 &HT;    Not all of her day jobs were so unpleasant.
 &HT;    ``I loved waiting tables and I loved bartending,'' Carter says
with a smile. ``That was great. (Former Capitol Nashville chief
Jimmy) Bowen always said, `Don't do business with somebody til you
play golf with them and see how they are. Are they fair? How are
they as a person _ hotheaded, levelheaded?' You learn that by
waiting tables, too.''
 &HT;    Carter credits much of her current success to those days.
 &HT;    ``I waited tables at Zanies, the comedy club here, for a long
time, about three years,'' she recalls. ``I learned so much from
those comedians. I used to be really envious of the way that they
were self-destructive on the stage _ they would sit there and
self-bash and abuse themselves and the human spirit and human
nature.
 &HT;    ``That was hilarious. When you see comedians making fun of what
we all have in common, then you're on the right track.''
 &HT;    Carter tries to bring that same spirit to her music, she says,
especially in her more personal songs, such as ``Absence of the
Heart,'' the first single from ``Everything's Gonna Be Alright.''
 &HT;    ``Musically I have to keep exposing myself,'' she says. ``It's
just therapy, really. It makes me feel better when I sing a song
like `Absence of the Heart' and I see someone crying or relating to
it. I'm really contacting that person, and at least half of that
weight is gone because you know someone else is going through it
too.
 &HT;    ``You don't want them to, but there is so much release in
knowing that you're not the only one. Musically, it's important to
put your guts out there.''
 &HT;    ``Absence Of The Heart'' is one of many strongly narrative
Carter songs. The singer says that she needs a story that she can
relate to if she's to give a song her best.
 &HT;    ``All the singles off the first album were little stories or
specific instances that you could visualize,'' she says. ``You can
plug your life into that. I am a song girl, and I love to be able
to plug my life into it, where I can either escape into the song or
feel like I am reliving something that I've been through before.''
 &HT;    One of the tunes likely to evoke memories for baby boomers is
Carter's cover of ``Brand New Key,'' the 1970s hit. Although Carter
infuses her version with a fun spirit, she doesn't take this song
any more lightly than anything else on the album.
 &HT;    ``A lot of energy goes into that, to have fun,'' she says. ``The
first album, there were serious sides and lighthearted sides, but
there was also a fun element. I wanted to make sure that this album
had that too.''
 &HT;    Although it had been five years since she'd been in the studio,
Carter says that she's generally pleased with ``Everything's Gonna
Be Alright,'' despite its relatively hurried genesis. But next time
out she aims for a more relaxed pace.
 &HT;    ``I love this album, but it came around so much faster than the
first one,'' she says. ``It's kind of like planning your children _
the second one, we were surprised!
 &HT;    ``I want to have a little more time for the next project. I
appreciate foresight and I like to be respectful of that, because I
don't want the music to suffer.''

 Includes a 350-word sidebar and a color slide of Jennifer Grey and
Chris Eigeman in a scene from ``It's Like, You Know.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any day now, someone will announce a television show that has no
cast or setting _ just two cameras filming each other filming each
other filming each other ...
</P>
<P>
   Since the dawn of the medium, television has focused on the
entertainment world _ look at its most legendary sitcom, ``I Love
Lucy,'' with starstruck Lucy Ricardo aching to get a taste of her
bandleader husband's stardom.
</P>
<P>
   But lately it's moved to a new level. Though two of the best
have recently departed _ ``Seinfeld,'' which starred Jerry Seinfeld
as a popular comic named Jerry Seinfeld, and ``The Larry Sanders
Show,'' Garry Shandling's dark, insightful and scabrously funny
look at the talk-show business _ there's plenty more where they
came from.
</P>
<P>
   Al Franken's ``Lateline'' brings the spirit of ``Sanders'' to a
television news program, for example, while ``SportsNight'' offers
a similarly behind-the-scenes look at a cable sports program. Like
``Sanders,'' these shows often feature celebrities guesting as
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This spring the ante is raised even further. ABC's ``It's Like,
You Know'' centers on a Seinfeldesque group of Los Angeles
denizens, including actress Jennifer Grey as herself, while ``Movie
Stars'' is a family sitcom whose family just happens to feature
mom-and-pop superstars. Jennifer Grant, daughter of Dyan Cannon and
Cary Grant, stars, and the cast also includes the real-life
brothers of Patrick Swayze, Sylvester Stallone and John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   More self-reference is on the way: Sara Gilbert will star in a
comedy about a late-night-comedy-show writer, and New York actress
Rosie Perez will headline a comedy about the travails of a New York
actress.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the spirit of the big screen, where Robert Altman's
``The Player'' (1992) featured legions of stars cameoing as
themselves, ``Get Shorty'' (1996) viciously spoofed the movie
business and ``Wag the Dog'' (1997) let Dustin Hoffman do a
sarcastic turn on producer Robert Evans. Coming soon to a multiplex
near you is ``Being John Malkovich,'' a quixotic look inside the
quixotic character actor's brain, and ``Free Enterprise,'' in which
William Shatner portrays a version of himself _ a pompous actor who
cons a couple of ``Star Trek'' fans into financing a musical
one-man show reminiscent of the legendarily bad album Shatner
himself recorded in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment Tonight started it,'' says James Widdoes, the
co-creator and executive producer of ``Movie Stars.'' ``The success
of that show and everything that came after it, the magazines and
all that stuff, that began it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People _ viewers, readers _ love to get behind the scenes,''
agrees Ted Harbert, former ABC Entertainment president and
executive producer of ``It's Like, You Know.'' ``That's the reason
talk shows work. That's why award shows work. That's why game shows
like `Hollywood Squares' work.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the idea of a star playing themself in a fictional sitcom
is, I don't want to go as far is to say irresistible, but you're
going to want to check out what Jennifer Grey says about herself in
the show,'' he says. ``There isn't much in the show that hasn't
happened to one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty fresh idea, and `Larry Sanders' broached it,''
says Grey, whose background, life and even her nose job are mined
for the show's scripts. ``And this specifically has never been done
before. I think that's part of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Like'' creator Peter Mehlman, a former ``Seinfeld''
writer, has collected stories from Grey and the rest of his cast to
use in his scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody takes themselves so seriously out here,'' he says.
``Every quote, every newspaper article's like, you know, the end of
the world. I said to Jennifer, `You know, you're going to get all
the stuff, with the nose and everything like that, it's all just
words. Have fun with it _ it's not going to change who you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   The self-reflexive trend comes at a time when the sitcom format
itself seems a bit tired, making it ripe for self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest with you,'' Mehlman admits, ``I'm
trying to avoid getting bored with this form. I was on `Seinfeld'
for seven years _ I'm in great danger of getting bored doing
standard shows. I'm feeling a little restless.''
</P>
<P>
   But can it be healthy for the world of entertainment if its main
subject is increasingly itself? Is immersing ourselves in the
fantasy factories good for our self-image, for maintaining a sense
of perspective in living our own lives?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very profound question,'' Widdoes says thoughtfully.
``We make things out of whole cloth here, we make entertainment.
Are we curing cancer? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he repeats for emphasis. ``I wish I could do a really
smart comedy about the fact that America's children are getting
dumber every year. I can't come up with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have to do shows that afford me the opportunity to make
sure that my kids get the best education they can.''
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: JENNIFER GREY'S PERFECT ROLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first time actress Jennifer Grey, playing actress Jennifer
Grey, turns up in ``It's Like, You Know,'' Chris Eigeman's
character doesn't think it's her.
</P>
<P>
   He's a huge fan of ``Dirty Dancing'' (1988), which he saw in its
recent re-release, and she looks nothing like she did in that
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nose job!'' Grey exclaims, and hopes the matter will rest
there.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't. Most people, let alone most celebrities, don't
advertise their plastic surgery, certainly not on prime-time
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved how I looked'' before the nose job, she insists.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she says, ``Dirty Dancing's'' phenomenal success
didn't translate into any boost for her career. She didn't work for
a year after it was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I looked specifically Jewish, and I think that
there are not a lot of parts for Jewish girls specifically,'' she
says. ``I really wanted to be able to be considered for all sorts
of parts, to play an unspecific ethnicity ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to help myself get work, and I was trying to
not compromise myself and do the right thing to help myself be a
working actress.''
</P>
<P>
   She took some flak for the decision, but insists that she
doesn't regret it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of my life, it's part of who I am,'' she says.
``Without having had that happen, I would never have gotten the
lessons I've gotten. I had to completely rebuild who I thought I
was without anyone's input. That's the most valuable thing in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also given her a sense of humor about her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a part in my contract where I basically have approval
over things directly pertaining to my personal life,'' Grey says.
``But I also find that the more open-minded I can be and the more
freely I can allow them to go nuts and throw wild stuff at me, the
more opportunity I have to have a great time as an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all sitcom actresses, Grey wouldn't mind winning an Emmy
for her work. But if she doesn't get one, will it mean that she
didn't even have the acting chops to be convincing as herself?
</P>
<P>
   Grey laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says. ``I guess it'll mean I've been miscast as
Jennifer Grey. That'll just be one of the knocks I'll have to
take.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wedge-issue politics steps up to the plates
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The state of Florida is jumping into the
political bumper-slogan business. So why aren't bumper-sticker
manufacturers outraged and mobilized?
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is poised to give Florida an anti-abortion
license plate. If passed and approved by the governor _ as is
likely _ a ``Choose Life'' tag will join the 42 specialty plates
that now enliven license-plate bingo games on the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators love specialty license plates. They are easy to vote
for and each makes some group happy. Since the state started
authorizing them in 1987, hardly a session has gone by without
legislators approving new tags. This year, they want five new tags.
Last year, they added six.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the tags have been noncontroversial. Florida
bumpers sport beloved team mascots, floating manatees, leaping
fish, prowling panthers and smoke-belching space shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   Which is as it should be. Political causes that bring
table-conversation to a dead stop and cause folks to be crossed off
Christmas-card lists would seem to be poor choices for license
plate themes. Why are we no longer satisfied with license plates
that simply give a place and a number? Why must they be A
Statement?
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is one of those hard issues over which people of good
will, sound morals and normal intelligence will disagree, call each
other astounding names and argue themselves hoarse without
resolving. It is an issue people have been murdered over. Is this
really a debate that fits on a license plate?
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what the next legislative session will bring. A
death-penalty license plate (``Choose Death'')? An ``I'll Give Up
My Guns when They Pry My Cold, Dead Hand from the Trigger'' plate?
``Hamburger is Murder'' and ``Wake Up to the Teletubbie Menace''
plates?
</P>
<P>
   Once Florida starts stamping polarizing political slogans on its
plates, is there any issue too weird to be proposed? Hint: we are
talking about Florida Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's experience with a politically charged license
plate motto should be instructive. Since 1973, prisoners have
stamped the motto ``Live Free or Die'' on that state's license
tags.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan was a call to resist tyranny but over the years had
been taken up by enough militia groups, white supremacists, gun
nuts and right-wing kooks that some New Hampshire folks are
uncomfortable with it. The state had to prosecute people for taking
the slogan off their plates _ until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
that a state can't force people to say they value freedom.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, declaring for or against the slogan is an easy way
in New Hampshire to start a fight when people would otherwise be
frozen and bored. Attempts to change it are ritually shouted down.
</P>
<P>
   I do not have a specialty plate on my car. I have the old,
pre-1997 plate with the state's outline on it. I liked the one
before that even better. The one that said ``SUNSHINE STATE.''
Sentiments I dare anyone in the room to contradict or gainsay.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like the newer Florida plates, which feature an orange,
because the orange is smooth and looks too much like a peach. I
like my oranges to look like oranges. I'm funny that way.
</P>
<P>
   We get to drive around with different license plates here: 42
specialty plates, old plates and new plates. I see this as
symbolic. Floridians tend to come from somewhere else, so we have
less in common than people in other states do.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to unite around the symbol of a peachlike orange, we
drive around sporting an ever-growing number of symbols and
slogans. Until now, all of them have at least been nonpolitical and
nothing anyone would argue about _ with the exception of the
University of Florida or Florida State University tags.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that last little bit of common civic space, a little
rectangle of sheet metal on our cars, is going to be up for
political grabs. Something to be argued over, legislated, lobbied,
featured in mailings, used in attack ads and forced into effect
over the other side's objections.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we will have even less in common. And a new
legislative game on the road _ capture the tag.

 &HT;    NEWS FOR KIDS: Kosovo no closer to peace
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Albanians and Serbs couldn't agree to a peace plan
last week and were preparing for more fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies may get involved in the war.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is threatening to
bomb Serbian targets and send soldiers to try to keep peace.
President Clinton is warning that the missions could be very
dangerous and Americans could die.
</P>
<P>
   The province of Kosovo is part of the country of Yugoslavia.
Albanians who live there want Kosovo to be its own nation, but the
Serbian leaders of Yugoslavia are opposed. The two groups fight
about religious differences, as well as other issues.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Stocks hit 10,000 mark
</P>
<P>
   If your parents seemed extra happy last week, it might have been
because their stocks were doing well. The Dow Jones industrial
average hit 10,000 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are little shares of companies that anyone can buy. All
together, the stockholders own the companies. The Dow Jones average
is the average price of some major stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, as stocks are bought and sold, the Dow rises
and falls. When the Dow rises, it usually means that the economy is
doing well and stockholders are making money.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones average began in 1896. It rose slowly in the
beginning, but it has leaped dramatically in recent years. It took
76 years to hit 1,000, in 1972. Fifteen years later, in 1987, it
rose to 2,000. And in only four more years, 1991, it hit 3,000. In
1995, it rose to 5,000.

   Cartoons not role models
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed Dumbo getting drunk or Cruella de Vil
chain-smoking throughout ``101 Dalmations''? A professor from the
University of North Carolina took note and started studying just
how often cartoon characters abuse alcohol or tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Goldstein found that 34 out of 50 G-rated movies released
during the last 60 years showed alcohol or tobacco abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are clearly seeing positive images of addictive
substances that their parents, teachers and society all
discourage,'' Goldstein wrote in an article for the Journal of the
American Medical Association.

   Japanese love Dumplings
</P>
<P>
   Children in Japan are screaming for more dumplings. They're not
extra hungry for sticky dough balls. They're in love with ``The
Three Dumpling Brothers,'' animated characters on a Japanese kids'
show that is similar to ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The three dumpling boys, who are stuck together on a skewer,
fight, make up and turn dry and hard when they sleep in the
cupboard overnight. After the dumplings sang a song, the TV network
was flooded with calls. The dumplings made a CD to satisfy their
fans, and it went straight to the top of the pop chart.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the records, the sales of rice dumplings have also
increased.

 &HT;    Running too fast guarantees short life span
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I grew up in the South during the days of four-wheeled
dinosaurs. The association I have for the word ``speed'' is shaped
by a two-lane highway outside of Arkadelphia, Ark., a road that
magically turned into an illegal and dangerous drag racing strip
around midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days of muscle cars. It all happened so long ago
that even the description of those cars won't mean a thing to most
kids growing up today. We had GTOs with three two-barrel
carburetors that sat atop a log manifold, on an engine with a
three-quarter race cam that gave it a strange loping sound ... like
KER KER KERPLUNKA.
</P>
<P>
   So when I think about a growing problem for computer buyers
today _ hopped-up processor chips that are forced to run at a speed
beyond the design specifications _ I understand how much and how
little has changed. It's still all about speed just for the sake of
going fast. But the new status symbols are computers, not fast
cars.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, we tortured engines to get the most out of them, even
though we knew that shortened their life span. The same thing
happens with hopped-up computer chips: They live a short but
exciting life.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the frightening news, though: Some manufacturers and
retailers hop up the chip before you buy it and don't tell you.
Some unsuspecting customers pay extra for a computer with a high
megahertz rating and are actually buying a slower chip that has
been hopped up. That's where the short life span comes into play.
That hopped-up chip may run fine for a while but _ because of the
stress _ it ought to have a tattoo on it that says ``Born to Die.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand why Intel is worried about these hot-rod chips,
we'll have to talk about that mysterious megahertz rating, and
along the way, you'll learn something you probably didn't know. The
speed of a processor is determined by an oscillator that vibrates
electronically at a set frequency. It is called the ``clock'' for
the chip. Think of it as the pace car that determines how fast the
chip will run.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what newcomers to computing might not understand: Did you
know that a Pentium II running at 300 megahertz is identical inside
to a Pentium II running at, say, 450 megahertz? When I say
identical, I mean precisely that. That 300-megahertz chip comes off
the same production line as the 450-megahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens at Intel and other chip manufacturers: In a
process that any grocery store meat manager will recognize, the
best chips are clocked at the highest speeds and sold for a premium
price. It's just like selecting the best cuts of meat and labeling
them prime. The chips that didn't turn out quite as good are
clocked at lower speeds and sold for less.
</P>
<P>
   Some computer hobbyists have understood this clocking system for
years. And they've taken advantage of it to home-brew computers
that run faster, simply by changing a few settings on the
motherboard of the computer. Intel is not bothered by that at all.
After all, these folks have every right to trade longevity for
speed in their own computers.
</P>
<P>
   But what's scaring Intel these days is that some retailers and
manufacturers are overclocking chips and selling the machines at a
higher price without telling the buyer. In fact, Intel has warned
consumers about the problem and has even created a small program
that can be downloaded by the Intel Web site (http://www.intel.com)
that checks Pentium III chips for overclocking. That program won't
detect overclocking on earlier models of chips, including the
Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a way to protect yourself from overclocked
chips. Even Intel acknowledges that the problem is limited to
small, no-name manufacturers and retailers. So if you're worried
that you might be sold a hot rod of a computer that won't last,
then you can buy with safety from the brand-name companies.

 &HT;    Eyes of the Nation a superb look at history
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new CD-ROM from SouthPeak International called ``The Library
of Congress: Eyes of the Nation'' is a splendid reminder that the
Smithsonian Institution is not this nation's only repository of
historical documents and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Made up entirely of material from the library, and put together
largely by curators and experts, it is a multifaceted and
compelling look at the history of the United States, from the
continent's discovery to the present decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is divided into five main sections, beginning with an
introductory look at the library's special collections, which is
essentially everything not available to anyone who just drops in at
the library. The main experience is called Eyes of the Nation,
which is a fairly long study of U.S. history written by historian
Alan Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   The American Experience breaks down history by topics:
entertainment, exploration and settlement, the African-American
experience, the Native American experience, the American woman,
arts, entertainment, government, war, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Library of Congress exhibits document five special exhibits on
such narrow topics as British satirical images of the American
Revolution and Rosie the Riveter.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth section is called Gateways to American Memory, and
features essays on four of the most significant graphic periods of
American history: daguerreotypes, the craze for hand-drawn,
bird's-eye-view maps of cities, the work of the Farm Security
Administration photographers and the collection of Detroit
Publishing Co. The latter was one of the biggest postcard
publishers in the nation, and judging from the images displayed
here, its archives are truly a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sections, with the exception of the American
Experience, are narrated very professionally, with appropriate
background music. The narrations are very interesting and not very
long, and when they have concluded the viewer can browse through
the images at will.
</P>
<P>
   The images, incidentally, are not limited to photographs. There
are fantastic antique maps, paintings, sketches and prints, sheet
music, posters, cartoons, and documents. Each can be enlarged to
nearly full screen; some of the more interesting ones can be
enlarged in a zoom mode through which the viewer can manipulate a
box around the screen to see greater enlargement of sections.
</P>
<P>
   All images can be printed out. There is a built-in notepad, and
a means of putting together a portfolio and making a slide show.
Additionally, the whole CD is indexed. There are World Wide Web
hooks to more library information on nearly every general topic
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes of a Nation is the best-designed educational CD-ROM I've
encountered. Navigating through the disc is entirely intuitive and
smooth as silk.
</P>
<P>
   The CD offers a unique perspective on history, but more than
that, I believe, it reminds us of the splendor of the Library of
Congress, the world's largest library.
</P>
<P>
   It will make you want to camp on the library's doorstep and
spend every waking minute inside.
</P>
<P>
   While its $40 list price is a bit on the high side, I can find
only one problem with Eyes of the Nation. It's not long enough. One
can only hope for a DVD version.

 &HT;    The war of the handheld computers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First came the Newton, a hand-held computer which was shaped
like a brick and weighed like one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Apple's Newton never took off, and neither did
the market for hand-held computers. It took a light, pocket-sized
competitor called the PalmPilot to ignite popular interest.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot has sold nearly 3 million units, and its success
awakened the giant in Redmond, Wash., known as Microsoft.
Microsoft's entry into the market has spawned scores of new
hand-held computers, powered by a light version of its Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are plenty of models, and they come in all sizes,
colors and configurations. But don't be fooled. There's less
variety than meets the eye. Most hand-held computers are pretty
much alike. They track appointments, keep telephone numbers and let
you take notes. A growing number of hand-helds also let you send
and receive e-mail or browse the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The more-powerful models, which are also larger and heavier,
also let you write memos and create spreadsheets. Hand-helds range
in price from $199 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held market has become a smaller version of the one for
desktop and notebook computers. There are really only two choices:
hand-helds running Windows and the three PalmPilot models, which
use a unique operating system and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds familiar, right? It's Microsoft leading a pack of clones
challenged by one upstart. There is, however, a key difference.
PalmPilot's parent, 3Com, has learned from Apple's mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, 3Com designed its PalmPilots to work smoothly with
Windows-driven computers. It released the Palm OS, or operating
system, to all comers, generating a large choice of software for
users. There are some 3,000 titles to choose from today.
</P>
<P>
   In short, PalmPilot has clung to the underbelly of Microsoft
like a remora to a shark. The PalmPilot has fed off Windows'
success but avoided the powerful jaws of its host. At least so far.
</P>
<P>
   While largely similar, PalmPilot and Windows hand-held computers
do have some important differences. The biggest, of course, is the
operating system. That software controls the workings of any
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Most hand-held models now run Windows CE, a slimmed-down version
of the Windows operating system running on 90 percent of all
computers. You'll recognize the familiar Start button on the bottom
screen of any hand-held running Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   The use of Windows lets hand-helds run slimmer versions of
Microsoft's other ubiquitous software such as Word and Excel.
PalmPilot models cannot run Word or Excel, although there are other
software programs designed for them that perform the same word
processing and spreadsheet functions.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some hardware distinctions between Windows and
Palm hand-helds. Some of the Windows hand-helds, for example, let
you record simple voice messages. Philips' Nino is one example.
</P>
<P>
   And other, bigger models of Windows hand-helds include small
keyboards so you can write memos and crunch numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Windows CE hand-helds, such as the Nino, let you
record a simple message. Others, such as models by Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, let you write memos and create spreadsheets with
scaled-down versions of Microsoft Word and Excel. Your work can
then be seamlessly shipped onto a desktop or portable computer for
use.
</P>
<P>
   This, Microsoft executives argue, is the key advantage of
hand-held computers running their software. ``You're going Windows
to Windows,'' says Marty Paradise, general manager of Microsoft's
Atlanta-based Southeast District office. ``It's a seamless
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, adds Paradise, there'll be more and better software
for hand-helds running Windows CE because of the millions of
developers already writing for the Windows platform.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot executives, of course, dismiss this advantage. ``It
turns out that what's really important isn't matching operating
systems, but fast, error-free seamless synchronization,'' says E.
Michael Lunsford, a Palm senior product manager.
</P>
<P>
   And, so far, the market for hand-helds has not given the
advantage to hand-helds running Windows. There are three PalmPilots
in circulation for every one Windows CE counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been successful because we built, from the ground up, a
simple, straightforward, intuitive interface with an operating
system designed for the hand-held space,'' says Lunsford.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's early in the game. Especially for Microsoft,
which tends to gather steam in releasing better and more powerful
versions of its products over time.
</P>
<P>
   A simple test drive of a PalmPilot and a Philips Nino running
Windows shows the strengths and weaknesses of each platform.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot is clearly simpler and more portable. You can run
it without ever reading a manual. But the PalmPilot is not as
powerful as a Windows hand-held. These machines can do many more
things. But with power comes complexity. You definitely need to
read the manual with a Windows hand-held, especially if you're used
to a Mac.
</P>
<P>

   COXNET PTECH _The cell phone, which turns 15 this year, has
displaced lots of calls that once were made on desk phones. Many
pay phones are unoccupied in busy passageways such as those in
airports. No need to scramble for coins or stand in lines, because
so many people are carrying their own phones. Welcome to the
wireless generation. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

sake of going fast. But the new status symbols are computers, not
fast cars. (Husted, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>

Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>

 &HT;    Forgiving Elia Kazan
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 1976 memoir of the Holocaust, ``The Sunflower,'' Nazi
hunter Simon Wiesenthal recalls how as a young concentration inmate
he was called to the deathbed of a grotesquely wounded SS officer.
The SS man begged Wiesenthal, as a Jew, to forgive his role in a
wartime atrocity. Wiesenthal thought about it, then refused. He had
no right, Wiesenthal reasoned, to forgive on behalf of the victims.
Wiesenthal asked his readers what they might have done. Good
question.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary film director Elia Kazan was honored the other
night with an Oscar for his lifetime achievements. Outside, pickets
protested. Inside, many refused to rise in respect. Elia Kazan had
once named names. The names were those of friends, who Kazan
identified as Communists before the infamous House Un-American
Activities Committee. Now an old man, and either out of pride or
conviction, Kazan has refused to seek forgiveness or to apologize
for the pain he caused..
</P>
<P>
   Life is filled with close calls. This is one. Kazan was not
being honored for his life, but for his directorial
accomplishments. Only the victims have a right to forgive. We have
no right to feel more virtuous than we are. Let him have his award.
He has earned it, if not our respect as a man.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not meant to be like this. With the single currency
comfortably in place, spring was supposed to bring a general
tidying up in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There would be radical changes to the European Union's farm
policy, a wider reform of its entire budget, and then a final
making ready to receive applicants from the east.
</P>
<P>
   With a new government firmly in place, Germany, as current
president of the EU, would hold a triumphant summit in its
once-and-future capital Berlin, on March 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of its presidency in midsummer, a new chairman of the
EU's executive, the commission, would have been chosen; a new
European Parliament would have been elected; and the way would be
clear to start serious talks to admit new members.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the EU has lost the entire commission and Germany, the
Union's biggest economic power as well as its president, has lost
its finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is, undeniably, awkward, yet good can come of all
this confusion.
</P>
<P>
   It will do so if the chance is taken to rid the EU of some of
its Mediterranean practices, exploiting the Union's more northern
balance and mores; and if Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder,
can make up his mind about what he wants to do with the new power
he holds, and then use it well.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, neither outcome is at all certain. The immediate
task is the appointment of a new commission. The trouble with the
old one was not just that its members, or at least some of them,
were complaisant about fraud, cronyism and mismanagement _ as an
independent committee found this week, making it impossible for
this lot to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   It was also that the commission's president, Jacques Santer, was
too weak to control them. The next president needs to be stronger.
For a period, someone not censured in the report, Sir Leon Brittan
perhaps, might take over. But the sooner a permanent appointment is
made, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The new president needs to be strong enough to keep his troops
in line, to command the ear of heads of government, and to have the
confidence of Euro-MPs. Italy's Romano Prodi, having squeezed Italy
into the euro, might be such a man.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament has, on the whole, come well out of this episode.
Like the Council of Ministers, it has been accruing power at the
commission's expense. Yet it too suffers from weak leadership, and
is hardly a paragon of financial rectitude.
</P>
<P>
   It needs to attend to its own faults if it is to exercise better
control over the executive, bringing to an end, in particular, its
expensive dual life in Brussels and Strasbourg. Best stick to
Brussels, even though this would require a treaty change.
</P>
<P>
   The main business before the EU is expansion. A new
inter-governmental conference will be needed to reform the Union's
institutions to accommodate its new members.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of this week's damning report, it should also
strengthen the provisions for accountability and control.
</P>
<P>
   One improvement would be to allow the president, with the
approval of the parliament, to sack individual commissioners.
Another would be to open up Council of Ministers' meetings to
public scrutiny when the ministers are legislating.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, however, the budget must be settled, and the
responsibility for that rests largely with Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin summit next week will be Schroder's first unambiguous
test. So far, he has been able to blame his government's long list
of failures on others: his Green partners, who have helped to
antagonize so many companies with their anti-nuclear and other
policies; the opposition, which has frustrated Schroder's proposed
rewriting of Germany's citizenship laws; and, most notably, his
turbulent finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who flounced out on
March 11.
</P>
<P>
   With Lafontaine gone, the tug-of-war at the center of government
should also be gone. The Greens are cowed, at least for the moment.
And Schroder is expected to take over Lafontaine's other job, the
chairmanship of the Social Democratic Party, on April 14, leaving
him free, in theory, to pursue his politics of the ``New Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder faces two general difficulties, however, and one
particular one.
</P>
<P>
   First, he has to show that he really has some sense of what he
wants to achieve;he has, in other words, to dismiss the impression
that he has no central values and no clear idea of how Germany, or
indeed Europe, should be run.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he has still to reform his party, which has been
subjected to none of the colonic irrigation of that other New
Middler, the British Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
   And then, unrelated to these general concerns, and perhaps even
harder to achieve, he has to cajole the other 14 members of the EU
into accepting a budgetary arrangement that makes it possible for
newcomers to join. The miserable deal reached by the Union's farm
ministers on March 11 is not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   However, the events of the past ten days have at least provided
the possibility of better outcomes. German politics should be less
confused. European politics should be more open and accountable,
less off-putting to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, time is short. If Europe's leaders are serious about
reform and about opening the way for the EU's overdue expansion,
hard decisions must be taken within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin summit that produces just fudge and waffle will only
confirm doubters in their belief that the Union is incapable of
putting its house in order, let alone opening its doors to
newcomers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, conventional wisdom held that Latin America would
easily weather the Asian financial storm. While economies crumbled
on one side of the Pacific, free-market reforms would pay off on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although Latin stock markets have recently rallied, the
outlook remains gloomy. Brazil faces its steepest economic decline
since the early 1980s. Ecuador is having its worst financial crisis
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect a fall of 1.5 percent in Latin American GDP
this year; and net inflows of private foreign capital will shrink
from $80 billion in 1998 to around $50 billion. Can anything be
done to make Latin America less vulnerable and less volatile?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. A first step is simply more of the same. Most
governments have reacted responsibly to the past year's turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign finance has dried up, governments have tightened
their fiscal belts and raised interest rates. There has been no
giving in to populism or to protectionist pressures. Maintaining
this resolve is a precondition for greater stability.
</P>
<P>
   But the region has not been uniform in its newfound virtue _ and
it is the most prudent that have fared best. Although every Latin
American country has found it more expensive to tap external
capital, those with sound budgets (such as Mexico, Peru and Chile)
have been hit less hard.
</P>
<P>
   While several countries have suffered from financial contagion
or plunging commodity prices, the biggest weaknesses have often
been self-inflicted: in particular, politically difficult fiscal
reforms have been put off for too long.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, notably, fiscal reform must mean more than simply
abiding by the recent IMF agreement. This agreement was a clever
compromise between the economically desirable and the politically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But, rather like a crash diet for a compulsive eater, it does
not solve the underlying problem _ and it could have unwelcome side
effects. Distortionary tax increases hurt the private sector; the
root cause of public profligacy, which is excess spending on wages
and pensions, remains untackled.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve stability, Brazil must find a more sensible tax
structure, get better control of fiscally lax state governments and
reform its public pensions.
</P>
<P>
   A second path to virtue is to be found in better risk
management. Even countries with healthy budgets could do more to
insulate themselves from capital-market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Careful debt-management strategies that avoid short-term
borrowing or the bunching of maturities and hedge against
interest-rate or exchange-rate swings should come high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening the region's commercial banks should be another
priority. A big reason for Ecuador's current mess is its weak
banks. In a region with such a history of volatility, banks also
need quicker access to cash.
</P>
<P>
   High reserve requirements, especially against foreign borrowing,
are one option. Another is to encourage contingent arrangements
with foreign banks that guarantee limited credit lines in advance.
A third is to encourage the internationalization of the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   As Argentina has found in recent years, a bigger role for
foreign banks usually means a safer banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The other, more controversial, matter that needs attention is
exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pegged but adjustable currency regimes such as Brazil's have
been discredited by the recent crisis. So far, the preference has
mostly been for free floating _ witness Mexico, Brazil, even
Ecuador. But the wholly opposite notion of ``dollarization'' is
also gaining support.
</P>
<P>
   Dollarization is, in essence, merely a stronger version of the
currency boards that seem to have protected countries such as
Argentina from financial contagion.
</P>
<P>
   Even places without a currency board are already heavily
dollarized: that is, many people hold their assets in greenbacks
rather than domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
   At the first sign of trouble, investors across Latin America
tend to flee to dollars. So many countries suffer the volatility of
floating currencies without the benefits of flexibility _ for if
they try to cut interest rates or prop up their banks, their
currency tends to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That gives dollarization its appeal. But it is not a panacea.
Important questions, such as how to create a limited lender of last
resort, need to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, which is toying with dollarization, has thought up
ingenious schemes for using seignorage revenue (returned from
America) as collateral for private credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it will be more feasible in small, open
economies than in big, closed ones such as Brazil's, where the
consequent abnegation of monetary policy would be hugely
controversial. But it should be considered as a serious option for
some Latin American countries. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE _ There is nothing quite like the peace dividend for
creating civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the citizens of Orange County, Calif.,
would relish the chance of getting their hands on 4,700 acres of
prime property, particularly when a single acre in the area can
fetch as much as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the decommissioning of the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station has created the biggest row in the county for decades. It
has set neighbors against neighbors, Republicans against
Republicans, the filthy rich against the disgustingly affluent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the citizens of Newport Beach have been irritated by
the growing number of aircraft using John Wayne Airport. (It is
regarded as a local tragedy that the city's most popular former
resident has given his name to its least popular institution.)
</P>
<P>
   They have also been worried that air traffic will grow hugely
with federal deregulation in 2005. After news came through in 1993
that the local Marine base was being decommissioned, George
Argyros, a leading citizen of Newport Beach, spent about $1 million
promoting a ballot measure to turn the base into a commercial
airport.
</P>
<P>
   El Toro may be only seven miles away from John Wayne Airport,
but Argyros correctly sensed that seven miles could as well be 170.
Moving the airport even such a short distance diverts the flight
path from Newport Beach to Irvine and seven other cities farther
south.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was carried by a tiny majority, 51 percent, and
ever since then the citizens of Irvine have been stretching
ingenuity to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most arguments in the area are discreetly solved by the Irvine
Company, which owns more than a fifth of the county. But this time
the company is keeping studiously silent, probably because it owns
land on both sides of the noise divide. This means that the
citizens have the unfamiliar task of sorting things out for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are making heavy weather of it. The County Board of
Supervisors, which is split three-to-two in favor of the new
airport, is frequently paralyzed by airport-related bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican political machine is divided down the middle on
the issue; in particular the Lincoln Club, one of the biggest
collections of Republican moneybags in Southern California, is
losing key members because of its support for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings in Irvine are running so high that ways are being
explored of ending the subsidies it pays to the fire departments of
cities that support the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so explosive that all the local papers have
assigned at least one full-time reporter to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine town council has set up no fewer than five committees
to fight the airport. Christina Shea, Irvine's glamorously blonde
mayor, admits to devoting half her time to fighting the airport _
and thinks it could get to be more than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the death,'' she argues. ``It's our Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine and its allies have no shortage of arguments against the
airport. The ballot violated the proper procedures for
decommissioning bases.
</P>
<P>
   The hills behind the base are so high that they pose a safety
hazard. The planned doubling of the size of Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) means there will be no need for yet
another international airport in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real reason why Irvine's citizens hate the airport is
that it will threaten their (somewhat peculiar) quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine is a planned community where you cannot change the color
of your door without getting permission. But the new airport may
introduce all sorts of unplanned things from junk-food joints to
(if LAX is anything to go by) strip clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Laguna Woods is the only city in the United States
that consists almost entirely of people aged 55 and over: the
airport will send air traffic directly over its plush golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Newport Beach crowd have outmaneuvered their
opponents at every point. They have managed to persuade the north
of the county (which contains 70 percent of the population) that
the new airport will be good for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So the airport's opponents are trying two loosely related
tactics: putting a measure on the ballot to require a two-thirds
vote before public money can be used to support ``noxious'' land
uses; and a grand ``millennium plan'' which involves buying the air
base and turning it into an ``urban village,'' complete with
houses, offices, a sports complex and parkland.
</P>
<P>
   For all their political naivete, however, the airport's
opponents have two important things on their side: the glacial pace
of the American legal system and an iron determination to prevent
the ``incursion of the airport into our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   They are willing to spend whatever it takes to delay the
proposed airport for years, perhaps decades, to come.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving such a valuable piece of land empty for the foreseeable
future might seem folly. But the strength of the passions involved
may mean that there is no other choice: unless, that is, both sides
decide to give the land back to the Marines. &QL;

<P>
   IRVINE _ There is nothing quite like the peace dividend for
creating civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that the citizens of Orange County, Calif.,
would relish the chance of getting their hands on 4,700 acres of
prime property, particularly when a single acre in the area can
fetch as much as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the decommissioning of the El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station has created the biggest row in the county for decades. It
has set neighbors against neighbors, Republicans against
Republicans, the filthy rich against the disgustingly affluent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the citizens of Newport Beach have been irritated by
the growing number of aircraft using John Wayne Airport. (It is
regarded as a local tragedy that the city's most popular former
resident has given his name to its least popular institution.)
</P>
<P>
   They have also been worried that air traffic will grow hugely
with federal deregulation in 2005. After news came through in 1993
that the local Marine base was being decommissioned, George
Argyros, a leading citizen of Newport Beach, spent about $1 million
promoting a ballot measure to turn the base into a commercial
airport.
</P>
<P>
   El Toro may be only seven miles away from John Wayne Airport,
but Argyros correctly sensed that seven miles could as well be 170.
Moving the airport even such a short distance diverts the flight
path from Newport Beach to Irvine and seven other cities farther
south.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was carried by a tiny majority, 51 percent, and
ever since then the citizens of Irvine have been stretching
ingenuity to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Most arguments in the area are discreetly solved by the Irvine
Company, which owns more than a fifth of the county. But this time
the company is keeping studiously silent, probably because it owns
land on both sides of the noise divide. This means that the
citizens have the unfamiliar task of sorting things out for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are making heavy weather of it. The County Board of
Supervisors, which is split three-to-two in favor of the new
airport, is frequently paralyzed by airport-related bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican political machine is divided down the middle on
the issue; in particular the Lincoln Club, one of the biggest
collections of Republican moneybags in Southern California, is
losing key members because of its support for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Feelings in Irvine are running so high that ways are being
explored of ending the subsidies it pays to the fire departments of
cities that support the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so explosive that all the local papers have
assigned at least one full-time reporter to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine town council has set up no fewer than five committees
to fight the airport. Christina Shea, Irvine's glamorously blonde
mayor, admits to devoting half her time to fighting the airport _
and thinks it could get to be more than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the death,'' she argues. ``It's our Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvine and its allies have no shortage of arguments against the
airport. The ballot violated the proper procedures for
decommissioning bases.
</P>
<P>
   The hills behind the base are so high that they pose a safety
hazard. The planned doubling of the size of Los Angeles
International Airport (LAX) means there will be no need for yet
another international airport in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real reason why Irvine's citizens hate the airport is
that it will threaten their (somewhat peculiar) quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine is a planned community where you cannot change the color
of your door without getting permission. But the new airport may

   PRISTINA _ ``What are we without you, our holy ground? I'm not
giving up what's mine to anybody, even if I perish with it. Even if
the skies open, and even if judgment day comes, we will stay here
where our roots are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the chilling new jingle broadcast by Serbia's state-run
television with the main evening news, even as NATO has been
revving up its own war machine in an increasingly desperate effort
to impose a peace on the battered Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Serbia's delegation to the second round of peace talks in
Paris this week makes an 11th-hour about-face, negotiations with
the Contact Group _ America, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Russia _ over a peace deal look set to end abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs still reject the deal that would give broad autonomy
to the Kosovars, with some 28,000 NATO-led peacekeepers
guaranteeing peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a climb-down by Slobodan Milosevic, technically the
president of Yugoslavia but still in effect the boss of Serbia, its
main part, diplomacy now seems exhausted _ though the talks' two
co-sponsors, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his
French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, were expected to make a
last-minute appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Western embassies in Belgrade have again been preparing to
evacuate their staff in preparation for oft-threatened NATO air
strikes against military targets in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, say members of his much-reshuffled inner circle, is
still keeping his options open. But they are narrowing fast.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks in France last month went his way. To
the annoyance of Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state,
the divided delegation representing Kosovo's Albanian majority
refused to accept the deal. That weakened NATO's ability to squeeze
the even more recalcitrant Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, however, the leaders of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) agreed to the deal. Milosevic's team in Paris
have been trying in vain to reopen it. But, if anything, Serb
intransigence seems to have united the sometimes fractious Contact
Group in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strong-arm tactics on the ground have also
backfired. Since the earlier talks fizzled out on Feb. 23, Kosovo
has seen some of the worst fighting since last October, when, under
NATO pressure, Milosevic agreed to halt his offensive, reduce his
forces and cooperate with unarmed ``verifiers'' from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   That agreement is now in tatters. More than 80,000 ethnic
Albanians have fled their homes over the past three weeks, as more
Serb troops have been moved in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic was trying to provoke the KLA into abandoning
the deal, he miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   His next gamble is probably that NATO's missile threats will
prove hollow. Since they were first made last year, western
embassies have twice evacuated staff, while the threats have yet to
be made good.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has probably lost count of the number of western and
Russian emissaries to his palace in Belgrade. But a western
mediator in Paris has warned the Serbs that air strikes would come
in days, rather than weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unperturbed, Milosevic seems to be digging his heels
in more deeply. He sacked the generals who advised him six months
ago to make concessions to NATO and accept a cease-fire, and
replaced them with loyal hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   They have told their commander-in-chief that to allow NATO
troops into Kosovo without a fight might be a final humiliating
blow to his regime. Many Serbs already blame Milosevic for losing
former Serb lands in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is closer to home, its ancient Orthodox monasteries a
symbol, if rarely visited, of Serbia's birthright.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, increasingly fed up with Milosevic and the burden
of sustaining his bankrupt economy with cheap gas, publicly oppose
NATO air strikes but have refused to break a U.N. arms embargo
against Yugoslavia or give it sophisticated air-defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav armed forces are in no position to resist NATO,
which is why they are being dispersed around Serbia for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic may be hoping that NATO will settle for hitting a few
remote installations, causing little real damage to his army. That
would allow him to channel popular anger towards the United States,
and away from himself, while he capitulated on Kosovo to save the
Serb nation from further harm.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a risky gamble. And NATO has its own credibility
to think of. It is due to celebrate its 50th anniversary next
month. Milosevic will not be allowed to spoil the party. &QL;

   Alexis De Tocqueville originally traveled to the United States
in 1831 to study not the country's political institutions but its
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   These were an object of great curiosity in Europe because the
United States had embarked on a bold experiment: to rehabilitate
criminals through a strict regime of solitary confinement, silence
and hard work in a newly created institution, the ``penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville was not impressed by what he found. America's social
reformers, he said, were in the grip of a ``monomania'' and seemed
to believe that prisons were a ``remedy for all the evils of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades that monomania has again gripped
America, and it shows few signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the
nation's prison and jail population has increased yet again, by 4.4
percent to 1.8 million in the year to June 1998. This represents
slower growth than the annual average of 6.2 percent since 1990, or
the 5.9 percent growth in 1997. But it is not much of a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable is the fact that America's prison population
continues to grow at such a steady pace in the teeth of two other
facts: rates of reported crime have fallen for each of the past six
years, and America has already locked up more people than any
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of imprisonment in America is now unmatched in any
democracy, and is greater than even most totalitarian governments
have ever attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year one in every 150 American residents (children
included) was behind bars. The rate of incarceration, at 668
inmates per 100,000 residents, is five to ten times the rates of
countries in Western Europe, six times the rate in Canada and
nearly 20 times that in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans in prison has nearly quadrupled since
1980 and more than doubled since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Only Russia imprisons a larger proportion of its people but, at
the current rate of increase, America should win the top spot in a
year or two. Because of its larger population, America already has
more people behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Is this extraordinary experiment in mass imprisonment working?
It seems to beggar belief that the fall in crime in recent years
does not have something to do with the increase in imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   But so many factors influence the level of crime _ demographic,
economic and cultural _ that it is difficult to establish a link
between any single policy and the overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, there are reasons to doubt that mass imprisonment
can take the lion's share of the credit. In some places where crime
has dropped most, such as New York, the incarceration rate is not
as high and has not risen as fast as the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Although crime has decreased nationally since 1991, that drop
came after a seven-year rise in crime even though the prison
population expanded by 77 percent during the same period, points
out Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the effect of increased imprisonment could have been
delayed, producing a lower crime rate in subsequent years. But even
today the level of violent crime in America is still about the same
as in the mid-1980s, when 1 million fewer people were in prison or
jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report published in January, arrests
for murder, rape and robbery declined sharply between 1990 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The prison and jail populations have soared not because the
police are catching more violent criminals, but because sentences
have been lengthened and probation severely curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is one type of crime where mass imprisonment
seems to have failed abysmally _ illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Since America panicked over the crack epidemic ten years ago,
toughening drug laws at both the federal and state level, the
number of people imprisoned for illegal drug use or trafficking has
quadrupled, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 people are now imprisoned for drug offenses, a
larger number than those in prison for all crimes in England,
France, Germany and Japan combined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such large-scale imprisonment, the number of people
abusing drugs has not changed since 1988, according to the National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1997, the most recent available.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that about 14 million people had used
illegal drugs, and 600,000 had smoked crack cocaine, in the month
before the survey, the same figures found by the survey a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The costs, both financial and social, of mass imprisonment have
been high. Ballooning prison budgets have squeezed out spending on
education and other social programs in states throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The toll on the black community has been especially heavy.
Blacks comprise 12 percent of the American population, but
represent nearly half of those in prison or jail.
</P>
<P>
   The incarceration rate for black men, according to figures
published last year, is eight times that for white men. About one
in every 12 black men aged between 25 and 29 is currently behind
bars, ten times the rate among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Many are there not for violent offenses, but for breaking the
drug laws, which seem aimed directly at blacks.
</P>
<P>
   For example the penalty for possessing five grams of crack
cocaine, the form most widely used in black districts, is the same
as the penalty for possessing 100 times as much of the powdered
variety, which whites prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not prison works as a crime-fighting tool, how much
further down the road of ever more frequent imprisonment can
America go? &QL;

   Alexis De Tocqueville originally traveled to the United States
in 1831 to study not the country's political institutions but its
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   These were an object of great curiosity in Europe because the
United States had embarked on a bold experiment: to rehabilitate
criminals through a strict regime of solitary confinement, silence
and hard work in a newly created institution, the ``penitentiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocqueville was not impressed by what he found. America's social
reformers, he said, were in the grip of a ``monomania'' and seemed
to believe that prisons were a ``remedy for all the evils of
society.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oracle's boss, Larry Ellison, likes to describe competing with
Microsoft in apocalyptic terms: ``It's Microsoft against mankind,
and mankind isn't winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that Bill Gates's firm should be broken up for
repeated antitrust violations. For its part, Microsoft sneers at
the bombastic Ellison as a failed visionary whose attempts to
supplant the PC with a low-cost browser-based ``network computer''
went nowhere with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the funny thing is that, until now, neither firm has really
competed head-on against the other, even in databases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's database, SQL Server 6.5, was a lightweight compared
with Oracle's, suitable only for departmental use and smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Oracle benefited from the success of Microsoft's
Windows NT operating system for business users, selling many more
databases than it would have had it been confined to the
slower-growing Unix system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, nearly 30 percent of Oracle's database sales came from
its share of the NT market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has long been eyeing the $9.5 billion-a-year
relational database market. In January it pounced, with SQL Server
7.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doug Leland, the Microsoft manager responsible for
marketing the new database, SQL 7 ``is a stake in the ground that
puts us squarely into the enterprise class.'' He adds ominously:
``Our friends in Redwood Shores (where Oracle is based) are going
to feel the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the database market has begun to matter to
Microsoft. Databases are the all-important platform for
``enterprise resource planning'' (ERP) applications, pioneered by
Germany's SAP, which have revolutionized the business processes of
large companies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new emphasis on mining data to get a detailed
understanding of what is really going on inside a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft needs SQL 7 to help spearhead its next release of NT,
christened Windows 2000, which it claims will be able to run even
the most powerful server computers that currently rely on different
types of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has worked closely with consulting firms and big ERP
suppliers, such as SAP and PeopleSoft (though not, oddly enough,
with Oracle), to create a platform that they can recommend even to
their biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 is indeed a ``good enough'' database, according to Betsy
Burton, a consultant at Gartmore. It will support
online-transaction processing by about 500 concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   That number will grow when Windows 2000 is launched towards the
end of this year and Intel's powerful new Xeon processors also
become available.
</P>
<P>
   But, as always with Microsoft, the database's success will
depend less on its own qualities than on the company's sheer market
power.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 will be bundled with other Microsoft products, such as
BackOffice, attracting price-conscious companies. A further $600
million has been earmarked to sweeten contracts with inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has nearly $20 billion in cash, waiting to be siphoned
into grabbing extra market share when needed. It will also use the
clout it gets from the NT operating system to win the backing of
hardware firms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most crucially, Microsoft will have strong support from
the dominant ERP supplier, SAP, because of the German firm's own
rivalry with Oracle in the business-applications market.
</P>
<P>
   Against such an onslaught, many firms would panic. And for
Sybase and Informix, relative minnows of the database industry, the
prospects indeed look cloudy. But Oracle is not without advantages
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 has fewer features than Oracle 8, the latest release of
Oracle's database, and it cannot match its performance. In
particular, Oracle 8 will support a couple of thousand, as opposed
to a few hundred, concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   With Unix now the preferred platform for ``mission critical''
applications, SQL 7's restriction to running only on NT guarantees
Oracle a lock on the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also has a large installed base. It dominates the Unix
market and provides over 40 percent of the databases that run on
NT. Oracle also claims that 87 percent of Fortune 500 companies
have an Oracle database; and that today a majority of ERP
applications run on Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Because database customers do not like to chop and change, it is
almost inconceivable that Oracle users will suddenly switch to SQL
7, however tempting the price.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives Oracle most confidence is the conviction that
computing is moving its way. Although Ellison was wrong about the
network computer, he is probably right to say that ``the Internet
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is betting on a type of Internet computing in which
applications are centrally managed, backed up and administered.
Users will gain access to information and applications using a
browser that can run on a personal computer or an even simpler
device.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle may charge more than Microsoft, but it says that the
extra costs of running SQL 7 on NT more than offset any saving. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To ram home the message, Oracle has this month released Oracle
8i, which is designed to be not just a database, but a complete
platform for Internet computing.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle believes that the rigors of doing business on the
Internet are creating a demand for ever more sophisticated database
technology, and that 8i will be a natural choice for electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Firms now need not only to give their employees access to a
database, but also to extend parts of their database to customers
through corporate ``extranets'' or the public Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With customers doing their own ordering and billing through the
Internet, databases must be able to handle vast numbers of
concurrent users and provide information fast.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle claims that the ten most-visited consumer websites,
including Yahoo! and America Online, are powered by its databases,
as are the ten biggest business websites (with one exception:
www.ibm.com). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i should tighten the company's grip on the exploding
e-commerce database market, where IBM is its main competitor. But
it has another purpose too.
</P>
<P>
   By incorporating software that allows traditional files to be
stored and managed by the database, Oracle 8i also removes the need
for a big, all-purpose operating system, such as Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize this, Oracle has joined Sun Microsystems to create
an Intel-based server, called the ``Oracle 8i appliance,'' with an
Oracle database and its own simple operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to use out of the box, this, Oracle says, is a cheaper and
less complex alternative to a database that runs on NT, because it
minimizes the cost and complication of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several large computer makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and Dell, have already said they will sell their own versions of
the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With much of their distribution aimed at small and medium-sized
firms, the machine will take the fight to Microsoft. As Merv
Adrian, an analyst with Giga Information Group, puts it,
``Microsoft is playing the commodity card, but Oracle has gone one
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who _ apart from customers _ will win this database war? The
answer depends to some extent on Windows 2000. Until it is
established, SQL 7 will be a capable, cheap database in search of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   More decisive, however, will be the speed with which the
Internet approach to computing that Oracle preaches takes off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Oracle not only remains in pole position, but has the
more compelling vision. That said, few firms can play catch-up to
more devastating effect than Microsoft. &QL;

the bombastic Ellison as a failed visionary whose attempts to
supplant the PC with a low-cost browser-based ``network computer''
went nowhere with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the funny thing is that, until now, neither firm has really
competed head-on against the other, even in databases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's database, SQL Server 6.5, was a lightweight compared
with Oracle's, suitable only for departmental use and smaller
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Oracle benefited from the success of Microsoft's
Windows NT operating system for business users, selling many more
databases than it would have had it been confined to the
slower-growing Unix system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, nearly 30 percent of Oracle's database sales came from
its share of the NT market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft has long been eyeing the $9.5 billion-a-year
relational database market. In January it pounced, with SQL Server
7.
</P>
<P>
   According to Doug Leland, the Microsoft manager responsible for
marketing the new database, SQL 7 ``is a stake in the ground that
puts us squarely into the enterprise class.'' He adds ominously:
``Our friends in Redwood Shores (where Oracle is based) are going
to feel the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the database market has begun to matter to
Microsoft. Databases are the all-important platform for
``enterprise resource planning'' (ERP) applications, pioneered by
Germany's SAP, which have revolutionized the business processes of
large companies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new emphasis on mining data to get a detailed
understanding of what is really going on inside a firm.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft needs SQL 7 to help spearhead its next release of NT,
christened Windows 2000, which it claims will be able to run even
the most powerful server computers that currently rely on different
types of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has worked closely with consulting firms and big ERP
suppliers, such as SAP and PeopleSoft (though not, oddly enough,
with Oracle), to create a platform that they can recommend even to
their biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 is indeed a ``good enough'' database, according to Betsy
Burton, a consultant at Gartmore. It will support
online-transaction processing by about 500 concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   That number will grow when Windows 2000 is launched towards the
end of this year and Intel's powerful new Xeon processors also
become available.
</P>
<P>
   But, as always with Microsoft, the database's success will
depend less on its own qualities than on the company's sheer market
power.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 will be bundled with other Microsoft products, such as
BackOffice, attracting price-conscious companies. A further $600
million has been earmarked to sweeten contracts with inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has nearly $20 billion in cash, waiting to be siphoned
into grabbing extra market share when needed. It will also use the
clout it gets from the NT operating system to win the backing of
hardware firms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most crucially, Microsoft will have strong support from
the dominant ERP supplier, SAP, because of the German firm's own
rivalry with Oracle in the business-applications market.
</P>
<P>
   Against such an onslaught, many firms would panic. And for
Sybase and Informix, relative minnows of the database industry, the
prospects indeed look cloudy. But Oracle is not without advantages
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   SQL 7 has fewer features than Oracle 8, the latest release of
Oracle's database, and it cannot match its performance. In
particular, Oracle 8 will support a couple of thousand, as opposed
to a few hundred, concurrent users.
</P>
<P>
   With Unix now the preferred platform for ``mission critical''
applications, SQL 7's restriction to running only on NT guarantees
Oracle a lock on the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle also has a large installed base. It dominates the Unix
market and provides over 40 percent of the databases that run on
NT. Oracle also claims that 87 percent of Fortune 500 companies
have an Oracle database; and that today a majority of ERP
applications run on Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Because database customers do not like to chop and change, it is
almost inconceivable that Oracle users will suddenly switch to SQL
7, however tempting the price.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives Oracle most confidence is the conviction that
computing is moving its way. Although Ellison was wrong about the
network computer, he is probably right to say that ``the Internet
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is betting on a type of Internet computing in which
applications are centrally managed, backed up and administered.
Users will gain access to information and applications using a
browser that can run on a personal computer or an even simpler
device.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle may charge more than Microsoft, but it says that the
extra costs of running SQL 7 on NT more than offset any saving. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   To ram home the message, Oracle has this month released Oracle
8i, which is designed to be not just a database, but a complete
platform for Internet computing.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle believes that the rigors of doing business on the
Internet are creating a demand for ever more sophisticated database
technology, and that 8i will be a natural choice for electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Firms now need not only to give their employees access to a
database, but also to extend parts of their database to customers
through corporate ``extranets'' or the public Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With customers doing their own ordering and billing through the
Internet, databases must be able to handle vast numbers of
concurrent users and provide information fast.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle claims that the ten most-visited consumer websites,
including Yahoo! and America Online, are powered by its databases,
as are the ten biggest business websites (with one exception:
www.ibm.com). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i should tighten the company's grip on the exploding
e-commerce database market, where IBM is its main competitor. But
it has another purpose too.
</P>
<P>
   By incorporating software that allows traditional files to be
stored and managed by the database, Oracle 8i also removes the need
for a big, all-purpose operating system, such as Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize this, Oracle has joined Sun Microsystems to create
an Intel-based server, called the ``Oracle 8i appliance,'' with an
Oracle database and its own simple operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to use out of the box, this, Oracle says, is a cheaper and
less complex alternative to a database that runs on NT, because it
minimizes the cost and complication of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several large computer makers, including Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and Dell, have already said they will sell their own versions of
the appliance.
</P>
<P>
   With much of their distribution aimed at small and medium-sized
firms, the machine will take the fight to Microsoft. As Merv
Adrian, an analyst with Giga Information Group, puts it,
``Microsoft is playing the commodity card, but Oracle has gone one
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who _ apart from customers _ will win this database war? The
answer depends to some extent on Windows 2000. Until it is
established, SQL 7 will be a capable, cheap database in search of
an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   More decisive, however, will be the speed with which the
Internet approach to computing that Oracle preaches takes off.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Oracle not only remains in pole position, but has the
more compelling vision. That said, few firms can play catch-up to
more devastating effect than Microsoft. &QL;

   Oracle's boss, Larry Ellison, likes to describe competing with
Microsoft in apocalyptic terms: ``It's Microsoft against mankind,
and mankind isn't winning.''

repeated antitrust violations. For its part, Microsoft sneers at

<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scope out the course beforehand, says Ilene Sokoloff, who used
to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in
advance so the client understands he's your guest. Have a gift
waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scrimp on anything. If the client needs golf balls, don't
buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a foursome. Invite two other people who will interest or
be of help to your client and who will help keep the conversation
moving, says Rhame. Or let the client bring someone, says Bill
Storer, who runs Business Golf Strategies in Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Pulitano, CEO of Computing Concepts, a computer integrating
company, played with a client who was a purchasing agent, and the
client brought his father, who was a purchasing agent for another
company. ``We picked up another account,'' says Pulitano, who pays
for his employees to attend Storer's seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your
client a team, calling each other partner and working off each
other's success, says Rhame. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember _ during the game, you're being watched as closely as
you are watching. Storer tells the recent story of a salesman who
made the mistake of drinking during a round and tipped the cart on
a sharp turn. His client fell out and was knocked unconscious.
After recovering, the client didn't stick around to do more
business. The salesman was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Woo, who runs Golf 101, encourages women to play off the
middle tees, where men usually start, instead of the forward tees,
which used to be called the ladies' tees but are now less
chauvinistically referred to as the beginners' tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there trying to build a relationship, you don't
want to be coming in and out of the conversation,'' she says. If
the more difficult drive holds a woman's game back, she should tell
the other players she'll move her ball from where it lands to where
theirs land, to keep the game moving.
</P>
<P>
   If you're playing with someone who plays from the forward tees,
don't sit in the cart and wait for her to tee off, says Rhame.
``Give her the courtesy to get out of the cart, and go stand with
her like she stood with you.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, send a thank-you note, maybe even an article about an
interest that your client casually mentioned. Follow up with a
phone call to set up an appointment to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take my calls more frequently after we've played a
round of golf,'' says Dave Lakhani, director of sales at Cougar
Mountain Software in Boise, Idaho. And that's what it's all about. &QL;

to run a business-golf seminar and now writes about golf. If you
don't know soft spikes are required, you could end up having to buy
your client and yourself new shoes _ and you'll look unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you bring a female client to play during men-only hours, or
vice versa, you'll embarrass everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know course employees so you're treated like a regular in
front of your client, adds Rhame, who's the co-author along with
James A. McNulty of ``Pat Summerall's Business Golf: The Art of
Developing Relationships Through Golf'' (Birch Lane Press, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   On game day, says Rhame, arrive early. Have your golf bag put on
the driver's side, especially if you're a woman, says Sokoloff. It
creates equal footing. Greet the client as he drives in. Pay in
advance so the client understands he's your guest. Have a gift
waiting, ideally a golf shirt with your company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scrimp on anything. If the client needs golf balls, don't
buy her three _ buy her a dozen. Pay for the cart, too. Exception:
If the client wants to walk, you walk.
</P>
<P>
   Make it a foursome. Invite two other people who will interest or
be of help to your client and who will help keep the conversation
moving, says Rhame. Or let the client bring someone, says Bill
Storer, who runs Business Golf Strategies in Basking Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Pulitano, CEO of Computing Concepts, a computer integrating
company, played with a client who was a purchasing agent, and the
client brought his father, who was a purchasing agent for another
company. ``We picked up another account,'' says Pulitano, who pays
for his employees to attend Storer's seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Establish the format in advance. One of the most conducive for
business is best ball, with two-person teams. After you both tee
off, each of you plays from the spot where the better drive landed
and so forth for the rest of the hole. That makes you and your
client a team, calling each other partner and working off each
other's success, says Rhame. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch financial consultant Kirsten Bratti needs a firm
grasp on the minds and moods of her clients if she's going to aptly
manage their life savings. But she felt she wasn't getting quite
far enough.
</P>
<P>
   So last summer Bratti, who works in San Mateo, Calif., decided
to break the grass ceiling. She took a seminar called Golf 101,
which teaches not the techniques of golf but how to do business on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, she invited a $400,000 client to play _ and
everything changed. ``Every time we got together, she would bring
up other things in her life and say how fantastic it was that she
was really getting to know me,'' says Bratti. Within a few months,
the client asked Bratti to manage all her assets: $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to doing business on the golf course, it doesn't
matter how well you play the game, as long as you can play the
game. And that's what seminars on business golf teach: how to
develop a relationship with a client between swings, when and how
to talk business, and how not to screw up a transaction with golf
faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that deals are done on the golf course. A
Hyatt survey shows that 93 percent of executives who play golf
agree it's a good way to tighten links with a business associate.
In fact, 35 percent have clinched some of their biggest deals on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you won't actually sign your contract on the
fairway. Course time is dedicated to developing the relationship,
to creating shared moments that you can reminisce about later, and
to culling clues about what your client values.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel compelled to talk numbers, don't bring it up until
the middle third of the round, says Dan C. Weilbaker, who teaches a
business golf seminar at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
Ill., and organizes an annual golf outing in which his students
practice with executives.
</P>
<P>
   In case the client brings up business, have a few short points
prepared, says Sue Wietzman, a former financial analyst who now
teaches business golf. ``You might only have 20 or 30 seconds
before somebody needs to shoot, so don't have a ten-minute test,''
she days. ``Have five soundbites that you can drop in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced golfers don't care about your skill level, as long
as you don't slow down play. But they do care that you know the
rules and etiquette of the game. Not knowing how to tend the pin
when your client is putting, for example, could turn her birdie
into a bogey and her into an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: If she's putting from the green, you ask whether she
wants the flagstick in or out of the hole. (If she wants the flag
in, you pull it out after she putts but before the ball reaches the
hole.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're not as skilled as the other person, be good-natured
about it, says Peter Titlebaum, as assistant professor of sport
management at the University of Dayton and a teacher of
business-golf seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep apologizing, and don't blame inanimate objects. If
none of you plays well, consider inviting the clients for a golf
lesson instead of a round, says Weitzman.
</P>
<P>
   If you're much better than your client or boss, don't throw the
game. It could destroy your credibility. At the same time, suspend
your ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is not about you,'' says Will D. Rhame, who runs
BusinessLinks International in Tampa, Fla. ``It's about the person
you invited. Don't focus on trying to impress somebody with your
playing ability. Focus on being the best host.''
</P>
<P>
   And keep your golf tips to yourself, says Weitzman. Keep the
emphasis on fun, rather than competition. Rhame recommends agreeing
in advance to be lax: Mulligans are okay. Picking up the ball if
you're overmatched on a hole is okay.
</P>
<P>
   Half the people in the Hyatt survey agree that the way a person
plays golf is a reflection of the way he does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's willing to cheat on the golf course, they're
probably willing to cheat in a business deal,'' says Titlebaum.
``If they throw clubs and swear, it may tell me they don't have as
much control as I would like for people I want to be associated
with.'' &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye out for other clues. Bratti noticed that one
particular client liked to mull things over before making a
decision. ``She took quite a while before lining herself up and
hitting the ball,'' she says. Bratti now uses that knowledge when
doing business with her: ``Before something needs to be done, I put
it in writing and give her enough time to think about it,'' Bratti
says. Some of her other clients prefer to wing it or have decisions
made for them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   We, a nation of TV enthusiasts, have placed our faith in the
idea of the little black set-top box, an accoutrement that, as a
cable box, turned out feeble network options into a viewing
Shangri-la.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from TV, some Internet providers soon spawned the
notion of content personalization through ``channels.'' Then came
the idea that we could reap television-like enjoyment from
``viewing'' these Internet channels on our TV. When we signed on,
we envisioned a web of TV; what we got was WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have reached convergence: ReplayTV. A step beyond
WebTV, ReplayTV has taken the personalization features of Internet
portals like Yahoo! and Excite and adapted them to what we want to
see emanating from our tubes _ namely, television programs.
</P>
<P>
   A small, sleek black box with the savvy of a PC yet commanded by
the familiar click of a remote control, ReplayTV lets us believe
again in the idea of personalized channels.
</P>
<P>
   Its Replay Channels _ tailored by show, entertainer, or theme,
be it ``The Simpsons,'' ``Jeff Gordon,'' or ``fishing'' _ act like
a set of earmarked mailboxes (you've got ``Friends''!), where
specific types of programs of your predetermined choosing are found
and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees fan could set up a ``Yankees Channel'' and, whenever
he wanted, check for Yankees games and related programming on the
on-screen program guide. Just punch up that channel when it's time
for marathon viewing.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: Let's say that during ``Frasier'' we decide we'd
love to have a permanent record of David Hyde Pierce's future work.
Just press the ``Record This Show'' button on the Replay remote.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will ask, ``Record just this episode or record all
episodes?'' If you decide on the latter, the most recent show will
always be in the on-deck circle, ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Because its hard-drive storage (anywhere from 6 to 20 hours) is
random-access, ReplayTV can record and play a show at the same
time, allowing you to pause, rewind, and fast-forward during
currently airing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each night ReplayTV dials into the free Replay Network Services
to update itself with the latest channel-guide info.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the top-of-the-line ``enthusiast version'' is available
from Replay Networks for $995. But various manufacturers have
licensed this technology, so coming down the pike will likely be
$500 versions with an emphasis on simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bells and whistles are one thing, but as Replay Networks
director of marketing Jim Plant explains, the core of the issue is
always that ``the number-one problem people have is missing their
favorite television show.'' &QL;

   Taking a cue from TV, some Internet providers soon spawned the
notion of content personalization through ``channels.'' Then came
the idea that we could reap television-like enjoyment from
``viewing'' these Internet channels on our TV. When we signed on,
we envisioned a web of TV; what we got was WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have reached convergence: ReplayTV. A step beyond
WebTV, ReplayTV has taken the personalization features of Internet
portals like Yahoo! and Excite and adapted them to what we want to
see emanating from our tubes _ namely, television programs.
</P>
<P>
   A small, sleek black box with the savvy of a PC yet commanded by
the familiar click of a remote control, ReplayTV lets us believe
again in the idea of personalized channels.
</P>
<P>
   Its Replay Channels _ tailored by show, entertainer, or theme,
be it ``The Simpsons,'' ``Jeff Gordon,'' or ``fishing'' _ act like
a set of earmarked mailboxes (you've got ``Friends''!), where
specific types of programs of your predetermined choosing are found
and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees fan could set up a ``Yankees Channel'' and, whenever
he wanted, check for Yankees games and related programming on the
on-screen program guide. Just punch up that channel when it's time
for marathon viewing.
</P>
<P>
   There's more: Let's say that during ``Frasier'' we decide we'd
love to have a permanent record of David Hyde Pierce's future work.
Just press the ``Record This Show'' button on the Replay remote.
</P>
<P>
   The TV will ask, ``Record just this episode or record all
episodes?'' If you decide on the latter, the most recent show will
always be in the on-deck circle, ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Because its hard-drive storage (anywhere from 6 to 20 hours) is
random-access, ReplayTV can record and play a show at the same
time, allowing you to pause, rewind, and fast-forward during
currently airing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each night ReplayTV dials into the free Replay Network Services
to update itself with the latest channel-guide info.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the top-of-the-line ``enthusiast version'' is available
from Replay Networks for $995. But various manufacturers have
licensed this technology, so coming down the pike will likely be
$500 versions with an emphasis on simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Bells and whistles are one thing, but as Replay Networks
director of marketing Jim Plant explains, the core of the issue is
always that ``the number-one problem people have is missing their
favorite television show.'' &QL;

   Nineteenth-century French novelist Gustave Flaubert loathed that
newfangled contraption, the steam locomotive. When there was talk
of laying track in his peaceful hometown of Croisset, he scoffed,
``What's the point? It will only bring in more people to be stupid
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Flaubert never wandered into an Internet chat room.
Online chat rooms _ basically, the real-time, typed equivalent of a
telephone conversation _ are open forums haunted by an assortment
of people with time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical chat room, Monsieur and Mademoiselle Lonelyhearts
pretend to have sex while pretending they're someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most investment chat rooms aren't much of an improvement. (To
find these places, do a quick search on the keywords ``Stock+Chat''
using an engine like Yahoo!)
</P>
<P>
   I've visited several of them, usually to discover that I'm the
only one to show up. The only time I encountered another virtual
creature, it dropped a hint about some suspiciously cheap,
unheard-of stock, then darted off. No wonder sites such as
InvestorExchange.com have closed their chat areas in favor of
bulletin boards, where investors don't converse but post and read
messages.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is par for the course. As one Silicon Valley
investor points out, ``If the people who inhabit these places and
give advice on stocks were taking their own advice, they'd have
better things to do than hang out in chat rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the dismal run of chat rooms is the scheduled
variety hosted by legitimate Web sites, where investment movers and
shakers take real-time questions from participants.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Network's Investor.com, for example, regularly sets up
scheduled chats with Wall Street stars, such as the recent seminar
``Investing for Growth and Income,'' sponsored by Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co. and featuring Robert Natale, a managing director at Bears
Stearns Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Also higher on the evolutionary scale are the newsgroups and
other threaded discussion forums _ bulletin boards focused on a
fairly narrow topic _ offered by the big online services and
portals, such as America Online, Microsoft Network, Compuserve,
Netscape, and Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Business and Finance message board
(http://messages.yahoo.com/yahoo/business_and_finance/index.html)
is typical of the genre, with discussions on such topics as
brokerage firms, upcoming initial public offerings, fund-trading
strategies, and overvalued stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The boards aren't without their share of hype and nonsense, but
practiced participants learn to separate the signal from the noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take time to read with an unbiased eye, you can find
employees and insiders posting good information,'' says Michael
Burry, a physician in Palo Alto, Calif., who also writes an online
investment newsletter, ``Valuestocks.net.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring he joined a Yahoo! group focused on the titanium
industry. ``There was a guy named Acroti, who said he was an
insider in the titanium business,'' Burry recalls. ``He told us
where the trends in titanium were going and that it would soon be
in a downturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent events showed Acroti to be ``dead on,'' says Burry,
and he now looks for postings that, like Acroti's, are delivered
with authority but without an apparent ax to grind. ``He posted
what he needed to post and didn't get involved in arguments,'' says
Burry.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based or monitored Web sites are also good for weeding out
the riffraff. Burry's favorite site, Silicon Investor, charges a
$10 monthly fee, but he says the price is worth it. ``It's really
amazing to see the time and thought that some people put into their
posts, '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites tend to do a better job of shooing away the hucksters
than the open forums on sites such as Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   In open discussion groups where users can create multiple
identifiers for themselves, stock pushers can create what looks
like a group discussion, usually around a small stock, when in fact
the entire conversation is the fabrication of a single person with
an interest in hyping the stock.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting discussion groups, look for sites that post
clear ground rules and for discussions that stay on-topic. Don't
become embroiled in passionate debate right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, study the posted messages in various areas. If the site
appears to lack serious, concentrated discouse, lists several
postings by the same person (identified by a nickname), or allows
users to carry multiple nicknames, keep several grains of salt
handy.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the better sites:
</P>
<P>
   SILICON INVESTOR (www.siliconinvestor.com) is a members-only
club for investors in high tech. The $10-per-month price tag (or
$200 or a lifetime membership) discourages the weirdos and phonies.
More than 300,000 messages are posted monthly, some of them,
admittedly, of the amuse-and-schmooze variety but many of them
serious analyses of market events. There's also private E-mail for
members.
</P>
<P>
   THESTREET.COM (www.thestreet.com) also charges a $10 monthly fee
($100 a year), which buys access to the site's rather uneven news
coverage as well as to a portfolio tracker, a useful SEC Filings
feature, and plenty of intelligent debate. The Talk section offers
threaded discussions on travel and culture as well as investing.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOTLEY FOOL'S (http://boards.fool.com/) discussion boards,
which are free, let participants post questions on message boards
and receive replies. There are plenty of instructive tales as well
as a weekly roundup of the best postings.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian firm StockGroup Interactive Media posts a free
forum, INVESTOR EXCHANGE (www.investorexchange.com). The monitored
discussions cover all aspects of investing, with a focus on
Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT NETWORK INVESTOR (http://investor.msn.com), which
offers free and pay services, features forums plus scheduled and
open chats. A section called MoneyCentral
(http://moneycentral.msn.com) provides discussion groups on such
topics as retirement, credit, taxes, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch's STOCKCHAT (www.stockchat.com) is a free,
wide-ranging forum. You can search for discussion threads
alphabetically or by stock ticker symbol. The discussions are
monitored for obscenity and other breaches of netiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the INVESTMENT FAQ (www.invest.faq.com) culls some of
the best postings from investment newsgroups, compiles the combined
wisdom into straightforward articles, and provides links to outside
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Even Flaubert would probably consider it a vast improvement over
live chat rooms. &QL;

 By SCOTT BURNS  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a truth universally acknowledged that the road to real
money and mind-boggling returns is small-company stocks. But just
try following the path.
</P>
<P>
   Why have small stocks been so disappointing?
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many investors searched so hard to find so little?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that only one small-stock fund beat the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Stock Index over the past 15 years _ and then by less
than one-tenth of one percentage point?
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that more than 600 managers, scouring the most obscure
nooks and crannies of the known stock universe, seem to be falling
further and further behind, Internet fever notwithstanding?
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to examine a deep belief _ the idea that
small-company stocks will, in the long run, provide a higher return
than large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It has a remarkably diverse array of adherents. Mavericks
believe because there is a romance attached to finding a small
company that will transform an industry _ or create one.
</P>
<P>
   Quantitative types believe because the largest and most revered
database, the virtual bible of modern portfolio theory, says small
stocks provide higher returns than big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And commonsense types believe because it seems so logical: At
some point, a big company's ability to grow should be constrained
by its already massive size.
</P>
<P>
   Actual events, however, don't support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the small-company stock creed are to be found in
the aforementioned bible: ``Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation,''
the Ibbotson Associates yearbook that provides data on asset
returns from 1926 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 yearbook shows that large-company stocks _ as
represented by the S&AMP;P 500 _ have delivered a compound annual
return of 11 percent while small-company stocks have returned 12.7
percent. That extra return isn't free, however.
</P>
<P>
   Small-stock prices are more volatile than large-stock prices _
investors have to live with greater price risk while waiting for
their higher return.
</P>
<P>
   But the payoff is substantial. Put $1,000 into large stocks, and
the Ibbotson data say it will grow to $184,565 over 50 years. Make
the same investment in small stocks, and it will grow to $394,635
over the same period. Twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   The problem starts with the actual results of the professional
investors who are paid to capture that extra return.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1981, just months before the start of the stock
market's long rise, there were only 17 small-company funds. FPA
Capital, which Robert Rodriguez has run for 14 years, is the
best-performing fund in that group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years that ended October 31, the fund provided a
compound annual return of 17.20 percent, enough to edge out the S&AMP;P
500's 17.11 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Acorn Fund, managed by Ralph Wanger and Ralph McQuaid, was
second-best, returning 15.56 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, both funds beat the Russell 2000 _ a broad index
of small companies _ by a wide margin. Indeed, the two funds
performed so well that they lifted the 15-year average for the
entire small-stock category above the Russell index.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the number of small-company funds has burgeoned to
682. Their track record, measured against the Russell 2000 index,
hasn't been bad. On average, they beat their index in three of five
measuring periods. What they haven't done is come close to the
returns on large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the persistent faith in small stocks is that over
the past 15 years some companies have grown from tiny, struggling
start-ups into industry leaders, while some large companies that
were once seen as invincible have suffered devastating declines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, to cite just one example, Eastman Kodak had the
seventh-highest market value among U.S. stocks. Today it ranks
117th.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Microsoft had yet to go public in 1977, and neither
Dell Computer nor Compaq Computer had even been founded. Today,
Microsoft has the largest market capitalization of all U.S. stocks;
Dell and Compaq rank 31st and 45th, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the divergent fates of Microsoft and Kodak represent the
general triumph of the small and entrepreneurial over the large and
bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Two respected observers offer different, but related,
reasons. In ``Stocks for the Long Run,'' finance professor Jeremy
Siegel points out that small stocks' edge over large stocks
virtually disappears if the 1975-83 period is excluded from the
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While some might object to simply removing a block of years from
a time series, it happens that small stocks lost 31 percent of
their value in 1973 and an additional 20 percent of their value in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that small stocks did relatively well from
1975 to 1983. They were recovering from virtual obliteration.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the price volatility of small stocks means that
market makers increase their bid/ask spreads _ that is, to
compensate for the added risk, they charge a higher markup when
buying or selling small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel cites a study showing that even in modern times the
spread on small stocks has been 2.65 percent, compared with 0.40
percent for large stocks. That wider spread wipes out the entire
long-term advantage of small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation comes from value manager David Dreman. An
asterisk in the 1998 ``SBBI'' yearbook notes that the 12.7 percent
annual return of small-company stocks includes 1933, when their
total return was a stunning 142.9 percent. Large stocks have never
enjoyed a comparable one-year jump.
</P>
<P>
   Dreman found that trading in the 1931-35 period was very light,
with some 58 percent of the small-stock group not trading at all on
any given day. Not surprisingly, bid/ask spreads were enormous,
averaging 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   We'll let the academics worry about the fine details. The
practical message is that market realities may hinder any investor
from reaping the benefits of small-stock investing _ if those
benefits exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   So what's an investor to do? Forget size _ it's just too
limiting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the median company on the Russell 2000 list has a
market capitalization of $220 million. If and when its market value
exceeds $1 billion, it will cease, by most conventional
definitions, to be a small stock.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who stick strictly to small stocks, then, are
voluntarily limiting their potential gains to what Peter Lynch
would call a ``five-bagger.'' That's giving up a lot of potential
upside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most doctrinaire small-stock investor would probably
regret selling the likes of Cisco Systems ($125 billion in market
capitalization as of Dec. 8), Dell ($85 billion), or Oracle ($34
billion) when they became ``too big.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything to be learned from following the contrails
of these highfliers, it's that size doesn't matter. Good stocks
do. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Global warming notwithstanding, the big three ski stocks _ Vail
Resorts, American Skiing, and Intrawest _ have a lot going for them
these days.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboards and new,
easier-to-turn-without-falling-and-snapping-fibula skis are
propelling more American families to the slopes _ where, in posh
locations like Vail, Colo., Mom and Dad can bid adieu to an average
of $300 per family member per day.
</P>
<P>
   Geographic diversification has made these companies less
vulnerable to capricious snowfalls. They've also taken a page from
Disney and become more adept in the art of total resort management.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there may be few better investing plays, at least in
the long run, on the as-yet-unrefuted maxim that the rich get
richer.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, though, there may be a few drawbacks. First,
because swooshing down mountains on plastic slats is hardly a basic
human need, ski stocks tend to be hypersensitive to swings in the
economy (the $10,000 family ski trip is still regarded as
postponable even in many well-to-do households).
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, fears of a looming recession caused the stocks
of the big three to tumble an average of 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A second drawback is the market's relative inexperience with
these companies. All three listed their shares for the first time
on the New York Stock Exchange only in 1997. And even professional
analysts are still ill-at-ease when it comes to determining the
value of a ski stock.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are probably best viewed as two businesses
rolled into one: entertainment and real-estate development.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment side, which typically accounts for about 75
percent of revenue, is fairly straightforward. At Vail, lift-ticket
sales provided $147 million, or 34 percent of total revenue, during
the 1997-98 season, up 8 percent from the previous winter.
</P>
<P>
   Food service accounted for another 12 percent of Vail's revenue.
Retail sales, equipment rentals, property-management fees,
instruction, and summer activities provided the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that the way to value this side of Vail's
business is to project its future cash flow (its earnings before
interest expenses, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).
</P>
<P>
   They then multiply its EBITDA forecast by nine _ a rule of thumb
that's based on historic ski-resort transaction prices. Goldman
Sachs, for example, values the entertainment side of Vail's
business at $1.125 billion, or $32 a share (before subtracting
debt).
</P>
<P>
   This is based on Goldman's forecast that Vail's EBITDA in the
fiscal year ending in July will reach $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street hasn't come to a similar consensus about how to
value the real-estate side of the business _ the subdivision and
sale of property, typically in the forms of time-shares, homes, and
undeveloped lots.
</P>
<P>
   This is tricky terrain because the ski companies themselves each
advocate a different valuation approach.
</P>
<P>
   When American Skiing went public in November 1997, its
investment bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette advocated
applying the EBITDA model equally to the entertainment and
real-estate operations and raising the multiple to ten.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, the resulting valuation of $18 a share generated
just the amount needed ($265 million) to fund American Skiing's
acquisitions of Steamboat Springs and Heavenly Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A major drawback of this technique, however, is that cash flow
from a ski resort's real-estate operations can swing wildly from
year to year _ in the case of American Skiing, from $1.7 million in
1997 to $17.6 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Intrawest, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, urges investors
to apply a multiple not to cash flow but to net income. That's
because Intrawest is something of a real-estate profit machine _
selling between 1,200 and 1,400 condominiums a year at locations
ranging from Stratton in Vermont to Whistler outside Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Jarvis, Intrawest's chief financial officer, says the
company could keep up this pace for at least another 15 years.
Intrawest also likes the earnings-multiple approach because it's
the tool Wall Street uses to gauge hot growth stocks that carry
lofty valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Vail prefers a third valuation model _ one that emphasizes the
book value of its real estate. This is partly because Vail sells
few condominiums on its own, leaving that job to its developer
partners. Rather, it views its real estate as a strategic asset for
enhancing the value of its total operation.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Resnick, a Vail managing director, points out that hastily
completing a condo project (to get the sales on the books) can mar
the total environment at a resort.
</P>
<P>
   A patient real-estate strategy, he adds, can also produce
longer-term benefits, such as when Vail bought Arrowhead Mountain
in 1993 and focused on developing lifts and trails that boosted
skier volume 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vail would rather an investor follow these steps for assessing
its value: Add the book value per share of its real estate ($3.98)
to the per-share value of its entertainment side ($32, as
previously calculated). Then subtract corporate debt minus any cash
on hand. Result: $28.60 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Vail's stock fares less well under the
valuation approaches advocated by its rivals. Applying American
Skiing's EBITDA model to Vail produces a valuation of just $23 a
share, while Intrawest's earnings-multiple approach lowers it even
further to $19. (The stock is currently trading at just above $21.)
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern holds true at all three companies. Intrawest's
stock is worth only $16 a share under the Vail model and $18 under
American Skiing's EBITDA approach.
</P>
<P>
   But its value rises to $19 under the earnings-multiple approach
that, for reasons that should be clear, it likes best. (Intrawest's
stock is currently trading below $17 a share.)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, American Skiing's blended EBITDA model still gives it
the most favorable result: $16 a share. The company can't be
assessed on its earnings because it hasn't had any lately (due to
the high depreciation and interest payments associated with an
aggressive development program).
</P>
<P>
   The Vail model, meanwhile, pegs American Skiing at $11 a share _
an amount that's still more than $3 above the trading prices.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't likely that these resorts will abandon their accounting
disagreements anytime soon. Nevertheless, an investor who wants to
become a mogul should, at the very least, know that there are
different ways of valuing one. &QL;

<P>
   What goes 'round, comes 'round. But not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   After outperforming the economies of the rest of the developed
world for most of the 1990s, the U.S. economy has begun an almost
invisible restructuring that will keep it growing faster than
Europe or Japan through 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't supposed to happen. Historically, countries that have
enjoyed a long period of competitive advantage go soft and lose
their edge.
</P>
<P>
   With profits pouring in, companies stop counting pennies and
allow costs to rise. Workers demand to share the pie, and wages
creep upward and then soar out of control. Management gets
complacent about products and manufacturing technologies and fails
to invest enough to stay on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beaten-down foreign-competitors cut costs to the
bone, squeeze concessions out of workers worried about losing their
jobs, and gamble on new products, new management structures, and
new manufacturing processes, figuring that unless they take these
risks they'll be out of business pretty quickly anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they've erased the cost advantage enjoyed by companies that
call the leading economy home. And then, riding the momentum, these
upstart companies sprint into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the story that played out in the 1980s and 1990s
between Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Japanese companies seemed about to take over the
world. Sumitomo Bank was going to overwhelm U.S. financial
companies such as Citicorp (now Citigroup) and Merrill Lynch.
Hitachi was going to put IBM out of the mainframe business.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, Sumitomo has abandoned its retail-banking
drive in the U.S. and retreated to the home islands. IBM's biggest
competition isn't Hitachi but American companies such as Dell
Computer and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy now in the longest economic recovery in
its history _ 95 months and counting, as of February _ U.S.
companies should be showing signs of going soft. After all, the
fear that drove the top-to-bottom restructuring of companies is
well in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 didn't show that at all. Even though the U.S.
unemployment rate hovers near a low 4.5 percent, layoffs _ as
measured by the Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas employment survey _
surged last year.
</P>
<P>
   As of November, the pace was running better than 30 percent
above the 1997 rate. With a month still to report, the 1998 totals
were 28 percent above the annual average for 1995 through 1997 and
just 7 percent short of the layoff record for the decade set in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all these layoffs coming from? Troubled firms account
for some. It's no surprise, for example, that Boeing, a company
struggling with plunging profits as Asian airlines cancel orders
for new planes, decided to cut 48,000 jobs by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But companies with the lowest costs in their industry have also
joined the trend. Exxon, a company known for its attention to
saving every penny, will bring this sensibility to its merger with
Mobil, and the combined company will cut 7 percent of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the layoff numbers fully capture the trend. Companies in
the U.S. are clearly not relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in December, General Electric decided that this
fierce, fast-moving competitor needed to run even faster. Rather
than putting more of its profit into a long-standing program of
buying back its shares, GE stepped up its plan to purchase
floundering competitors in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies seem to be running just as hard as they did a
decade ago, even though nobody is chasing them.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from Japan and Europe is that the competitive gap
between those economies and the U.S. economy may actually be
growing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, hourly compensation in European manufacturing
already runs 12 percent above the wage rates in the same sectors of
the U.S. economy, and politics on the continent are pushing wages
higher.
</P>
<P>
   France has recently mandated a 35-hour workweek (without a wage
cut) by 2000, and politicians in Italy and Spain have begun to
consider similar laws. (Compensation in Europe's largest economy,
Germany, is even higher _ about 55 percent above U.S. wage levels.)
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, layoffs are slow in coming despite a desperate need to
cut costs in industry after industry. Plant closings have been few
and far between, and job losses after most mergers have been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting profit squeeze at Japanese companies is taking
place just as Japanese banks have almost stopped lending, and this
has cut deeply into the ability of Japanese companies to invest in
capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Japanese makers of computer chips and other
semiconductors are lagging behind their U.S. and Taiwanese
competitors in buying next-generation production equipment that
radically cuts manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   When global demand recovers for chips and other products, all
but the very biggest and financially strongest Japanese companies
will find themselves facing U.S. corporations that have higher
profit margins because they have become more efficient
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to figure out from this which stock market will be
most attractive to investors as the global economy gradually digs
out from the wreckage of the financial and economic crisis that
began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As growth rates from Thailand to Brazil inch up and consumers
around the world start to buy goods and services again, the profits
will flow disproportionately to lean, aggressive U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It's this scenario that may actually justify the Wall Street
projections that earnings per share (before special items) will
climb 21 percent in 1999 for the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index, and why many analysts are calling for even higher
earnings growth of 23 percent for the companies in the S&AMP;P
Industrials.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate restructuring that produced annual gains of 20
percent or more for the S&AMP;P 500 in each of the past four years may
not have run out of steam yet. In fact, it might just be getting a
second wind. &QL;

   For example, hourly compensation in European manufacturing
already runs 12 percent above the wage rates in the same sectors of
the U.S. economy, and politics on the continent are pushing wages
higher.
</P>
<P>
   France has recently mandated a 35-hour workweek (without a wage
cut) by 2000, and politicians in Italy and Spain have begun to
consider similar laws. (Compensation in Europe's largest economy,
Germany, is even higher _ about 55 percent above U.S. wage levels.)
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, layoffs are slow in coming despite a desperate need to
cut costs in industry after industry. Plant closings have been few
and far between, and job losses after most mergers have been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting profit squeeze at Japanese companies is taking
place just as Japanese banks have almost stopped lending, and this
has cut deeply into the ability of Japanese companies to invest in
capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Japanese makers of computer chips and other
semiconductors are lagging behind their U.S. and Taiwanese
competitors in buying next-generation production equipment that
radically cuts manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   When global demand recovers for chips and other products, all
but the very biggest and financially strongest Japanese companies
will find themselves facing U.S. corporations that have higher
profit margins because they have become more efficient
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to figure out from this which stock market will be
most attractive to investors as the global economy gradually digs
out from the wreckage of the financial and economic crisis that
began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As growth rates from Thailand to Brazil inch up and consumers
around the world start to buy goods and services again, the profits
will flow disproportionately to lean, aggressive U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It's this scenario that may actually justify the Wall Street
projections that earnings per share (before special items) will
climb 21 percent in 1999 for the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Stock Index, and why many analysts are calling for even higher
earnings growth of 23 percent for the companies in the S&AMP;P
Industrials.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate restructuring that produced annual gains of 20
percent or more for the S&AMP;P 500 in each of the past four years may
not have run out of steam yet. In fact, it might just be getting a
second wind. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   What goes 'round, comes 'round. But not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   After outperforming the economies of the rest of the developed
world for most of the 1990s, the U.S. economy has begun an almost
invisible restructuring that will keep it growing faster than
Europe or Japan through 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't supposed to happen. Historically, countries that have
enjoyed a long period of competitive advantage go soft and lose
their edge.
</P>
<P>
   With profits pouring in, companies stop counting pennies and
allow costs to rise. Workers demand to share the pie, and wages
creep upward and then soar out of control. Management gets
complacent about products and manufacturing technologies and fails
to invest enough to stay on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beaten-down foreign-competitors cut costs to the
bone, squeeze concessions out of workers worried about losing their
jobs, and gamble on new products, new management structures, and
new manufacturing processes, figuring that unless they take these
risks they'll be out of business pretty quickly anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they've erased the cost advantage enjoyed by companies that
call the leading economy home. And then, riding the momentum, these
upstart companies sprint into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the story that played out in the 1980s and 1990s
between Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Japanese companies seemed about to take over the
world. Sumitomo Bank was going to overwhelm U.S. financial
companies such as Citicorp (now Citigroup) and Merrill Lynch.
Hitachi was going to put IBM out of the mainframe business.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, however, Sumitomo has abandoned its retail-banking
drive in the U.S. and retreated to the home islands. IBM's biggest
competition isn't Hitachi but American companies such as Dell
Computer and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. economy now in the longest economic recovery in
its history _ 95 months and counting, as of February _ U.S.
companies should be showing signs of going soft. After all, the
fear that drove the top-to-bottom restructuring of companies is
well in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 didn't show that at all. Even though the U.S.
unemployment rate hovers near a low 4.5 percent, layoffs _ as
measured by the Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas employment survey _
surged last year.
</P>
<P>
   As of November, the pace was running better than 30 percent
above the 1997 rate. With a month still to report, the 1998 totals
were 28 percent above the annual average for 1995 through 1997 and
just 7 percent short of the layoff record for the decade set in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all these layoffs coming from? Troubled firms account
for some. It's no surprise, for example, that Boeing, a company
struggling with plunging profits as Asian airlines cancel orders
for new planes, decided to cut 48,000 jobs by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But companies with the lowest costs in their industry have also
joined the trend. Exxon, a company known for its attention to
saving every penny, will bring this sensibility to its merger with
Mobil, and the combined company will cut 7 percent of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the layoff numbers fully capture the trend. Companies in
the U.S. are clearly not relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in December, General Electric decided that this
fierce, fast-moving competitor needed to run even faster. Rather
than putting more of its profit into a long-standing program of
buying back its shares, GE stepped up its plan to purchase
floundering competitors in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies seem to be running just as hard as they did a
decade ago, even though nobody is chasing them.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence from Japan and Europe is that the competitive gap
between those economies and the U.S. economy may actually be
growing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, hourly compensation in European manufacturing
already runs 12 percent above the wage rates in the same sectors of
the U.S. economy, and politics on the continent are pushing wages
higher.
</P>
<P>
   France has recently mandated a 35-hour workweek (without a wage
cut) by 2000, and politicians in Italy and Spain have begun to
consider similar laws. (Compensation in Europe's largest economy,
Germany, is even higher _ about 55 percent above U.S. wage levels.)
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, layoffs are slow in coming despite a desperate need to
cut costs in industry after industry. Plant closings have been few
and far between, and job losses after most mergers have been
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting profit squeeze at Japanese companies is taking
place just as Japanese banks have almost stopped lending, and this
has cut deeply into the ability of Japanese companies to invest in
capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Japanese makers of computer chips and other
semiconductors are lagging behind their U.S. and Taiwanese
competitors in buying next-generation production equipment that
radically cuts manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   When global demand recovers for chips and other products, all
but the very biggest and financially strongest Japanese companies

TRUTHS BEHIND THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With roughly a million people behind bars in this
country at any given moment, the single most crucial problem the
police face is the widespread perception that they're not fair.
</P>
<P>
   Every poll on the topic shows that most people think the cops
are tougher on those without power, wealth or position.
Overwhelmingly, Americans believe that people with connections or
resources routinely are given passes for conduct that would land a
lesser individual in the slammer.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I can't ignore the sad case of Michael J. Sinclair.
He came across the border from Canada on March 5. He was missing
from active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps. He was packing a
stolen, loaded .45-caliber pistol. The U.S. Customs Service turned
him over to the New York State Police.
</P>
<P>
   And what did the state police do with him? Did they charge him
with felonies for possessing the stolen pistol? Did they turn him
over to the federal government's AWOL unit? No, in direction
violation their own policies, they released Michael J. Sinclair
into the custody of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Sinclair's father, by the way, is Col. John H.
Sinclair, director of the Vermont State Police.
</P>
<P>
   When word of this reached me, I started calling around to nail
down the facts. I got a serious runaround. Col. Sinclair refused to
discuss it. New York State Police Senior Investigator Bob Denny was
involved in all this. When he heard me mention Michael J.
Sinclair's name, he immediately booted the call to Lt. Bruce
Dunning. Dunning heard Sinclair's name and said he would call right
back. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   After several phone calls to Dunning _ and after I told whoever
answered the phone the last time that my next call would be to the
office of New York State Police Superintendent Jim McMahon, I
finally heard from the Troop B commander, Maj. Bill Warburton. He
asked if he could talk to me about this the next morning. I figured
he had some bad news to break to his bosses, so I said fine.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Warburton told me the next day, it's true. The Sinclair kid,
he said, wasn't AWOL in a technical sense, so the state police
didn't have to turn him over to the feds. Yes, he had the loaded
gun, but it had been stolen from his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was suicidal,'' the major explained.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm not sure how many psychiatrists are serving in Troop B
of the New York State Police, but I do know that proper procedure
involving a suicidal guy with a loaded gun is to get him to a
secure medical facility and let a judge figure out what to do with
him. Maj. Warburton, however, decided that wasn't the best course
of action here. Instead, a call went out to Col. Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father comes over with tears in his eyes,'' the major
said. ``I don't care how it looks. You know, I would have done it
if it had been your kid, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he would have. You can decide for yourself how likely that
scenario might be. The problem is that, if the polls are accurate,
you'll probably conclude that Michael J. Sinclair got special
treatment not because of his emotional problems but because his
father is a high-ranking police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent annual report, McMahon wrote, ``Society
bestows upon police officers the highest degree of public trust ...
The public has a right to demand, and indeed expect, that police
officers perform their duties with the utmost degree of integrity,
fairness and professionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's discretion involved in police work _ and properly
so.
</P>
<P>
   But it's precisely the trust that McMahon mentioned that's
placed in such serious peril by preferential conduct like this.

CREATING EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FIELDS OF DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Human beings learn by making mistakes, sometimes
even male human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I made a big mistake and learned that modern young
women can play hardball _ literally. I called 14-year-old star
baseball player Carey Myslewski a boy and, boy, am I sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' Carey said, when I phoned her. ``I've had umpires
call me `young man' before, when I cut my hair short.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuse. It's a male thing. We have the ``don't get it'' gene.
</P>
<P>
   I had asked readers what San Francisco could name for the late
Joe DiMaggio. Carey's dad, Rik Myslewski, sent an e-mail suggesting
fixing kids' baseball fields in Joe's name. He said they're so bad
his kid risks twisted ankles on rutted base paths.
</P>
<P>
   I called Myslewski to find out his child's name, but couldn't
reach him. So I made the dumb male assumption: Boys play hardball.
Thus I referred to Carey as his ``baseball-loving son.'' It turned
out Carey is a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Just my luck. Carey says she's the only girl in the Pony League,
or 7th- and 8th-grade division, of San Francisco's Recreation and
Park youth baseball league. This 8th-grader also starred on Hoover
Middle School's baseball and basketball teams, and is the city
champion in the 800-meter run.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best guy on the team,'' Andy Cedarblade, her coach,
said wryly. ``She gets some looks, but people only underestimate
her once.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Carey how she handles it when boys give her trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of ignore them,'' she said, ``Then I strike them
out.''
</P>
<P>
   My feminist editor suggested that I should do penance for my
male chauvinist assumptions by trying to hit some of Carey
Myslewski's high inside fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a better way to make amends. Maybe some good can
come of this.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Carey was hurt by a sexist mistake somewhat worse than
my own, and by her favorite team, the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the team asked Hoover Middle School to select kids
to be bat boys during the last home game of the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered it to anybody on the Hoover baseball team, and I
was on the Hoover baseball team and I was chosen,'' Carey said.
``But they hadn't really guessed that there were girls on the
Hoover team, and they said I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she felt when she was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt disappointed,'' she said. ``I would have liked to have
done it. I was a little angry at the organization, not the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a straight-A student, she's a real baseball girl.
Her mom, Marilyn Myslewski, once told Carey after a loss, ``You
don't have to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Yes, you do.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Giants gave for not allowing Carey to be a bat
kid was that the duties included working in the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents don't want to bash the Giants. They just think the
team should have let her be a bat kid, or whatever you'd call it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have let a girl do it, A, because Candlestick is a
public accommodation and, B, because it's the '90s,'' Rik Myslewski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's parents wrote the Giants about the matter, but didn't
receive a response.
</P>
<P>
   I called Giants Vice President Larry Baer, and he said it was a
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to the best of us.
</P>
<P>
   Baer said both boys and girls are allowed to be honorary bat
kids, but girls have to stay out of the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Carey Myslewski is a tough, quiet kid. She doesn't want anything
special from the Giants. When she was 11 she was hit in the mouth
by a ball that took a bad hop off a ruined infield.
</P>
<P>
   According to her dad, ``She kept with the play, made a perfect
peg to home and then worried about her lip.''
</P>
<P>
   She's almost worn out her tape of the movie ``A League of Their
Own,'' about a women's baseball team, and she loves Tom Hanks'
line, ``There's no crying in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But her very favorite line in the movie is: ``Baseball is
supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everybody would play it.''
</P>
<P>
   So here's a baseball idea. Carey's mom, who is a fund-raising
consultant, says that the Giants could become the leader in
repairing San Francisco's youth baseball fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the consortium of people who own the Giants
represents the elite of San Francisco, and they're so generous in
so many other ways,'' Marilyn Myslewski said. ``The easiest way to
do it would be to set up a public/ private partnership through
Friends of Rec and Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are leaders in the field of dreams, and kids like
Carey Myslewski dream of better fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``In moving to the new ballpark, we're thinking of having a
fund-raiser, black tie, for a good cause,'' Baer said. ``This could
be a perfect beneficiary.''

NEW ABC SHOW COMES CLOSE TO CLONING `SEINFELD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network television has shot itself so many times in the foot
trying to replicate ``Seinfeld'' it probably has no toes left.''
</P>
<P>
   I got it! Let's put a single twenty- or thirtysomething in a
lavish New York City apartment he could never afford, surround him
with some whacky, zany, cuckoo friends _ one of whom has to have
really bad hair _ and, well, yada, yada, yada ...
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked. Careers and viewing time have been wasted as
Hollywood chases that phantom Holy Grail. When will the networks
learn?
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a mid-season show on ABC that doesn't look like
``Seinfeld,'' but sure sounds like it. More importantly, it feels
like it, in no small part because its creator and executive
producer is former ``Seinfeld'' writer Peter Mehlman.
</P>
<P>
   Premiering Wednesday, ``It's like, you know ...'' comes late in
the fray, even by mid-season replacement standards. While other
mid-season fill-ins have been successful in recent years (``King of
the Hill,'' ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Becker,'' to name just a few),
this series, with two of the best casting moves in memory, leaves
you scratching your head: What took ABC so long to put it on the
air?
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are that in a year where the fall shows were
generally regarded as a fairly mediocre crop, you are set apart
from that,'' Mehlman said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   First great casting move: The central character is
self-possessed, superficial and absolutely fascinated with the
banal. Sounds like Jerry, doesn't it? So who is he?
</P>
<P>
   Try Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never see in television where the actual city where the show
takes place has an actual impact on the show,'' Mehlman said.
``Even `Seinfeld,' which was known for its New York sensibility,
was not dominated by the city.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there will be some Los Angeles-based critics dismissing
the jibes at the city as passe (surprisingly, the pilot did not
test well).
</P>
<P>
   Here is the short take: Arthur (Chris Eigeman) is a New York
City writer who moves to L.A. for two months to write a book about
why he hates the city, even though he has never been there.
</P>
<P>
   He moves in with his former college roommate Robbie (Steve
Eckholdt), who despite making millions off of televising Yom Kippur
services (``Pay Per Jew'') lives in the massive guest house of his
friend, Shrug (Evan Handler).
</P>
<P>
   Now understand that Shrug is a ``trustafarian'' who lives off a
trust fund, never worked a day in his life and occasionally feels
guilty about it. He lost all his hair because of stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrug! I love Shrug!'' Handler said recently. ``I want to go
back and do more. Shrug is just a result of his circumstances. He
is socially inept and unaware, yet savant-like in his wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention everyone in Los Angeles is rich? For example,
Shrug was convinced he borrowed $50,000 from Robbie, who doesn't
remember loaning the money. Finally, Robbie does recall the loan:
Shrug pulls out a wad of crumpled cash from his pocket: ``I only
got like 20 (thousand) on me.'' Robbie shrugs at Shrug.
``Whatever,'' he replies, stuffing the bills in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The inanities of ``Seinfeld'' are still there, such as an
extended discussion about why Elliott Gould (in a cameo) was
driving a Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what's so great about L.A.,'' Robbie cheerily replies
to Arthur questioning whether it merited conversation. ``You don't
even have to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where ``It's like ...'' resonates its ``Seinfeld''
roots. ``When you look at the success of `Seinfeld' and look how
the networks took it and tried to copy it they took a lot of
elements ... but the most important elements were not taken: the
incredibly natural dialogue,'' Mehlman said.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the cast is the delightfully airy Lauren (a
grown-up A.J. Langer of ``My So-Called Life''), a transplanted
masseuse/process server from Columbus, Ohio, whose philosophy is
``don't have a philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the funniest bit of casting since John Wayne was tapped
to play Genghis Khan _ only this time it's intentional _ Jennifer
Grey stars as ... Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Grey is Robbie's celebrity neighbor, far removed from her
``Dirty Dancing''/``Red Dawn''/``Ferris Bueller's Day Off''
successes. She is now unrecognizable (but extremely attractive),
the result of a complete nose job that prompts Arthur to ask her if
she got ``just one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Jennifer in the back of my mind because we were
friends,'' Mehlman said. ``She was totally game for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were considered like ``Flashdance'' star Jennifer Beals
but they would not have had the comedic impact of Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Only six of the 13 episodes shot are slated to air this season.
Mehlman and Handler kept talking about ``if'' the network picks up
the show this year. It is a no-brainer. This is great fun.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so was ``Cupid.'' Of course, it got axed just before
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Below the Norm: ABC will be trucking out another late premiere,
``The Norm Show,'' at 9:30 p.m. EST Wednesday. The sitcom stars
Norm Macdonald (late of ``Saturday Night Live'') and Laurie Metcalf
(``Roseanne''). Macdonald plays a former professional hockey player
banned from the game for gambling, who must work as a social worker
or go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   This is a pretty weak offering, and a waste of both Macdonald
and Metcalf. The only reason to tune in to this show Wednesday is
you probably won't get many more opportunities.

WRITING TABLES HAVE VALUE BEYOND WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Almost any table can function as a desk or
writing table. The table becomes distinguished by the addition of a
drawer or the lack of one, the amount of detailing, such as leather
inlay writing surface, carvings, painted design, inlaid woods,
hardware, the type of wood and/or finish.
</P>
<P>
   Writing table is a contemporary term coined by 18th-century
cabinetmakers for various types of tables with drawers below and/or
a superstructure of racks, pigeon holes, small cupboards for
stationery and perhaps secret compartments for private papers (as
there were no safes back then).
</P>
<P>
   A writing table also is called a davenport, which is a special
English desk or table that originated in the late 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   The writing table evolved from the Spanish writing cabinet or
box, called a vargueno, which rested on a set of collapsible legs.
Because of its easy portability, this simple box, which also stores
writing implements, can be moved from room to room and house to
house. In 18th-century England, cabinetmakers were combining the
portable writing box with a set of permanent legs. English
cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale designed a variety of writing
tables with graceful lines and Rococo ornamentation in the late
1700s.
</P>
<P>
   To enlarge the work surface of a writing table, early
cabinetmakers included a writing drawer, where the front panel
dropped down to create extra writing space when pulled out.
Sometimes it was an extension of the top, which pulled out, like a
dining room table leaf, and was supported by its own set of legs,
which were often cleverly concealed within the writing table.
</P>
<P>
   Pop-up writing surfaces were also popular. This pop-up surface
was part of the table top when not in use, and easel-like when put
into service.
</P>
<P>
   Some writing tables even included a brass or wooden galley
(decorative railing), where there was sufficient room to place
necessary writing implements and a few small books. In some cases,
this section, which rested on the top of the desk, included fitted
drawers for inkwells, quills, sand, embossed wafers (for sealing
the envelope) and stationery.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, the writing table, which was often referred
to as a library table, was placed in the center of the room. Thomas
Sheraton designed the drum writing table. Chippendale created the
round rent table in 1770, which like the drum table had drawers all
around and a pedestal base.
</P>
<P>
   An original or reproduction Louis XV writing table is still
considered very de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   A lady's writing desk, which was smaller than a man's writing
desk, would often be open beneath the writing surface so the writer
could take advantage of the warmth of the fireplace, with a
concealed pop-up fire screen to shield her face from the heat of
the scorching flames.
</P>
<P>
   Tables can be found in used furniture, consignment and antiques
shops, as well as flea markets and classified ads of newspapers,
for anywhere from under $50 to thousands of dollars and under $200
for a new table.
</P>
<P>
   Writing tables were once a means of status and affluence. Today,
they are a necessity and often hold more than quills and paper.
</P>
<P>
   A sturdy plain rectangular table can be perfect for a computer
work station. Storage can always be added in the form of a rolling
open metal wire cart, two-drawer file cabinet or stack of wicker
baskets.

OLDSMOBILE SEDAN A STYLISH PERFORMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOG GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For '99, Intrigue boasts a potent V-6 engine that
improves power and performance. And, supposedly, it's nearly
maintenance-free.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigue needs an ego boost after more than two years of going
up against import heavyweights Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.
Marketed directly against the duo's high-end V-6 models, Intrigue
has caused some ripples in the midsize-sedan mainstream, if not a
very big splash.
</P>
<P>
   But Oldsmobile is on a roll, with the success of its compact
Alero, the continuing praise for the big Aurora, and the Aurora V-8
engine's overwhelming success in the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   Indy racing hasn't had a strong crossover effect the way NASCAR
has for Pontiac. But for those in the know, the Motorsport Aurora
V-8 has proved to be a sturdy power plant, eclipsing rival
Infiniti. This could signify that Oldsmobile's civilian engines are
bulletproof, too, though not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The new Twin Cam 3.5-liter engine is an outgrowth of the Aurora
V-8 program, replacing the venerable pushrod 3.8 engine. It's
smoother and stronger, though highway gas mileage is a bit off in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   As well as being a good performer on the highway, it's also
interesting on paper. With a total of four camshafts and two-piece
cast-aluminum-block design, the V-6 seems more like something
designed by Alfa Romeo than Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   For it to become a mainstream engine in a midsize General Motors
sedan is somewhat remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile says that other than routine oil and filter changes,
the engine is zero maintenance for 100,000 miles, including no
attention needed for spark plugs and engine coolant. I don't know
about you, but I think I'd get nervous after about 50,000 miles of
ignoring my engine.
</P>
<P>
   With its Twin Cam V-6, the Intrigue proved to be a quick and
enjoyable driver. The engine has lots of torque right off the line
and soars smoothly to its upper rpm limits. It's also smooth and
quiet, with refined behavior and minimal vibration, and it runs on
regular.
</P>
<P>
   On a quick freeway drive to Cottonwood, the Intrigue proved to
be a comfortable cruiser. Just past Black Canyon City, it sprinted
up the long, steep incline to Sunset Point with minimal effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Intrigue, a good-looking sedan with styling cues that echo
Oldsmobile's flagship, the Aurora sedan, is surprisingly roomy
inside. The GLS model we tested was plush and loaded with comfort
and convenience features, including an excellent Delco-Bose stereo
system. At nearly $1,000, including a 12-CD changer, it had better
be good.
</P>
<P>
   Another expensive option on the test car was a set of chromed
aluminum wheels at $700. They do look sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wheel, the Intrigue feels like an import, and you can
tell that Olds designers and engineers spent a lot of time studying
the competition from Europe and Japan. Handling is quick and
balanced, though Intrigue feels too plush and heavy to be
considered sporty.
</P>
<P>
   It shares the same basic chassis design as Pontiac Grand Prix,
which has a muscle-car flair, and Buick Regal, a nicely designed
luxury ride with a softer feel. Intrigue is the most distinctive,
with its broad-shouldered Aurora styling and low-front aspect.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to steal customers from the imports, Intrigue has the
disadvantage of not offering stick shift, unlike V6-powered foes
Camry, Nissan Maxima and Volkswagen Passat. Accord offers stick in
four-cylinder models only. Many foreign-car drivers like to shift
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser GX version of Intrigue starts at just more than
$21,000, about comparable with the V-6 versions of the imports, but
no real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile seems to be back in action after a few years of
marginal existence as GM's weak-sister division. It looked for a
while that America's oldest continuous car company barely would
make it past its 100th birthday before keeling over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a collection of attractive new products and a lock on
IRL competition, Oldsmobile seems back in the race. &QL;

GARDEN ONE-UPS THE DESERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Sonoran
desert's wildflower display will be puny this year.
</P>
<P>
   A dry winter is producing a dull spring - unlike last year, one
of the best for viewing desert vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   But floraphiles can take heart. A glorious display of native
foliage is waiting at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, where
the experts have fooled Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The trick? Water.
</P>
<P>
   When plants are watered, they bloom. Irrigation can do for
captive plants what wild plants must depend on rain for. Gardeners
have been watering their charges diligently, and the results are
rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is at the mercy of the weather,'' said Mary Irish,
the botanical garden's director of public horticulture. ``We can
make things happen . . . There are the same species here that you
would see on the desert and many, many more. It's a good substitute
for the color of the desert. ''
</P>
<P>
   Of the garden's 145 acres (including administrative offices and
research acreage), 45 are open to the public, featuring a mile of
walking trails that wind past trees, flowers, cacti and succulents,
including a separate Cactus House and Succulent House.
</P>
<P>
   With plenty of drinking fountains and comfortable benches along
the way, it's a comfortable and pleasant expedition. Garden docents
are stationed at various points to explain and demonstrate the
magic of the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors learn, for example, about the healing benefits of aloe
leaves and objects made from desert plants.
</P>
<P>
   People are surprised by what they see, Irish said. Most expect
some cactus, some succulents, some rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much more than that,'' she said. ``I think they think
it's very stark until they come to this garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Such beauty doesn't escape the notice of winter visitors,
accustomed to vastly different species of plant life in their home
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different for us,'' said Minnesotan Phyllis Clover,
whose garden in Duluth features such perennial flowers as
geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   She and husband Charles have made the Phoenix garden a must-see
during their annual two-month stay in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come every year for 7 years,'' she said. ``This is where
we bring guests who come to visit us.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Irv and Mabel Kaufman are habitual garden-goers when
they visit their son, Alan Kaufman, a Scottsdale attorney. The
couple are avid gardeners back home in New York, where they have a
place in the city and also a house in a wooded area in East
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Mabel Kaufman is the former editor of a horticultural newsletter
in her community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get tired of it,'' Irv Kaufman said of the botanical
garden. ``I love it - the wide range, the shapes and adaptability
and the habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvelous place.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish well understands the appeal her garden has for
out-of-towners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they like is that it's such a potent display of plants
that are not (available) where they live,'' she said. ``And it's a
really big garden. It has a powerful impact on you. Most people
don't realize there are so many plants that are desert plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the garden's most prized specimens are four crested
saguaros - surreal-looking cactus that develop tangled crowns
instead of stately arms. The plants are a botanical enigma,
baffling scientists as to how they develop their unusual shapes.
The phenomenon is apparently due to unchecked cell differentiation
that occurs only once in many thousands of saguaros.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the cascalote tree, which is located near the
garden's Webster Center and produces glorious yellow blossoms, and
the agave, from which tequila and mescal are made.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd favorite is the skunk tree, an Australian plant named
for its odor that increases with atmospheric humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will knock you out,'' Irish said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   What visitors often find hard to believe is that this is not a
natural desert preserve. Except for the creosote trees, all of the
vegetation has been transplanted to this spot and carefully
propagated like backyard landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives a very naturalistic feel,'' Irish said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only our own Sonoran desert but similar regions from around
the world are represented. There is a piece of the Australian
desert as well as the desert of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Irish said, ``the South African bulbs are blooming
like crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other specialty areas include the vegetable and herb garden, the
native crop garden (featuring such traditional crops as corn,
beans, gourds, squash and cotton), the mesquite bosque (natural
shelters formed by mesquite root bundles) and the Hispanic gardens
(plants originally brought to Arizona from Mexico).
</P>
<P>
   A stand of telescopes is located near the Mountain Vista ramada
for viewing the far edges of the garden as well as such sites as
Camelback Mountain and the Superstition Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the garden is the Patio Cafe and Ullman
Terrace, where visitors can enjoy lunch under the trees. Arcadia
Farms sells sandwiches, salads, muffins, cookies and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this the perfect place to have lunch?'' Helen Wooden
commented as she and friend Shirley Lewis, both Scottsdale
residents, enjoyed lunch on a recent balmy day while birds chirped
and the garden's two resident cats ambled past their table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who can't climb the desert
anymore,'' said Wooden, who uses a Bobcat motorized scooter to get
around. ``Just to be here, I feel I'm out in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden, who visits the garden at least three times a week, is
training to be a volunteer. She says the facility is completely
accessible to people with disabilities. In her snappy bright red
scooter, she can easily navigate the trails and access the patio.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Desert Botanical Garden celebrated its 60th
anniversary, marking a milestone as the third oldest such facility
in the West. The Boyce Thompson Arboretum in Superior, Az., opened
in 1929, and the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical
Gardens in San Marino, Calif., opened to the public in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a gift shop and plant shop, the Phoenix garden
offers a full schedule of public events and welcomes school groups.
</P>
<P>
   Best time for viewing the garden is now through mid-April, while
the blooming cactus are in their glory.

 TEXAS HICK SURVIVES BENEATH McCONAUGHEY'S HOLLYWOOD VENEER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The sexiest thing of all,'' drawls Matthew
McConaughey, leaning forward and intensifying his blue-green gaze,
``is when two people are having a conversation within inches of
each other ... to be able to talk going into a kiss and coming out
of a kiss. Some actors'll tell ya it's weird or a pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Texan, 29, grins blindingly. ``But they're lyin'. It's
daaaaamn great.''
</P>
<P>
   He picks up a paper cup off the table and spits in it: brown
ooze that had been brewing inside his lower lip. It's a wad of
chew! (Talk about a virtual cold shower.) Is this the face (and
bod) that launched a million female hormonal episodes two years
ago, when the then-unknown actor graced the cover of Vanity Fair?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the supermarket and suddenly I see my face on this
magazine cover!'' he recollects happily. ``At first I thought I was
dreaming, and then I laughed out loud. I picked it up, found the
prettiest checkout girl and showed it to her: `Pretty good-looking
guy, huh?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is McConaughey in a nutshell. Open as the Texas plains,
undeniably sexy, completely comfortable in his skin _ and a
died-in-the-flannel hick. Despite having landed some choice roles
in recent years, including leads in ``A Time to Kill,'' ``Contact''
and ``Amistad,'' the spotlight has not blinded him.
</P>
<P>
   He still says grace before meals and pays tribute to his
``mama'' in interviews. (``I've gotten really wonderful things, and
I believe in reciprocity.'') He takes cabs rather than limos, and
if seen in public at all it's in dives or music clubs with his
buddies. He has no need for the Hollywood crowd and their scene.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ron Howard, when casting his film ``EDtv'' _ which
depicts the chaos that befalls an Average Joe (Ed/McConaughey) when
he is chosen to have his life filmed 24 hours a day _ says
McConaughey caused him to completely rewrite the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of Ed was initially written for a Jewish guy from New
Jersey with a crazy suburban family,'' Howard says. ``But during
auditions Matthew told stories _ about his friends in Texas, his
family. He was so totally engaging and personable that it shifted
my whole way of thinking about the role.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Lowell Ganz, who wrote the script with Babaloo Mandel,
``The minute Matthew started working with us the script got better.
He came up with a lot of the gags himself _ like the Wall of
Chrome.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the wall of hubcaps that Ed displays proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Was this McConaughey's personal collection?
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``No, I do not have a wall of chrome. We're not alike
in every sense. Although Ed is a big Burt Reynolds fan and so am I.
Early Burt, mind you _ circa `Smokey and the Bandit.'''
</P>
<P>
   With McConaughey, what you see is what you get: a good-natured
boy with values, a few honest vices and few Hollywood affectations.
One of those is yerba mate, a trendy herb that McConaughey said he
switched to from caffeine because he ``couldn't take the highs and
lows.''
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey's little vices have not gotten in the way of his
romantic leading man status. As Jenna Elfman, his co-star in
``EDtv,'' said recently: ``Are you kidding? He's gorgeous, he's got
a great body and he's a fabulous kisser. What's not to like?''
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, McConaughey blushes. ``Well, I've been lucky to
have had such good actresses to work with!''
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Jodie Foster, Julianne Margulies, Ashley Judd,
Elizabeth Hurley and Sandra Bullock, who has been his off-and-on
girlfriend for some time now.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Are people surprised to find that McConaughey, who has a degree
in filmmaking from the University of Texas, is a smart and
thoughtful guy? He does not seem pleased by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? You mean, because they take pictures of me on hay bales,
because I have an accent, and wear a coozie (a beer bottle holder)
around my neck? People are gonna think what they want to think. I
know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to keep people guessing. After doing ``EDtv,''
McConaughey threw himself into a World War II drama, tentatively
titled ``U571,'' about Americans breaking a German code that
enabled them to destroy our submarines. This is no romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``No, not a love story, although we're trying to save
every woman in the world. I guess our mistress is the sea.''

LONE STAR SPRING ARRIVES IN A COLORFUL NEW BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring is here, and what better time to consider a new and
heartwarming book about the season.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of ``Heralds of Spring in Texas'' by naturalist
Roland H. Wauer (Texas A&AMP;M University Press, $24.95) can best be
captured in the author's story about his yearly anticipation of the
return of the buff-bellied hummingbird to the back yard of his home
in the south Texas city of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day it is not present, and the very next it is sipping
sugar water from one of the feeders as if it had never left,''
Wauer writes. ```Betty, our buff-belly is back!' I yell to my wife.
She, too, must have a look. And we admire our new, eagerly
anticipated neighbor almost as if it were a newly born human
child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heralds of Spring in Texas'' divides the state into seven
regions and describes the harbingers of the season in each. For the
Hill Country, there's the bluebonnet, of course, as well as the
redbud trees, the mountain laurel, the chimney swifts, field
sparrows and other annual visitors _ even Maury Maverick's beloved
purple martins.
</P>
<P>
   If you grew up anywhere in Texas, this book will bring back
plenty of springtime memories, sights and smells.
</P>
<P>
   Quotes from Texans and visitors enhance chapters, and line
drawings by Ralph Scott add a lot to this volume in the Louise
Lindsey Merrick natural environment series of A&AMP;M Press.
</P>
<P>
   The late J. Frank Dobie, Texas' folktale king and lover of
nature, said of the Texas bluebonnet: ``No other flower _ for me at
least _ brings such upsurging of the spirit and at the same time
such restfulness.'' And A.L. Morgan described bluebonnet time as
the time ``when the sky falls on Texas.'' Amen.

BOOK ON CLICHES CAN BE READ OVER AND OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer and lexicographer Betty Kirkpatrick cut her teeth as a
wordplay expert while editing both ``The Bloomsbury Thesaurus'' and
the latest edition of ``Roget's Thesaurus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's given students of the language something else to chew
on: the overused, often abused phrases that cover a multitude of
sins when we're grasping at straws, have a lot on our plate or find
ourselves at sixes and sevens, glad to find any port in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliches: Over 1,500 Phrases Explored and Explained'' (St.
Martin's Press, $12.95 paperback) runs the gamut from ``absence
makes the heart grow fonder'' to ``yours truly,'' and Kirkpatrick
provides origins and meanings for every man jack of them. She
defines ``cliche'' as ``a pejorative term for an expression that
has lost its first bloom and thus its potency but is nevertheless
widespread and sometimes even loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Kirkpatrick's book should be popular far and
wide; you might call it the greatest thing since sliced bread or
the cat's meow, or you may think it's just a flash in the pan that
should be nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>

   What lives without a body, speaks without a tongue; Everyone can
hear it, yet no one can see it? An echo, according to a Lithuanian
riddle. What is the wink that inspires fear? A bolt of lightning,
says a riddle from the Philippines. Phil Cousineau has collected
many examples of sophisticated wordplay in ``Riddle Me This: A
World Treasury of Word Puzzles, Folk Wisdom and Literary
Conundrums'' (Conari Press, $13.95 hardback). The book's foreword
notes that all riddles have evolved from the riddle of who we are
and why we're here, and that more wordplay can help us find our
place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest forms of folk wisdom, the riddle is explored
in all its variations. Here's a Breton riddle: ``What is it that a
young man can give a maiden/ That he does not have, That he cannot
have, that he has never had,/ That he will never have,/ and that he
cannot give to a young man?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The name of a wife.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fractured Fairy Tales,'' told by A.J. Jacobs (Bantam, $9.95
paperback) will be highly prized by anyone who grew up with the
wacky and wonderful stories on the television shows ``Rocky and His
Friends'' and ``The Bullwinkle Show.'' Many of the funny tales,
long and convoluted, are collected here; they generally end with a
punny punch line such as ``A mule and his honey are soon parted''
or ``Fishing might make it so.''

MEXICO'S `FUSION' CUISINE A CULINARY TAPESTRY  
 (INCLUDES RECIPES AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AJIJIC, Jalisco, Mexico _ In the open-air restaurant of the
Danza del Sol, the cooking-class participants focused on the slim,
elegant woman in the white chef's coat with flags of Mexico
embroidered on the collar.
</P>
<P>
   She sauteed a mixture of mushrooms and roasted, peeled poblano
chiles. Cooked with an onion and lots of garlic, the aroma was
fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Quintana, the first break-out cook, author and teacher
who has received widespread international recognition for
popularizing the cuisines of Mexico, gave numerous ideas for the
mushroom-chile mixture. The recipe was much more than its stated
name, Queso Fundido con Champinones y Rajas de Poblano (Melted
Cheese with Mushrooms and Poblano Chile Strips).
</P>
<P>
   ``As the rainy season starts to come, we will have a lot of
mushrooms,'' said Quintana, who is based in Mexico City. ``You can
make a soup with the mushrooms, (begin ital) rajas (end ital)
(chile strips) and squash blooms. You can also do mushrooms and
(begin ital) rajas (end ital) in crepes, or stuff into enchiladas.
I feel you have to prepare a simple dish for vegetarians at
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   You could also add just a little cream to the mixture and serve
it over rice, she said. To change the flavor a bit, add either
cilantro or epazote (a Mexican herb that is slowly gaining
acceptance in this country), or fennel or a touch of anise.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of two mornings, Quintana wove a colorful spell
of high culinary adventure over fascinated students at the first
class of Jalisco Culinary Adventures. The new cooking school has
Phoenix ties through its consultant, Joanne Goldwater, who for 10
years ran a catering business in the Valley and is one of the
founders of Goldwater Foods.
</P>
<P>
   One of Goldwater's friends, Norman Fierros of Norman's Arizona,
is scheduled to teach April 18-24 in Ajijic, a lovely village on
Lake Chapala.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater and Sally Leonard help with some of the social events
for the week of the tour, such as leading trips into the (begin
ital) abastos, (end ital) the wholesale market, in Guadalajara, a
half-hour away. During the week of the culinary tour, class members
take other trips, too, such as through the Sol brewery, known by
ubiquitous Sol advertising in even the smallest Mexican villages.
</P>
<P>
   Students go to Tlaquepaque, an upscale area in Guadalajara, or
may ride the Tequila Train, four new train cars that depart from
Guadalajara every weekend for the village of Tequila, 35 miles to
the northwest. Mariachi music and beverage service start
immediately on the all-day excursion, which includes a tour of a
tequila factory, ballet folklorico performances in the town plaza
and a buffet meal.
</P>
<P>
   Because Jalisco state is the major producer of tequila, some of
the recipes include cooking with tequila. Bruce Jensen, head of the
school, teaches a class focusing on tortillas, salsas and soups.
Staff member Andrew Bosworth, who holds a Ph.D. in international
relations, lectures on the rise of Mexican culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico was the first country to have ``fusion'' cuisine,
Bosworth pointed out, the first example of Old World foods fusing
with New World techniques and ingredients when the Spanish brought
wheat, olive oil, sugar and almonds, among other foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the world's most sophisticated and subtle
cuisines,'' he said, ``although many people think otherwise because
of Taco Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting thing about Mexican cuisine is its history,
Quintana said. And there is no one ``Mexican food'' because all
dishes are regional: ``Chiles and so much else are local to the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 32 different regions of inland cooking, and
spectacular things you can eat on the Pacific Coast and the
Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico,'' she said. ``I hope in the next
century, Mexico will be the next cuisine to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Seed sauces, such as the Pipian Verde with chicken that she made
the first day, with raw peanuts and unsalted pumpkin seeds, were
used by pre-Hispanic Indian tribes. To bring out their flavor,
Quintana first sauteed the seeds in a little oil. Pumpkin seeds are
a great source of calcium, she told the class.
</P>
<P>
   Quintana gracefully handled the situation when disaster nearly
claimed the second day.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful pork crown roast had marinated overnight in an adobo
sauce made from vinegar, onion, guajillo and guajillo puya chiles,
garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, allspice and pepper. It was
baking in a big Pyrex dish, and Quintana pulled it halfway from the
oven to add hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The dish suddenly shattered, glass all over the inside of the
oven. No one knew why, but it was certainly dramatic. Jensen
decreed a break while cleanup took place.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there was extra adobo sauce to be poured over the
roast when it was cleaned up and transferred to another dish. Soon,
Quintana, unruffled, was making guacamole, chopping it with two
knives at once with controlled vigor. Tie the pork roast together
into its crown shape and serve the guacamole in the center, she
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Her guacamole recipe: Chop together three avocados, about 1/2
cup white onion, 6 or 7 raw tomatillos, one serrano chile or to
taste, plus cilantro, salt and lime juice to taste. Drizzle with a
little olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guacamole is very indigenous to native people,'' Quintana
said. ``And it is a sauce. You can garnish it with tomatoes on top,
and onion.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Zoque Black Beans, named after an ancient Indian community
that still exists in Chiapas state, were a revelation. Quintana
pureed half the beans with only a little of the cooking broth to
make a thick mixture that she then made into ``refritos'' _
``well-fried'' beans. Eventually, they were so thick she flipped
them in the skillet like an omelet.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the beans were also pureed, but thinned with
bean broth to a soupy consistency. These became the sauce for
Enfrijoladas, an enchiladalike dish of corn tortillas passed
through the bean sauce, folded on a platter, garnished with more
beans, chopped onions, creme fraiche and feta or ranchero cheese.
Simple. Wonderful.
</P>

Zoque Black Beans &QL; 
 &QL; 
(From Patricia Quintana) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beans:
</P>
<P>
   12 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound dried black beans, sorted, soaked overnight in water
to cover, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 medium white onions, peeled and halved
</P>
<P>
   3 bunches scallions, tied in a bundle
</P>
<P>
   1 whole head garlic, halved but not peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 strips bacon (or 1/4 cup minced chorizo sausage)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium white onion, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup corn or safflower oil, as needed
</P>
<P>
   Garnish:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   12 dried de arbol chiles or 20 small Simojovel chiles or 14
dried japones chiles
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add the beans, onion,
scallion and garlic. Cook the beans, covered, over medium heat for
1 to 1 1/2 hours or until tender. If the water evaporates before
the beans soften, add small quantities of hot water. Season with
salt and simmer the beans until thick. Remove the scallions and
garlic and puree the beans with 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid in a
food processor or blender until they form a thick puree.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a large skillet, fry the bacon strips until crisp.
Remove the bacon and drain on a paper towel. Crumble and reserve
the bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Add the onion and cook, uncovered, until it has begun to
caramelize. Add small portions of the bean puree, stirring
constantly while cooking over medium heat. Add oil if needed. Add
all of the beans and simmer uncovered until they are very thick and
can be flipped like an omelet.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare garnish:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a medium skillet. Add the chiles
and quickly stir-fry them with a pinch of salt. Do not let them
burn. Remove the skillet from the heat as soon as the chiles are
crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Scoop the beans onto a large platter and garnish with the
reserved bacon and whole chiles. Or, chop the chiles and sprinkle
over the beans, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with freshly made tortillas.

</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup feta, farmer's or ranchero cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   Place the beans in a blender and add the broth. Blend until a
medium-thick sauce is formed. Pour into a large skillet and cover
to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   In another skillet, heat oil and pass the tortillas through it,
one by one, for a few seconds each. Dry on paper towels and
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the blended beans in the skillet. Dip each tortilla into
the bean sauce and remove. Fold and place the tortillas on a
serving platter. When all are dipped, pour more sauce over them.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with cream and crumbled cheese.
</P>
<P>

fresh cheese before folding, or sprinkle tops with cooked,
well-drained chorizo.

MEXICAN CUISINE TIPS  
 (WITH QUINTANA-FOOD) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooking teacher and author Patricia Quintana offers these
pointers: &QL; 
- To approximate the taste of the thick Mexican crema that so
captivates visitors: Mix equal parts sour cream and heavy cream. &QL; 
- Toast dried chiles to bring out their flavor but be careful not
to burn them. Open them to flatten and mash down with a spatula on
a hot, dry griddle or skillet. &QL; 
- What about removing seeds from chiles to reduce their heat?
Quintana believes the flavor is in the seeds but advocates taking
seeds out of large dried chiles. &QL; 
- Any kind of chile seeds can be toasted and used for garnish. &QL; 
- Wash dried chiles with a little brush to remove dust or sand
before using them. &QL; 
- Dried chiles need air to prevent bug infestation. Keep them in a
non-airtight container or pierce them with a needle to let air get
inside each chile or freeze them. &QL; 
- To reduce heat, soak fresh chiles in a water and vinegar solution
for 15 minutes. &QL; 
- Top a pizza crust with refried beans, strips of chipotles in
adobo sauce and cheese. &QL; 
- If you put a little oil on your hands first, handling chiles
won't hurt you. However, if you wear contact lenses, be sure to
wear gloves so you won't get chile residue on your hands. &QL; 
- Add salt to beans only after they have cooked long enough to
soften. &QL; 
- When cooked with beans, avocado leaves, especially the leaves
from the small variety known as cocktail avocados, have the same
gas-eliminating effect as epazote. &QL; 
- Use an inexpensive wicker basket as a colander or strainer.
Quintana demonstrated how she uses a basket to strain cooked
nopales, or diced cactus pads. It cut the sliminess of the
nopalitos like magic. &QL; 
- Use a large spoon to scoop the flesh out of a mango half. &QL;

MORE FASHION LOSERS THAN WINNERS FOR THE OSCARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gwyneth Paltrow, winner of the Oscar for best actress,
stepped onto the red carpet to greet Joan Rivers before the 71st
annual Academy Awards broadcast from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
in Los Angeles, there was an audible gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Paltrow, on the arm of her father, Bruce, a bona
fide Hollywood princess, she looked the part. Pretty in pink
doesn't even describe Paltrow's full-on Ralph Lauren ball gown with
its simple princess lines, graceful skirt, deeply veed back and
graceful matching organza shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow has become the Tinseltown fashion icon _ a cool blonde
whose stylists have chosen the best of the fashion trends and
displayed them on the beyond-perfect dress hanger. And on Oscar
night, with her sleek, neat hair and simple diamonds, Paltrow set
the bar for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Full-on ballgowns, worn by probably half of the women at the
Oscars, are a blessed relief from years of skin-tight slip dresses
that have as much personality as cold spaghetti. Anne Heche's gray
T-shirt top looked like a sweatshirt and needed more support than
partner Ellen DeGeneres' arm. The other slipdress came on Goldie
Hawn _ a sky-blue, side-split, sequin-sparkled slink that did
nothing for Hawn's sunny complexion.
</P>
<P>
   For true old-style Hollywood glamour, you had to turn to
Jennifer Lopez, whose strapless Badgley Mischka, embroidered with a
Victorian necklace motif across the front, was black silk taffeta
with a massive skirt. For the past two years, Lopez has worn more
skin than clothes, stuff guaranteed to show off her shapely booty.
This year, she was positively ladylike.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hunt decided to wear more makeup this year. Instead of the
pale, skinny wraith who wore skin-bleaching ice-blue Gucci last
year, Hunt was the picture of the '70s Italian screen goddess in
her sleeveless, backless, brilliant- trimmed dove gray Gucci. Her
hair was middle parted and Cher-straight; her lips were pale
yellowed-down peach; and her eyes, raccoon-rings of kohl assisted
with fake eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Canadian songbird Celine Dion is faultlessly dressed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in her reverse tuxedo-jacketed white pants ensemble
from John Galliano for Dior, with its matching fedora and $28,000
diamond-encrusted Ray Ban sunglasses, she was better suited for
MTV. Galliano also dressed ``Elizabeth'' star Cate Blanchette in a
simple, mini-fleurette embroidered net gown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Renee Zellweger should fire the stylist who did up
her hair like Mrs. Miniver and put her in a lavender gown trimmed
in gold braid that was not only so skin tight she could hardly
walk, but made her look fat and 40. Sharing honors with Zellweger
and Dion for worst dress was Meryl Streep, whose sequin-sparkled
beige-peach gown may have complemented her complexion but resembled
something Hints from Heloise would have recommended to scrub pots.
</P>
<P>
   Without Ashley Judd, her gardenias and her leg-revealing Richard
Tyler, there was no real va-voom dress except for the top of Lisa
Kudrow's steel-gray Randolph Duke. Beautifully cut and spangled, it
promised to be the slinky dress of the night when viewed from the
waist up, but disappeared in an a-line length of duchesse satin.
</P>
<P>
   Most women were gowned so politely, they should have been
wearing white gloves. Pamela Dennis' blue strapless number for Liv
Tyler was quite sweet but nothing special; Dennis did better for
Joan Rivers with a two-piece ruby red sequined gown. Rivers'
daughter Melissa, co-hosting E! Entertainment's pre-Oscar show,
covered up her fresh lime green Vera Wang with a turquoise pashmina
shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Duke dressed quite a few women, including Geena Davis _ the sexy
number she wore for the Oscars themselves, that is. (For her boring
pre-Oscar show, Davis wore a peach satin corset dress by a designer
named Bradley Bayou that looked like Escada lite.) Duke put Kim
Basinger in a plain white strapless dress and also gowned Minnie
Driver for the second year. Last year's second-skin cranberry
number (which Duke did while designing for Halston) started a run
on color that flowered at this year's awards like Giverney.
</P>
<P>
   Very few women even considered black except for Annette Bening,
whose Armani shtick is wearing thin (tastefully boring), and Sophia
Loren, whose belle poitrine is bigger and belle-er all the time.
(Roberto Benigni buried his nose in her net-draped bosom and almost
had a heart attack.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men, meanwhile, played it fairly safe with a few
variations. Robin Williams is still schlepping around in his
knee-length preacher coats. But Jim Carey's black monochromatic
look, with his black satin tie on a black silk tux shirt, was
handsome and striking. Ellen DeGeneres still had the best-looking
tuxedo, a white Richard Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer's Western-style satin-yoked jacket and string tie was
particularly appropriate as he presented an homage to the film
Western (alas, he was upstaged by a beautiful blonde, a skittery
palomino better groomed than he was).
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' director, India's Shekhar Kapur, was festively
attired in a burgundy velvet jacket trimmed in gold with an
embroidered shirt.

SOFTWARE MAKERS APPLAUD APPLE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The computer industry welcomed Apple Computer
Inc.'s decision to give away the software coding for its new
Macintosh server operating system.
</P>
<P>
   By giving away the code for its new Mac OS X Server, Apple has
endorsed and entered a new era of software development, allowing
any programmer to improve upon and make new applications based on
the software.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement by the Cupertino, Calif.-based company
means the Mac OS X ``kernel,'' or programming core, is available to
pretty much anyone through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should provide a quicker turnaround for developers,''
said Scott Seebass, chief executive of Berkeley-based Xinet Inc.,
which produces software programs for the printing industry. ``You
can develop (programs) without relying on the operating system
vendor to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mac OS X Server software costs $499, about half what Apple
had originally announced in January. The server and software
together cost $4,999, and are faster than systems running
Microsoft's Windows NT, Linux and Sun's Solaris brand of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of open source distribution of the software is to
encourage developers to make new software based on a core program.
In theory, when those software applications become popular, a
standard evolves that benefits the company, Apple in this case,
that created the core program.
</P>
<P>
   Open source programming has gained momentum recently due to the
growing popularity and acceptance of Linux, a free, Unix-based
operating system developed by Finnish student Linus Torvalds, that
is shaping up to be the only viable alternative to Microsoft's
dominant Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Like Apple's Mac OS X, Linux is primarily used to run servers
and not individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing companies and educational institutions, the mainstay
of Apple's non-consumer business, should benefit most from the move
toward open source distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect a huge rush of people to convert (to the
Macintosh platform) but it will maintain Apple's dominance in
education and publishing,'' Seebass said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris LeToq, an analyst at San Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest
Inc., said Mac OS X Server ``supports what Apple is doing in these
marketplaces and really means that their customers don't have to
look elsewhere for server technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts were mixed on whether businesses using other
software platforms, namely Windows NT, will switch to Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Seebass was optimistic about Apple's open source attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will attract the same people who are converting from NT to
Linux,'' he said. ``If you're working on NT, you have to rely on
Microsoft. (Apple) might convert some people who aren't happy with
their current options.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. in
New York, said Apple probably would not gain many new business
customers immediately, but there could be more interest down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open source thing will promote cross-fertilization,'' he
said. ``The Linux guys who've been frustrated because there's no
Apple support (may convert). That's a potentially very big win for
Apple. But that's a longer-term thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Mazzucchelli said Apple needs to be very
careful in how it advertises and markets Mac OS X. Because the
product is targeted toward business customers, Apple shouldn't
advertise in general interest newspapers or magazines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have to focus and not get their messages mixed,''
Mazzucchelli said. ``They don't want to confuse their consumer
customers.''

A GRIPPING POST-MORTEM OF A SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything, especially in book publishing. Maureen
Orth, best-known for her work in Vanity Fair, has written an
exceptionally good account of suspected serial killer Andrew
Cunanan's spree in 1997, and odds are that very few people will
notice _ or be able to recall just who Andrew Cunanan even was.
</P>
<P>
   A monster, that's who, a man who lied his way through most of 30
years and, when he finally ran out of lies or at least an audience
for them, turned violent. The combined forces of virtually every
national law enforcement agency never could catch Cunanan, who
traveled from Minnesota to Florida, killing five people, police
say. In the end, Cunanan was shot down by his worst enemy: himself.
</P>
<P>
   But being suspected of taking the lives of designer Gianni
Versace, along with four others, isn't enough, in these sad days,
to earn Cunanan eternal or even lengthy infamy. ``Vulgar Favors''
debuts on bookshelves at the same time as ``Monica's Story'' and
George Stephanopoulos' ``All Too Human,'' tales of White House
shenanigans that are (we assume) more rare than a nut-case with a
gun. We can rephrase a popular bumper sticker from the Nixon era:
``Nobody Died at Monicagate.'' But it won't help sell copies of
``Vulgar Favors'' _ even though it may be a far more important book
than Monica Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   In some sense, Andrew Cunanan is very much one of us. Orth takes
us into Cunanan's childhood, when he was alternately spoiled by
doting parents and forced to arbitrate Mom and Dad's stormy,
ultimately failed, marriage. The kid turned to fantasy, trying to
convince schoolmates that he came from a wealthy blue-blood clan.
If he went further than was safe, well, there was no one around to
tell him he had taken fantasy far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Orth tells this twisted story with grace and courage, taking
readers to some very warped places without condescending; Cunanan
and many of his pals are homosexual, but Orth demonstrates why they
are often despicable without suggesting that all gays are bad. What
simultaneously mesmerizes and repulses are the sadistic sexual
places Cunanan and company went, none of which can be properly
described in a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cunanan, his belly thickening and his audience
dwindling, leaves his beloved California to confront an ex-lover in
Minnesota, there is a tragic certainty to Orth's tale. In the final
third of her book, we marvel less that Cunanan snapped than at how
long it takes police and federal agencies to come up with a
coherent plan to capture him. Much of their hesitancy to act, Orth
notes, stems from the O.J. Simpson debacle _ nobody wanted to step
out front in a high-profile case unless success was absolutely
assured. And while the feds bumbled, Cunanan apparently kept
killing.
</P>
<P>
   And now, almost two years after Gianni Versace died in a pool of
his own blood, who will want to read about it? We live in a society
that inadvertently nurtures the occasional Andrew Cunanan. ``Vulgar
Favors'' tells us how, and we ought to listen.

FAVORITE WEB SITE LIST GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Back in February, we ran a list of your favorite Web
sites for 1998. If you missed the list, it can still be found at
www.azcentral.com/computing/viewpoint/0215hoyewebsites.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating such a list proved so popular with readers,
that I continued to receive recommendations long after the
submission deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites that didn't make it on the original list are
very good. So I've decided to revisit the topic by publishing a
sort of addendum to our original list.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are additional Web sites recommended by readers of
``The
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic'' as top sites for 1998:
</P>
<P>
   - www.trafficspy.com: The Traffic Spy Home Page is a handy site
if you need instructions on how to get from Point A to Point B, or
if you'd like to check out traffic cameras anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   - www.superkids.com: Thinking of buying your child some
educational software or a game? Check here first. The site offers a
lengthy list of software reviews and information for parents and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   - www.litsoft.com: Literate Software Systems, makers of Across
Lite crossword puzzle software, operates this site. If you are a
crossword puzzle lover, check it out.
</P>
<P>
   - www.hboi.edu: If you like boats, fish or the ocean, check out
the home of the Florida-based Harbor Branch Oceanographic
Institution Inc. The site offers visitors a chance to follow along
on a 20-day expedition to explore sharks.
</P>
<P>
   - investormap.com: Looking for information on a mutual fund? A
brokerage? Financial software? Global markets? Stock quotes? This
is a place to find all that, and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   - www.digitaldog.com/breeds.html: If you're a dog lover or a
would-be dog owner, you'll want to bookmark this site. It lists dog
breeds alphabetically, and provides images and useful information
on each, such as average lifespan and whether the dog is good with
children.
</P>
<P>

Unhappy over happy99.exe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I received a lot of e-mail following last week's column on
happy99.exe, a type of worm or Trojan horse program that spreads
via e-mail. Infected systems send copies of happy99.exe with each
outgoing e-mail without the user's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers said they had received copies of happy99.exe the
very morning the column appeared. I'm glad the information helped
stem the advance of this annoying program.
</P>
<P>
   A couple readers tipped me off to a file that happy99.exe
creates and that goes undetected by anti-virus programs. It's
called ``liste.ska.''
</P>
<P>
   The file isn't anything to be concerned about. In fact, it's the
only good file included in the whole happy99.exe mess.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the maker of happy99.exe decided it would be nice to
keep track of everyone sent a copy of happy99.exe from an infected
computer system. The list is kept in the file liste.ska.
</P>
<P>
   If you've had happy99.exe on your system, and didn't know about
this list, you've probably still got it bouncing around on your
hard drive. Conduct a file search, and you'll probably dig it up.
</P>
<P>
   You can open liste.ska using Notepad or any other
word-processing program you have installed on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Before deleting liste.ska, you might want to jot down the people
it lists (or print it out) and then send them an e-mail warning
that their computers might be infected with happy99.exe.

AN OSCAR FOR THE END OF PC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ When the 39 board members of the Motion
Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences approved ``with enthusiasm''
an honorary Oscar for Elia Kazan, their historic, high-profile
decision hastened the demise of the ``politically correct''
instinct in America.
</P>
<P>
   PC, whatever it was, lies in ruins, defeated by art, not
politics. It never was a movement, more like a conditioned reflex
or a college prank. Kazan shares his triumph with another Greek
genius, Aristotle, who propounded an iron rule of artistic
criticism: Judge the work, not the author.
</P>
<P>
   This artistic affirmation eclipses the ideological quarrels that
have surrounded Kazan since 1952, when he named names before the
House Committee on Un-American Activities. Kazan's honorary Oscar
ignited ``controversy,'' journalistic jargon suggesting that
somebody is unhappy about something.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy about what, exactly? That is where the politically
incorrect reflex tends to buckle and collapse. History was never
its forte, nor indeed was scholarship. If a snap judgment can not
explain a controversy, let's move on to another trend. Gywneth
Paltrow's hairdo will do.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, congressional investigators proceed on the
assumption, as preposterous as it was sinister, that communists in
Hollywood were poisoning American minds. Since ``informing'' and
``the blacklist'' mean little in today's Hollywood, Victor S.
Navasky wrote ``Naming Names'' in 1980, ``a moral detective story''
that allows readers to decide about Kazan and others.
</P>
<P>
   Working his way through Williams College and Yale's drama school
made Kazan an egalitarian. In 1935, he joined the Communist Party,
which he soon quit because of its ``slavery of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after his testimony, he took out an ad in The New
York Times, which Navasky reprints. It attacked ``specious
reasoning which has silenced many liberals. It goes like this: `You
may hate the communists, but you must not attack or expose them,
because if you do you are attacking the right to hold unpopular
opinions and you are joining the people who attack civil
liberties.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thought soberly about this. It is, simply, a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was troubled, but not apologetic, which riled his enemies.
``Anybody who informs on other people is doing something disturbing
and even disgusting,'' Kazan has said. ``It doesn't sit well on
anybody's conscience. . . . But I think it has to be judged from
the perspective of 1952.'' PC is rooted in hindsight, not real-time
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   After his testimony, Kazan teamed up with writer Budd Schulberg
for ``On the Waterfront,'' awarded the Oscar for best picture in
1954. Karl Malden, who proposed this year's honorary award, was one
of five actors from that film nominated for Oscars. He was best
supporting actor in 1951, directed by Kazan in ``Streetcar Named
Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   As Father Barry, the waterfront priest, Malden implores Terry
Malloy, played by Marlon Brando, to inform on mobsters and
racketeers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's my own brother they're asking me to finger _ and
Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I
was this high he took me to the ball games,'' Malloy mumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave
you a life pass to the Polo Grounds!'' the priest interjects, then
speaks softly: ``Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry.
It's your conscience that's got to do the asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Conscience does not compute in PC software. Conscience doth make
cowards of us all, said Shakespeare, also lavished with Oscar
honors despite being certifiably dead, white, and possibly male.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's politics will not long endure, but his art will. He
vanquished his foes and also transformed the style of protest.
Instead of ransacking the dean's office, Kazan's critics chose
silence, a blissful silence that also marks the passing of the
philistine era of political correctness.

MILLENNIUM ENDS ON MINIMAL NOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Twentieth-century music wanes, dying away in echoes.
Listen to the music of Philip Glass, and the echoes are of intense
harmonic consonance; of overlapping, trance-inducing beat patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the echoes do not match their sources. The
originating sounds, the musics of the early 20th century, were
abstracted and dissonant, jagged and brittle. Yet the echoes are an
eternal vamp of simple chords oodling away over a steady beat.
</P>
<P>
   The musical 20th century, which began with all 12 tones sounding
at once, is ending with a major triad in hypnotic repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it: What the hell happened? How
could such a beginning have such an ending? It's as if a tale that
started with the promise of dense plot structure and complex
characters concluded in the elimination of character and the
abandonment of plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explain it this way,'' says Glass over the phone from New
York. ``At the beginning of the 20th century, we had a crisis in
tonality. At the end of the 20th century, we have another crisis in
tonality. In between, we learned a terrific amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass bears a large portion of responsibility for the way the
musical century is ending. It was he who codified the language of
Minimalism when it emerged from the 1960s out of rock and roll and
Indian ragas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minimalism'' may be an old-hat term, and one Glass has not
used for many years, but its core meaning still applies to what
might more accurately be called The New Sound of Postmodern
composers: simple harmonic materials and pulse-oriented rhythms in
structures that emphasize repetition, frequently with melodic
material borrowed from cultures other than the West (Glass has
borrowed from India, North Africa and other cultures) or from
contemporary pop music (two Glass works are based on material by
David Bowie).
</P>
<P>
   It was also Glass who found in the theater the best and true
home for The New Sound, putting his ideas to work in such stage
pieces as ``Einstein on the Beach'' and ``Satyagraha.'' Glass'
theater affiliation is perfect for his music, because it throws
interest from the aural to the visual, turning the music into
illustration. Nowhere is the visual element's primacy in a Glass
opera more obvious than in the publicity surrounding his newest,
``Monsters of Grace'':
</P>
<P>
   High Art Meets High Tech! A digital opera in three dimensions.
3D GLASSES PROVIDED!
</P>
<P>
   From that you can ascertain that the opera, staged by
avant-garde director and longtime Glass collaborator Robert Wilson,
will use 3-D technologies, computer-generated images and
stereoscopic film in addition to live action.
</P>
<P>
   That's what to expect theatrically. What can we expect
musically? It should depend upon the ears that hear it. I find few
stylistic differences in his scores from one to the next. But
Glassophiles seem to find in each new foray by their hero some tiny
bit of change that augurs new artistic horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The composer, speaking for himself, sees the seminal
accomplishment of his career very clearly as the positioning of
rhythm at the center of musical structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the progression in harmony from Monteverdi to
Schonberg, is a gradual expansion and addition of the harmonic
language. There's the famous passage in Wagner where you can no
longer tell what key you're in, and then Schonberg comes along and
resolves the matter in 12-tone,'' Glass says.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first ``crisis in tonality.'' Harmony as the basis
of musical structure had become so complicated that it had to break
up and be pieced back together in the early 20th century as Arnold
Scho nberg's dodecaphony.
</P>
<P>
   Schonberg's 12-tone music _ the deliberately dissonant language
sometimes called serialism _ may have failed as a popular language,
says Glass, but it retrained our ears:
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole development of serial techniques taught us to listen
in a very different way. If you go to any movie, the language of
ordinary commercial music is radically different from 100 years
ago. The whole parameters of consonance and dissonance have
shifted.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift eventually brought about Glass' ``second crisis in
tonality,'' the absence of structure. Structure had always been
harmony-based, and with traditional functional harmonies gone,
where was structure's rationale? Glass's answer was to substitute
rhythm:
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was, `Which one is the functional element
(harmony or rhythm)? Which one drives the structure of a piece?' In
my early works I employed rhythmic structure first, then later
reintegrated the ideas of harmonic or tonal structure. I was
looking at the possibility that rhythmic structure could form an
overall structure, with harmony and rhythm in a unified field.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass' ``unified field theory'' was first employed in,
appropriately enough, ``Einstein on the Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if the old man couldn't do it, maybe I could,''
Glass laughs, referring to Einstein's failed effort to forge the
original unified field theory of physics.
</P>
<P>
   But Glass' unified field theory may be no more successful than
Einstein's. Rhythm _ more specifically, the beat or pulse _ remains
primary even in Glass' more recent and harmonically somewhat less
redundant music. It could be that the matter of harmony vs. rhythm
as structural primaries remain either-or. In Glass and in all the
New Sound music, harmony takes a back seat to an even pulse.
</P>
<P>
   If Schonberg is the Alpha and Glass the Omega of 20th-century
Western art music, the alphabet between is more diverse than you'd
expect. Glass loves it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of the 20th century, I think of John Cage and
John Coltrane, Rachmaninoff and Messiaen. I think of Bob Dylan. The
range of creative music in the 20th century is breathtaking, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   We started by asking how a single century could begin with
absolute dissonance and conclude in its opposite. Here's my best
guess, take it or leave it:
</P>
<P>
   Theory. The 20th century has been defined by theory. Not all of
it _ not even most of it _ but the parts that prop it up as an
object for music historians. Schonberg theorized that music could
be made with 12 tones of equal importance, without a tonal center.
The theory came first, the practice later. Glass theorized that
music could be made of rhythm with harmonies attached almost as
afterthoughts, and then he practiced what he theorized.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not these gambits were generated by ``crises in
tonality'' is beside the point. And whether in practice they have
succeeded in producing great music matters not so much to a
theory-obsessed century as their success in redefining what music
can be. &QL;

IRISH LEADERS CARRY HOME THE MESSAGE ON PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Seamus Mallon was remarking the other day on the
presence here of nearly 200 very big shots from Ireland _ North and
Republic _ for what is, after all, Ireland's own great day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we all come here,'' said the new deputy first
minister of the North's new elected Assembly on his first such
visit, ``is a sign of our political immaturity.''
</P>
<P>
   A good point, if a bit harsh in light of all that's been done in
the '90s to give peace and power-sharing a chance. But Mallon was
correct: When Washington is not crawling with Irish government and
political leaders during St. Patrick's week is when a functioning
new society in the North will be reality.
</P>
<P>
   They don't come for the fun. In Bill Clinton's time, the week
has been the occasion for very hard work; this year it started on
the Sunday before and continued without pause right through the
huge White House bash and equally stunning Irish Embassy
after-party on the day itself.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mallon (also deputy to John Hume in Northern
Ireland's largest Catholic party) and his fellow leaders were given
an unambiguous message from their trusted American friends and
supporters _ absolute intolerance of any remaining roadblocks or
stalemates in implementing last year's historic Good Friday
agreement to administer the Northern six counties fairly.
</P>
<P>
   They got it from President Clinton, from Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, from the US mediator of last year's triumph,
former Senator George Mitchell, and from their friends in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody said it better than Senator Edward M. Kennedy:
``Enough is enough is enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was honored by the American Ireland Fund for being at
the center of every move over the past generation that made a
settlement first possible, then probable, then reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been asked to do a great deal already,'' Kennedy said.
``Now you're asked to do even more because we know you will not
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final steps to set up the governing machinery unfold this
month, the message got through to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me,'' said Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahearn
over lunch, ``we are not going to give up. We keep coming back at
it. We've squared more circles than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the first minister in the new Northern Assembly, Protestant
leader David Trimble, thinks the latest stalemate-crisis is
resolvable, and he's the one who provoked it.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has for the moment refused to convene his new Cabinet in
the North _ which by electoral apportionment must include two
members of Sinn Fein, the onetime political arm of the
now-splintered Irish Republican Army _ by the latest British
deadline of March 29.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused to do so unless Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
arranges some ``credible'' beginning to the turning in of the IRA's
substantial caches of arms and explosives. Adams has both pleaded
impotence and opposed any act of ``surrender'' so long as a
reconstituted police force in the North, trusted by all sides,
remains unformed.
</P>
<P>
   They're both right, which misses a few larger points that
Trimble alluded to over breakfast with a few columnists under the
auspices of the nascent Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, a
pro-settlement American group. The most important is that all this
is ultimately about the government power that Britain's Prime
Minister Tony Blair is preparing to delegate to the North _ power
Trimble must share.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's votes, North and South, approving the Good Friday
Agreement, the Protestant community was deeply split, and its ranks
in the new Assembly are similarly divided. Trimble claims he's
taken his Unionist community as far as he can and needs help to
maintain momentum. Within the Assembly, he says the Protestant
ranks are evenly split and any future defections to rejectionism
would be more than ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Wales and Scotland, the planned devolution of
authority to Belfast is not eagerly anticipated by the guardians of
the unjust status quo. More than half the economy in the six
counties is public sector, in dramatic contrast to the economically
vibrant Republic, which is the fastest growing country in Europe,
thanks in no small part to vigorous US business investment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the huge security aparatus, this public sector
economy in the North is heavily subsidy-dependent _ spoils and jobs
whose unjust distribution is at the root of the long Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   All that is going to change, and none of the change is going to
be easy, but the irony is that so far all the provisions of the
agreement _ within the North and to create new institutions linking
North and South _ have been implemented on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest ``crisis,'' it doesn't approach the
difficulties the peacemakers encountered and resolved in the past.
Especially in the wake of last week's horrific car-bombing murder
of a prominent Catholic lawyer, Rosemary Nelson, there was an
almost defiant optimism in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Even Trimble shares it. He said he can envision ``choreography''
in which the negotiating answers are ``no'' right down to the last
instant when they become ``yes,'' ``with no advance clue for the
usual security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better be right. The American message, which was received,
is that the economic and political stakes for Ireland's future are
simply too great to countenance renewed stalemate or crisis.

TWISTS AND TURNS CHARACTERIZE STARR'S INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the US Senate's acquittal of President Clinton on
impeachment charges, the Clinton-Starr-Lewinsky affair continues to
take more twists and turns than a mystery novel.
</P>
<P>
   The ironies occurring along the way make the title of an Al
Pacino movie _ ``And Justice For All'' _ increasingly appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was acquitted, justice was served. Now, justice may
also be in the offing for the person who is largely responsible for
the injustices heaped upon Clinton, Monica Lewinsky, and others
connected to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, might have thought
that the last person who would ever come under federal
investigation would be Kenneth Starr. But a federal appeals court
decision last week has made that once-remote possibility a reality.
The court gave the Justice Department the green light to
investigate Starr's tactics and actions in the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts argue that if the Justice Department
determines that Starr and his assistants engaged in illegal
tactics, such as preventing Lewinsky from calling her lawyer when
she was held by Starr's office, he would have to be removed as
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens _ if the man who sought to remove Clinton from
office on charges of wrongdoing finds himelf being removed from
office on charges of wrongdoing _ it would indeed be an ironic
twist of fate.
</P>
<P>
   Events have taken some unexpected turns in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans and Democrats were split along party lines
over Republican-led impeachment charges arising from Starr's
investigation, both parties came together to reject an effort to
cut off financing for most independent prosecutors, primarily
Starr, by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move against Starr would have been seen by some as pure
revenge, by others as blatant pettiness _ thus creating the
possibility that the highly unpopular inquisitor would end up being
cast as a martyr. And that is not exactly what most Democrats, as
well as most of the nation's populace, envision for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   They know the best way to get to Starr is to use the same method
he and his GOP colleagues used in their efforts to get Clinton: the
legislative and legal process.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the law which resulted in the office of the
independent counsel. Since Democrats now realize how that law can
be used as a political weapon in an opponent's hands, and
Republicans realize how this political weapon can blow up in their
faces, it is probably that a majority from both parties will allow
the law to simply expire at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Although such expiration does not prevent Starr and other
current independent counsels from continuing their ongoing
investigations, Starr would _ and here's another irony _ have to
live with the knowledge that his zealous pursuit of Clinton is the
main reason the OIC ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr decides to indict Clinton during or after his
presidency, or indict Hillary Rodham Clinton, or go after any
others connected to the Clintons, chances of his staying on the job
would be about as good as chances the independent counsel law will
be renewed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Justice Department doesn't remove Starr after its
investigation, Attorney General Janet Reno could still fire him if
he continues his pursuit. Such an action would probably enhance
Reno's favorability rating with the public, because by that time
weary voters would welcome an end to Starr's personal agenda
against Clinton. Reno would be seen as a hero, rather than Starr as
a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is that ironic twist of fate that last week put both
Starr and the Justice Department on the same side of an issue, even
if inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
   When the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation sought to block
the Justice Department from investigating Starr, Starr's office
contended in court that Landmark had no legal basis for its
lawsuit. Meanwhile, the Justice Department said the court had no
authority to intervene in its investigation. The court ruled that
both Starr and the Justice Department were right and let the
investigation go forward.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Justice Department and Starr's office concurred,
for different reasons, that they were better off without Landmark's
involvement, don't expect to see such agreement in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the Justice Department determines that Starr's tactics were
in violation of the independent counsel law, it will have no choice
but to, at the very least, remove him. Criminal charges cannot be
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   But as this legal, political, social, and personal saga
continues, it becomes increasingly clear that one of the most
sordid chapters in this nation's history will end only when Starr's
career as an independent counsel is finally over.

METEOR MICROBES CAUSE EVEN SKEPTICS TO RETHINK MARTIAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Signs of life in a meteorite from Mars? After the
excitement of the initial claims three years ago, it seemed the
true answer might never be sorted out, as scientists argued
fiercely over what secrets the Martian rocks really held.
</P>
<P>
   But now, prospects for a definitive declaration of life beyond
Earth seem better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, new reports about the tantalizing fossilized microbes
in Mars meteorites seriously challenged the questions and
counterarguments raised about the announcement in 1996 of possible
microbial life signs in a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica,
called ALH 84001.
</P>
<P>
   Possible fossils found in two new meteorites, several scientists
said last week, not only seem more likely to be real, but, because
they are much larger, will be easier to analyze and thus settle the
issue once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other reports presented here last week seem to have
decisively shattered claims that the original Mars meteorite was
subjected to temperatures so high that nothing living could have
survived inside it. The new reports show that nearly identical
formations can be produced in the laboratory at low temperatures,
and that some Earth rocks that formed at low temperatures contain
similar forms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wave of new evidence, skeptics remain. But some,
like geologist Allan Treiman of Houston's Lunar and Planetary
Institute, agree that the formations found in the new meteorite,
dubbed Nakhla, should be easier to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell at last week's Lunar and Planetary Sciences
Conference here came from the lead researcher from the original
report, in August 1996, about possible fossils in ALH 84001 (so
named because it was the first meteorite found in the Alan Hills
section of Antarctica in 1984). David McKay, a geologist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Johnson Space
Center, said he has now found what appear to be Earth-like
microbial fossils in two younger meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   While ALH 84001 formed on Mars 4.5 billion years ago _ right
after all the planets formed _ Nakhla, named for a town near Egypt
where it was found, is just 1.3 billion years old. Another, called
Shergotty, for the town in India where it was discovered, was
formed a mere 165 million years ago, McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   And while ALH 84001 lay on _ or inside _ the ice of Antarctica
for 13,000 years before being found, Shergotty landed on Earth in
1865, and Nakhla in 1911. Both were collected almost immediately,
thus greatly reducing the possibility that anything seen inside
them is just earthly contamination.
</P>
<P>
   But the major difference in these new finds is the size of the
apparent fossils. The most contentious issue of all the questions
raised about the original claims concerned the tiny size of the
fossil-like shapes _ far smaller than any reliably known form of
microbial life on Earth
</P>
<P>
   There is no such problem with the new bacteria-like shapes in
Nakhla and Shergotty. The suspected fossils in those rocks are
about one micron (a millionth of a meter) across, exactly the same
size as some well-known Earth bacteria. Simply put, they look
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Thomas-Keprta, a member of the team that made the
original 1996 report, said she has analyzed hundreds of tiny
crystals of magnetite found inside that rock and found that they
show clear signs of having formed inside bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of both the Nakhla and Shergotty meteorite
formations, the biggest question now is whether these shapes formed
inside them are nothing more than terrestrial microbes that managed
to penetrate the rocks after they landed _ as unlikely as that
seems given their swift collection and careful storage in museums.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly promising development in this polarized,
acrimonious debate, the new meteorite samples are being
simultaneously analyzed by two separate teams who are approaching
them with opposite assumptions _ one looking for proof that the
shapes really are remnants of Mars life, the other trying to prove
they are not. This ``red team-green team'' approach was initiated
by McKay himself, in an attempt to get past some of the acrimony of
the adversarial research so far.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the team that will try to disprove the Martian origin of
these formations is microbiologist Andrew Steele, who provocatively
suggested that the geologists examining the Mars rocks simply don't
know enough about Earthly microbial life to know what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated that many meteorites are contaminated with
terrestrial microorganisms that go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Steele doesn't rule out the possibility that they
might really be looking at Martian fossils and in fact sharply
criticized other researchers who stop looking once evidence of
contamination is found. ``Don't run away from contamination,'' he
urged the other scientists. Steele says he finds the shapes found
by McKay in the Nakhla meteorite to show convincing signs of life.
``They look like the real thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the nearly featureless blobs originally seen in ALH
84001, Steele said, the Nakhla shapes include appendages that look
like bacterial flagellae, the tiny hairlike filaments cells use to
move around, as well as what look like fibrils surrounding the cell
to attach it to a surface. There are alos surface textures that
resmble those of known microfossils, and a filmy material
surrounding the cell-like shapes, similar to those secreted by
living cells. All of these make a convincing case to
microbiologists who have examined it, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   But it still could be that we'll never know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists now suspect that life on Earth might actually
have originated on Mars, and was carried to Earth inside meteorites
similar to those now being studied. Under this theory, we are all,
in effect, descendants of Martians _ and there might be no chemical
sign that would allow us to distinguish Earth life from microbes
from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   McKay thinks the answers will be known within a year. Steele is
less optimistic, but agrees that it should be possible to pin down
the nature of these formations long before the first rock samples
are brought back to Earth from Mars rovers in about 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's essential that we do,'' he said. And perhaps, one
of mankind's most persistent questions _ whether we are alone and
unique _ will finally have been answered.

MEET THE FOOSA, A MISUNDERSTOOD MAMMAL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's spelled fossa and pronounced FOO-sa. And if by chance you
know anything at all about Madagascar's largest predator, it's
probably wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The fossa, according to researcher Luke Dollar, is one of the
least understood mammals on earth. But Dollar, a graduate student
at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, is hoping to change
that by studying the cat-like fossa in the wild (there are only a
few in captivity). So far, just about every piece of information he
gleans is either brand new or has challenged the scant literature
that exists. So little is known of them, in fact, that Dollar's
first fossa-related grant was to ``confirm their presence'' in
Ranamafana, a rain forest in southeastern Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   He's done that. Now he wants to address bigger conservation
questions about the fossa: how does this animal affect populations
of prey animals, such as the lemur, and how does its existence
impact the environment of this nature-rich but fragile island? He
also wants to show Malagasy farmers who both fear and loath the
fossa that this predator is vital to keeping down the numbers of
rats that eat and foul the important rice harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Often described as puma-like in appearance, the fossa is slinky,
sinewy, and low slung. Its arboreal athleticism is said to be
rivaled only by that of the clouded leopard of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   With rounded ears and a shortened muzzle, these 15-pound
predators can look cute, but their ferocity is fabled. By using
their massive canine teeth fossas grab prey animals by the face and
then eviscerate them with formidable, retractable claws. Dollar
says they are ``killing machines'' that will ``eat anything with a
heartbeat.'' And they are strong enough to bring down animals at
least their own size.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fossa is categorized as a member of the mongoose
family, its cat-like attributes could be giving us a glimpse of
what the common ancestor to the cat and mongoose families looked
and behaved like.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar's path to this predator was through studying primates. In
Boston for last year's Earthwatch Festival of Science &AMP; Culture, he
said he first went to Madagascar, a 1,000-mile-long island off the
southeastern coast of Africa, to study its most famous animal
inhabitants: lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   As a lowly assistant, or as he says ``a research slave,'' Dollar
lost one of his first study subjects _ a rare red-bellied lemur _
when it was eaten by a fossa. Although disappointed, he was
intrigued with the reverence and respect the native trackers
accorded it when they discussed the fossa. Standing in the
rainforest in 1994, looking at the frayed radio collar of the
fossa's victim, Dollar says he had an epiphany. He was about to
dedicate all his energies to studying an animal he hadn't yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the United States with a mission, Dollar's
excitement only grew at the paucity of information his library
research yielded. What were these animals like? How do they hunt?
What do they eat? Could these small creatures really bring down
cattle? Dollar wanted to answer those very basic questions that
have lingered since the fossa was first seen by Westerners in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Securing a grant with the help of leading lemur expert Patrica
Wright (who succinctly describes fossas with a dismissive: ``big
teeth, small brain''), Dollar returned to Madagascar in 1996.
Carrying $4,000 worth of tracking equipment to heave deep into the
rainforests of southeastern section of the island, Dollar trudged
through mud, braved hordes of terrestrial leeches and found his
fossa. Since many researchers have spent a decade or more working
in the forests of Madagascar without ever having glimpsed one, it
is no surprise that the first live fossa Dollar saw was caught in
one of his traps (traps baited with live chickens are the only ones
fossas visit). The first thing that struck him was the scent: an
overpowering wall of musk. ``It's almost indescribable,'' Dollar
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Since that first fossa in 1996, Dollar has spent most of the
last two years trapping, darting, examining, radio collaring, and
tracking fossas with the help of a dedicated team of Malagasy field
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no evidence these small animals kill cattle,
Dollar has witnessed their impressive strength. One fossa chomped
through the side of a wooden trap that held him, and another
escaped a steel Tomahawk trap by twisting and bending the solid
metal door.
</P>
<P>
   But more important than the adventure, Dollar is, in his words,
``shaking up'' the literature on fossas. First, through activity
sensors on the radio collars, Dollar has determined that wild
fossas are not nocturnal, as reported in all the texts, but instead
cathemeral _ active both day and night. ``They basically sleep,
eat, hunt, and walk, and not necessarily in that order,'' Dollar
says.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the first to report that fossa catch fish and that
their preferred meal are lemurs. But their exact hunting strategy
is yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Fossas are also smaller and lighter than reported. Most of those
examined had been in zoos (such as San Diego, which has one; the
Montpelier Zoo in France; or Zoo Duisburg in Germany, which has had
success in breeding them), and are likely to grow heavier in
captivity. While many reports have said that fossas may tip the
scales at nearly 30 pounds, Dollar has never captured one weighing
more than 17 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   All these little pieces are helping fill in the larger portrait
of a little-known creature. And Dollar says that understanding the
carnivores of Madagascar is ``his passion.'' Right now, Dollar can
only guess how many fossas there are in the wild, perhaps 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be leading four expeditions to Madagascar this summer.
Information on joining him in his quest can be found on the
Internet at http://www.earthwatch.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything more blissful,'' Dollar says, ``than
hiking three days to a study site with a month's worth of rice and
beans on my back, and trapping animals where no researcher has ever
been before.''

ARE METAL DETECTORS HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I re-enter the building where I work several times a day.
Each time my belongings are X-rayed and I walk through a scanner. I
am concerned about my health and wonder if the contents of my purse
are becoming increasingly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   I.T., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's a lot of high-tech stuff happening as you walk
through that metal detector, or as your belongings pass through the
X-ray detector, but manufacturers say none of it is harmful to you
or your belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Detectors work in one of two ways: they either see, or they
smell. The archway you walk through to get into buildings or to
your gate at the airport detects for metal using pulses of
electromagnetic energy, nearly 200 per second. They're transmitted
from one side and received on the other, passing easily through the
body's soft tissue. But metal creates interference. The receiver on
the other side of the archway can tell if something metallic has
changed the shape of the radio wave, sped it up, or slowed it down.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Allman, of EG&AMP;G Astrophysics, which makes about 80 percent
of the security detectors used in America, says the Federal
Aviation Administration requires the machines to operate with a
small energy output, which is reported in gauss, the term for
measuring electromagnetic fields named after the German
mathematician who invented it. Airport metal detectors operate at
no more than one gauss. The background level emanating from the
earth is about .7 gauss. Using a blow dryer exposes you to roughly
1.5 gauss, and an electric can opener exposes you to about 4 gauss,
depending upon your distance from it. Allman says security
detectors in stores generate up to 20 gauss.
</P>
<P>
   No one has determined any health problems associated with metal
detectors, Allman says. There's no interaction with pacemakers,
either.
</P>
<P>
   The other detecting technology is X-ray. That's what your purse
or luggage is exposed to. It works the same way medical X-rays do.
Because of the unique characteristics of the X-ray beam, it is
either absorbed by the object it hits, penetrates the object, or is
scattered by it. The detector translates the beam's distortions
back into the ghostlike visual image of what you have in your
purse.
</P>
<P>
   Security X-ray machines usually use two beams, which pass
through the objects they're scanning between 100 and 200 times per
second. The total radiation exposure is about 1 millirem, Allman
says. Its not even enough to fog your film.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation can damage living cells, but not the inanimate objects
in your purse or luggage. And it doesn't build up in those objects
either.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how 1 millirem compares with other radiation exposures we
face in everyday living, according to the EPA:
</P>
<P>
   200 millirem per year from the air (mostly radon).
</P>
<P>
   40 per year from radioactive elements, like potassium, in food.
</P>
<P>
   40 per medical X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   26 millirem per year from cosmic radiation from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   23 millirem per year from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   1 millirem from watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates the average American receives 360 millirem per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic sniffers looking for weapons or explosives vacuum up
an air sample and subject the collected molecules to fancy-sounding
processes like gas chromatography and ion mobility spectrometry.
They're all designed to break those molecules apart and look for
one thing; nitrogen. It's the most common telltale element that
signals the possibility of explosives. NITROglycerin and
triNITROtoluene (TNT) are some well known examples. Molecular
differences between nitrogen compounds help scientists design
sniffers that can even recognize one explosive from another.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffers are incredibly sensitive. They can detect a picogram,
one trillionth of a gram, of nitrogen. If you're carrying something
with a handle, like a briefcase or suitcase, and you fired a gun
several days ago, sniffers can detect the nitrogen from the
gunpowder on the handle of your baggage.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of X-ray detectors that can see explosives by
detecting the difference between organic and inorganic molecules
and the unique density of the organic molecules in explosives will
soon be on the market.

SOME MUST PAY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION; SOME GET OFF HOOK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATTY WEN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always seems that it's the little items on bills that drive
people crazy. William E. Shea of Arlington, Mass., has two items on
his electric bill that drive him nuts. One is a monthly charge for
energy conservation, and the other is a fee to promote renewable
energy.
</P>
<P>
   For a typical customer, the two charges add up to $2.05 a month.
For Shea's business in Somerville, Ames Safety Envelope, it's an
extra $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   What irritates Shea is not the cost of the fees or the causes
they promote, but the fact that some communities don't have to pay
them at all. All customers of private utilities like Boston Edison
and Massachusetts Electric have to pay. But the charges don't apply
to residents of the 50 communities with municipal light
departments, including Belmont, Concord, Braintree, Hudson,
Wellesley, Peabody, and Danvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I pay for their clean air?'' asked Shea. ``If clean
air is beneficial, why shouldn't everyone pay for it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question. The best answer seems to be that the 50
communities did a good lobbying job on Beacon Hill when the state's
electric deregulation law was passed. They saved their residents
close to $27 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   William H. McLaughlin, a Boston tax attorney, has filed a class
action lawsuit with the Supreme Judicial Court to block the fees.
With Shea as his lead plaintiff, McLaughlin argues that the fees
are excise taxes that are not being applied uniformly. It's like
imposing the state's gasoline excise tax on residents of Brookline
but not Newton, McLaughlin argues.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more galling to McLaughlin and Shea is that a big
chunk of the money being raised from the renewable energy charge
will go to help defray costs that some of the 50 exempt communities
would otherwise be required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   As the electric deregulation law made its way through the
Legislature, an amendment was tacked on directing that nearly $50
million of the renewable energy money be used to pay for
environmental improvements at the state's waste-to-energy
incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the state's nine incinerators will get the money hasn't
been decided yet, but some of the communities exempted from the
renewable energy fee are likely to benefit. Belmont residents, for
example, don't contribute to the renewable energy fund, but they
are likely to get some of the money to offset $35 million of
planned environmental improvements at the Northeast Solid Waste
Committee incinerator in North Andover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how someone would have the perception that we're
getting something for nothing,'' said Tim McCarthy, manager of the
Belmont Municipal Light Department and the head of the state's
Municipal Electric Association.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fairness issues raised by Shea and McLaughlin will
prevail in court is hard to tell. The case will hinge on whether
the two fees are taxes, as McLaughlin insists, and whether the
taxes need to be uniformly applied.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Nogee of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which lobbied
hard for the fees, contends that they are not new taxes. The
state's private utilities were required to invest in energy
conservation and renewable energy before deregulation, Nogee said,
and they're required to do the same thing now. The only difference
is that before deregulation the costs were factored into rates; now
they're identified separately.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that utilities are spending more now on energy
conservation and renewable energy projects and that part of the
renewable energy money is spent outside the utility's service
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison, for example, says it charged customers $29
million for energy conservation (energy audits, light bulb credits,
etc.) and renewable energy projects in 1997, the year prior to the
start of deregulation. This year, the first full year of
deregulation, the two new fees will raise a total of $54 million
from Edison customers, an 86 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the fees are determined to be taxes, one could argue
they are not unconstitutional because they will benefit everyone.
Even the incinerator improvements funded by the renewable energy
fund will make the air cleaner for everyone. And there is
historical precedent for not subjecting municipal utilities to
state regulation, since the municipal utilities are already
regulated locally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the municipal exclusion seems to be more about politics
than practical sense. Says Nogee of the Union of Concerned
Scientists: ``From an environmental and public policy perspective,
it would be better if municipal customers did contribute.''

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I recently felt 15 again.
 &HT;    Usually, when a 40-year-old woman feels like a teenager, it's a
positive thing. However, in this case, I didn't want to be reminded
of younger days.
 &HT;    Twenty-five years ago, I attended a conservative evangelical
church. After youth group one warm August night, I got ``born
again'' and accepted Jesus in my heart.
 &HT;    Jesus got there because the youth leaders scared me by teaching
that the end of the world was imminent. In the months previous, we
read one of the best-selling books of the 1970s, Hal Lindsey's huge
bestseller, ``Late Great Planet Earth.'' Lindsey believed that the
apocalypse, a period of terror immediately preceding the coming of
God's kingdom, was at hand.
 &HT;    Lindsey convinced us through an impressive array of evidence
about international politics, nuclear weapons and natural
disasters. The world is bad now, he warned, and it is about to get
much worse.
 &HT;    Luckily, God provided an escape plan for ``real'' Christians --
those saved by being born again -- called the Rapture. God would
take true believers from the earth and leave sinners to face his
wrath and Satan's unleashed power.
 &HT;    The Rapture seemed the better option -- I got scared to Jesus.
 &HT;    In 1975, nuclear annihilation, social chaos and economic
collapse threatened America. The world was shifting to what we now
know as the global, technological economy. It was a chaotic time.
 &HT;    Scary theology -- even if bad theology -- made sense.
 &HT;    Around 1980, however, scary theology made less sense. In
conservative churches, people began to talk politics instead of
apocalypse. Hal Lindsey was out; Ronald Reagan was in.
 &HT;    Instead of preparing for the last days, conservatives prepared
for primaries. Political consultants, rather than end times
prophets, made a killing.
 &HT;    As we approach 2000, the prophets are making a comeback. Why did
I feel 15? While on a recent business trip, I accidentally flipped
to Christian television. There, a well-dressed man was running
through a Power Point presentation on Y2K. Line by line, graph by
graph, the horror mounted: food shortages, urban violence, planes
falling to the ground, technological breakdown, nuclear
destruction.
 &HT;    At first, I didn't realize this was a Christian program. I sat
captivated by his smoothly delivered terror to what appeared to be
a suburban business seminar. Despite his nonchalant demeanor, this
man scared me. Should I buy a generator? A gun?
 &HT;    Get a grip, I told myself. Then I realized I had heard it all
before: as a teenager back in the 1970s. A slick evangelist was
playing off my fears. Only after an hour of calculated terror did
he finally push the button: come to Jesus (and stock up on food and
batteries) and everything will be fine.
 &HT;    In the 1970s, the Russians were a real threat, nuclear disaster
a real possibility. We were scared. The difference between then and
now is that the prophets have date for apocalyptic meltdown:
January 1, 2000.
 &HT;    Even the Rapture is popular again -- witness the 3 million
copies sold of Tim LaHaye's and Jerry Jenkins' last-days thrillers.
 &HT;    For many people, the apocalyptic worries of conservative
Christians seem fanciful -- if not fanatical. End times
speculations, however, are not just the stuff of fiction.
Millennial theology could play an important role in next year's
presidential elections -- especially for the Republican party.
 &HT;    Y2K points toward a disarming political reality: the religious
right is a theologically fickle group. In the 1970s, fear and
cultural disengagement kept them away from politics; in the 1980s,
prosperity propelled them into politics. Now, suffering from a
continued series of political losses and a gnawing apocalypticism,
they are politically unpredictable. Come New Hampshire, Christian
conservatives might go to the polls -- or they might be locked in
their basements.
 &HT;    Thus, Y2K is especially bad news for the Republicans who have
come to depend on the religious right. Their most reliable
constituency might not be raptured -- but they might not show up.
Evangelicals are moving back toward a policy of cultural
disengagement. Politicians who fail to account for this theological
promiscuity will misread the electorate and, perhaps, curry to an
absent interest group. People preparing for apocalypse don't vote.
 &HT;    And Y2K is bad news for evangelical political power. Already,
conservative Christian leaders are showing considerable ambivalence
regarding cultural engagement. Some leaders are urging religious
conservatives to get out of politics; others are reorganizing for a
major election-year push.
 &HT;    Will conservative Christians head for the polls or the hills?
 &HT;    If television evangelists are any indicator -- as they were when
evangelicals emerged as a political force in the 1980s -- I bet on
the hills. Or maybe their closets. In the world of the religious
right, Y2K means retreat. For a while, at least.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two decades ago, certain truths about children's television were
held to be self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, that boys wouldn't watch TV shows whose main characters
were girls; that shows based on toys were the most surefire ticket
to commercial success; and that a cable channel devoted to children
wasn't likely to become a major player in the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on April 1, 1979, Nickelodeon was born. You can now
find those old shibboleths in the bin marked ``Discard.''
</P>
<P>
   As the network prepares to celebrate its 20th birthday,
Nickelodeon is the top-rated cable network in the country, a
distinction it has claimed for four years in a row. Among kids aged
2 to 11, it is the top-rated network, period, besting ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox even though it reaches millions fewer homes than the
broadcast behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   From a creative standpoint, Nickelodeon has helped transform the
world of children's television by emphasizing original series
rather than knockoffs, by putting girls in leading roles, and by
sticking to a resolutely ``kidcentric'' view of the world. Called
``one of the great innovations of the cable age'' by TV historians
Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, the network also helped the young cable
industry market itself to new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Nickelodeon's creative strength has come from trying
to buck conventional wisdom,'' said Nickelodeon president Herb
Scannell, a 42-year-old graduate of Boston College. ``We challenged
a lot of myths and looked at the world from a kid's point of view.
Now a lot of people are imitating us.''
</P>
<P>
   That is doubtless prompted by the fact that Nickelodeon's
financial success proved once and for all that children's
television could be big business. ``It started to make a ton of
money, and that's something the rest of the industry pays attention
to,'' remarked Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's
Television. ``I don't know how much the industry cares about girls
getting good female role models, but they sure care about making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there a price to Nickelodeon's own success? Can the
network retain what Scannell calls its kids-first philosophy as it
branches out into movies, websites, books, a magazine, live shows,
and merchandise ranging from clothes to video games?
</P>
<P>
   Scannell says yes, but questions intensified in November when
Nickelodeon came under fire for seeming to manipulate the child
audience in order to promote ``The Rugrats Movie.'' In the week
prior to the movie's premiere, the network took ``Rugrats'' off the
air and aired in its place a teaser reading: ``The Rugrats have
gone to Hollywood!'' The stunt dismayed and angered some parents.
Author Richard Panek argued in The New York Times that it was ``a
tactic that violates parents' trust, precisely because it treats
our children with something less than respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon vice president Cyma Zarghami said the network felt
it need to ``pull out all the stops'' to make ``The Rugrats Movie''
a success, but conceded: ``We'd think hard before we'd do that
again.'' Scannell seemed to concur, calling it ``a different kind
of marketing strategy'' but adding: ``I'm not saying we would do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rugrats'' controversy is significant because for 20 years,
the relentlessly promoted notion that the network is for and about
kids has been central to Nickelodeon's strategy and identity. In
the early years, the philosophy was: No grownups allowed (except,
of course, at night when Nickelodeon airs nostalgia fare for
baby-boomers, packaged as Nick at Nite).
</P>
<P>
   Kids liked the message, liked the contemporary flavor and
playful wit of shows like ``Doug'' and ``Hey Arnold!,'' and eagerly
tuned in. Soon, when other networks wondered where many of their
young viewers had gone, the answer was: Watching Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals were watching too, often with apprehension. The
pioneering sitcom ``Clarissa Explains It All'' triggered a wave of
shows on other networks with girls as lead characters, while the
success of Nickelodeon's ``Rugrats'' got rivals scrambling to
create their own original animation rather than shows derived from
dolls or action figures. Recently, Nickelodeon's hugely popular
``Blues Clues'' put PBS on notice that it no longer had the
preschool audience to itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nickelodeon has had a tremendous impact on children's
television,'' said Amy Jordan, head of research on children's TV at
the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of
Pennsylvania. ``It created an island, this child-friendly place
where kids knew if they turned it on, there would be something for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But at first, notes Charren, ``There was nothing particularly
interesting about the programming'' on Nickelodeon. At the
beginning of this decade, that changed, as Nickelodeon introduced a
sitcom titled ``Clarissa Explains It All,'' whose popularity buried
the boys-won't-watch-girls myth once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Scannell was a development executive at Nickelodeon then, and
whenever producers asked what he was looking for, he would say ``a
show about girls.'' His answer arrived in the person of Mitchell
Kriegman, who created ``Clarissa'' for Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegman, who is now executive producer of ``Bear in the Big
Blue House'' on the Disney Channel, says Nickelodeon was pulsing
with energy when he arrived in 1991, an atmosphere he attributes to
Geraldine Laybourne, president of the network from 1980 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very pure passion that Gerry engendered in
people,'' said Kriegman. ``It was a hugely creative place, with a
lot of people who had a new look at kids. The basic philosophy was:
`Do something for kids, take a risk, and do it so you like it too.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was high-risk, innovative, take-a-chance programming,'' he
added. ``They weren't protecting a lead; they weren't protecting a
market share.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kriegman began work at Nickelodeon on ``Clarissa'' _ he was
also story editor on ``Rugrats'' and ``Doug'' _ the network was
largely identified with the raucous ``Ren and Stimpy,'' a gross-out
cartoon whose humor revolved around flatulence and vomiting. Though
Kriegman says he loved ``Ren and Stimpy,'' the programs he created
and championed helped change Nickelodeon's image. `` `Clarissa' and
`Doug' and `Rugrats' said we were more than slime,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Nickelodeon in those years, and the key to
its current success, was Laybourne's decision that the network
would ``be all for kids, and all from their point of view,''
according to Kriegman. ``That meant they weren't for toys; they
weren't for the business; they were for what kids wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``radically redefined'' the way programmers throughout the
television industry approached the child audience, according to
Kriegman. Suddenly, programs based on formulas that had succeeded
elsewhere was out; original live-action and animation, based on
what kids said they wanted to see, were in.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon gained confidence as it gained momentum, so much so
that it even rolled out that rarest of kids' programs, a news show,
called ``Nick News,'' in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years ago, Nickelodeon became home to ``Blue's
Clues,'' an educational game show for toddlers that Charren calls
``unlike anything else on television.'' Scratch the Nickelodeon
surface a bit further nowadays and you find a cockeyed gem like
``The Wild Thornberrys.'' It features a girl as its central
character, which follows in the tradition of not just ``Clarissa''
but also Nickelodeon's ``The Secret World of Alex Mack'' and ``The
Mystery Files of Shelby Woo.''
</P>
<P>
   One mark of Nickelodeon's longevity and success is the number of
alumni who now hold influential positions elsewhere in television.
Laybourne recently left a top job at ABC to form a new network
called Oxygen Media with Oprah Winfrey. Anne Sweeney, who got her
start under Laybourne at Nickelodeon, is now president of
Disney/ABC Cable Networks, which gives her control of the Disney
Channel and ABC's Saturday morning children's lineup. Some of the
writers who worked on ``Clarissa'' went on to write for such hit
shows as ``Friends'' and ``Roseanne.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nickelodeon under Scannell is doing more than fine. So far
this TV season, the network boasts 17 of the 20 most-watched kids'
shows in the country, including No. 1-rated ``Rugrats,'' which was
spun off into a movie that has grossed nearly $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three years, we've really taken the business to a
whole new level,'' said Scannell. ``We're in the movie business
now; we're in the consumer products business; we made a big move on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some Nickelodeon watchers hope the network won't be
content to just flex its muscles. Jordan, the Annenberg Center
researcher, said she hopes Nickelodeon will follow the civic path
blazed by the network's ``The Big Help'' volunteer effort and
``show they can do more than just capitalize on their audience.''
Looking at the current Nickelodeon lineup, Kriegman wonders whether
his old network has moved from ``doing something original to just
doing something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Scannell, though, argues that the ``spirit of innovation'' is
very much alive at Nickelodeon, and added: ``The future is really
bright now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds for Nickelodeon, the two decades of
its past are considered remarkable by hard-to-impress observers
like Charren.
</P>
<P>
   ``To, the most amazing thing Nickelodeon has done is it became a
commercial venture that did all the things you would not expect a
commercial venture to do,'' she said. ``Nickelodeon did so much
right _ and it worked.''

LIVING YOUR LIFE ON TV: FROM OPIE TO ED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that art imitates life. In the case of ``EDtv,'' a new
comedy directed by Ron Howard, the similarities are uncanny.
``EDtv,'' which opened Friday, examines obsession with celebrity at
a cultural moment when America's fascination with fame has reached
a nearly unimaginable zenith. The film deals with invasion of
privacy by the media, a topic turned super-hot in the last several
years. Even the cast members of ``EDtv'' have all been subjected to
intense media glare: Ellen DeGeneres, Elizabeth Hurley, Matthew
McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, and Jenna Elfman have felt, to
varying degrees, the limelight's glow deepen into an uncomfortable
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Howard himself is perhaps uniquely equipped to grapple with such
themes. He literally grew up on television, starring as Opie on
``The Andy Griffith Show'' in the 1960s and then as Richie
Cunningham on ``Happy Days'' the following decade. At 45, Howard is
as sweet, polite, and boyishly enthusiastic as the characters he
created on the small screen. ``Yeah, some of these ideas resonate
for me in a personal way,'' Howard says, smiling and settling into
the sofa in his suite at the Ritz-Carlton, where he's spending the
day doing promotional interviews for the film. ``For one thing, I
knew that if I did something really stupid it was going to get
noticed. It probably made me a little less adventuresome, which is
maybe a bad thing and maybe a good thing. I knew if I was arrested
for drunk driving it would be a huge humiliation. Part of me thinks
that if we all lived in such a way that we knew our dumb mistakes
would be noticed we might just use a tiny bit more caution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing,'' Howard goes on, ``is that weird, ongoing
relationship with people who have seen you on TV and therefore
think they know you. They can be really familiar with you, but you
don't know them back. That's odd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' chronicles four months in the life of _ you guessed it
_ Ed (McCounaghey), a charming but aimless video-store clerk who is
selected to star in a foundering cable TV network's last-ditch
effort to boost ratings: a 24-hour-a-day broadcast of one ordinary
guy's life. Cameras follow Ed's every move, from the moment he
wakes (usually with his hands down his jammies) to the moment he
falls asleep. If that sounds uncomfortably similar to last year's
``The Truman Show,'' rest assured the similarities, while striking,
are superficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``My nightmare,'' says Howard, ``is that people are going to
say, `Oh, I think I've already seen ``EDtv.' '' That would break my
heart. Because beyond that sort of one-sentence description,
they're totally different. `The Truman Show' was more like a
`Twilight Zone,' a drama about this guy who doesn't know he's on
television. This is about a guy who chooses to say `yes. I'm gonna
turn my life into an absolute media circus and I'm gonna ride that
wave. I'm gonna take that 15 minutes of fame and milk it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The film marks a reunion for Howard and screenwriters Lowell
Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (their last collaboration was on 1989's
``Parenthood''). ``EDtv'' is also a comedy with serious overtones _
dealing not only with issues of celebrity but also with family
dysfunction. Ed's family, a wonderfully motley crew played by Sally
Kirkland, Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, and Woody Harrelson, begins
to unravel and reveal its dark underside in the glare of the TV
lights. ``One of the themes that's interesting to me has to do with
the myth of the functional family,'' Howard says. ``I think I've
got a great family.'' In perfect ``Happy Days'' form, Howard's been
married to Cheryl, his high-school sweetheart, for 23 years; they
have four children. ``But are we `functional'? I don't know that
anybody is. So we decided to take that idea of the life unexamined.
It's the TV experience that forces Ed's family to take a serious
look at themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But first and foremost,'' Howard goes on, ``I think the film
deals with the question: `Is fame in and of itself a worthy role?'
Why do people go on the daytime talk shows? Why is it important in
this country, and increasingly around the world, to get noticed?
Then when we developed the love story'' _ Ed falls in love, in
front of a million viewers, with his brother's girlfriend, played
by the luminously geeky Jenna Elfman _ ``suddenly it became a
question of what we think is going to solve our problems vs. what
actually will. These things are hard enough in private. How in the
world can you develop a love relationship under those
circumstances?''
</P>
<P>
   Howard is no stranger to loss of privacy. He moved his family to
Greenwich, Conn., when the children were young to avoid the high
visibility of Hollywood life. ``I mean, you're having an argument
with your wife and somebody wants to snap pictures. You can be
disciplining your kids, you're embarrassed, you're angry, you're
upset, and somebody's coming up and wanting attention from you. I'm
always patient with it, because my parents taught me to do that.
And I think I really began to understand it clearly when my kids
began to be dazzled by celebrities that they meet and suddenly it
became important to me, as a father, to give them that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its attention to matters close to home, there's no
takeaway message in ``EDtv.'' Howard, whose movies tend to be more
about feeling good than about provoking powerful reactions, doesn't
expect you to leave the theater with any answers. Rather, he hopes
audiences will have some good laughs. ``Nobody wanted it to be a
whiny movie about how crummy it is to be well-known. It
acknowledges that there are some thorns out there, but at the end
of the day it was a pretty positive experience for Ed. I think he
came out of it OK.'' So, quite clearly, did Ron Howard.

UPDIKE PICKS THE BEST SHORT STORIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY 
John Updike, editor; Katrina Kenison, coeditor 
Houghton Mifflin. 775 pp. $28 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can thank Scheherazade for keeping the story going and Edgar
Allan Poe for hauling it into the modern age, and one can hardly
imagine American literature without it. Born from the epic tale and
Westernized by Chaucer, the short story emerged in the mid-19th
century wearing its own suit of clothes. Nobody took it for granted
then; it hadn't yet been shoved around on the playground by the
bigger, more brutish novel. For a time, before publishing itself
became a predictable story of corporate earnings, short stories
prospered both aesthetically and commercially: The best writers
wrote them, and everybody, it seemed, read them _ in the Atlantic,
or Harper's, or that old literary mansion of short fiction, The New
Yorker. Then came the triumph of visual narrative, from ``I Love
Lucy'' to MTV, and an amazing short story, read the evening before,
could no longer get you into a conversation with a stranger on a
train.
</P>
<P>
   But if the mass appeal of short stories has narrowed in the past
few decades, its critical reputation has been fiercely guarded by
practitioners and devotees alike. The Houghton Mifflin literary
series of ``The Best American Stories,'' born in 1915 and taken
over by that publishing house in 1933, has been an integral record
of the century's short fiction; its tastes and selections have been
shaped, obviously, by its editors, which in the past two decades
have included an annual guest rotation that has ensured the
wideness of its net. As the only writer to have his own work chosen
in volumes from each of the past five decades, John Updike was
invited to select the best of the best (but alas, only one story
from each writer) for this millennial anthology. Katrina Kenison,
the series editor since 1990, made the first cut, winnowing some
2,000 stories from the original editions down to more than 200;
from that number, Updike chose the final 55 (Kenison insisted on
his own inclusion). They have done a splendid job: ``The Best
American Short Stories of the Century'' is a treasure _ a
one-volume literary history of this country's immeasurable pains
and near-infinite hopes.
</P>
<P>
   America! If you love the language that belongs to its fields and
regions and city streets, you can hear it here in myriad forms: in
the careful, impeccably sad craft of Sherwood Anderson, the
haunting, mystical sheen of William Saroyan, the bleak and
onomatopoeic poetry of Annie Proulx. You can feel the cold wind off
Ellis Island, the suffocating thickness of the Deep South, the
lunacies of war, the more ordinary cruelties of a marriage gone
bad, a child sick, or an old woman alone. There is the slyly
laconic modernist verse in Hemingway, the urban, celebratory battle
cry of Bellow, the slate-gray invocations of exurban America in
Cheever and Updike. Students of literature can trace the directions
of this century's fiction from the railroads laid by Faulkner to
the creepy Gothic strains of Joyce Carol Oates to the dark hilarity
of Lorrie Moore; students of history, having here what no straight
text can give them, will find Fitzgerald's tinseltown Babylon and
Roth's Second World War and Tim O'Brien's Vietnam. Largest of all,
though, is the unalterable private journey that literature
requires. You come back stretched and challenged from these
stories, awed by the quality of this century's fiction, and sobered
by how very unpretty much of America's story really is.
</P>
<P>
   What stands up, and what doesn't? It was a question the editors
had to ask themselves, and readers will as well. (Though sometimes
toward the same end by different means: I found myself agreeing
with Updike's choices, for the most part, but arguing with his
interpretations.) Nowadays, this selection from Fitzgerald _
``Crazy Sunday'' (1933), where a guy is trying to stay away from
drink and dangerous dames _ seems arch and somewhat
cardboard-melodramatic. Donald Barthelme's spooky absurdism,
captured in ``A City of Churches'' (1973), comes off merely as an
interesting card trick. The stories that display a haunting
longevity are often subtle ones: Elizabeth Bishop's ``The Farmer's
Children'' (1949), which contains an ice-white, terrible beauty; E.
B. White's ``The Second Tree from the Corner'' (1948), which
captures the wounds of a universal yearning. William Saroyan's
``Resurrection of a Life'' (1935), steeped in elegiac excess,
nonetheless still grabbed me by the shoulders. But the 1930s seem a
bit dull, even with Faulkner, while the '40s seem compellingly
rich, though the stories feel studiedly not about the war.
Literature sometimes takes time to catch up to history, even when
it surpasses it: Philip Roth's ``Defenders of the Faith,'' a
captivatingly moral story about a Jewish sergeant and his men
during World War II, is from 1960; while Cynthia Ozick's stunning
classic about a concentration camp, ``The Shawl,'' was published in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Ozick's brief tragedy is so strong that it takes one's breath
away, but there are other classics as well: Jean Stafford's dark
journey into a woman's hospitalized consciousness in ``The Interior
Castle'' (1947); Cheever's ``The Country Husband'' (1955), with its
gorgeous last sentence; Flannery O'Connor's ``Greenleaf'' (1957),
still chilling with its take-no-prisoners grace. Isaac Bashevis
Singer's ``The Key'' (1970) beautifully displays his singular
position in his craft by capturing a frightened woman who's
forgotten how to trust. Raymond Carver, in his funny-painful detox
tale, ``Where I'm Calling From'' (1983), ushers in the contemporary
short story with grim, post-Hemingway detail; Ann Beattie
highlights the subjectivity and privacy of the modern world's
epiphanies in one of her better stories, ``Janus'' (1986). There
are also a few outright surprises here, most notably Mary Ladd
Gavell's ``The Rotifer'' (1968), a story of chance and swarming
life that begins under a microscope and ends with a question mark.
First appearing in the journal Psychiatry, it was the only story
she ever published.
</P>
<P>
   I read these stories straight through, from the Lower East Side
of 1915 (Benjamin Rosenblatt's ``Zelig'') to the desolate
destruction of the modern Western myth (Proulx's ``The Half-Skinned
Steer,'' 1998). That reading pattern isn't necessary or even
recommended, but it does display how the very feel of fiction has
changed over the years: the young, half-innocent irony of pre-World
War II America, the lushness that seems to have emerged in the '40s
and '50s, the desultory, even anarchic patterns of the stories from
the '80s and '90s that nonetheless often deliver a kind of
itinerant-narrative wisdom. No collection will have everything
everyone desires, but I particularly missed Robert Stone's
``Helping''; it also seems a travesty that the best short fiction
of the century would leave out Grace Paley, though I don't know
that her work was included in earlier volumes. Still, Updike has
the grace and sense to write about his regrets as well as his
choices, so that even a few of his omissions get a conciliatory
nod.
</P>
<P>
   Captured by a panoply of writers in this century, there is,
finally, the cumulative howl and refrain of America: a song of and
to itself, wild and mournful and unendingly alive. ``I am left with
myself unexpressed,'' says the heartbroken man in Bernard Malamud's
``The German Refugee'' (1964). But his frustrated sorrows, however
silent, are etched into stone by the fact of this story: by all the
voices in this extraordinary volume, and by the writers who were
able to hear their tones.

LAURYN HILL TAKES HIP-HOP TO A NEW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``My name is Lauryn Hill. My name was always Lauryn
Hill. My name will always be Lauryn Hill.'' With that simple
declaration of self, the artist who is arguably the most important
figure in popular music crystallized the essence of her one-woman
hip-hop revolution. She spoke the words quietly, between songs at
the Fox Theatre here last weekend, in the clear, unaffected voice
of one who makes no claim to the swaggering style and braggadocio
image that have characterized her genre for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has rewritten the crusty old hip-hop script _ littered with
aging gangsta rappers, paint-by-number crews, and rhyming fashion
slaves _ in a vibrant new language. It's a language of personal
revelation and religious dedication, one that's earthy and soulful,
spiritual and womanly. On stage, Hill tucks her turntables between
a drum set and an old wood organ. She'll bring 16 musicians with
her to the Wang Center on March 31 and April 1; only one of them is
a DJ. It's her respectful return to the roots of African-American
music and African-American experience _ and the maverick
individuality required to build that bridge _ that make Lauryn
Hill, at the age of 23, such a towering force in music.
</P>
<P>
   Hill wasn't merely paying lip service when she appeared at the
Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Awards in Los Angeles last
month to introduce Patti LaBelle and the Bluebells, telling them,
``You are my teachers.'' Her solo debut album, ``The Miseducation
of Lauryn Hill'' (which the artist wrote and produced and which won
five Grammys last month), is a visionary fusion of contemporary
hip-hop and old-school R &AMP; B. The sort of stripped, organic soul
that fueled Stevie Wonder's early work infuses ``Miseducation,'' as
does the smooth grace distilled by Marvin Gaye. Hill's voice is
thick with reggae's pungent lilt, and its social conscience. She
mines melodies with a feel as innate as Aretha's; she raps beats _
in a deep, husky flow of spoken rhythm _ like a born MC.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who grew up in suburban New Jersey and began her career as
L-Boogie in the Fugees, is a gifted rapper who eschews nearly every
hip-hop convention. Like the influential artists she's descended
from, Hill is beholden only to her ear and her heart. To a genre
weaned on guns and drugs, big cars and closed minds, she brings a
sustaining faith, political commitment, and sensuality. She's
expanded the parameters of hip-hop with a vision that is true to
modern urban experience but that skewers _ with the simple power of
her humanity _ the modern urban mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Zion'' rises like a phoenix from the ashes of murdered rap
stars Tupak Shakur and Biggie Smalls: a chanting, simmering hymn to
motherhood, to the redemptive power of giving life. That Hill chose
to embellish such a transcendent (and, for hip-hop, radically
uplifting) theme with the swirling acoustic work of rock guitarist
Carlos Santana is one more testament to her singular vision.
</P>
<P>
   Hill (who declined to be interviewed for this story) is at the
vanguard of hip-hop's new positivity. Choosing to begin her concert
with a scratchy recording, played in the darkened theater, of Bob
Marley singing the luminous ``Redemption Song'' is not merely a
deferential gesture to the reggae icon. (Hill's fiance and the
father of her two young children, by the way, is Rohan, Marley's
son.) Blasting Bob Marley's folk anthem to freedom is an
unqualified statement of purpose: Hill is here to take her place in
a chain of passionate musician-philosophers for whom past and
present _ and music and message _ are inextricably linked . &QL; 
 &QL; 
An overarching faith &QL; 
 &QL;

   From the album title, which echoes Carter G. Woodson's ``The
Miseducation of the Negro,'' to her unfailing belief in God as the
source of all things sacred and profane, Hill reunites two segments
of the culture that have diverged over time. Where hip-hop is the
mouthpiece of the marginalized urban youth and religious faith is
the cornerstone of the old guard, Hill fuses the two. ``Be seen
through / Let God redeem you / Keep your deen true / Watch out what
you cling to / You can get the green too / Observe how a queen do /
And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm / 'Cause wit all this on I
got the world in palm,'' Hill raps in ``Final Hour.'' And on ``I
Used to Love Him,'' a duet with another groundbreaking musician,
Mary J. Blige, Hill proclaims, ``Father you saved me and showed me
that life / Was much more than being some foolish man's wife /
Showed me that love was respect and devotion / Greater than planets
deeper than oceans.''
</P>
<P>
   By daring to invoke her own spiritual transformation as the
bedrock of a hip-hop record, Hill has pushed the edge of the
envelope at a critical time in the evolution of urban music.
``Lauryn has redefined the notion of what it is to make a hip-hop
record,'' says Selwin Seysu Hinds, editor in chief of The Source,
hip-hop's preeminent publication. ``It's already had a huge impact
on the genre. Hip-hop has always responded well to people who show
that the parameters aren't fixed. When gangsta rap was in, that was
it. During Puffy's rule, that was it. What sets Lauryn apart is her
spirituality, her soulfulness. She is the first real MC rapper to
make a soul record. As hip-hop goes into the 21st century, she puts
the exclamation point on creative diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is not unaware of her position, and in concert she made
good-natured reference to it by staging a series of spirited duels
with her DJ. It was old school vs. new school, as Hill and her band
broke into the Jackson 5's ``I Want You Back,'' only to be rebutted
by turntablist Leon Higgins's heavy beats. She and the band, which
included a horn section and a trio of female vocalists, alternated
soul classics (Stevie Wonder's ``Sir Duke'' and Gladys Knight's
``Midnight Train to Georgia'') with Higgins's hip-hop anthems,
until Hill eventually launched into a buoyant cover of rapper
Jay-Z's ``Hard-Knock Life,'' calling out, ``You think the band
can't play hip-hop? Let's put 'em all together like family.''

PIANIST HAMELIN VENTURES FROM STUDIO TO STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc-Andre Hamelin is a famous pianist in Europe, particularly
in Great Britain. His work is still not known to the general
musical public in America, however, though he has lived in
Philadelphia for 18 years and won the Carnegie Hall International
American Competition in 1985. His recordings have become a pillar
of the distinguished Hyperion label, and his 1994 disc of works by
the eccentric French romantic composer Charles-Valentin Alkan has
been praised in Fanfare Magazine as ``one of the best releases of
anything to have been made, a classic of the recording era.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin, now 37, has returned to Boston for the first time since
a 1986 recital and a 1988 appearance with the Harvard Chamber
Orchestra (under the direction of Leon Kirchner) to play a program
in Sanders Theatre benefiting Harvard radio, WHRB-FM (95.3). His
repertory is characteristically enterprising, including standard
works by Bach (the Fifth French Suite) and Brahms (the Intermezzi,
Op. 117) alongside such unusual works as the ``Sonata romantica''
by Rachmaninoff's contemporary Nikolai Medtner; the entertaining,
supervirtuoso variations by Alkan, ``Le Festin d'Esope''; and
Liszt's ``Reminiscences'' of Bellini's opera ``Norma.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from his home in Philadelphia, the
deep-voiced Hamelin said he was not a prodigy. ``My beginnings were
very modest. I was born in Montreal, and it was discovered very
early that I had perfect pitch, and I think that makes a lot of
difference _ it makes it possible to assimilate music faster;
reading music is easier and more efficient; and intramusical
hearing is facilitated. Later, this ability made it possible to
compose and practice away from the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin has needed this gift. Every young pianist needs to be
prepared to jump in when a famous artist cancels. Hamelin is ready,
with 40 concertos in his repertory. ``The nature of our craft is
that we have to prepared for emergencies. My greatest
accomplishment along those lines so far was when I stepped in for
Peter Serkin in Beethoven's First Concerto on 3 1/2 hours' notice.
I was in Montreal, and ran out to buy a score because I didn't have
one with me. The orchestra sent a cab, and during the ride, which
took an hour and a quarter on the slippery ice, I practiced
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin began his studies with a private teacher, and when it
became clear he was talented, his parents enrolled him in what he
calls ``the best school in Montreal,'' the Vincent D'Indy School.
``There my progress was quite rapid. Every year we had
competitions. When I was 9, I played the Kabalevsky Variations;
when I was 12, I was ready for Debussy's `Jardins sous la pluie,'
and the next year brought a huge jump to Chopin's `Andante spianato
and Grand Polonaise.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin had been exposed to the standard literature from early
childhood. ``My father is a pharmacist and also a very good amateur
pianist. He had a good collection of music and I was always looking
through it. Instinctively I wanted to do what my father did, and I
also wanted to compose, so I wrote things that made no sense _
unfortunately, we didn't keep any of this stuff, because I'd be
curious to see it now. When I got to be a teenager, the urge to
compose came again. I still try to compose when I can, although
there is less and less time to do it. I've recorded some of my own
transcriptions _ Rossini's `La Danza,' for example.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin's interest in exploring unfamiliar repertory dates back
to his 13th year. ``I was looking around in a record store and I
found John Kirkpatrick's recording of Ives's `Concord' Sonata. I
was intrigued because in October 1974, Clavier magazine had put out
a special Ives centennial issue. I wanted to hear this music, and
now the recording was in my hands. It was the first record I ever
bought for myself, and I listened to it at least once a day for a
whole summer; a whole new world was opening up. Three months later
I bought the score and started fiddling with it, although I didn't
play it in public until 1985. I still play it today.''
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Hamelin came to the United States to accept a full
scholarship at Temple University, in Philadelphia. ``This was the
best thing I had ever done. I could have stayed in Canada, but I
probably would have had only a one-dimensional education there. I
would even urge European musicians to come to the States to study
music.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of Hamelin's American teachers was Russell Sherman,
with whom he worked privately between 1986 and 1988. ``This was the
last period when I was taking piano lessons. I was attracted to
Russell Sherman because of his reputation, and when I came to him,
I was not disappointed. He really teaches you to think, and
encourages you to create wonderful images _ he encourages the
imagination. I remember once I was playing for him the Beethoven
Sonata, Op. 10, No. 2, and in the trio of the second movement, I
wasn't catching the mood. So he said to me in his soft-spoken,
delicate way of speaking, `Think of these huge Roman temples, these
vast columns _ and behind one of them Julius Caesar is being
assassinated.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 Carnegie Hall International American Music Competition
was a prestigious prize that brought Hamelin a number of concerts,
including his Boston debut, and a first recording (etudes by
William Bolcom and the ``Battle Piece'' by Stefan Wolpe, for New
World Records; later he recorded Ives's ``Concord'' Sonata for the
same label).
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin's reputation has spread through his recordings. For a
small company named Altarus, he recorded the First Sonata of
reclusive and eccentric composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorbabji. Then,
for Music &AMP; Arts, Hamelin recorded an Alkan album, a Liszt album,
and an album of cabaret music with his wife, singer Jody Applebaum.
Their partnership has been compared with the celebrated work of
Joan Morris and Bolcom, but Hamelin says there is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They concentrate on American popular music of earlier periods,
and we perform an international repertory of French, German,
British, and American cabaret songs. We have another CD on the
Helicon label of work by German cabaret composer Friedrich
Hollander, who later fled from Germany and became a film composer.
The Nazis destroyed every trace of his work they could find, so 14
out of the 18 tracks are first recordings. We think the music is
just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In England and to some extent elsewhere in Europe, Hamelin is
now a top-ranking pianist, thanks mostly to the uniformly
enthusiastic critical reception for 15 recordings that have
appeared on Hyperion. He has an active European management, but the
American management scene is in such disarray, and operates under
such distorted priorities, that Hamelin has to look after his own
arrangements in this country. Hyperion has succeeded in the
international marketplace because it knows its priorities,
maintaining an old-fashioned commitment to quality over all things;
the company records music it wants to hear, performed by musicians
it believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales manager for Hyperion is a fellow named Mike Spring,
who is the resident piano fan and specialist,'' Hamelin explains.
``Hyperion's series of romantic piano concertos, which is now in
its 18th or 19th installment, is his brainchild. He was looking for
other pianists to record some of these concertos, and he came to a
recital I was giving with a cellist in a London suburb. It took us
a while to agree over repertory, but we started with concertos by
Alkan and Henselt, and later moved on to concertos by Marx and
Korngold. I have a wish list and Mike has a wish list, and when our
wish lists coalesce, a record is usually born.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the concertos, Hamelin has also recorded many
solo discs for Hyperion, including sets of Reger Variations, the
complete Scriabin Sonatas, a Liszt record, a Grainger record, and
four discs of the Medtner Sonatas. ``My discovery of Medtner was
gradual and eye-opening. It rarely makes its best impression at
first. It doesn't come at you, like Rachmaninoff's music does; you
need to go to it, and then you begin to realize just how amazing it
is. The intensity of interest grows with each hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamelin is quick to emphasize that he is still ``in touch'' with
the standard literature and that he is looking forward to recording
an all-Schumann album. He is politically incorrect enough to object
to Beethoven on the early piano. ``I have never liked the unclear
attack and lingering resonances of the fortepiano. I have a problem
with that _ not with playing Bach on the piano! What I do think is
a problem is that the programs for piano recitals are becoming a
bit stale. I don't understand why every young pianist feels he has
to play Mussorgsky's `Pictures at an Exhibition.' Programs today
need some spicing up, and so that's what I do.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 ATLANTA: ... like family.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hill is joined in the charge to broaden rap's musical and
cranial focus by up-and-coming groups like the Roots, Black Eyed
Peas, Everlast, and OutKast, an Atlanta duo that won the opening
slot on Hill's current tour. ``Lauryn has let people know that you
can do more than one thing,'' says OutKast's Dre Benjamin, winding
down backstage after his set. ``You don't just have to rhyme all
day long. It's music. And the words are deep, know that.''
OutKast's stage was set with an enormous painting of a weeping,
pregnant woman. ``That's Mama Earth,'' explains Benjamin, a
teetotaling vegan who is the philosophical descendant of musical
explorers like Sun-Ra and George Clinton. ``She's crying 'cause
she's dying,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin is one of the new breed of rap stars unafraid to break
out of the mold and reveal their tender sides. His songs have
titles like ``Hold On, Be Strong'' and ``Rosa Parks.'' Like Hill,
Benjamin is a new parent; 16-month-old Seven Benjamin's mother is R
&AMP; B singer Erykah Badu. ``You can't teach kids one side. You got to
let them know there's two sides to things. . . . The audience is
like kids. Let 'em know what's going on the street, but at the same
time bring a positive outlook. And put it to something funky where
people can feel it. Lauryn is showing the world that you can get
back to that now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the artist who comes along to upend the rules is a woman,
however, one has to wonder how comfortably she manages to fit into
_ let alone transform _ hip-hop's firmly entrenched boy's club.
``Yes, hip-hop is, at its core, a celebration of black
masculinity,'' says Hinds. ``And it's an ongoing challenge for
women to figure out how to play in that club. The marvelous thing
about Lauryn is that she's sexy and beautiful, but everyone I know
has this reverence for her. Guys talk about her in a sense that's
not as a lover but as a friend and a sister. The hard-core rappers
accept her. There's a deep, abiding love for Lauryn and what she
represents. She's almost holy.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Propelling hip-hop &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop has been slowly expanding its reach over the past
decade. In 1998 rap acts sold more than 81 million albums, the best
year in the history of the music. But Hill has given it a giant
push into the mainstream, breaking beyond hip-hop's core audience
to attract older music fans and women, who made up a majority of
the audience at the Fox Theatre show. Says rap-soul star D'Angelo,
who duets with Hill on ``Nothing Even Matters'': ``She did a lot
for black women and black folks in general. A lot of people have
been scared to do the stuff she's doing, because they felt record
companies didn't believe it would sell. But she's been an exception
to that. Her music is very marketable and is still dope.''
</P>
<P>
   For a sound born on the streets of the South Bronx, however,
acceptance by the popular establishment is a controversial
proposition. ``I think it's always a mixed blessing,'' says Hinds.
``The success of hip-hop as a market is attributable to the
maturing of the genre. It has the capacity to cross color lines.
But it will always retain the fringe element. As I said, it's a
celebration of black masculinity. America will never be comfortable
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Hill, hip-hop is now a celebration of female dignity
as well, a remarkably gratifying turn of events given the misogyny
and abuse glorified by the rap rank and file. Prominent female
rappers like L'il Kim and Foxy Brown do little to improve the
image, wielding sex and blatant materialism as their stock in
trade. For Hill, however, dignity isn't gender-specific, but rather
humanity's fundamental tool of empowerment. She counsels women
about self-respect (``When you give it up so easy, you ain't even
fooling him . . . showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's
a trend / Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem'') and men
about responsibility (``The sneaky silent men the punk domestic
violence men / The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys
and be men'') on the hit single ``Doo Wop (That Thing).'' ``How you
gon' win,'' Hill asks over and over again, ``when you ain't right
within?''
</P>
<P>
   It's the striving toward what's right that fuels Hill's fire.
Social justice and emotional truth, the black experience and
religious faith, earthly pleasures and modern dilemmas, merge into
an extraordinary narrative, unmistakably credible and undeniably
potent. The stories are told in word and song, with spoken
incantation and transcendent melody weaving in and among one
another much as they do at a Sunday worship. Like Stevie Wonder,
Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and Bob Marley before her, Lauryn Hill
grounds the story of her life in a much older story, finding
meaning in a spiritual and musical legacy that can be summed up in
one word: soul. &QL;

RECORD INDUSTRY IS SEARCHING FOR CLONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are there any more Lauryn Hills out there? You can be sure that
record industry scouts are trying hard to find them, ever since
Hill's eye-popping five Grammy wins last month. It's symptomatic of
the industry to chase after anyone who might duplicate such a
windfall success.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: When Madonna hit it big, the industry had a feeding
frenzy for Madonna clones. When skinny-tied ``power pop'' bands
were the rage in the '80s, record labels went crazy signing their
own versions. And when Alanis Morissette made ``angry young
female'' rock popular in the '90s, more angry women turned up.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, by any standard, is a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many Lauryn Hills,'' says Tommy Mottola, chairman
of Sony Records, Hill's label. ``But when it comes along and the
talent is there, people will search it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Hill is so special because she's the example of hip-hop
evolving to the next step,'' adds Mottola. ``She's taken it from
rap music, which is a street genre, to a whole other form, yet
she's kept her respect and credibility. In some ways, Mary J. Blige
was the prototype for Lauryn's success _ a woman who was an urban
act and then crossed over. But Lauryn took it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   However, don't exaggerate all those Grammy wins, says Roy Lott,
president of Capitol Records. ``I always think people make too much
of these things,'' he says. ``This Grammy success had to do with
Lauryn Hill, rather than with musical movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lauryn's success reminds everybody of the approach
I've always believe in _ that there is room for all musical
directions,'' says Lott. ``If you oversimplify it as one style,
then you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a legitimacy to the accusation that record labels are
going to be looking for cookie cutter types in the future,'' Lott
adds. ``I'm sure there are a lot of attorneys pitching the next
Lauryn Hill, the same way they did with Alanis clones. But Lauryn's
success had a lot to do with her, period. She's a great artist.
She's a great rapper and a great singer. She writes meaningful
lyrics and is darned good-looking, too. And she already had a base
by working with the Fugees and on Aretha Franklin's single
(``Rose'') last year. There were a lot of stars lined up for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do hope is that her success will cause more young women
aged 14 and 15 to be inspired by music and to become future Lauryn
Hills,'' says Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her time at the Grammys, just as it was Bonnie Raitt's
time a few years ago,'' says David Leach, a general manager of the
new Universal Music Group (formerly PolyGram), which includes the
Def Jam rap catalog. ``Everybody is going to try to copycat her a
little bit. We all want to be ahead of the curve and people will
think this is the way to do it, but there's only one Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lauryn is a brilliant artist,'' says singer and fellow Grammy
winner Lenny Kravitz. ``She has such a strong female energy and any
time that can get out there as an influence, it can only help other
women, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely other artists like TLC, who have blended
pop and hip-hop,'' says John Sykes, president of cable channel VH1.
``But Lauryn has done it the best and has brought hip-hop to the
next generation. What she has done is a milestone, much like what
Stevie Wonder did in the '70s with `Songs in the Key of Life.' Our
viewers grew up on Motown and R&AMP;B, so many of them love her. She's
bringing it all into the next generation.''

IRISH LEADERS CARRY HOME THE MESSAGE ON PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Seamus Mallon was remarking the other day on the
presence here of nearly 200 very big shots from Ireland _ North and
Republic _ for what is, after all, Ireland's own great day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we all come here,'' said the new deputy first
minister of the North's new elected Assembly on his first such
visit, ``is a sign of our political immaturity.''
</P>
<P>
   A good point, if a bit harsh in light of all that's been done in
the '90s to give peace and power-sharing a chance. But Mallon was
correct: When Washington is not crawling with Irish government and
political leaders during St. Patrick's week is when a functioning
new society in the North will be reality.
</P>
<P>
   They don't come for the fun. In Bill Clinton's time, the week
has been the occasion for very hard work; this year it started on
the Sunday before and continued without pause right through the
huge White House bash and equally stunning Irish Embassy
after-party on the day itself.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mallon (also deputy to John Hume in Northern
Ireland's largest Catholic party) and his fellow leaders were given
an unambiguous message from their trusted American friends and
supporters _ absolute intolerance of any remaining roadblocks or
stalemates in implementing last year's historic Good Friday
agreement to administer the Northern six counties fairly.
</P>
<P>
   They got it from President Clinton, from Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, from the US mediator of last year's triumph,
former Senator George Mitchell, and from their friends in American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody said it better than Senator Edward M. Kennedy:
``Enough is enough is enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was honored by the American Ireland Fund for being at
the center of every move over the past generation that made a
settlement first possible, then probable, then reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been asked to do a great deal already,'' Kennedy said.
``Now you're asked to do even more because we know you will not
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final steps to set up the governing machinery unfold this
month, the message got through to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me,'' said Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahearn
over lunch, ``we are not going to give up. We keep coming back at
it. We've squared more circles than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the first minister in the new Northern Assembly, Protestant
leader David Trimble, thinks the latest stalemate-crisis is
resolvable, and he's the one who provoked it.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has for the moment refused to convene his new Cabinet in
the North _ which by electoral apportionment must include two
members of Sinn Fein, the onetime political arm of the
now-splintered Irish Republican Army _ by the latest British
deadline of March 29.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused to do so unless Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
arranges some ``credible'' beginning to the turning in of the IRA's
substantial caches of arms and explosives. Adams has both pleaded
impotence and opposed any act of ``surrender'' so long as a
reconstituted police force in the North, trusted by all sides,
remains unformed.
</P>
<P>
   They're both right, which misses a few larger points that
Trimble alluded to over breakfast with a few columnists under the
auspices of the nascent Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, a
pro-settlement American group. The most important is that all this
is ultimately about the government power that Britain's Prime
Minister Tony Blair is preparing to delegate to the North _ power
Trimble must share.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's votes, North and South, approving the Good Friday
Agreement, the Protestant community was deeply split, and its ranks
in the new Assembly are similarly divided. Trimble claims he's
taken his Unionist community as far as he can and needs help to
maintain momentum. Within the Assembly, he says the Protestant
ranks are evenly split and any future defections to rejectionism
would be more than ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Wales and Scotland, the planned devolution of
authority to Belfast is not eagerly anticipated by the guardians of
the unjust status quo. More than half the economy in the six
counties is public sector, in dramatic contrast to the economically
vibrant Republic, which is the fastest growing country in Europe,
thanks in no small part to vigorous US business investment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the huge security aparatus, this public sector
economy in the North is heavily subsidy-dependent _ spoils and jobs
whose unjust distribution is at the root of the long Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   All that is going to change, and none of the change is going to
be easy, but the irony is that so far all the provisions of the
agreement _ within the North and to create new institutions linking
North and South _ have been implemented on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest ``crisis,'' it doesn't approach the
difficulties the peacemakers encountered and resolved in the past.
Especially in the wake of last week's horrific car-bombing murder
of a prominent Catholic lawyer, Rosemary Nelson, there was an
almost defiant optimism in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Even Trimble shares it. He said he can envision ``choreography''
in which the negotiating answers are ``no'' right down to the last
instant when they become ``yes,'' ``with no advance clue for the
usual security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better be right. The American message, which was received,
is that the economic and political stakes for Ireland's future are
simply too great to countenance renewed stalemate or crisis.

SOME MUST PAY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION; SOME GET OFF HOOK
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATTY WEN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always seems that it's the little items on bills that drive
people crazy. William E. Shea of Arlington, Mass., has two items on
his electric bill that drive him nuts. One is a monthly charge for
energy conservation, and the other is a fee to promote renewable
energy.
</P>
<P>
   For a typical customer, the two charges add up to $2.05 a month.
For Shea's business in Somerville, Ames Safety Envelope, it's an
extra $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   What irritates Shea is not the cost of the fees or the causes
they promote, but the fact that some communities don't have to pay
them at all. All customers of private utilities like Boston Edison
and Massachusetts Electric have to pay. But the charges don't apply
to residents of the 50 communities with municipal light
departments, including Belmont, Concord, Braintree, Hudson,
Wellesley, Peabody, and Danvers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I pay for their clean air?'' asked Shea. ``If clean
air is beneficial, why shouldn't everyone pay for it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair question. The best answer seems to be that the 50
communities did a good lobbying job on Beacon Hill when the state's
electric deregulation law was passed. They saved their residents
close to $27 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   William H. McLaughlin, a Boston tax attorney, has filed a class
action lawsuit with the Supreme Judicial Court to block the fees.
With Shea as his lead plaintiff, McLaughlin argues that the fees
are excise taxes that are not being applied uniformly. It's like
imposing the state's gasoline excise tax on residents of Brookline
but not Newton, McLaughlin argues.
</P>
<P>
   What is even more galling to McLaughlin and Shea is that a big
chunk of the money being raised from the renewable energy charge
will go to help defray costs that some of the 50 exempt communities
would otherwise be required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   As the electric deregulation law made its way through the
Legislature, an amendment was tacked on directing that nearly $50
million of the renewable energy money be used to pay for
environmental improvements at the state's waste-to-energy
incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the state's nine incinerators will get the money hasn't
been decided yet, but some of the communities exempted from the
renewable energy fee are likely to benefit. Belmont residents, for
example, don't contribute to the renewable energy fund, but they
are likely to get some of the money to offset $35 million of
planned environmental improvements at the Northeast Solid Waste
Committee incinerator in North Andover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see how someone would have the perception that we're
getting something for nothing,'' said Tim McCarthy, manager of the
Belmont Municipal Light Department and the head of the state's
Municipal Electric Association.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fairness issues raised by Shea and McLaughlin will
prevail in court is hard to tell. The case will hinge on whether
the two fees are taxes, as McLaughlin insists, and whether the
taxes need to be uniformly applied.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Nogee of the Union of Concerned Scientists, which lobbied
hard for the fees, contends that they are not new taxes. The
state's private utilities were required to invest in energy
conservation and renewable energy before deregulation, Nogee said,
and they're required to do the same thing now. The only difference
is that before deregulation the costs were factored into rates; now
they're identified separately.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears that utilities are spending more now on energy
conservation and renewable energy projects and that part of the
renewable energy money is spent outside the utility's service
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison, for example, says it charged customers $29
million for energy conservation (energy audits, light bulb credits,
etc.) and renewable energy projects in 1997, the year prior to the
start of deregulation. This year, the first full year of
deregulation, the two new fees will raise a total of $54 million
from Edison customers, an 86 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the fees are determined to be taxes, one could argue
they are not unconstitutional because they will benefit everyone.
Even the incinerator improvements funded by the renewable energy
fund will make the air cleaner for everyone. And there is
historical precedent for not subjecting municipal utilities to
state regulation, since the municipal utilities are already
regulated locally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the municipal exclusion seems to be more about politics
than practical sense. Says Nogee of the Union of Concerned
Scientists: ``From an environmental and public policy perspective,
it would be better if municipal customers did contribute.''

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEW IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Death: A Love Story'' Despite some uncomfortable lapses
into New Age-speak and greeting-card imagery, Michelle Le Brun's
documentary is a noble, heartfelt examination of her husband, Mel
Howard, who was chairman of Boston University's film school, and of
the last months of his life as he battled cancer (Unrated) (Renee
Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Forces of Nature'' There's not much fizz in this
neo-screwball comedy, but Ben Affleck (as the buttoned-down type on
the way to his wedding) and Sandra Bullock (not quite free enough
as the free spirit who upends him) are nice to have around. While
not entirely successful, the film at least avoids predictability.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (FL) &UR; !!! &LR;  ``The Harmonists'' Handsomely crafted German showbiz
biopic. A snappy musical group makes it big in between-the-wars
Berlin, then finds itself in trouble in the Hitler years because
three of its six members are Jewish. Sleek period finish is a big
plus. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !! &LR;  1/2 ``Pizzicata'' A sensitive debut feature from
documentary-maker Edouardo Winspeare. It's admirably textured and
acted, even if its subject matter seems overfamiliar: Two men (one
a downed US fighter pilot) clash over a woman in a feudal rural
Italian landscape at the tail end of World War II. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ! &LR;  ``Ravenous'' A clumsy attempt to reinvent the story of the
Donner Pass cannibalism in terms of 19th-century American
land-grabbing and Manifest Destiny. It traps some good actors _ Guy
Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeffrey Jones _ in a silly gorefest that
reminds us how much better Hannibal Lecter did this sort of thing.
(R)
</P>
<P>
   (FR)  &UR; !!! &LR;  ``True Crime'' Clint Eastwood is slyly funny as a
broken-down newspaper reporter juggling reprobate ways and
professional savvy as he goes to bat for a death-row inmate he's
convinced is innocent. Because there's more emphasis on
characterization and atmosphere than on formulas, and because this
film is so far above the genre average, you forgive the climactic
car chase. (R)

THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN SECURITY AND RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am retired at 66 with the following investments: $48,000 in
BankBoston stock, $14,250 in Citicorp stock, $10,000 in Series E
Savings Bonds, $79,400 in bank IRAs, $8,400 in bank savings
accounts, $23,000 in bank CDs, $36,300 in AARP GNMA and U.S.
Treasury fund, $15,000 in AARP High-Quality Short-Term Bond fund,
and $5,000 in AARP U.S. Stock Index fund. My wife, who is 52 and
will continue working until she is 60, has a $240,000 401(k)
account to which she adds $400 a month. I get Social Security of
$1,207 a month. My wife thinks my investing is too conservative. We
are looking for security, but perhaps higher returns. Suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   J.J., Los Angeles &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One of you is right, but you left out the most critical piece
of information: how your wife has invested her 401(k) account,
which represents a whisker more than half the combined portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Since you write that she thinks you are investing too
conservatively, let's consider first how the total portfolio will
look if her 401(k) account is dominated by stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   If all of her investments are in stocks or stock funds, that
puts the combined portfolio at 64.1 percent equities _ a
traditional if slightly conservative position for a fellow your
age.
</P>
<P>
   If her 401(k) portfolio is invested in higher-risk stocks,
eliminate the phrase ``if slightly conservative'' in the previous
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But if her 401(k) is about evenly divided between stocks and
bonds, the overall portfolio is very very conservative and your
wife is right _ you want more stocks, and probably a lot more
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the very minimum, I'd suggest you hold at least 40 percent
stocks, and 70 percent at the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing about the 401(k) investments, I have no idea what
your portfolio returns may be. But there certainly are ways to
achieve a slightly better yield on the remainder of the portfolio
without dramatically increasing risk.
</P>
<P>
   One series of moves would be to put the money now in AARP
High-Quality Short-Term Bond fund, yielding 5.6 percent, into AARP
GNMA and U.S. Treasury fund, where the yield is 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A similar move might involve the $8,400 earning 4.7 percent in a
savings account _ unless you consider that a highly liquid cash
pool to deal with emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   What are the prospects for growth within the non-401(k)
portfolio during the next eight years until your wife retires?
</P>
<P>
   If we projected 5 percent growth for the portfolio you have
detailed, it would grow to $353,628 over eight years with no
additional contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mysterious 401(k), with your wife's $400 monthly
contributions after eight years the accumulation would amount to
$431,329, $497,138, or $571,852, provided total returns were 6
percent, 8 percent, or 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were you I wouldn't take that final figure very
seriously. Although 10 percent is a reasonable assumption for
long-term stock fund growth, it's probably high for an eight-year
accumulation, and especially for the accumulation that's likely to
be delivered by our current worn-out stock market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The investment mixes you discuss in your column seldom
include real estate. Why is that? While we don't want the
responsibilities of direct ownership of real estate, we think it's
a good thing to include in our long-term investment portfolio, and
we have liked the income stream provided by our existing REIT
investment. The overall REIT market has fared poorly during the
last year or so, and we're thinking now may be a good time to make
additional investments in this sector. We're in our mid-50s, expect
to retire in two or three years, and are thinking about raising our
allocation to real estate from 5 percent to 10 percent by investing
in the Vanguard REIT Index fund. We would appreciate your thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   D.S., Eugene, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I rarely discuss REIT funds because I consider them
higher-risk investments that are inappropriate for many investors.
If your retirement portfolio is sufficiently fat that you can
afford the substantial risks inherent in buying REIT funds, more
power to you. It certainly does seem as if they may have hit a low,
and a recovery could bring very generous returns.
</P>
<P>
   In point of fact, I have a position in one of the riskier REIT
funds _ CGM Realty _ which has delivered a spine-jolting 20.65
percent loss in the past 52 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I hold the shares in an IRA, so I remained calm
when the fund's year-end distributions exceeded 15 percent _ that
in a year during which the fund lost 21.15 percent. So let's begin
with that: Unless you can live with some unpleasant tax surprises,
don't hold a REIT mutual fund in a taxable account.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I'm hanging in there with CGM Realty. But despite the
fact that the chart has flattened out since its September-October
lows, I'm not doubling up as you propose to do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have a higher appetite for risk than I do, or maybe
you're counting on the lower-risk profile provided by the Vanguard
Specialized Real Estate Index fund when compared with CGM Realty.
</P>
<P>
   The recent numbers for the Vanguard fund are less gory than
those of CGM, but they're still unpleasant. Over 52 weeks, it shows
a 17.13 percent loss (compared with a 20.65 percent loss for CGM
Realty and a 17.71 percent loss for the Wilshire REIT Index).
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date, it shows a 3.97 percent loss, which compares with
a 3.62 percent loss for CGM Realty and a 5.75 percent loss for the
REIT Index. Vanguard's REIT Index fund yields 7.61 percent, nicely
leading the 6.71 percent of CGM Realty. You can trace most of that
variance to the expense ratios _ 0.24 percent for Vanguard compared
with 1.00 for CGM Realty. (Both of these are 1997 figures, the
latest provided in the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports.)
</P>
<P>
   For my money, which is staying with CGM, the abilities of fund
manager G. Kenneth Heebner are worth the extra 76 basis points on
the expense ratio. (I should also note that a vice president of CGM
is an old and valued friend of mine, and I am following his advice
_ wince and hang in there.)
</P>
<P>
   So in summary, I have nothing at all against REIT funds _
provided 1) it's in a tax-deferred account; 2) you keep the holding
to a small percentage of your overall portfolio; and 3) you can
both afford the risk financially and deal with the emotional
affects of that risk when things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another way of thinking of it is this: The REIT sector has
already suffered what I think is ahead for the large-cap stocks as
a group, a fairly long and choppy slide until prices get back in
line with earnings and dividends.
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 23:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CELL-BEHAVIOR (Undated) _ Hoping to understand on a very
basic level how individuals _ whether cells in a body, plants and
animals in an ecosystem, or members of a society _ congregate into
complex wholes that take on autonomous existences of their own,
scientists based at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico are
studying how the simplest imaginable cells can interact to generate
surprisingly complex, coordinated behavior. By George Johnson. With
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GRIEF-RESOLUTION (Undated) _ Researchers are now exploring
the concept they call ambiguous loss, in which a ``lost'' person is
still physically present but emotionally absent or a lost person is
physically absent but still emotionally present. Research, outlined
in new book, contends that in such circumstances it is often very
difficult for people to resolve their grief and get on with their
lives. By Jane E. Brody. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOLID-CARBON-DIOXIDE (Undated) _ Carbon dioxide, a
ubiquitous chemical exhaled by all animals and incorporated into
plants as their main building block, has assumed a new and
astonishing form: a solid that resembles quartz, is nearly as hard
as diamond, and transforms light in intriguing (and potentially
very useful) ways. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DNA-SEQUENCE (Undated) _ Last week the public consortium
working to sequence the human genome said it would complete a
``first draft'' of the human DNA sequence next spring, well ahead
of the target date announced by its commercial rival the Celera
Corporation. The outcome of this battle between rivals seems to lie
to some extent in the hands of an esoteric computer program named
phred. By Nicholas Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COLD-FUSION (Undated) _ Cold fusion is alive today and doing
well in the scientific underground. Researchers around the globe
quietly claim success at getting tantalizing results, if not
blistering heats ready to topple the status quo. This hum of
low-level work confounds skeptics and delights believers. By
William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COOLIDGE-DOCUMENATRY (Undated) _ Ancient footage of African
expeditions, with big guns and long lines of porters, by early
conservationists like Harold Jefferson Coolidge represent a sort of
gorilla skeleton in the closet of the global conservation movement.
But eventually Coolidge became a major force behind preserving the
kind of rare species he had once shot. Now, his expedition films
are being crafted into a documentary. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-POISON-ANTIDOTE (Undated) _ Experts say the complicated and
sometimes tricky treatment of poisonings with ethylene glycol
(antifreeze) and perhaps other toxic alcohols could be radically
changed with the recent introduction of a new antidote drug that
appears to be highly effective, but prohibitively expensive for
some hospitals. By Warren E. Leary. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CARTOON-HEALTH (Undated) _ Parental concerns about the
messages small children receive in G-rated animated feature films
have resulted in a review showing that two-thirds of such movies
produced over the last 60 years include the use of tobacco and
alcohol by villains and heroes alike. By Nancy Beth Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   DUAL-DOCTOR-MARRIAGES (Undated) _ As the ranks of women doctors
grow, so do doctor-doctor marriages. Compared with other
physicians, doctors in dual-doctor marriages reported greater
satisfaction in discussing and sharing work interests with their
spouses, more involvement in child rearing by both partners and a
higher family income. By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   ZERO-GRAVITY-EXERCISES (Undated) _ As a January 2000 launching
date for the first resident mission to the new International Space
Station approaches, NASA now is making its most serious effort ever
to break the muscle barrier to extended stays in zero gravity. By
John O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EATING-HABITS (Undated) _ Two new studies lend evidence to
the view that eating and other health habits of children just
starting elementary school play a major role in the problems they
may suffer in later life, including heart disease, high blood
pressure and possibly diabetes. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Your science questions answered.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items dealing with evolution
bioluminescence underseas, genetically engineered silkworms and
origins of the moon. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ A generation ago, researchers
at the University of Minnesota published findings that, if heeded
then, would have extended millions of American lives during the
last 30 years and millions more in the years to come. The
researchers examined the relationship between diet and heart
disease rates and found that people who lived along the
Mediterranean Sea suffered only a tiny fraction of the heart
attacks and coronary deaths experienced by Americans and people in
other Western industrialized countries. In the years since, other
studies have fleshed out those findings. The latest, in
Circulation, is a four-year follow-up of more than 400 men and
women in France. By Jane Brody. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short news items, including: a study
by researchers who surveyed a decade's syphilis reports in North
Carolina counties and found that syphilis appeared more than twice
as often in North Carolina rural counties that bordered I-95 as it
did in rural counties that did not border the highway. With map.
</P>
<P>
   A new study finds that family doctors with the most impressive
credentials seem to be the most likely to be sued.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, therapists and police officers who give hearsay
testimony in court about young children's statements may not be

COUPLES PLAN FOR THE FIRST BABY OF 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The global race for the first baby in 2000 is
under way. Would-be contestants have conceived a winning strategy _
now they just have to conceive a baby.
</P>
<P>
   From now until April 10 is the optimal fertilization window for
couples hoping to create the first offspring of 2000, specialists
say.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy to conceive a millennium baby is a tad ironic. While
next year is symbolically the beginning of the new millennium, it
does not technically begin until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the first babies of 2000 can count on much more than
their photos in the newspaper: a bonanza of prizes and a place in
history await them.
</P>
<P>
   For people who want to simultaneously usher in a new life at the
dawn of next year, the San Francisco-based BabyCenter on-line store
is offering a $49.99 Millennium Conception Kit. Buyers receive a
best-selling fertility guide, an ovulation-predictor kit, a
pregnancy test, calcium supplements, a calendar, a pair of
hand-dipped red taper candles and a bottle of Terra Nova's Cloud
Nine massage oil _ all gift-wrapped in red tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Seltzer, a software-company recruiter from Foster City,
Calif., has her fingers crossed that the kit will work for her and
her husband Eric.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not like these couples who are timing artificial
inseminations and planning to fly around the globe so they can have
the millennium's first birth,'' she said. ``Our primary goal is to
start our family _ having the year's first baby would make
something already special just a bit extra special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the marketing frenzy seems a bit much to me _ although
when I heard about a Dallas radio station offering the millennium
baby a full college scholarship I did think to myself, `Wouldn't
that be great?'''
</P>
<P>
   Frenzy may be an understatement: A San Diego couple has
announced plans not only to conceive a baby on April Fools' Day,
but also to fly to Kiribati _ an island nation in the Western
Pacific _ for a Caesarean section at 12:00:01 a.m. Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Duane and Susan Dimock are busy picking names: If it's a girl,
Millie; if a boy, Otto _ for aught, as in zero.
</P>
<P>
   A New Zealand radio station has booked 100 Auckland hotel rooms
on April 9 for couples to ``hit the sheets'' in pursuit of a
millennium baby. To ensure the proper ambience, the station is
furnishing aphrodisiacs such as oysters and champagne.
</P>
<P>
   China has been beset by rumors that the first babies of 2000
will qualify for special cash prizes and international passports _
the Beijing Youth Daily reported on one woman who had an abortion
so she could time her next pregnancy closer to the target date.
</P>
<P>
   British television network ITV plans to follow its ``Birth Race
2000'' kickoff ``Nookie Night'' _ an evening featuring shows like
the wildlife documentary ``Animal Passions'' _ with documentaries
tracking hopeful couples throughout gestation and into the delivery
room via live coverage Dec. 31. With similar hopes of inspiring
millennial conceptions, the Britain's Classic FM intends to flood
the airwaves April 11 with passionate pieces by composers such as
Rachmaninov and Ravel.
</P>
<P>
   Already, ``Official Millennium Baby'' is a trademark, right
alongside ``The Official Burger of the New Millennium'' and ``The
Official Air Freshener of the New Millennium.'' The Canadian
company that owns the baby trademark is soliciting sponsors to
donate $2 million in prizes _ from diapers to a minivan _ for the
``jackpot baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Intercourse affords only about a 25 percent chance of getting
pregnant, and not all those pregnancies will survive to term. Even
though the human gestation period averages 38 weeks, there are wide
variations. Only 5 percent of mothers give birth on their due date.
</P>
<P>
   The hype and technological tinkering troubles religious and
medical ethicists. They fear that the priceless miracle of creation
is being trivialized into a cheap publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making a mockery of what a child is about,'' a papal
spokesman said. ``Having a child to get on TV must be the height of
absurdity.''

TOO MUCH SOUND AND FURY, SAY READERS _ AND FOR WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been working our way through the American Society of
Newspaper Editors' three-year-long research project to study the
issue of credibility, specifically as it relates to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE reported six ``major findings,'' and today we deal with
No. 4:
</P>
<P>
   ``The public believes that newspapers chase and over-cover
sensational stories because they're exciting and they sell papers.
They don't believe these stories deserve the attention and play
they get. Americans say they're tired of having sensational stories
crammed down their throats. The public believes that underlying
newspaper excesses is a commercial motive, to sell more papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's deal with some facts first. A relatively small percentage
of Star-Telegram copies are sold from newspaper racks and other
locations. Most of our circulation is by subscription delivered to
your home, and what is on the front page makes no difference in
those sales.
</P>
<P>
   That said, obviously editors want the front page to be
interesting, and the folk who work in circulation tell us that
their single-copy sales are better some days than others. They
attribute that to what is above the fold on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Perception deeply held might as well be reality, and the authors
of the ASNE study say that public beliefs ``are clear indictments
of press credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not unreasonable perceptions ...,'' the report said,
``but they are pervasive accusations that newspapers are not using
journalistic judgment exclusively to build the news report, but
allowing personal or corporate objectives to shape or flavor it.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a series of sensational stories during the past
few years, and the study cited several of them: the O.J. Simpson
murder trial, the allegations swirling around President Clinton
(including those by Paula Jones), the Monica Lewinsky story, the
death of Princess Diana, the death of JonBenet Ramsey, and the
Olympic bombing in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspaper editors' judgments about if and how and where to
play those stories on the pages of the newspaper must be carefully
made, then, with full realization that these kinds of stories will
likely already have had heavy television coverage,'' the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no science about news selection on front pages.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, editors are looking for the most significant news of the
day, something interesting for the readers, something with great
impact on daily living and, depending on the top newsroom
management, perhaps a goofy change-of-pace story to lighten up the
gloom and doom often associated with the news report.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, whatever else is going on in the world on a given day
influences the selection. There have been comments attributed to
various people that all boil down to the admonition not to mess up
on a light news day. Stories that might not otherwise make it to
the front will do so when there's not much else happening.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite also is true: Significant stories that might
otherwise be played on a section front will be pushed inside and
shortened if there is major news taking place.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter what newspapers actually are doing if you
as readers believe them to be doing something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another, perhaps more insidious, contributor to these beliefs
is the public's perception that newspapers overplay otherwise
normal news stories,'' the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that 48 percent of U.S. adults say they find
misleading headlines in their paper more than once a week and that
78 percent think that ``journalists enjoy reporting on the personal
failings of politicians and public figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of you calling my office think we don't report enough
on the personal failings of public figures _ one especially. But
others who call think that we overdo it. I suppose since both sides
call consistently, we're maybe somewhere in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Urban and Associates used the Clinton sex scandal
as an example:
</P>
<P>
   ``In April and May of 1998 _ long before the Starr report _
almost every adult (96 percent) was aware of the Clinton/Lewinsky
story, and of that group: 82 percent believed the news reports
contained inaccuracies or omissions; 85 percent said TV had too
much coverage (66 percent said newspapers had too much); and 67
percent said they were not at all interested in the story.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that newspapers should be driven only by what
the public says it does or does not want to know. There will always
be instances when the proper thing to do is also the unpopular
thing to do, and newspapers must have the courage to print (or
perhaps not print) those stories.
</P>
<P>
   But the ASNE report also suggests that perhaps newspapers ask
for trouble without needing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that 74 percent of adults say they want local
news every day; 54 percent say newspapers are their primary source
of local news (the only content area in which newspapers
consistently are given the edge over television or other media);
television is overwhelmingly seen as the dominant source of
national and world news; and television is almost universally
accepted as the news medium that gets the news first.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this interest and the clear advantage of newspapers
in local news, ``editors need to seriously examine the amount of
energy and space spent on the sensational stories that the public
doesn't want, resources that could, perhaps, be better redirected
toward giving them what they do want,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when daily newspapers are still hanging on to their
local news franchise _ but only barely _ the risks inherent in
chasing and over-covering sensational wire stories just don't seem
worth it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I can also show you research that contradicts that,
and that is one of the things that makes this challenging. We must
be all things to all people, and we are expected to be good at all
of them.

IN THE END, 10,000 IS NOT SIGNIFICANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Dow Jones industrial average is so near closing
above 10,000, it's time for a reality check.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a great milestone and something to be celebrated. But
last week's struggle to close above 10,000 shows why there are
reasons to beware of the hot stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me is the concentration of securities,'' said
money manager George Briggs, president of Briggs Management and
Research in Houston, who's been in the business for more than 20
years. ``It's a difficult market in which to invest money because
those selected ones that people are invested in are so high-priced
and they carry a lot of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the market's July 1998 peak, just before last summer's
correction, the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index of
large stocks has risen 9 percent, according to the Outlook, an
investment newsletter published by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.
</P>
<P>
   However, things look different if you didn't invest in that
select group _ which is the investment benchmark for index funds,
which buy those S&AMP;P stocks to emulate the performance of these 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P MidCap 400, which is made up of smaller players, is down
3 percent, and the S&AMP;P SmallCap 600 is off 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have matched or beaten the most widely followed market
averages are likely to be invested in stocks that are just plain
expensive. If you overpay for something, there's far greater danger
you will fall from the sky later on.
</P>
<P>
   The price investors are paying for the assets and earning power
of the companies in the Dow average is twice as expensive as it was
just 3 1/2 years ago, when the Dow crossed 5,000 for the first
time, in the fall of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undeterred by extreme price/earnings ratios, investors are
doing what has been working best _ staying with the winners, the
large-caps,'' said S&AMP;P analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners are flocking to the big-name issues they identify
with the U.S. economic boom. Money managers, fearful of being left
behind, are piling into stocks that are the most liquid and the
most influential in the performance benchmarks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TECH STOCKS STOKE THE FEVER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Dell Computer Corp., the Nasdaq-listed Round
Rock-based company, trounced Wal-Mart Stores, the top performer in
the Dow, during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, such as Dell, have been at the forefront of
the investment fever.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have gotten so enamored of Internet stocks that
they don't appear to show any interest in whether an Internet
company has made money or not.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers of the shares of energy companies, basic industries,
heavy goods firms are likely to feel left out of the loop. Steel,
and oil and gas have suffered from low worldwide prices.
</P>
<P>
   Other basic industries just don't offer the potential growth of
the computer and software sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rather large segment there where money isn't
invested,'' Briggs said. ``People think they're not growing fast
enough, but I just think it makes the market difficult to invest
money in.''
</P>
<P>
   When so many stocks aren't involved in the rally, there's not
enough strength to propel the market further ahead, said Mark
Arbeter, S&AMP;P technical analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``What eventually happens is that it causes the market to pull
back,'' Briggs said. ``Either the laggards have to catch up or the
leaders have to pull back, and frequently they've been pulling
back.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third time last week, the Dow failed to lock in at the
10,000 level at the close. Perhaps it's because some investors fear
that once it closes at that level or above, the market will hit a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very difficult to maintain a level above
10,000 for a while,'' said David Lapin, president of Lapin &AMP;
Wigginton Asset Management, a Houston money management firm.
``You'll see waves of selling each time advances are attempted at
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOOSEN YOUR TIE AND REST A BIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's time to take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Lapin had 100 percent of his clients' money invested last year
in stocks. He's reduced that to 70 percent stocks and 30 percent
fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher we go, the more you need to pull off the table,''
he said. ``We're going to reduce our equity exposure 1 percent for
each 100-point advance in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider pulling back a bit on your buying so that the Dow's
surge doesn't take over your investment common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax considerations permitting, lighten up a bit on stocks if
the market advance has pushed that portion of your portfolio above
the 55 percent we are recommending,'' said S&AMP;P analysts.

   CLINTON-KOSOVO (Washington) _ As U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke makes another appeal to Yugoslav President Slobodan

   CYBERCROOKS (Washington) _ The Internet has become a new vehicle

committing financial fraud.'' By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN.

   SCOTUS-SCHOOLS (Washington) _ In a pair of cases with

   MONEY-COLUMN (Houston) _ Now that the Dow Jones industrial
average is so near 10,000, it's time for a reality check. Yes, it's

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Here's the latest scenario on the
Clintons' future: When Hillary declares she'll run for the Senate
in New York, Bill will resign to move to Manhattan with her, ending

2000 as a sitting president. Gore will then issue a blanket pardon
for Clinton, sparing him any future indictment. There are holes in

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Late one afternoon on Madison Avenue, I fell into step behind
two young people apparently heading home, as was I, from a day at
the office. ``I'm assigned to the boss's son,'' one said earnestly
to the other. ``He's a great business getter but not a very good
accountant. The trouble is I'd like to learn how to do things right
before I learn how to be a crook.'' I shuddered and crossed the
street.
</P>
<P>
   _ HARRISON J. GOLDIN
</P>
<P>
   Abbie Snyder was walking into the room at the Whitney Museum of
American Art where the ``Circus Women'' by Elie Nadelman are kept,
pieces that at first glance look like ancient artifacts. She
overheard the following exchange between another visitor and a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Visitor: ``Where were these found?''
</P>
<P>
   Guard: ``Where were these found? In storage.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 p.m. on a school night and Elsa Adler heard the sounds
of activity on the pool table in the basement. She walked down to
reprimand her 16-year-old son, Michael, who should have been
studying, and heard her husband telling her son that he was
``looking for a color printer, copier and fax.'' Mrs. Adler,
increasingly angry as she descended each step, called out, ``And
I'm looking for a boy who is going to get A's on his report card.''
At this, Michael looked up and retorted, ``Then I suggest you look
into adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   An obviously frustrated mother and her daughter, who appeared to
be in her late 20s, were having lunch when Robert B. Peltz
overheard this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``You've been living together for almost a year. When
are you getting married?''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: ``We're still testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``What are you testing, the mattress?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Alden, collected for charity every week for a year
and each week when her tin was full, she proudly carried it to the
man in the wheelchair we passed on our way to her nursery school.
On occasion we brought him breakfast, and for several months he and
my daughter exchanged niceties.
</P>
<P>
   When we passed him on the day of her nursery school graduation,
he asked her why she looked so excited. She told him it was her
graduation day, and he said, ``Come here, I have something for
you.'' He reached into his pocket and gave her $2. She accepted
with the same grace that he did from her in the past.
</P>
<P>
   _ KAMMI REISS
</P>
<P>
   Carl Coraggio was amused by the sign he saw displayed by a
street vendor on Times Square. ``Webstir's Dictinary,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's creation of Fortress City Hall brings
to mind an incident in 1955 when I was in my first post-Army job,
handling public relations for Pace College diagonally across from
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, a call for help came from the mayor's office. Mayor
Robert Wagner and his wife were to be hosts to the shah of Iran and
Queen Soraya at City Hall at noon. But, the caller said, he had
just discovered that ``someone forgot to send out invitations to
the prelunch reception.'' Could I bring a couple of dozen
appropriately dressed men and women to greet the city's guests?
</P>
<P>
   I raced into the halls and rounded up a group of students who
were dressed for the office jobs they went to after classes.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, our team breezed into City Hall, casually
informed a guard what we were about and just as casually were
directed to the room where the reception would take place.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the principals showed up, we had each put away about
a pound of quite nice hors d'oeuvres. We then went through the
receiving line _ ``Hello shah, hello queen, hiya Mr. and Mrs.
Mayor'' or something like that. Everyone seemed satisfied and we
left the exalteds to resume our humdrum lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Was the mayor aware of what had happened? Probably not. But it
would never happen today.
</P>
<P>
   _ WALTER GRAY
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old son of a playwright friend of ours just got into
the Stuyvesant High School class of 2003, one of about 700 accepted
from among approximately 20,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he received the good news, he was on a bus with
his father and confessed that he had really prayed a lot, asking
God to get him into Stuyvesant. However, he added, now that he had
been accepted he wished that hadn't prayed quite so much, because
now he'll never really know if he got in on his own merit or if
only because God pulled strings for him.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Collimore was recently in Vermont where, he says, New York's
reputation is ``inexplicably mixed.'' He was given change in one of
the rural general stores for a new $20 bill and realized the
cashier had taken it for a $100 bill. He returned the extra money
and, bearing his city's reputation in mind, said: ``Remember this
moment. I AM FROM NEW YORK.''
</P>
<P>
   I was recently walking near Times Square after a matinee and
dropped an earring, which fell through a sidewalk grating in front
of a hotel. The doorman saw what happened but told us the grate
belonged to Con Edison and the hotel had no access to it.
</P>
<P>
   The earring had been a gift from my husband, so I decided to try
my luck with the utility company. On Monday morning, I telephoned,
finally reached a live person and explained what had happened. On
Tuesday morning, the phone rang: It was the chief of the emergency
crew and he had my earring. So much for impersonal giant
corporations!
</P>
<P>
   _ SARI REIFBERG
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Giuliani said that he watched the heavyweight fight on
pay-per-view and he said that the decision was `a travesty.'
Giuliani is also upset because both boxers were topless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a Web site on the Internet that's showing nude
pictures of Keith Richards. The Web site is at
www.loseyourappetite.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman hasn't shown up to play with the Lakers since
Saturday because he says he has some personal issues to deal with.
Apparently it's a tough time for Rodman because he's going through
menopause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Paula Jones announced that she and her husband are
getting separated, but she said things aren't going to get ugly.
Jones said, `We're just separating; it's not like I'm getting my
old nose back.'''  &QL; 
``The St. Patrick's Day parade was held in New York today and this
was the ninth year in a row that the Irish Gay and Lesbian
Organization was banned from marching. On the bright side, they
were invited to a huge keg party at Tinky Winky's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During a prison brawl this week, Charles Manson had his guitar
smashed. As a result, Manson said he's going to form an a cappella
group with the voices in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the Vatican released a new CD where Pope John Paul
II recites prayers while classical and rock music play underneath.
I think the Pope is taking this thing a bit too far because today
he announced he's having a feud with West Coast rappers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, a federal advisory board said that marijuana is not
a gateway to the use of harder drugs. However, they said that
marijuana is a gateway to spending an entire afternoon watching the
Cartoon Network.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday in Iowa several Amish teens rioted and were arrested
for vandalizing a farm and overturning several buggies. The worst
part is the teens spray-painted everything with the words,
`Electricity Rules.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners of the Oscars have already been decided, but only
two people know who they are. Apparently the entertainment industry
is a bit suspicious because one of those people is Don King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion executives say that only a few of the actresses
actually return the expensive gowns lent to them by top designers.
Apparently the rest of them sell their gowns to Dennis Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to a brand new book about celebrity pets Oprah
Winfrey has been having trouble controlling her dog. Apparently,
Oprah can get her dog to sit and roll over but he still won't read
any of the books she recommends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day on `60 Minutes' Mike Wallace showed an old
interview he did with Oprah Winfrey 13 years ago where Oprah looks
overweight and unpolished. Of course, it was 13 years ago so
Wallace looked old and wrinkled.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S `THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The big story this week -- they've been conducting marijuana
research all over the country, or as it's normally called, spring
break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress wants to give itself an increase of $5,000 a year.
That's just jealousy. They saw how much Clinton and Gore were
getting from the Chinese, and now they want a raise too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore opened his presidential campaign in Iowa by talking
about how as a young man, he slopped the hogs. Isn't that how
Clinton got in trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some exciting news: after 40 years Monopoly is introducing a
new game piece. It's a little bag of money and it's an exact
replica of the one Don King gave each of the judges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers at Cornell University say studies prove that
parents do in fact have a favorite child. I think Woody Allen
proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Patrick's Day, the biggest day of the year for Irish
politicians. Did you see the hot thing in Washington now? This is
the button they're all wearing: `Lewinsky me, I'm Irish.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've decided they're already going to have a rematch of the
Holyfield/Lewis fight. I hope they don't make the same mistake they
made last time, hiring those NFL referees to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonalds is now introducing a new hamburger with four
patties: 790 calories and 41 grams of fat. I believe it's called
the McTripp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened again. A Los Angeles High School teacher has been
arrested for having sex with one of her students. No wonder Clinton
wants to hire 100,000 more teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM `WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's `SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Paula Jones announced that she and her husband are
separating. One of their disagreements has been over how to spend
the money Jones received in her settlement with President Clinton.
She wants to spend it on clothing and jewelry, and he wants a new
set of tires for the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an interview published this week in the British newspaper
`Express,' Monica Lewinsky said she was upset that people seemed to
believe her relationship with President Clinton was a one-way
affair. Hey Monica, you performed oral sex on him and then he ate a
pizza. That's a one-way affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Energy Department is asking the Senate this week for an $8
million budget increase to beef up security at U.S. nuclear
laboratories. Security at one of the labs was so lax, a group of
hip-looking teenagers was able to slip past guards by flashing a
pack of Mentos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At court martial proceedings this week, Major General David
Hale was ordered to pay $22,000 for committing adultery with the
wives of four of his subordinates. That's only $5,000 a piece. If
Paula Jones is worth $850,000, what do these ladies look like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday that
despite new reports about the benefits of smoking marijuana, it is
still an illegal drug and would remain so. After the announcement,
McCaffrey drove off in his limited edition Marlboro truck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of travel journalists have voted Niagara Falls as the
best location to celebrate the millennium. The worst location:
Sitting between David Arquette and Robin Williams at Howie Mandel's
New Year's party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you how crooked boxing is: Last night, HBO
replayed the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight. Holyfield
knocked him out in the fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During an international tournament in Manhattan this week,
Maurice Ashley has become the first African-American chess
grandmaster in history, proving once again that blacks are just
better athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before their game on Tuesday, the New Jersey Nets got a pep
talk from motivational speaker Tony Robbins. The Nets lost anyway,
and Robbins was immediately traded to Milwaukee for Deepak
Chopra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The former president of Ecuador was jailed this week on
corruption charges that claim he inflated the Ecuadorian payroll
with over 1,000 phantom employees. He will be extradited to New
York where he will immediately be made shop steward at the Javit's
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Britain granted citizenship to residents of its
overseas territories including, Bermuda, and the British Virgin
Islands. The happy new citizens then went back to their life of
standing outside a barbed wire fence watching people at Club Med do
Jell-O shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd Hooker, an Oswego Hotel janitor, won $45 million in the
New York State Lottery this week and said that it is probably the
greatest thing that has ever happened to him. Really, are you sure
you want to step out on a limb like that? I thought the best thing
in your life was the time you got the drumstick at the Salvation
Army Thanksgiving dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony Records and the Vatican have joined forces and are
releasing `Abba Pater' a CD-ROM and music video featuring Pope John
Paul reciting psalms and singing. The high point of the video is
when the Pope tears up a picture of Sinead O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Amish teens were arrested this week for smashing 44
windows and overturning buggies during a rampage at the home of an
Amish farmer. The boys were easily captured by police because they
move like molasses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marilyn Manson canceled some shows this week after twisting
his ankle. Apparently, the antichrist doesn't have as high
threshold of pain as you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge this week threw out a Louisiana law that had made
consensual oral and anal sex a felony in the state. In other words:
my trip to New Orleans is back on!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim J. Bullock was arrested in West Hollywood for possession
of the illegal drug crystal meth. He was released on $10,000 bond
and now faces up to two years in prison, although there's talk his
lawyer might plea bargain it up to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Olivia D'Abo, the big sister on the `Wonder Years,' will play
Neve Campbell's love interest on three episodes of `Party of Five,'
when Campbell's character, Julia, enters into a lesbian affair.
That night, I'm gonna be having a little party of five.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `Bull Sale` &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This couple goes to an agricultural show way out in the
countryside on a fine Sunday afternoon, and are watching the
auctioning off of reproduction bulls. The guy selling the bulls
announces the first bull to be auctioned off: A fine specimen, this
bull reproduced 60 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The wife nudges her husband in the ribs, and comments: See! That
was more than 5 times a month!
</P>
<P>
   The second bull is to be sold: Another fine specimen, this
wonder reproduced 120 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Again the wife bugs her husband: Hey, that's some 10 times a
month. What do YOU say to that?!
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison...
The third bull is up for sale: And this extraordinary specimen
reproduced 360 times last year! The wife slaps her husband on the
arm and yells: That's once a day, every day of the year! How about
YOU?!
</P>
<P>
   The husband was pretty irritated by now, and yells back: Sure,
once a day! But ask the announcer if they were all with the same
cow!!!.

   Late one afternoon on Madison Avenue, I fell into step behind
two young people apparently heading home, as was I, from a day at
the office. ``I'm assigned to the boss's son,'' one said earnestly
to the other. ``He's a great business getter but not a very good
accountant. The trouble is I'd like to learn how to do things right
before I learn how to be a crook.'' I shuddered and crossed the
street.

   Abbie Snyder was walking into the room at the Whitney Museum of
American Art where the ``Circus Women'' by Elie Nadelman are kept,
pieces that at first glance look like ancient artifacts. She
overheard the following exchange between another visitor and a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Visitor: ``Where were these found?''
</P>
<P>
   Guard: ``Where were these found? In storage.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 p.m. on a school night and Elsa Adler heard the sounds
of activity on the pool table in the basement. She walked down to
reprimand her 16-year-old son, Michael, who should have been
studying, and heard her husband telling her son that he was
``looking for a color printer, copier and fax.'' Mrs. Adler,
increasingly angry as she descended each step, called out, ``And
I'm looking for a boy who is going to get A's on his report card.''
At this, Michael looked up and retorted, ``Then I suggest you look
into adoption.''

   An obviously frustrated mother and her daughter, who appeared to
be in her late 20s, were having lunch when Robert B. Peltz
overheard this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``You've been living together for almost a year. When
are you getting married?''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: ``We're still testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``What are you testing, the mattress?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Alden, collected for charity every week for a year
and each week when her tin was full, she proudly carried it to the
man in the wheelchair we passed on our way to her nursery school.
On occasion we brought him breakfast, and for several months he and
my daughter exchanged niceties.
</P>
<P>
   When we passed him on the day of her nursery school graduation,
he asked her why she looked so excited. She told him it was her
graduation day, and he said, ``Come here, I have something for
you.'' He reached into his pocket and gave her $2. She accepted
with the same grace that he did from her in the past.

   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's creation of Fortress City Hall brings
to mind an incident in 1955 when I was in my first post-Army job,
handling public relations for Pace College diagonally across from
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, a call for help came from the mayor's office. Mayor
Robert Wagner and his wife were to be hosts to the shah of Iran and
Queen Soraya at City Hall at noon. But, the caller said, he had
just discovered that ``someone forgot to send out invitations to
the prelunch reception.'' Could I bring a couple of dozen
appropriately dressed men and women to greet the city's guests?
</P>
<P>
   I raced into the halls and rounded up a group of students who
were dressed for the office jobs they went to after classes.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, our team breezed into City Hall, casually
informed a guard what we were about and just as casually were
directed to the room where the reception would take place.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the principals showed up, we had each put away about
a pound of quite nice hors d'oeuvres. We then went through the
receiving line _ ``Hello shah, hello queen, hiya Mr. and Mrs.
Mayor'' or something like that. Everyone seemed satisfied and we
left the exalteds to resume our humdrum lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Was the mayor aware of what had happened? Probably not. But it
would never happen today.

   The 13-year-old son of a playwright friend of ours just got into
the Stuyvesant High School class of 2003, one of about 700 accepted
from among approximately 20,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he received the good news, he was on a bus with
his father and confessed that he had really prayed a lot, asking
God to get him into Stuyvesant. However, he added, now that he had
been accepted he wished that hadn't prayed quite so much, because
now he'll never really know if he got in on his own merit or if
only because God pulled strings for him.

   Tom Collimore was recently in Vermont where, he says, New York's
reputation is ``inexplicably mixed.'' He was given change in one of
the rural general stores for a new $20 bill and realized the
cashier had taken it for a $100 bill. He returned the extra money
and, bearing his city's reputation in mind, said: ``Remember this
moment. I AM FROM NEW YORK.''
</P>
<P>
   I was recently walking near Times Square after a matinee and
dropped an earring, which fell through a sidewalk grating in front
of a hotel. The doorman saw what happened but told us the grate
belonged to Con Edison and the hotel had no access to it.
</P>
<P>
   The earring had been a gift from my husband, so I decided to try
my luck with the utility company. On Monday morning, I telephoned,
finally reached a live person and explained what had happened. On
Tuesday morning, the phone rang: It was the chief of the emergency
crew and he had my earring. So much for impersonal giant
corporations!

Saturday because he says he has some personal issues to deal with.
Apparently it's a tough time for Rodman because he's going through
menopause.''

   ``This week Paula Jones announced that she and her husband are
getting separated, but she said things aren't going to get ugly.
Jones said, `We're just separating; it's not like I'm getting my
old nose back.'''  &QL; 
``The St. Patrick's Day parade was held in New York today and this

Organization was banned from marching. On the bright side, they
were invited to a huge keg party at Tinky Winky's.''

   ``During a prison brawl this week, Charles Manson had his guitar
smashed. As a result, Manson said he's going to form an a cappella
group with the voices in his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the Vatican released a new CD where Pope John Paul
II recites prayers while classical and rock music play underneath.
I think the Pope is taking this thing a bit too far because today
he announced he's having a feud with West Coast rappers.''

   ``Yesterday, a federal advisory board said that marijuana is not
a gateway to the use of harder drugs. However, they said that
marijuana is a gateway to spending an entire afternoon watching the
Cartoon Network.''
</P>

   ``Yesterday in Iowa several Amish teens rioted and were arrested
for vandalizing a farm and overturning several buggies. The worst
part is the teens spray-painted everything with the words,
`Electricity Rules.'''

is a bit suspicious because one of those people is Don King.''

actually return the expensive gowns lent to them by top designers.
Apparently the rest of them sell their gowns to Dennis Rodman.''
</P>

   ``According to a brand new book about celebrity pets Oprah
Winfrey has been having trouble controlling her dog. Apparently,
Oprah can get her dog to sit and roll over but he still won't read
any of the books she recommends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day on `60 Minutes' Mike Wallace showed an old
interview he did with Oprah Winfrey 13 years ago where Oprah looks
overweight and unpolished. Of course, it was 13 years ago so
Wallace looked old and wrinkled.''

research all over the country, or as it's normally called, spring
break.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress wants to give itself an increase of $5,000 a year.
That's just jealousy. They saw how much Clinton and Gore were
getting from the Chinese, and now they want a raise too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore opened his presidential campaign in Iowa by talking
about how as a young man, he slopped the hogs. Isn't that how
Clinton got in trouble?''

replica of the one Don King gave each of the judges.''

   ``Researchers at Cornell University say studies prove that

made last time, hiring those NFL referees to judge.''

   ``McDonalds is now introducing a new hamburger with four
patties: 790 calories and 41 grams of fat. I believe it's called
the McTripp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened again. A Los Angeles High School teacher has been
arrested for having sex with one of her students. No wonder Clinton
wants to hire 100,000 more teachers.''

   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM `WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's `SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Paula Jones announced that she and her husband are
separating. One of their disagreements has been over how to spend
the money Jones received in her settlement with President Clinton.
She wants to spend it on clothing and jewelry, and he wants a new
set of tires for the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an interview published this week in the British newspaper
`Express,' Monica Lewinsky said she was upset that people seemed to
believe her relationship with President Clinton was a one-way
affair. Hey Monica, you performed oral sex on him and then he ate a
pizza. That's a one-way affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Energy Department is asking the Senate this week for an $8
million budget increase to beef up security at U.S. nuclear
laboratories. Security at one of the labs was so lax, a group of
hip-looking teenagers was able to slip past guards by flashing a
pack of Mentos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At court martial proceedings this week, Major General David
Hale was ordered to pay $22,000 for committing adultery with the
wives of four of his subordinates. That's only $5,000 a piece. If
Paula Jones is worth $850,000, what do these ladies look like?''
</P>
<P>
   ``White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey said Wednesday that
despite new reports about the benefits of smoking marijuana, it is
still an illegal drug and would remain so. After the announcement,
McCaffrey drove off in his limited edition Marlboro truck.''

best location to celebrate the millennium. The worst location:
Sitting between David Arquette and Robin Williams at Howie Mandel's
New Year's party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you how crooked boxing is: Last night, HBO
replayed the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis fight. Holyfield
knocked him out in the fourth.''

   ``During an international tournament in Manhattan this week,
Maurice Ashley has become the first African-American chess
grandmaster in history, proving once again that blacks are just
better athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before their game on Tuesday, the New Jersey Nets got a pep
talk from motivational speaker Tony Robbins. The Nets lost anyway,
and Robbins was immediately traded to Milwaukee for Deepak
Chopra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The former president of Ecuador was jailed this week on
corruption charges that claim he inflated the Ecuadorian payroll
with over 1,000 phantom employees. He will be extradited to New
York where he will immediately be made shop steward at the Javit's
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Britain granted citizenship to residents of its
overseas territories including, Bermuda, and the British Virgin
Islands. The happy new citizens then went back to their life of
standing outside a barbed wire fence watching people at Club Med do
Jell-O shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Floyd Hooker, an Oswego Hotel janitor, won $45 million in the
New York State Lottery this week and said that it is probably the
greatest thing that has ever happened to him. Really, are you sure
you want to step out on a limb like that? I thought the best thing
in your life was the time you got the drumstick at the Salvation
Army Thanksgiving dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony Records and the Vatican have joined forces and are
releasing `Abba Pater' a CD-ROM and music video featuring Pope John
Paul reciting psalms and singing. The high point of the video is
when the Pope tears up a picture of Sinead O'Connor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four Amish teens were arrested this week for smashing 44
windows and overturning buggies during a rampage at the home of an
Amish farmer. The boys were easily captured by police because they
move like molasses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marilyn Manson canceled some shows this week after twisting
his ankle. Apparently, the antichrist doesn't have as high
threshold of pain as you might think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge this week threw out a Louisiana law that had made
consensual oral and anal sex a felony in the state. In other words:
my trip to New Orleans is back on!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim J. Bullock was arrested in West Hollywood for possession
of the illegal drug crystal meth. He was released on $10,000 bond
and now faces up to two years in prison, although there's talk his
lawyer might plea bargain it up to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Olivia D'Abo, the big sister on the `Wonder Years,' will play
Neve Campbell's love interest on three episodes of `Party of Five,'
when Campbell's character, Julia, enters into a lesbian affair.
That night, I'm gonna be having a little party of five.''

   &UR; `Bull Sale` &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This couple goes to an agricultural show way out in the
countryside on a fine Sunday afternoon, and are watching the
auctioning off of reproduction bulls. The guy selling the bulls
announces the first bull to be auctioned off: A fine specimen, this
bull reproduced 60 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The wife nudges her husband in the ribs, and comments: See! That
was more than 5 times a month!
</P>
<P>
   The second bull is to be sold: Another fine specimen, this
wonder reproduced 120 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Again the wife bugs her husband: Hey, that's some 10 times a
month. What do YOU say to that?!
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison...
The third bull is up for sale: And this extraordinary specimen
reproduced 360 times last year! The wife slaps her husband on the
arm and yells: That's once a day, every day of the year! How about
YOU?!
</P>
<P>
   The husband was pretty irritated by now, and yells back: Sure,
once a day! But ask the announcer if they were all with the same
cow!!!.

announces the first bull to be auctioned off: A fine specimen, this
bull reproduced 60 times last year.

was more than 5 times a month!

   Again the wife bugs her husband: Hey, that's some 10 times a
month. What do YOU say to that?!
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison...
The third bull is up for sale: And this extraordinary specimen
reproduced 360 times last year! The wife slaps her husband on the
arm and yells: That's once a day, every day of the year! How about
YOU?!
</P>
<P>
   The husband was pretty irritated by now, and yells back: Sure,
once a day! But ask the announcer if they were all with the same

<P>
   Late one afternoon on Madison Avenue, I fell into step behind
two young people apparently heading home, as was I, from a day at
the office. ``I'm assigned to the boss's son,'' one said earnestly
to the other. ``He's a great business getter but not a very good
accountant. The trouble is I'd like to learn how to do things right
before I learn how to be a crook.'' I shuddered and crossed the
street.

   Abbie Snyder was walking into the room at the Whitney Museum of
American Art where the ``Circus Women'' by Elie Nadelman are kept,
pieces that at first glance look like ancient artifacts. She
overheard the following exchange between another visitor and a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Visitor: ``Where were these found?''
</P>
<P>
   Guard: ``Where were these found? In storage.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 p.m. on a school night and Elsa Adler heard the sounds
of activity on the pool table in the basement. She walked down to
reprimand her 16-year-old son, Michael, who should have been
studying, and heard her husband telling her son that he was
``looking for a color printer, copier and fax.'' Mrs. Adler,
increasingly angry as she descended each step, called out, ``And
I'm looking for a boy who is going to get A's on his report card.''
At this, Michael looked up and retorted, ``Then I suggest you look
into adoption.''

   An obviously frustrated mother and her daughter, who appeared to
be in her late 20s, were having lunch when Robert B. Peltz
overheard this conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``You've been living together for almost a year. When
are you getting married?''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter: ``We're still testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother: ``What are you testing, the mattress?''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, Alden, collected for charity every week for a year
and each week when her tin was full, she proudly carried it to the
man in the wheelchair we passed on our way to her nursery school.
On occasion we brought him breakfast, and for several months he and
my daughter exchanged niceties.
</P>
<P>
   When we passed him on the day of her nursery school graduation,
he asked her why she looked so excited. She told him it was her
graduation day, and he said, ``Come here, I have something for
you.'' He reached into his pocket and gave her $2. She accepted
with the same grace that he did from her in the past.

   Carl Coraggio was amused by the sign he saw displayed by a
street vendor on Times Square. ``Webstir's Dictinary,'' it said.

<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's creation of Fortress City Hall brings
to mind an incident in 1955 when I was in my first post-Army job,
handling public relations for Pace College diagonally across from
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, a call for help came from the mayor's office. Mayor
Robert Wagner and his wife were to be hosts to the shah of Iran and
Queen Soraya at City Hall at noon. But, the caller said, he had
just discovered that ``someone forgot to send out invitations to
the prelunch reception.'' Could I bring a couple of dozen
appropriately dressed men and women to greet the city's guests?
</P>
<P>
   I raced into the halls and rounded up a group of students who
were dressed for the office jobs they went to after classes.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, our team breezed into City Hall, casually
informed a guard what we were about and just as casually were
directed to the room where the reception would take place.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the principals showed up, we had each put away about
a pound of quite nice hors d'oeuvres. We then went through the
receiving line _ ``Hello shah, hello queen, hiya Mr. and Mrs.
Mayor'' or something like that. Everyone seemed satisfied and we
left the exalteds to resume our humdrum lives across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Was the mayor aware of what had happened? Probably not. But it
would never happen today.

   The 13-year-old son of a playwright friend of ours just got into
the Stuyvesant High School class of 2003, one of about 700 accepted
from among approximately 20,000 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he received the good news, he was on a bus with
his father and confessed that he had really prayed a lot, asking
God to get him into Stuyvesant. However, he added, now that he had
been accepted he wished that hadn't prayed quite so much, because
now he'll never really know if he got in on his own merit or if
only because God pulled strings for him.

   Tom Collimore was recently in Vermont where, he says, New York's
reputation is ``inexplicably mixed.'' He was given change in one of
the rural general stores for a new $20 bill and realized the
cashier had taken it for a $100 bill. He returned the extra money
and, bearing his city's reputation in mind, said: ``Remember this
moment. I AM FROM NEW YORK.''
</P>
<P>
   I was recently walking near Times Square after a matinee and
dropped an earring, which fell through a sidewalk grating in front
of a hotel. The doorman saw what happened but told us the grate
belonged to Con Edison and the hotel had no access to it.
</P>
<P>
   The earring had been a gift from my husband, so I decided to try
my luck with the utility company. On Monday morning, I telephoned,
finally reached a live person and explained what had happened. On
Tuesday morning, the phone rang: It was the chief of the emergency
crew and he had my earring. So much for impersonal giant
corporations!

   This couple goes to an agricultural show way out in the

announces the first bull to be auctioned off: A fine specimen, this
bull reproduced 60 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The wife nudges her husband in the ribs, and comments: See! That
was more than 5 times a month!
</P>
<P>
   The second bull is to be sold: Another fine specimen, this
wonder reproduced 120 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   Again the wife bugs her husband: Hey, that's some 10 times a
month. What do YOU say to that?!
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison...
The third bull is up for sale: And this extraordinary specimen
reproduced 360 times last year! The wife slaps her husband on the
arm and yells: That's once a day, every day of the year! How about
YOU?!
</P>
<P>
   The husband was pretty irritated by now, and yells back: Sure,
once a day! But ask the announcer if they were all with the same
cow!!!.

`TUNA' SAGA IS FUNNY BUT IS SHORT ON BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT HURWITT  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Big, lovable Bertha Bumiller is back, and so is
her sardonic, dog-poisoning sister Pearl Burras.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are such favorite residents of Tuna, Texas, as
gun-merchant Didi Snavely, vindictive Vera Carp, rebellious young
Stanley Bumiller, meek, animal-loving Petey Fisk and the
ever-popular Radio OKKK broadcast team of Thurston Wheelis and
Arles Struvie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red, White and Tuna,'' the newest installment of the Tuna
saga, opened Friday at the Marines' Memorial Theatre, starring
original Tuna creators Joe Sears and Jaston Williams as the entire
population of the third-smallest town in Texas. Billed as the third
part of the Tuna trilogy, it's clearly meant to provide Sears and
Williams with a graceful exit after almost two decades of touring
with its wildly popular predecessors, ``Greater Tuna'' and ``A Tuna
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's their plan, it may backfire. ``Red, White and Tuna''
isn't as sharply satirical or crisply structured as ``Greater
Tuna'' nor quite so comically iconoclastic as its holiday sequel.
But it is wonderfully funny, pointedly topical and genuinely
heartwarming. It may turn out to be as hard for Williams and Sears
to get out of Tuna as it is for most of their characters.
</P>
<P>
   For those who've yet to tune in to Tuna, Williams, Sears and
director Ed Howard created ``Greater Tuna'' in 1981 as a satire on
the ascendant right-wing politics of the Reagan era. With rapid
changes of costume and personality _ at comic odds with the
deliciously slow amble of the show _ Sears and Williams created 19
sharp cameos. A perversely subversive tale of one teen's rebellion
emerged from beneath the apparently aimless collection of
caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas,'' created in 1989, picked up many of the same
characters plus a few new ones, for a total of 22, some years
later. ``Red, White and Tuna'' looks back in on the same town at a
still later date, revisiting most of the same folks from the first
two shows.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, who (once again) shares writing credits with the actors,
stages it at the same comically slow amble _ with Sears or Williams
wandering behind an upstage flat and emerging from the other side
of it as a different character without seeming to have broken
stride. Linda Fisher's inventive quick-change costumes are as
effective in defining the caricatures as her work was in the first
two shows. Kevin Rupnik's lonesome prairie Texas landscape recalls
his set for the first ``Tuna.''
</P>
<P>
   A rambling, comic newscast by Sears' garrulous Thurston and
Williams' laconic Arles sets the scene. It's the Fourth of July,
which in Tuna means both a low- rent fireworks display and the
annual high school reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the news is the heated battle for Reunion Queen between
the town's reigning matrons _ Sears' ever-wonderful Pearl Burras, a
mountain of tough tenderness, and Williams' vividly mean-spirited
Vera Carp.
</P>
<P>
   Carp is also engaged in a Smut Smashers campaign to expurgate
suggestive lyrics from church hymns, as well as trying to shut down
the latest theatrical production by the misfit fey thespian, Sears'
flamboyant Joe Bob Lipsey (whom she skewers as a ``yard sale
Liberace''). Interwoven with the reunion plot line is another
involving the pending, on-again, off-again marriage of Arles and
Sears' Bertha, matriarch of the Bumiller clan.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed in Tuna. Klan spokesman Elmer Watkins (Sears)
appears briefly as leader of the new Independent Nation of Free
White Texas, setting up a running gag about militiamen running
afoul of a no-nonsense rancher woman. Bertha's kids have grown up.
Whiny, ever-hungry teen Charlene (Williams) is now married,
pregnant, still ravenous and dreaming of moving to Bakersfield (her
``I hear it's like paradise'' brings down the house).
</P>
<P>
   Teen rebel Stanley (Williams) has moved to Santa Fe and become a
successful taxidermy artist with his spray-painted roadkill, a
device that will recur in his latest act of vengeance against the
town. Williams' hilarious gravel-voiced Didi Snavely, of Didi's
Used Weapons, is still chain-smoking and waiting _ just barely _
for her possibly UFO-abducted milquetoast husband R.R. (Sears) to
return. Her habit of taking a long drag in the middle of a song,
and picking up the lyrics after an interminable inhale, is
brilliantly funny.
</P>
<P>
   The man-hungry Tastee Kreme waitresses, Helen Bedd (Williams)
and Inita Goodwin (Sears), are back as well, demonstrating what
happens when you serve potato salad on a hot day (``110, but it's a
dry heat'').
</P>
<P>
   Other characters from the previous shows put in appearances as
well, more for the sake of another quick change than for what they
add to the story. More significant are two new, bright creations,
Tuna's renegade flower children Star Birdfeather (Sears) and Amber
Windchime (Williams).
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's a kinder, gentler, though still very funny,
``Tuna.'' Williams, Sears and Howard wrap up their saga on a
positive note, focusing on the emotional depth of their more
attractive characters. The show ends with new possibilities for
Bertha, Arles and Stanley in particular. Even the introduction of
some delightful special effects helps emphasize the theme that life
is pretty much the same everywhere, even in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, Sears and Williams break with the past by making
one of their costume changes onstage. It's a magically understated
moment, and one well-devised to bring the Tuna saga to a close.

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation ago, Dr. Ancel Keys and colleagues at the
University of Minnesota published findings that, if heeded then,
would have extended millions of American lives during the last 30
years and millions more in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers examined the relationship between diet and heart
disease rates in seven countries and found that people who lived
along the Mediterranean Sea suffered only a tiny fraction of the
heart attacks and coronary deaths experienced by Americans and
people in other Western industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   Among people along the Mediterranean, dietary fat consumed was
mostly of vegetable origin; among the others, diets were rich in
highly saturated animal fats from meat and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the seven countries study other researchers
have helped to tease out the various influential features of what
has come to be called the Mediterranean diet, and a number of
cookbooks have been published promoting delicious foods that just
happen to protect hearts and blood vessels and, as a bonus, may
also help prevent several common cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Various studies have substantiated Dr. Keys' initial
observations and shown that deaths from coronary heart disease are
far less common in countries along the Mediterranean than in
northern Europe. In addition, some researchers have tested the
benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet in people who face a high
risk of dying of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, published last month in Circulation, the
journal of the American Heart Association, is a four-year follow-up
of more than 400 men and women in France, all of whom had already
suffered one heart attack and therefore were at risk of another.
</P>
<P>
   About half the participants were told to switch to a
Mediterranean-type diet rich in fruits, vegetables, cereals, fish
and beans, and the other half were advised to eat a more
traditional Western diet that was relatively low in fat, saturated
fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Those following the Mediterranean diet were 50 percent to 70
percent less likely than the comparison group to develop recurrent
heart disease, including fatal and nonfatal heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising, and gastronomically pleasing,
feature of the dietary scheme that has emerged from this research
is that the diet may not have to be low in fat to protect the
heart. Rather than insisting, as does Dr. Dean Ornish, that no fat
be added to food and that all fat-containing animal foods be
avoided, advocates of the Mediterranean diet include a fair amount
of fat, nearly all in the form of oils: olive oil, nut and seed
oils and fish oil.
</P>
<P>
   However, meat in the traditional Mediterranean diet is only a
sometime thing, used more as a condiment than as the main
ingredient in meals. Instead, the diet features lots of fruits and
vegetables, legumes and nuts and all manner of grains (bread,
pasta, rice, bulgur and the like), often cooked and/or seasoned
with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The predominant animal foods are fish, yogurt and cheese
(usually low-fat feta). Wine is typically consumed in moderation
with meals. A featured item of Greek meals, for example, is a large
salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, onions and feta cheese,
dressed with vinegar and olive oil and eaten with bread.
</P>
<P>
   In the newly published study, conducted by Dr. Michel de
Lorgeril and colleagues in Lyon, France, 30 percent of calories in
the experimental Mediterranean diet came from fat and 8 percent
from saturated fat, compared with 34 percent fat calories and
nearly 12 percent saturated fat calories in the other group's diet.
Cholesterol intake averaged 212 milligrams a day on the
Mediterranean diet; on the control diet, 312.
</P>
<P>
   The levels of fats and cholesterol reached in the Mediterranean
diet approached those recommended by the American Heart Association
for people who have heart disease or high levels of cholesterol in
their blood, whereas the comparison group's diet closely resembled
that of typical Americans, half of whom die of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Mediterranean diet group also consumed more dietary fiber,
antioxidants and B vitamins found in fruits and vegetables, all of
which may slow the arterial damage that precedes heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   What is so special about olive oil or, for that matter, the oils
in nuts and seeds, like walnut oil, canola oil and flaxseed oil?
They are, first of all, unsaturated oils that do not raise blood
levels of cholesterol. And they are rich in a kind of fatty acid
called alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid that is found
only in plants and is an essential nutrient in the human diet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with fish oils, which are also rich in omega-3 unsaturated
fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, and docosahexaenoic
acid, or DHA), these oils have several effects in the body that
would be expected to prevent or reduce coronary heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in animals and people have pointed to such effects as a
reduced risk of blood clots, prevention of abnormal heart rhythms,
less inflammation and clogging of blood vessels by deposits of fat
and cholesterol and prevention of sudden cardiac death (this last
effect is linked mainly to fish oils).
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, in the Lyon study, those participants who
had higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids had a lower risk of
developing a recurrent heart attack or other cardiac problems. This
finding should not be interpreted to mean that blood levels of
cholesterol are unimportant; countless studies have clearly
demonstrated that they are. The higher the cholesterol level, the
greater the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, de Lorgeril and colleagues suggested that the
protection afforded by the Mediterranean diet might be enhanced by
drugs that lowered blood levels of cholesterol. But, according to
Dr. Alexander Leaf, professor emeritus of clinical medicine at
Harvard University Medical School, the Lyon study indicates that
``there are other powerful risk factors within the realm of diet
that must be considered if we are to achieve maximal dietary
benefits in reducing this No. 1 cause of mortality in the world
today.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting finding of the Lyon study was that although the
project was officially terminated after 27 months (the benefits of
the Mediterranean-type diet were so drastic that the researchers
concluded it would be unethical not to give the comparison group a
chance to go on it), most of the participants who had been in the
experimental group continued to follow the diet. In other words,
the diet was well-tolerated and probably enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   If you are serious about wanting to avoid a heart attack, or a
worsening of heart disease, numerous studies have strongly
indicated that you'd be wise to eat fish at least once or twice a
week. Here is a quick summary of some of the most telling findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ In a study in Seattle and surrounding suburbs of 334 people
who suffered a cardiac arrest compared with 493 people who had not,
eating one fatty fish meal a week was associated with a 50 percent
to 70 percent lower risk of a fatal heart attack, according to a
report by Dr. David S. Siscovick and colleagues at the University
of Washington. This finding strongly suggests that eating fish can
prevent potentially fatal disruptions of heart rhythms, an effect
that has been demonstrated in laboratory animals given fish oils.
</P>
<P>
   _ A British study found that people who regularly ate fish,
especially fatty fish, were less likely to suffer heart attacks.
The researchers, writing in the British Medical Journal, suggested
that fish oils reduced the thickness and stickiness of the blood,
which in turn meant less chance that a blood clot would form and
precipitate a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 30-year study of 1,800 men in Illinois showed that men who
consumed one or two servings of fish a week (about 7 ounces) had a
significantly lower risk of suffering a fatal heart attack. The
lead researcher, Dr. Martha Daviglus of Northwestern University
Medical School, concluded, ``The good news is that small amounts of
fish, amounts all of us can easily fit into our diets, may make a
difference.''

DEVELOPING A GLOW  
 MORE COLORS IN NATURE  
 THE MOON AND THE EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deep oceans are filled with creatures that emit light for
use as camouflage, to attract a mate or as a lure for food. But
understanding how such bioluminescence evolved in these organisms
has been practically impossible, because fossils contain no record
of what is essentially a chemical process.
</P>
<P>
   The recent discovery of a bioluminescent octopus, however,
offers a few evolutionary clues. The octopus, discovered by
researchers from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in
Fort Pierce, Fla., has what at first glance appear to be ordinary
suckers on its eight arms. But the suckers have lost their ability
to stick to anything, and instead emit a blue-green glow, making
the octopus look as if it got entangled in a string of Christmas
lights.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who describe the species in a recent issue of
the journal Nature, suggested that the octopus evolved from a
shallow-water, bottom-clinging species as it colonized deeper
water.
</P>
<P>
   The suckers were no longer needed for clinging, but another
function _ signaling to a potential mate _ was still important, and
more difficult in the deeper and dimmer waters. The species first
may have developed a reflective layer in the back of the suckers,
and then, over time, light-emitting cells replaced the sucker
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to use in mating, the octopus' light-emitting
suckers may function in food gathering, attracting tiny crustaceans
the way moths gather around a bug light.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blue light from an octopus is one addition to nature's palette.
Here's another: fluorescent green silk from a silkworm.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the color is the work of Japanese
scientists, who have re-engineered a silkworm gene responsible for
producing a fibroin, a protein that is a major component of silk.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described their work in the current issue
of the journal Genes and Development, altered the fibroin gene by
inserting a jellyfish gene that produces a fluorescent green
protein. To get the altered gene back into silkworms, the
scientists used an insect virus as a carrier, swapping out a gene
in the virus with the modified gene.
</P>
<P>
   Female moths were then infected with the virus, mated with
males, and the resulting larvae _ the silkworms _ contained the
altered genes, producing silk that glows green when exposed to
ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   While fluorescent green silk suits are unlikely to appear on the
racks anytime soon, the technique could be used with other kinds of
insects, and other genes, to custom-produce various proteins useful
in industry. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long debated the moon's beginnings, whether it
was created when a planet-sized object smashed into the earth eons
ago or had an independent origin.
</P>
<P>
   New data from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Lunar Prospector spacecraft support the idea that
the moon is in fact a chip off the old block. Measuring slight
fluctuations in the spacecraft's low lunar orbit (an indication of
gravitational variations), scientists have confirmed that the moon
has a relatively small core, with a radius of 140 to 280 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Such a core makes up 4 percent or less of the moon's total mass.
By contrast, the earth's iron core is about 30 percent of the
planet's mass.
</P>
<P>
   In the collision theory of the moon's formation, the impact
occurred after the earth's core was formed, and only iron-poor
material closer to the surface was ejected into orbit. This
material, coalescing into the moon, would create an object with a
small core.
</P>
<P>
   If, as another theory holds, the moon was formed independently
from the same swirling dust and debris that created the earth, its
core should roughly match the earth in proportion of total mass.

IRVING BERLIN HAD LUCK AND PLUCK AND A FEEL FOR AMERICA

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IRVING BERLIN 
American Troubador 
By Edward Jablonski 
Holt, 406 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Irving Berlin'' is a smooth, lyrical take on a fascinating
subject. It will be enjoyed by anyone curious about the Golden Age
of American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The book is not only about the genius of Berlin, one of the
world's best-known and best-loved composers. It's something of a
survey of the glittering landscape of popular culture before TV and
before rock 'n' roll _ before the latter became popular music. The
sun king at the center of what was a hit parade of stage, movie,
and radio musicals that supplied that culture was a very real,
palpable, pragmatic Russian-Jewish refugee. And his own biography _
a near-incredible rags-to-riches story _ is only incidental to the
accounting of what he gave (back) to his adopted country: a heart
and soul that it desperately needed and was searching for without
necessarily knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   His ``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' celebrated
America's principal Christian holidays; his ``God Bless America,''
a virtual national anthem, sanctified the country itself. ``There's
No Business Like Show Business'' was an anthem to the world where
he made his living.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are just the tips of the Irving Berlin iceberg. Shrewd
as he was, he couldn't have succeeded by his own design; he gave
luck as well as pluck a plug. As a Russian-born immigrant
13-year-old, he fled his large family's Lower East Side tenement to
survive. He became a ``Bowery bard,'' a busker performing in
saloons for money. He inhaled popular American tastes. He was a
quick study who grew up fast, knew who and what he was and, with
rare exceptions, didn't forget to keep his eye on the sparrow.
Rarely was he diverted from his songwriting skill _ he insisted on
calling himself a ``songwriter,'' not a composer or lyricist,
though he qualified as all those things. He ``unconsciously,'' the
author writes, created art.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Kern said that Berlin had no place in American music _ he
was American music. Kern wrote: ``Both the typical Yankee and a
Berlin tune had humor, originality, pace and popularity; both were
wide awake, and both, sometimes, a little loud _ but what might
unsympathetically be mistaken for brass was really gold.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not universally beloved. His future father-in-law, an
anti-Semite, couldn't bring himself to speak his name. Songwriter
Harry Warren, no admirer, is supposed to have said in 1944, after
an American attack on the German capital, ``They bombed the wrong
Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   The eminently readable Jablonski, who knew Berlin personally, is
the author of innumerable books on American musical theater,
including biographies of George Gershwin, Alan Jay Lerner, and
Harold Arlen. He has a way with backstage stories and insider's
knowledge. Stephen Foster's music in the public domain was the
music most often played on radio's popular ``Your Hit Parade'' back
when a bitter, far-reaching licensing dispute kept most
contemporary music off the air. An infectious song Berlin wrote for
a Judy Garland solo in the movie musical ``Easter Parade'' was cut
from the movie because ``the song stopped the show.'' When a
jealous friend remarked that ``Annie Get Your Gun'' _ the musical
for which Berlin wrote what many have said was his best score _ was
``old-fashioned,'' Berlin answered, ``Yeah. A good old-fashioned
smash.'' The eminent New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson had a
``tin ear'' for music, Berlin said, adding: ``Aren't we lucky that
the critics only write about the music and don't try to write it
themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, who wrote some 1,500 songs, could play piano in only one
key and never learned to read music or transcribe it. George
Gershwin called him ``America's Franz Schubert'' because of his
prolific inclinations toward both genius and schmaltz. He was an
original who spoke and sang in the American idiom, making him a
fortune. And irreplaceable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ One cannot help imagining the younger members
of the Coolidge family whining, of a boring rainy afternoon, ``Oh,
no, Uncle Hal! Not the expedition movies again!''
</P>
<P>
   But that antiquated footage that Harold Jefferson Coolidge so
liked to show _ those long lines of porters heading into the
African bush, those splayed remains of dissected monkeys, those
tippy canoes heading down the Mekong _ is quite a piquant piece of
history now, sort of a gorilla skeleton in the closet of the global
conservation movement.
</P>
<P>
   When the films were made in the 1920s and 30s, their hero, Hal
Coolidge, was a young naturalist of the Great White Hunter school.
A Boston Brahmin and descendant of Thomas Jefferson, he developed
what struck his peers as a peculiar penchant for exotic apes and
embarked on a series of expeditions that, in old-school style,
involved not only observing but killing a fair number of them for
further study.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, though, Coolidge evolved into a major force behind
preserving the kind of rare species he had once shot. He went on to
help found and lead the World Wildlife Fund and a precursor of the
World Conservation Union, and helped advance knowledge about
various species. He worked particularly on the gorilla and the
pygmy chimpanzee, better known as the bonobo, one of man's closest
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the expedition films, which are being crafted into a
57-minute documentary titled ``The Coolidge Chronicles'' by
Interlock Media Inc., a nonprofit filmmaking company in Cambridge
that focuses on the environment and human rights, captured him
before that transformation, on the journeys that helped prompt the
change in his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And those exotic times and places give the footage its spice
now: Coolidge, with his rifle and benevolent paternalism toward
locals and his eagerness to bag specimens, looks as primitive today
as the half-clothed ``natives'' of far-off climes looked to him
more than a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth of the conservation movement is fascinating but it's
not politically correct,'' said Jonathan Schwartz, the project's
director.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Coolidge's career, science seemed ``a race to see how
many species you could collect in the field,'' Schwartz said,
whereas primatologists today ``classify their species by finding a
piece of fingernail or hair on a tree and running back to the lab
for DNA analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``They don't necessarily fault the Coolidges
and Rockefellers who led these expeditions, because they base so
much of their work today on the taxonomy of these early
explorers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge participated in three major expeditions: the Harvard
Medical Expedition of 1927, which took him through Liberia and the
Belgian Congo and during which he bagged a large gorilla for a
Harvard museum; the Kelley-Roosevelt Expedition to Asia in 1928 and
1929, which explored part of the Mekong River and its tributaries,
and on which he was joined by Theodore Roosevelt Jr.; and the Asian
Primatology Expedition of 1937, which Coolidge led through
northwest Tonkin and northern Laos, and which greatly advanced the
understanding of gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers noted that Donna Haraway, a science historian,
described Coolidge's second Asian expedition in her book ``Primate
Visions'' as ``one of the last 19th-century-style colonial
collecting ventures and the first of the new primate behavior field
trips conducted in the frame of the incipient international
conservation politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's journals document quite a bit of intra-expedition
tension, Schwartz said, between those who wanted to study creatures
alive and those who wanted them dead.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Feeley, the project's research coordinator, said that on
the Asian Primatology Expedition, a field biologist and an animal
behaviorist ended up clashing over gibbons they were studying
because the field biologists wanted, naturally, to study them in
the field, while the behaviorist wanted eventually to study them
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the irony is because of the times,'' Feeley said.
``Behaviorists would study a group of gibbons for two to three
weeks and then have them shot for taxonomic purposes. So Coolidge's
career was really at a transitional point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 1930s were a time of mounting soul-searching among
scientists who ``collected'' rare specimens in the wild. In a 1984
interview with Earthwatch, Coolidge recalled that ``in the 1930s,
scientists in England interested in saving threatened species were
nicknamed `the Society of Repentant Butchers' because they were big
African game hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   The clearest evidence of Coolidge's turning point is a letter he
wrote to a colleague in 1939, noting that it did not seem necessary
to ``procure so many specimens'' (read: kill so many monkeys) in
order to classify a race of primates.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents turned up in collections from Harvard, the State
University of New York and family members as Schwartz and the
Interlock staff engaged in what seems like a great attic-cleaning
for an impressive and eccentric uncle with a house adorned by
elephants tusks and stuffed game.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more attic-like flotsam and jetsam of the collection
are expedition satchels containing timeworn tools Coolidge used,
like the calipers for measuring monkey skulls, and his scrawled
journal pages, with lines like, ``while this is a well-known route,
one really feels that he is in the interior where very few whites
have ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The film footage ranges from National Geographic-like shots of
partly clad African women to views of lesions on Africans' legs, to
many campsite shots, including an eerie, smoky series of scenes in
Indochina during a nearby forest fire. And there are many monkeys
throughout _ monkeys calling like banshees to each other in the
wild, monkeys dead and dissected.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent scenes of swarming porters also demonstrate what
tremendous logistical feats such expeditions were, involving dozens
of people and tons of material transported without the help of
motorized vehicles over hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers had about 14 hours of historical film from
Coolidge's expeditions _ much of it saved just in time from
deterioration _ along with nearly 1,000 photos and volumes of
journals and documents. The filmmakers expect to complete most of
their work and begin public screenings by late spring, and plan for
``The Coolidge Chronicles'' to air not only on American and
European television but in the countries where the expeditions took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge died in 1985 at age 81. He had by then become a senior
statesman in the global conservation movement, and left his mark in
a variety of ways, from the younger generations of Coolidges he
inspired to the center for environmental leadership he founded here
in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, viewers of his chronicles are likely to come
away with one main impression: that back in the old Tarzan days,
before everyone knew that being a Great White Hunter was wrong, it
sure was a whole lot of fun.

``The battle lines for local competition are being drawn as cable
companies step in as alternative providers of phone services and
Internet access,'' said Alan Lyons, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``Cable
companies have decided bigger is better.'' Cable-TV companies are

   MEDIAONE-Comcast, the fourth-largest cable company, buys
MediaOne Group, the No. 3 cable operator, for $48.7 billion in
stock, to create a cable network with 11 million customers. The
acquisition will create one of the largest broadband networks,
which allow several channels, such as television and Internet
access, to be transmitted on the same cable wire. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 24.
</P>
<P>
   w/MEDIAONE-SIDE _ The consolidation of cable companies makes
them much more formidable competitors to phone companies for
everything from local phone service to Internet access. What battle
lines will be drawn by this merger between Comcast and BellSouth?
``The battle lines for local competition are being drawn as cable
companies step in as alternative providers of phone services and
Internet access,'' said Alan Lyons, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``Cable
companies have decided bigger is better.'' Cable-TV companies are
seeking to expand their service areas so the costs of marketing and
new technology can be spread over bigger customer groups.

   COKE-BOTTLE _ In 1899, two Chattanooga, Tenn., attorneys
traveled to Atlanta and paid Coca-Cola Co. $1 for the rights to
bottle and distribute Coca-Cola to most of the U.S., establishing
the company's first bottling operation. On Wednesday, the company
celebrates its 100th year. We'll take the opportunity to look at
how Coca-Cola's bottling operations have grown, and consolidated
through the years, the strategy behind the changes and what lies a
head for the company's U.S. bottling operations. (Unger, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 52.

   DELTA-ASA _ Delta says its tender offer for ASA was successful,
giving it 91 percent ownership of the regional affiliate. ASA still

   HOMEDEPOT-OVERSEAS _ Home Depot Inc. named Anders Moberg,
president of Sweden's Ikea Group, to be its group president for
international operations, as the retailer plans further overseas
expansion. Moberg, 49, joins Home Depot after serving 13 years as
president of Ikea. He will begin on Sept. 1, reporting to President
and Chief Executive Arthur Blank. Moberg is credited with expanding
Ikea's business throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,
including a network of retail stores, catalogs and manufacturing
facilities, Home Depot said. This could help Home Depot to expand
internationally. (Bond, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 10.

   COXNET PTECH - The cell phone, which turns 15 this year, has
displaced lots of calls that once were made on desk phones. Many
pay phones are unoccupied in busy passageways such as those in
airports. No need to scramble for coins or stand in lines, because
so many people are carrying their own phones. Welcome to the
wireless generation. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
Lead art includes magnificent 4-column illustration of numerous
cellular phones surrounding a brilliant-blue planet Earth with the
sun emerging on the horizon.

</P>

   NETWATCHER _ Downloading MP3 files, uploading MP3 files and

GHOST OF COLD FUSION REFUSED TO PLAY DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Tenn., Calif., N.H.)  (af) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann are still true believers,
as are other scientists and enthusiasts scattered around the globe
who still see a glimmer of hope. Even the federal government keeps
a few researchers investigating the topic, though inconspicuously.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago today, on March 23, 1989, Pons, then chairman of
the chemistry department at the University of Utah, and
Fleischmann, a top British chemist at the University of
Southampton, set the world of science on its head by announcing in
Salt Lake City that they had achieved nuclear fusion at room
temperature in a jar of water.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed, in effect, to have tamed the sun, unleashing its
might on earth without destructive side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Hailed in headlines as the greatest discovery since fire, cold
fusion was seen as promising to provide a safe, cheap and virtually
inexhaustible form of power, ending human dependence on oil and
redrawing the geopolitical map to make Salt Lake City the energy
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it was outrageously simple to do. The test
apparatus cost a pittance and centered on palladium rods in a jar
of heavy water, in which normal hydrogen is replaced by deuterium,
an isotope of hydrogen that is ubiquitous in sea water.
</P>
<P>
   The two said that an electric current passing through the test
cell produced excess heat. Somehow, they said, atoms of deuterium
were forced to fuse together, paving the way for a new age.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream soon faded. Skeptics rushed forward. And after a
few hectic months, cold fusion collapsed as most scientists were
unable to match the startling results. Heavy blows were landed by
such giants as the California Institute of Technology and a
22-member federal panel made up mainly of top university
scientists, which said the reported find was too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it found no credible evidence of bursts of
neutrons, which the Utah team had claimed as key proof of nuclear
alchemy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Close, a physicist with top positions at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in Tennessee and the Rutherford Laboratory in
Britain, went further. In ``Too Hot to Handle'' (Princeton, 1991),
he charged that crucial evidence in the original claim was so
skewed as to be ``invented,'' an allegation the two claimants
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, despite a decadelong cold bath of criticism, cold
fusion is still alive today and apparently doing well in the
scientific underground. Researchers around the globe quietly claim
success at getting tantalizing results, if not blistering heats
ready to topple the status quo. This hum of low-level work
confounds skeptics and delights believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as alive as it's always been,'' Fleischmann, 72, said in
a telephone interview from his home in Britain. Successful tests,
he added, continue to show that whatever is happening has to be
nuclear in nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be chemical,'' he said. ``The energy quantities are
too large, orders of magnitude larger.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fellow of the Royal Society, the top honorary group for
British scientists, Fleischmann painted a picture of conspiracy in
which cold fusion was killed politically by a cabal of oil- and
hot-fusion interests, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, scientists have spent billions of dollars to
mimic the sun's hot-fusion reactions on earth. But that research
has remained a scientific curiosity, and its practitioners were
quick to question cold fusion, which in theory was a potential
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had incredible disinformation,'' Fleischmann said in the
interview. He added that he himself was still exploring cold fusion
experimentally, but would not say where or with what success.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the pair, Pons, 56, left the University of
Utah in 1991 and now lives in France. Colleagues say he still backs
the claims but is bitter over their public denunciation. ``He
doesn't want to talk to the press,'' said Jean-Paul Biberian, a
physicist at the University of Grenoble who is in contact with
Pons.
</P>
<P>
   Biberian, who said he has studied cold fusion for six years, is
one of perhaps a few hundred scientists around the world who
investigate the phenomenon, publish articles and go to
international meetings.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Huizenga, co-chairman of the federal panel that found
cold fusion wanting, said the true believers were chasing a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as dead as ever,'' he said in an interview. ``It's quite
unbelievable that the thing has gone on for 10 years. But it's the
same group of people and they don't want to take no for an
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that some evidence was unquestionably faulty in
the early days, cold fusion advocates insist that the evidence has
improved in quality and quantity over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of unexplained heat is essentially
unquestioned,'' said Michael C.H. McKubre, a chemist at SRI
International, a private research group in Menlo Park, Calif., who
works in the field. ``There's a source of heat we can't explain
with known chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   McKubre added that scientists, including himself, had also made
progress in finding hints of nuclear reactions. When deuterium
atoms fuse, they produce not only neutrons but byproducts like
tritium and helium. Both of these, he said, have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the results are still frustratingly erratic, he
added, and hard proof will require more research.
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, the Navy's top
science center, last year published a review of cold-fusion
research that concluded that enough mysteries remained to warrant
more inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further experimental investigations of these and related
questions seem desirable, at least for scientific if not practical
reasons,'' wrote David J. Nagel, the report's author and head of
the laboratory's division of condensed matter and radiation
sciences. Last week, officials there said the laboratory was
currently doing no such research.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest public advocates of cold fusion is Dr. Eugene
F. Mallove, the editor and publisher of Infinite Energy, which is
based in Concord, N.H. The bimonthly magazine ($5.95 in the United
States, more elsewhere) tracks cold-fusion research and usually
prints 5,000 copies that are distributed in 37 countries, Mallove
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real,'' he said of cold fusion. ``For many years now,
it's been absolutely clear that there is nuclear-scale energy
that's emerging.''
</P>
<P>
   For $595, plus shipping, the magazine's parent company, Cold
Fusion Technology Inc., sells a ``Plasma-Discharge Electrolysis
Exploration System,'' complete with an X-ray shield in case the
emerging energy is so abundant as to be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Mallove said the field was destined to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, he said, commercial developments that are going
on right now will produce ``a revolution in energy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Huizenga, the federal skeptic, said business people sinking
money into the field were going to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well,'' he rued, ``that's the way it goes.''

AS JOHN JUSTIN HANGS BOOTS UP, AN ERA ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ John Justin Jr. was scarcely a teen-ager
when he let his ambitions be known.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930, soon after H.J. Justin &AMP; Sons moved its boot
company from Nocona to Fort Worth, and there was a party for
employees. Justin remembers his grandmother speaking to the group
when suddenly she stopped, looked down at him and without warning
asked, ``John Jr., what do you want to do when you grow up?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to run this company,'' the 13-year-old blurted out.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed; Justin did not. He was embarrassed by his
uncalculated eruption, but he was also deadly serious.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, at the age of 82, Justin will end his 49-year reign
over the Justin-named businesses when he steps down as chairman and
chief executive of Justin Industries, the company that sprang from
H.J. Justin &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 120 years, there will not be a Justin
running the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll still spend a lot of time here,'' he said, reflecting
on the change. ``But if I get up and don't feel like it, or have
something I'd rather do, then I'm going to do that. I won't be tied
down to the day-in, day-out routine.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision to step aside will end one of Fort Worth's most
influential business careers. Like his friends and peers Charles
Tandy and Amon Carter Jr., Justin blended business leadership with
civic responsibility. He served as mayor and has been a longtime
chairman of the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and
Rodeo, where an arena bears his name and a statue of him astride
his horse welcomes visitors to the Will Rogers Memorial Center.
</P>
<P>
   He guided his company through five decades of change in the
business world: the postwar boom of the '50s and '60s, the
inflation and high interest rates of the '70s, and the bull market
and global competition of the '80s and '90s. Over that time, he
oversaw expansion, through a merger with Acme Brick in 1968 and
other later acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues peaked in 1994 at $483 million, and despite mounting
competition, Justin steadfastly kept most of his boot manufacturing
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of only a handful of American CEOs to stay on the
job into his 80s. But in recent years, Justin has been challenged
both by physical problems and by the whimsy of modern-day Wall
Street, where fledgling Internet companies are the high fliers and
an old-line manufacturer of cowboy boots and bricks fails to
generate excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Industries' stock price has fallen 37 percent in the last
six years and profits have slipped during a time of strong economic
expansion in Texas and nationwide. Some Wall Street analysts are
calling for a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a company with brick plants, wonderful land and
everything,'' Justin said. ``We've got a great balance sheet and no
debt. But it's below book value. You start one of these high-tech
companies that hasn't made any money ever, and probably won't for
10 years, and the stock just goes through the roof. I don't
understand it, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Kelly, a friend and Justin Industries director, said: ``He
built a great company with a tradition of quality. The quality of
the Justin products means more to John than the price of the
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin plans to remain active at the company as chairman
emeritus, even after a new chief executive is named. It is, he
says, his heart and soul, his life's investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I've got that they can't replace is the
knowledge of this company,'' he said. ``I know where the bones are,
and they need that, and I'll be glad to give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Justin knows that he can no longer offer his
once-inexhaustible physical drive. Although he has beaten leukemia
into remission and overcome a painful hip replacement, his mobility
is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Within reach of his desk, an aluminum walker sits as a reminder
of his frailty. Justin has a neurological disorder, and the walker
is an indispensable tool that has been with him for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors have told him his disorder comes with age _ the
nerve endings are worn _ and he'll have to adjust to it. It is a
bitter diagnosis and one he said he has not fully accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for his decision to step aside. He said
he still can't quite see a parallel between his departure, and his
arrival 49 years ago. The company history recounts that tale:

CITY ACCUSES ELITE ARMY UNIT OF OFFERING `BRIBE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 and CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Army's elite Delta Force offered to donate
$20,000 to the favorite charity of a San Antonio city councilman in
order to win his support so anti-terrorist operations could be
conducted in his council district, several city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mario Salas declined the donation.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the offer, which was made in early 1998 before city
officials refused the unit's request to train in the city, surfaced
after the anti-terrorist team returned to San Antonio for a
mock-training exercise last month at Fort Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That operation was conducted without incident Feb. 18 at the
abandoned Brooke Army Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   City permission for that training wasn't needed since the entire
operation took place on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story in 1998, when the Delta Force planned
nighttime mock air and ground assaults using live ammunition over
vacant buildings on the east and west sides of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said the Delta Force members, meeting stiff resistance
from Mayor Howard Peak and Police Chief Al Philippus, offered to
donate $20,000 to a favorite charity in return for his support.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said he neither selected a charity nor supported the
training exercise. As a result, the military made no donation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peak took offense at the overture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bribe, that's what it is,'' the mayor said. ``That's
what it is, no matter who the money was given to.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Sokalski, a spokesman for the U.S. Special Operations
Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., where the Delta Force is based, would
neither confirm nor deny that an offer had been made to Salas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying they don't carry that kind of money,'' Sokalski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said he was asked to support the team's urban training
after Peak, Philippus and other local officials refused to approve
the training operation.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said officials from the Army's Special Operations Command
told him the service had made similar donations in other cities,
but didn't tell him where.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, the Delta Force didn't give up, however, after
Peak and Philippus said no. Instead, they met with private property
owners and discussed the $20,000 donation with Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Salas said he initially liked the idea of helping the
military and a local charity, he said he withdrew support for the
proposal after talking with Philippus, who feared that Delta Force
operatives might alarm or hurt residents in the area of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I didn't consider that angle,'' said Salas, who
now wonders whether the Delta Force should have offered to make the
donation. ``In retrospect, it does seem strange.''

UNDATED: recounts that tale: 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1950, the boot company was struggling. It needed new blood
and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Justin began the business in 1879 when he moved to Spanish
Fort from his home in Gainesville, just south of the Oklahoma
border. The business moved to nearby Nocona 10 years later, when
Spanish Fort dried up with the loss of the cattle drives.
</P>
<P>
   It was a family business, and when H.J. Justin died in 1918, his
sons _ including John Sr. _ took over.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. hoped to become part of that business but was blocked
by his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt the boot business was dying,'' Justin said. ``My
father sincerely thought I shouldn't get in it, and he did
everything he could to keep me out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1950, John Sr. changed his mind. His son had proved
himself in business by laboring late into the night producing
women's belts in the family garage. He and his partner, a
neighborhood friend named Charles Tandy, took turns pounding at
scraps of leather with a 16-pound mallet. While one hammered, the
other burned made-up cattle brands into the belts.
</P>
<P>
   Justin then found a sagging belt company to invest in and turned
it into a profitable concern. He also served a stint in the
Merchant Marine during World War II. Finally, his father and Uncle
Earl asked him to save Justin Boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing nothing to help the boot business,'' Justin
said. ``They were trying every way in the world to do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was making shoes, but Justin said they ``had no
styling or snap,'' and the business was losing $1.75 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr., over the objections of his father, quickly eliminated
the shoe business and turned his attention to boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of like Henry Ford,'' Justin said of the
company he took over. ``You could have any color boots you wanted
as long as they were black. I started to get some styling and some
snappier things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very limited on money,'' he recalled. ``I went out and
bought a yellow leather, about the worst-looking yellow you can
imagine. And a green that was just about as bad. And a red and
blue. I got a bargain on it and I began to put those in different
combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealers took interest. The boots weren't pretty, but they
were different, and different was unusual for Justin Boot Co.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investors say, Justin Industries needs to be different
again. It needs to catch the market's attention. This time it is
John Jr., and his board members, who must find a younger person to
lead the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get around like I used to,'' Justin said. ``I am
primarily an operations and a manufacturing man. I am a good
salesman, too. I used to be in a plant or two every week or riding
with a salesman or two. But I just can't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He will still have other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Justin serves on the boards of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas
and AMR Investment Services, and he has been chairman of the Stock
Show board since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tandy and Carter in earlier times, Justin gave time and
energy to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jane, his wife of 46 years, have worked tirelessly for
several Fort Worth organizations. He served as Fort Worth mayor
from 1961 to 1963 and is a trustee at Texas Christian University.
She is on the advisory boards of the Child Study Center, the
Lecture Foundation, the Jewel Charity Ball and the Van Cliburn
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin represents a unique link between Fort Worth's past and
present,'' Kelly said. ``He is one of the last of Fort Worth's
truly legendary figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin relishes an earlier era in business, when he and other
business owners would gather at night to talk about their trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would just talk about selling, how you sold,'' he said. ``I
would go in there and say, `Well, I've got some boots and I can't
sell them, what do I need to do?' We'd talk all night about it.
We'd watch the sun come up, go home, shower and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin is proud of the company he has built and confident in its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Howard Jennings, one of our old directors,'' Justin
said. ``I would be down there at the factory on a Saturday morning,
worrying about the business, and he would tell me, `Run the
business the way it ought to be and the price will take care of
itself.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've run it the way it ought to be. The balance sheet
is as strong as horseradish. We have good factories and we're
building new factories. In footwear, we're getting new things on
the market. It doesn't worry me. It's going to make money and make
good money. It will pay a nice dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll still need me to give my ideas, and I've agreed.
They'll haul me off one day, and then they can find somebody
else.''

FLEEING POVERTY AND ABUSE, CHILDREN ILLEGALLY IMMIGRATING IN RECORD
NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DIANE SMITH and MARISA TAYLOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mauricio worked for scraps of food, jumped aboard moving boxcars
and trekked alongside strangers for hundreds of miles through
Central America and Mexico with the hopes of slipping into the
United States and finding work.
</P>
<P>
   His puckish grin belies a seasoned pilgrim who, at 16, entered
this country illegally _ and alone. Mauricio's plan was to rent an
apartment with other immigrant teen-agers and find work in
construction so he could send money home to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can work at whatever job,'' he said in February, about a
month before an immigration judge ordered him returned to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Youths such as Mauricio are not unique. Record numbers of
immigrant children fleeing poverty and the devastation of Hurricane
Mitch are coming to this country without their parents. Most hope
to find work, send money home and build prosperous lives.
</P>
<P>
   The children typically are 15 to 17, though some are as young as
6. Most are boys. One Immigration and Naturalization Service agent,
who is working the case of an 11-year-old Honduran, describes these
children as ``little Huckleberry Finns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are seeking the same thing as the Pilgrims _ to better
their lives,'' said JJ Gross, the juvenile coordinator for the
Dallas district of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many of the children there may be in the United
States. But the number apprehended by immigration authorities has
increased sharply during the past five years, with last year's
totals the largest. The INS had 4,295 youths in its charge
nationwide last year, compared with 1,188 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 minors nationwide are currently under the care of INS,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, tens of thousands of other young immigrants
may be here undetected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way of telling how many kids slip through the
system,'' said Barbara Francis, an INS spokeswoman in Washington,
D.C. ``How many have we missed?''
</P>
<P>
   The INS Dallas district has seen a steady flow of young
Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans who have fled Central
America without their parents in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. The
storm killed at least 9,000 people and displaced more than 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about survival,'' said Lynda Barros, director of legal
services for the agency Proyecto Adelante/Project Onward. ``When
your family is starving, immigration law is not going to be a
barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and child abuse are among the reasons that the children
leave their homelands, child and immigration advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the arrival of these unaccompanied minors is a
testament to the depth of misery they have reached in their
homelands,'' said Paul Zoltan, a Dallas immigration attorney.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrive in the United States, the young people often
take on some of the most laborious jobs. They are working in onion
fields in the Rio Grande Valley and as busboys in Houston, cleaning
offices in Dallas and landscaping in Tarrant County. And they have
their own understanding of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``El pobre de aqui es millionario al pobre de alla (The poor man
from the United States is a millionaire next to the poor man from
there),'' said Duwin, a good-natured 17-year-old with a smile that
softened a face already rugged. Duwin was born in El Salvador but
was living in Guatemala when he decided to try his luck in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Duwin walked, hitchhiked and rode in boxcars through Mexico. On
Christmas Day, to earn money for the last leg of his trip to the
United States, Duwin was carrying wood in northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came suffering _ sometimes without eating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Duwin could find work in Texas, the INS found him _ a
person he hitched a ride from turned him in, he said. In early
February, Barros was providing Duwin, Mauricio and at least four
other teen-agers with immigration counseling. Barros said she was
almost certain that Duwin would have to return to Guatemala. He
didn't stick around to find out. In March, he ran away from his
foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Santos, 13, has made the trip from El Salvador more than once.
The last time, he traveled through Mexico by train to the U.S.
border. After the INS found him, he was placed at the Casa Shelter
in Dallas, where the INS contracts beds for children. Santos chose
to return home last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the shelter was Nelson, 16, a confident youth who sports
a crown with a star outline on a front tooth. He left his Honduran
home in November. In Rio Claro, the village where Nelson lived, the
African palms that help fuel the regional economy were destroyed by
the hurricane, rushing water destroyed houses and cattle drowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't continue studying,'' said Nelson, who was in the
eighth grade before he left. ``Where I lived, there were few trees
left standing. It was horrible. I made the decision because I
wanted to work and help my family.''
</P>
<P>
   After working his way through Mexico as a field and ranch hand,
Nelson crossed into the United States via Piedras Negras. When he
was wandering near Carrizo Springs in Dimmit County, he emerged
from the brush to look for food and water, only to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sad,'' he said, adding that he had planned to work here
two years and return home. On March 13, Nelson went back to
Honduras after being granted voluntary return by an immigration
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Others in his village understand why he left.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We are a poor city with few resources, we don't have jobs,
factories or industries. People are living in houses with dirt
floors. Mothers, fathers and children eat only tortillas with
salt,'' said Marco Antonio Pavon, mayor of nearby Trujillo, which
has jurisdiction over the village. ``The hurricane was just another
obstacle for a town with problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to leave,'' he said. ``This is a tragic
situation. I tell people not to leave _ it's a great risk. Women
get assaulted, minors abused. It is a tremendous problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children who come to the United States without their
parents are from vulnerable families, Zoltan said. Many come from
broken homes and were abandoned, abused or neglected. Some were
living on the streets of San Salvador, El Salvador, Guatemala City,
Guatemala, or Tegucigalpa, Honduras, before they joined this
country's homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel, 14, said his mother had a one-word response to his plans
to leave Honduras: ``Andate (Go).''
</P>
<P>
   ``My family doesn't want me,'' he said. ``I left. I was not
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Elmer, also 14, walked away from his family and homeland in
search of money and a better life.
</P>
<P>
   At Ciudad Acu$a, the Mexican town across from Del Rio, he
plunged into the Rio Grande and swam to his promised land without
looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's dangerous,'' said Elmer, a somber, curly-haired
boy. He said he was tired of being poor and he felt neglected by
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aunt, she treated me bad. That's why I left,'' Elmer said.
``It's better to die along the way than to have stayed in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Onward, in conjunction with the INS, is trying to find a
foster family for Elmer while the immigration process takes its
course.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Central American children are smuggled into the
United States, INS officials said. Parents sometimes pay a smuggler
_ known as a coyote in Mexico and Central America _ to bring a
child into this country so they can get jobs and send money home.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccompanied children are sometimes smuggled in groups to work
as field hands, said Jeffrey Newman, president and executive
director of the nonprofit National Child Labor Committee in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children have been abused or assaulted along the
way. One child, who was later found by the INS, had his shoes
stolen in the Mexican state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border.
In some cases, the children arrive with sexually transmitted
diseases, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the children may believe that they have nothing to lose,
said Daniel Alvarez, 32, a waiter from Dallas who recalled how he
came into this country from El Salvador as a teen-ager in 1983.
Alvarez said he lived underground until he became a legal resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could get assaulted and robbed along the way _ and
I don't know what else. It was worth the risk. We had nothing to
lose. If you lost your life, that was already a fear we lived with
every day in El Salvador,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children find work with employers who exploit them.
Other employers unknowingly hire children because the youths have
counterfeit immigration documents and it is difficult to tell how
old they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come up to you and they show a Social Security number and
they say they are 18 and you have to believe them,'' the owner of a
local landscaping company said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, it is difficult to gauge where the
children work and how many are exploited. Federal and state
agencies that enforce child labor laws do not track whether child
workers are undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Child Labor Committee in New York,
which has done studies on the issue, as many as 120,000
undocumented children are believed to be working in unsafe or
illegal situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more hidden, they are more secret, they are more
vulnerable,'' the agency's Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some children don't find work, and they may be more prone to
criminal activity, other officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they find out the streets are not really paved in gold,''
Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS was required to change how it handles young immigrants
because of a 1997 court settlement. The agreement prompted the
agency to set up a system that places the children in foster care
or shelters while they work out immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   For a month and a half, Margarita Alvarez opened her Garland
home to Duwin and Josue, 16, a Salvadoran.
</P>
<P>
   ``They joked with me,'' she said. ``They would ask the questions
little curious youths like to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt happy because I imagined they were my children. The
same thing I wanted for my kids, I want for all kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But the teen-agers became scared about the possibility of being
deported and they ran away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are carrying my motherly prayers. They came looking for
bread, not something bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some children may end up in juvenile detention centers, some
human rights activists say. When there is no staff that speaks a
young immigrant's language, a youth can go for days or weeks
without communicating, said Jo Becker, advocacy director for the
children's rights division at Human Rights Watch in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   When children choose to return home, the INS pays for the
airfare and accompanies them. Other young people wait to go through
immigration proceedings. Those who are abandoned, neglected, abused
or orphaned can apply for a special immigration status that might
allow them to stay. But many others will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   After Mauricio was caught shortly after crossing the border, he
was transferred to Casa Shelter, where he shared a room with three
others in INS custody. He hung posters of movies such as ``The
Truman Show'' and ``Small Soldiers.'' The drawer under his bed was
filled with toy cars and action figures he was saving for his
younger brother and nephews. One of his favorite toys is a Michael
Jordan figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I suffered along the way, and they caught me here,''
Mauricio said as he shook his head and bit his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, Mauricio was deported to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he will leave his mother again to come here. He
and other children have no alternative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come again _ until they get tired of getting us,'' he
said.
</P>

CARTOON-STAR DUO: TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Parental concerns about the messages small children
receive in G-rated animated feature films have resulted in a review
showing that two-thirds of such movies produced over the last 60
years include the use of tobacco and alcohol by villains and heroes
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Adam O. Goldstein and his colleagues at the University of
North Carolina School of Medicine screened 50 animated feature
films by five major production companies, beginning with ``Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' released in 1937, in which only a
poisoned apple was consumed. They found that 34 films had at least
one scene in which tobacco or alcohol was used and that the
depictions did not decrease over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released in New York at a one-day briefing on the
media's impact on health behaviors and appears in the upcoming
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association .
</P>
<P>
   In the journal, the researchers write of the films:
``Twenty-eight (56 percent) portrayed one or more incidences of
tobacco use, including all seven films released in 1996 and 1997.
None of the films studied suggested any long-term health
consequences of tobacco or alcohol addiction or any verbal messages
about negative health consequences of usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who earlier investigated the effects of the Joe Camel
advertising campaign on young children, began the study after
watching ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' with his children. In the film,
Charlie, a good character, is run over after drinking with his
buddies. But when he is given a second chance at life, he orders
another beer, Goldstein realized.
</P>
<P>
   Once he turned his researcher's eye to the films and videos seen
by millions of children, Goldstein found that characters using
tobacco or alcohol were almost equally divided between good and
bad. Cigar-smoking Pinocchio and wine-drinking Dumbo, for example,
were good; Captain Hook and the amusement park manager from ``Space
Jam,'' both of whom puffed on cigars, were bad, as was Cruella De
Vil, a smoker, from ``101 Dalmatians.'' Three smoking characters in
``Alice in Wonderland'' _ the dodo, with a pipe; the walrus, with a
cigar, and the caterpillar, with a hookah _ were considered
neutral. Goldstein noted that animals or objects were often
portrayed as smoking or drinking to make them seem more human.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such portrayals lead to alcohol or tobacco use was not
explored in the study. ``We don't know what the effect of exposure
is, but the question is why is there exposure,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey L. Brown, a Westchester pediatrician, said, ``I
think it would be hard to prove a cause-and-effect relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Johnson, a social psychologist with the National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
said the study is important because it shows the range of exposure
to positive messages about substance use. ``On its own, it's not
very dramatic,'' he said, ``but added with other exposures like
parents smoking cigarettes or having drinks every evening or guys
on the corner drinking a can of beer, and there's a cumulative
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are not asking that childhood favorites be
banned from theaters or pulled off video shelves for re-editing,
but Goldstein suggested that parents watch the films with their
children and discuss the characters' behavior afterward.

WHO'LL SEQUENCE HUMAN GENOME FIRST? IT'S UP TO PHRED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash.)  (af) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week the public consortium working to sequence the human
genome said it would complete a ``first draft'' of the human DNA
sequence next spring, well ahead of the target date announced by
its commercial rival the Celera Corp. Each side has committed $250
million to the project, but the outcome of this battle of titans
seems to lie to some extent in the hands of an esoteric computer
program named phred.
</P>
<P>
   Phred's significance has to do with the new model of DNA
sequencing machine, called the ABI 3700 sequencer, on which both
teams, but particularly Celera, are resting their ambitious
timetables. The ABI 3700, like its predecessor the ABI 377,
determines the order of bases in the fragments of DNA fed into it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sequencing machines depend on phred, a program that checks
accuracy, but no version of phred is yet available for the 3700,
which could prevent the machine from being fully effective for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the ABI 3700 by Applied Biosystems Inc., now a
division of Perkin Elmer, was the spur that led to the formation of
Celera, also a Perkin Elmer subsidiary. Michael W. Hunkapiller, a
co-inventor of Applied Biosystems' sequencing machines, and J.
Craig Venter, a genome sequencing pioneer, calculated that with a
fleet of 240 of the new 3700 machines, they could sequence the
genome's three billion letters by December 2001, handily beating
the public consortium's target of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium _ which consists principally of eight
university centers finance by the National Institutes of Health and
the Sanger Centre in England backed by the Wellcome Trust of London
_ has responded to Celera's challenge by increasing its sequencing
efforts and ordering its own 3700s.
</P>
<P>
   These are expensive devices, costing $300,000 apiece. Besides
Celera's 240 sequencers, the NIH is negotiating for 200 machines,
and the Sanger Center 50. Whichever team wins the race, Hunkapiller
would seem to have already scored another kind of victory in
booking some $150 million of orders.
</P>
<P>
   Testing out the 3700, however, scientists at the Sanger Center
complained in an article in Science last week that the sequencer's
``read length'' _ the average number of bases in each fragment of
sequenced DNA _ was only 465 bases, compared with 655 bases for the
older 377 sequencer, which costs half as much.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter read length means more work for the people and
computers that assemble the complete sequence. ``There is no gain
in throughput in terms of capital investment,'' the Sanger
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   But a reason for the short read length, Hunkapiller said, is
that the Sanger Center was using a computer program calibrated for
the older, 377 machine. The program, known as phred, was written by
Dr. Philip Green of the University of Washington, Seattle. It
assigns quality values to the base identifications deduced by the
sequencing machine and cuts off the read if the quality falls.
Phred is important for preparing highly accurate sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Green, whose university operates one of the centers in the
public consortium, has not yet prepared a version of phred that is
calibrated for the ABI 3700. He is at present adapting phred to the
MegaBACE, a rival sequencing machine made by Molecular Dynamics,
now owned by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the Celera camp believe Green is delaying the 3700
version of phred in order to delay Celera. Green denied that,
saying the problem was that he does not have enough sequence data
from the 3700 to adapt Phred. Also, he said, Applied Biosystems had
not made available a machine for him, as Molecular Dynamics had
done.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that he ``may have enough data by the end of the
summer'' to update phred for the ABI 3700. Given the fast
timetables announced by the two consortia, late delivery of phred
could be an impediment, especially for Celera, which is relying
solely on the 3700.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will certainly delay the public side,'' Venter said, but he
added that Celera had contracted for the development of a new
quality-score program after learning that Green could not supply an
updated version of phred.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are pretty poisons. Sweet, pretty with their
yellow-green glow and all around us, as common as cars, in homes
and garages everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, at least 6,000 Americans, by design or accident, fall
victim to poisonings with ethylene glycol, a main ingredient in
automotive antifreeze and other products. Unless immediately
treated, consumption of this chemical can lead to permanent
disability or death.
</P>
<P>
   Most ethylene glycol poisonings in adults result from suicide
attempts, experts say, while other cases arise from alcoholics'
drinking antifreeze to get high or from accidental ingestions. But
because antifreeze is sweet to the taste, and colored with bright
fluorescent dyes to help mechanics spot leaks, it is also
attractive to children.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the complicated and sometimes tricky treatment of
poisonings with ethylene glycol could be radically changed with the
recent introduction of a new antidote drug that appears to be
highly effective, but is too expensive for some hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first new antidote to a human toxin to be produced
in years, and we are glad to have it,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Brent, a
physician-researcher who led a major human trial with the drug.
``The only downside to the drug is cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug is fomepizole, also known as 4-methylpyrazole, sold
under the brand name Antizol by Orphan Medical Inc., of Minnetonka,
Minn. Antizol, which is diluted and given intravenously, costs
$1,000 per dose and is sold in four-dose units, enough for the
typical treatment of one patient.
</P>
<P>
   John Bullion, the head of Orphan Medical, said Antizol was the
first income-producing drug for his small, five-year-old company,
which develops limited-use medicines for rare conditions that are
not profitable enough for large pharmaceutical companies to work
on. Such medicines are referred to as ``orphan drugs,'' which the
federal government encourages companies to develop by sponsoring
some initial research and granting special patent privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that price is an issue, but there was a lot of expense
and risk in developing this drug,'' Bullion said. ``The price we
chose was one to provide an attractive return to shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullion said Antizol was being investigated for wider use, such
as being approved for pediatric use and for treating poisonings
with another type of alcohol, methanol. Developing more uses for
the drug is a factor that could lead the company to re-evaluate its
pricing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Zane Horwitz, medical director for the Oregon Poison Center
in Portland, said a survey of 75 hospitals in the area served by
his regional center, which includes Oregon and half of Nevada,
showed that only 10 percent stocked fomepizole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the drug but it is primarily a cost issue,'' Horwitz
said, ``Every hospital in America would buy it if it were priced
more reasonably. The company could make money on volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Jacobitz, managing director of The Poison Center at
Children's Hospital in Omaha, Neb., the regional poison base for
Nebraska and Wyoming, said many smaller hospitals, particularly in
rural areas and remote towns, had not bought the drug, even though
the center recommended stocking it. ``It's fairly expensive and we
are not aware of many who have ordered it,'' she said. ``Most are
still relying on the traditional treatments, even though they are
not as good and have their drawbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, the Food and Drug Administration approved
fomepizole for treating ethylene glycol poisoning, based in large
part on a multicenter clinical trial coordinated by Brent and
colleagues with Toxicology Associates, a private treatment and
research group in Denver. Results of the study were published last
week in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for emergency rooms to see cases of people
who drink toxic alcohols, mainly ethylene glycol and methanol,
commonly found in windshield washing solutions and some solvents.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers,
there were 6,174 ethylene glycol poisoning exposures in 1997, the
latest year data were reported from 66 of its 73 member centers
nationwide. Of these exposures, 988 were in children under 6.
During this period, 2,488 cases of methanol poisoning were also
reported, 652 of them in children under 6.
</P>
<P>
   These toxic alcohols become poisonous to the body when they are
metabolized, or broken down into other chemicals, by an enzyme
produced by the liver and stomach called alcohol dehydrogenase. The
toxic metabolites cause acidosis, a rise in the acidity of body
fluids, produce crystals that damage organs and other tissue,
attack the nervous system and cause kidney failure. Left untreated,
a lethal dose of these toxic alcohols can cause death by
multi-organ failure within 24 to 36 hours, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Although not officially approved, for years the standard
treatment for this kind of poisoning has included intravenous or
oral administration of another alcohol, ethanol, the kind found in
vodka, whisky and other liquor. Ethanol binds with alcohol
dehydrogenase more readily than other alcohols and by giving it in
large, intoxicating doses, the ethanol uses up the enzyme to keep
it from breaking down the ethylene glycol into its many poisons.
This treatment is often accompanied by intravenous sodium
bicarbonate to lower acidity levels in the body and kidney dialysis
to remove both the toxic alcohol and its poison metabolites.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Brent and his colleagues found that in 19 cases of
ethylene glycol poisoning, Antizol inhibited the alcohol
dehydrogenase enzyme with none of the disadvantages of ethanol,
including intoxication, depression of the central nervous system,
low blood sugar and difficulty maintaining effective ethanol levels
in the blood. Although the design of the study called for all
patients with high ethylene glycol levels to undergo dialysis, the
researchers said similar patients who did not have acidosis
probably would not require dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a cost savings with the drug that helps offset
its price,'' Brent said. ``If patients aren't too sick, you may
save hospital costs by not having to put them in intensive care, as
you do now with ethanol treatment, and you may be able to avoid
dialysis with a lot of them.''

LIVING WITH LOSS THAT IS UNRESOLVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jenny and Ed had enjoyed 15 years of an emotionally and
intellectually fulfilling marriage when Ed suffered a stroke and
Jenny's whole life suddenly screeched to a halt. Instead of
gradually recovering, over the next five years Ed got progressively
worse. The stroke had unmasked or hastened the onset of Alzheimer's
disease, and Jenny became his permanent de facto caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, she said, was the ``very sweet, loving, gentle, kind human
being'' who had shared her interest in art, music, travel and
stimulating conversation. Gone was her protector. When she
collapsed one day with blood clots that had lodged in her lungs, he
said, ``What are you doing on the floor?'' and then stepped over
her to attend to his own needs. Gone was the husband she knew and
loved, a husband who now doesn't even notice her presence or
absence.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, Jenny's life has been more or less
frozen in time. ``I can't mourn him, he's not dead, but neither is
he really there,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny, who insisted that her full name not be used, is suffering
from what Dr. Pauline Boss calls an ambiguous loss, a loss that has
left her with unresolved grief mixed with a hefty dose of guilt and
anger. In the book ``Ambiguous Loss: Learning to Live With
Unresolved Grief,'' to be published in May by Harvard University
Press, Dr. Boss, a professor of family social science at the
University of Minnesota, describes this all-too-common phenomenon
as resulting from either of two circumstances: when the lost person
is still physically present but emotionally absent or when the lost
person is physically absent but still emotionally present.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to senility, physical presence but psychological
absence may result, for example, when a person is suffering from a
serious mental disorder like schizophrenia or depression or
debilitating neurological damage from an accident or severe stroke,
when a person abuses drugs or alcohol, when a child is autistic or
when a spouse is a workaholic who is not really ``there'' even when
he or she is home.
</P>
<P>
   As Dr. Lyman Wynne, professor emeritus of psychiatry at the
University of Rochester Medical School, put it, ``People are caught
in a dilemma between experiencing their situation as a genuine loss
and trying to relate to a person who doesn't respond in a normal
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases of physical absence with continuing psychological presence
typically occur when a soldier is missing in action, when a child
disappears and is not found, when a former lover or spouse is still
very much missed, when a child ``loses'' a parent to divorce or
when people are separated from their loved ones by immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the ambiguously lost person is physically or
psychologically absent, Dr. Boss' research has shown, it is often
very difficult for people to resolve their grief and get on with
their lives. ``People and families become frozen, their lives grind
to a near-halt, because they cannot properly mourn someone who is
not completely gone,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jan Goldman, a clinical psychologist practicing in
Jenkinstown, Pa., says this kind of loss ``can occur in almost any
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't escape it,'' Dr. Goldman said. ``It's a life
condition.'' She applauded Dr. Boss' concept of ambiguous loss
because, she said, ``It normalizes what people often look at as
pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other professionals familiar with Dr. Boss' work
emphasized that people suffering from ambiguous loss were not
mentally ill, but were just stuck and needed help getting past the
barrier of unresolved grief so that they could get on with their
lives. Often, they are helped just by knowing there is a name for
their problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting the problem in a framework is often very
therapeutic,'' said Dr. Evan Imber-Black, a therapist at the
Ackerman Family Therapy Institute in New York and author of ``The
Secret Life of Families'' (Bantam, $24.95). ``It helps people to
realize it's an experience that's shared with others.'' Also
helpful, she said, is being able to talk about ambiguous losses
with others in the family. ``Too often the subject becomes taboo
and feelings go underground, where they are much harder to deal
with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Rolland, a psychiatrist and codirector of the Center
for Family Health at the University of Chicago, said Dr. Boss' work
has drawn attention to a critical and underserved area of family
care. He added that ``families can get into unbelievable
conflicts'' over ambiguous losses, with different family members
holding very different views of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment of `death' may not happen at the same time for
every member of the family,'' Rolland said. ``One person may be
holding out hope for recovery while another is feeling `he's died
for me.'''

</P>
<P>
   Mourning an ambiguous loss does not mean that memories die,
Imber-Black said. ``People can honor their memories of what used to
be, but they must move on into the present and not remain locked in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Viorst, author of ``Necessary Losses'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$14), tells of a woman who ``had lost her father to Alzheimer's
disease more powerfully than to death.'' Not until the father died
could his daughter wipe out the ``obliterating presence of the
Alzheimer father and mourn the wonderful, vigorous father she had
known and loved for most of her life,'' Ms. Viorst said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ambiguous loss and its often wrenching
consequences was brought vividly to professional attention by the
many families with loved ones who were listed as missing in action
in Vietnam. Wynne said, ``The status of missing person left
families in a precarious psychological state of neither being able
to resolve their grief, as happens when someone dies, or being able
to engage with the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone gets stuck in the trap of an ambiguous
loss. For example, in her book, Dr. Boss tells of a wife and mother
of five whose husband was listed as missing in action after his
plane was shot down in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me her husband had come back to talk with her twice
since he was shot down,'' Dr. Boss recalled. During the first
``visit'' the husband told his wife to sell the house and get a
bigger one and a bigger car to accommodate their growing children.
She followed his ``instructions'' and, about a year later, the
husband ``returned'' to tell her that she had done a good job, he
was proud of her, he loved her and now he was going to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when I knew he was really dead,'' the wife told Dr.
Boss, who concluded that the perceived conversations not only
comforted the wife, but they also enabled her to move forward on
her own and make needed decisions and changes that benefited her
and her children.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Dr. Boss recalled a Minnesota couple who
continued to advertise for the return of their three sons 38 years
after they had disappeared, as small children, from a playground.
Despite numerous false alarms through the years, the parents kept
alive their hope that the missing sons might one day show up.
However, that hope, which Dr. Boss calls ``a defense against pain,
an expression of hopeful optimism rather than unconscious denial,''
did not prevent the parents from forging ahead like a normal
family, acknowledging that their lost children were probably dead
and providing love and attention for their other children.
</P>
<P>
   In still another case, Dr. Boss recounts the adaptability of
three sons of a woman who developed Alzheimer's disease. Instead of
the sons' becoming immobilized by their mother's deteriorating
condition, as she became more childlike, they played with her in a
more childlike fashion and treated her distortions of language as a
form of avant-garde poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to live with an ambiguous loss is with resilience,
not denial, Dr. Boss maintains. Denial stands in the way of finding
creative options, whereas resilience fosters them. When a father
who normally prepared a weekly gourmet dinner was disabled by
Parkinson's disease, the family preserved the Sunday night event
but gave him a less demanding task of making popcorn and serving
apples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal for families is to find some way to change even
though the ambiguity remains,'' she said. With a little help, she
added, people can learn to balance their grief over what was lost
with a recognition of what is still possible.

EARLY EATING HABITS TIED TO ADULT ILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two new studies lend support to the view that by the time
children enter elementary school they may have eating and other
health habits that will play a major role in the problems they may
suffer in later life, including heart disease, high blood pressure
and possibly diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts said the findings suggested that it was never too
soon to teach children good dietary habits, as well the importance
of exercise. This is especially true for black and Mexican-American
children. As early as age 6, one of the studies found, they show
significant health differences, overall, in comparison with
non-Hispanic white children.
</P>
<P>
   One study, to be reported Tuesday in Circulation, the journal of
the American Heart Association, was conducted by Dr. Alan R.
Sinaiko of the University of Minnesota Medical School in
Minneapolis and colleagues, beginning in 1977. It involved 679
public schoolchildren who were followed from age 7 through 23. Over
the years, the children were periodically examined to determine
their weight, body mass index _ considered a more accurate gauge of
overall health _ and blood pressure. As adults, they gave blood
samples that were tested for cholesterol and insulin levels.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that body weight during childhood, and
especially the rate at which the weight was gained, was a good
indicator of whether an adult would exhibit risk factors for
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This was especially true for a
condition known as insulin resistance syndrome, which is associated
with obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevalence of overweight in youth is increasing,'' the
report noted. ``On the basis of the data from this study, it can be
expected that there will be a steady increase in the number of
at-risk individuals as today's children become adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The second study, described in the March 17 issue of The Journal
of the American Medical Association, involved differences in
cardiovascular risk factors among children in various ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been established that blacks and people of Hispanic
descent suffer from the disease at a greater rates than
non-Hispanic whites. But the Stanford scientists report they could
detect differences in the risk factors for the disease as early as
age 6 in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that while poor nutrition and low income often
went hand-in-hand, the health differences between white and black
children, and white and Mexican-American ones, appeared to
transcend economic factors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the health indicators researchers looked at were body mass
index, fat intake, blood pressure and cholesterol. In most
categories, they found significantly higher problems in the
minority children studied.
</P>
<P>
   While there may be many reasons behind the differences, from
genetics to culture, the lead author of the study, Dr. Marilyn A.
Winkleby, said many could be linked to a lack of knowledge about
basic nutrition. She said more should be done to design nutrition
education programs for blacks and Mexican-Americans. She also said
much more should be done to encourage physical activity among
children, and suggested that minority neighborhoods have not been
provided with enough good sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that it's not hard to do,'' she said. ``It's
cost effective in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The study drew on data gathered by the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted by the federal government
from 1988 to 1994. Stanford scientists focused on examinations and
surveys done of 2,769 blacks, 2,854 Mexican-Americans and 2,063
non-Hispanic whites, all from the ages of 6 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Winkleby said the study showed the importance of reaching
children as early as possible to prevent future health problems.
``This highlights the need for interventions as early as
kindergarten,'' she said.

KOSOVO CRISIS LOOMS OVER PRIMAKOV'S VISIT WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S.-Russian disagreement over allied tactics
in Kosovo threatens to complicate Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's meetings with President Clinton during the Russian
leader's visit to Washington beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton wants to provide personal
support for Primakov and his efforts to win favorable debt
repayment terms from the International Monetary Fund to help
Primakov deal with Russia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and Russia are at odds over the threat by
NATO to bomb Serbian-dominated Yugoslav, Russia's long-time ally.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, just before his scheduled departure for the United
States, urged NATO to forego the air strikes that would be designed
to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his
campaign of suppression against ethnic Albanians' quest for
autonomy in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there will be no raids,'' Primakov said in Moscow,
adding that the Kremlin remains ``categorically against the use of
force against Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov did not rule out delaying his trip _ his first since
becoming prime minister seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, preparing for two meetings with Primakov later this
week, warned that NATO will move forward with military action if
Milosevic ``continues to choose aggression over peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was awaiting the outcome of last-minute
consultations in Belgrade between Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the president wants to
bolster Primakov's stature in Russia as he tackles the domestic
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is a prime contender for the Russian presidency in 2000
when President Boris Yeltsin's term expires. Primakov would oversee
Russia until a special election, should Yeltsin not finish his
term.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Primakov's visit to
the United States would not delay military action against Yugoslav
forces if Milosevic continues his offensive against ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a long-time ally of Yugoslavia, has opposed punitive
military action against Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian forces joined U.S.-led NATO troops in Bosnia in 1995
to enforce a U.S.-brokered peace agreement in that war-torn
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is hoping that Russia will join
forces with the United States and NATO allies to deploy a
peacekeeping force in Kosovo, if a peace agreement can be achieved
between Albanian and Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that both the western allies and Russia agree
on the goal of halting bloodshed in Kosovo and restoring the
political autonomy that Kosovo long enjoyed from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and our NATO allies _ and Russia _ all agree that this is
the right goal,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is banking on the United States and the IMF to help
Russia avert technical bankruptcy later this year as it tries to
pay off $17.5 billion in foreign debt payments.

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is hosting Primakov at the so-called
Gore-Primakov Commission _ a Cabinet-level forum that meets twice a
year to deal with non-ideological nuts-and-bolts issues that
complicate U.S. economic involvement in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is expected to approve a plan that will enable the
Russian government to resume receiving hard currency. The
arrangement calls for a U.S. firm to buy from Russia about 550 tons
of weapons-grade uranium that has been diluted with other material
to yield a uranium product suitable for powering U.S. nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov also will meet with IMF chief Michael Camdessus to
renegotiate the terms of payment of the $4.8 billion that the
Kremlin owes the IMF this year in loan repayments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's foreign debt amounts to almost $144 billion, including
the Kremlin's Soviet-era debt. Failure to make timely debt payments
could trigger the flight of foreign investment that is sorely
needed to rebuild the economy.

   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite White House hopes for helping Primakov, the Clinton
administration has taken a number of steps in recent months that
alarm the Kremlin and potentially fan anti-western nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration led efforts to expand NATO membership
to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, all former
Soviet allies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans a visit to Slovenia in the Balkans in June _
the next nation likely to be offered NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to move ahead with development of an
anti-missile system to target incoming warheads from rogue nations
such as North Korea also has alarmed the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist the new defensive missile system will not
require revisions in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. But
Russian authorities remain unpersuaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plan may complicate ratification of
the START II treaty by the communist-dominated Russian Duma. The
Duma has agreed to begin debate on the 1992 accord on April 2.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov took over as prime minister after last August's fiscal
freefall in Russia. The output of goods and services stands at
barely 55 percent of 1989 levels, according to Keith Bush of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.

 &HT;    BUSH, DOLE HIDING ANTI-ABORTION VIEWS, GROUP CLAIMS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's largest reproductive rights
organization accused the two leading Republican presidential
candidates Monday of trying to mask their opposition to abortion
rights in order to fool voters.
</P>
<P>
   The group's television ad campaign, citing news accounts,
labeled both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former American Red
Cross President Elizabeth Dole as ``anti-choice'' in the debate
over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began airing Monday in Des Moines, Iowa, and Manchester,
N.H., two early-voting states in the nomination battle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Dole are ``trying to hide their extreme views'' in the
Republican primary in order to avoid alienating voters in the
general election, said Kate Michelman, president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL), the
organization sponsoring the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying just enough about their position to keep the
far political right, anti-choice groups and voters within their
primaries,'' she said in an interview. ``They know that if they
don't obscure their positions, if they are forthright and honest
about their anti-choice views, it would cost them voters in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   The NARAL ad cites several statements made by Bush since
entering politics, notably a 1994 interview with the Dallas Morning
News in which he vowed to ``do everything in my power to restrict
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also said the Republican Party should maintain its
``pro-life tenor,'' but has not endorsed the longstanding GOP
platform plank calling for a constitutional amendment outlawing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has refused to answer any questions about abortion since
resigning from the Red Cross earlier this year to explore the
possibility of running for the Republican 2000 presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The NARAL ad notes, however, that in 1996, when her husband Bob
Dole was running for president, she acknowledged to the New York
Daily News that she supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw
almost all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bush told Reuters the governor opposes
abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the
mother is endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Dole, told the news agency she
also opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Dole feels so strongly about this matter that she will
say it in her own way and with her own words at the appropriate
time,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Michelman declined to say how much money NARAL would spend on
the ads. The group decided to air them in Iowa and New Hampshire
first because those states will host the first presidential
balloting next year. But she said NARAL would shift the ads to
other states if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She also said NARAL would produce similar ads in congressional
races in which candidates try to obscure their positions on
abortion. But she said the presidential campaign was a priority
because, with anti-abortion majorities likely to remain in
Congress, ``the presidency could be the last line of defense''
against the overturning of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling granting
reproductive rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Democratic president nomination, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, are
both advocates of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   All the other Republican candidates oppose abortion. One of
them, former Reagan administration adviser Gary Bauer, has made
opposition to abortion a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, ad campaigns such as the one launched by NARAL on
Monday occur during the general election. But Michelman said NARAL
did not want to wait any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to wait six months, eight months, a year when
they have already fooled half the people,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   She also said NARAL would produce similar ads in congressional
races in which candidates try to obscure their positions on
abortion. But she said the presidential campaign was a priority
because, with anti-abortion majorities likely to remain in
Congress, ``the presidency could be the last line of defense''
against the overturning of the 1973 Supreme Court ruling granting
reproductive rights to women.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates for the Democratic president nomination, Vice
President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, are
both advocates of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   All the other Republican candidates oppose abortion. One of
them, former Reagan administration adviser Gary Bauer, has made
opposition to abortion a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, ad campaigns such as the one launched by NARAL on
Monday occur during the general election. But Michelman said NARAL
did not want to wait any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to wait six months, eight months, a year when
they have already fooled half the people,'' she said.

 &HT;    Ikea president to head Home Depot's international dealings
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has made another move to advance its
do-it-yourself culture overseas by hiring a Swedish executive to
run its international operations.
</P>
<P>
   Anders Moberg, president of Ikea Group, will become Home Depot's
group president for international operations and will report
directly to President and Chief Executive Arthur Blank, the company
said Monday. Moberg, 49, is noted for his 29-year career with Ikea,
a large Denmark-based furnishings chain and one of the world's
largest privately held companies.
</P>
<P>
   Moberg, a native of Almhult, Sweden, is in the process of
relocating to Atlanta and will begin working for Home Depot in the
fall, Blank said. A search firm helped fill the newly created post,
Blank added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone who had experience running a large
company in lots of countries and with a lot of experience in global
sourcing,'' Blank said. Moberg, who joined Ikea in 1970, has seen
the company expand into 28 countries. In 1973, Ikea opened a store
in Germany _ its first store outside Scandinavia, then worked its
way across the globe by hitting a new country nearly every year
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moberg's importing experience was especially attractive, said
Blank, who noted that Ikea purchases from 65 countries. Imports
account for 3 percent of Home Depot's sales, and the company would
like to expand that to 11 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Moberg drove Ikea's expansion of retail stores and manufacturing
plants throughout Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, Blank said.
The newest additions to Ikea's reach include Finland, Spain and
China.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot opened its first stores outside North America last
year in Chile and will expand to Argentina. Is Moberg's experience
a signal that Home Depot is revving up international growth beyond
its Latin American outposts?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a change or shift in strategy. We're focused on
Latin America, but we'll continue to look at the Far East and other
areas,'' Blank said. ``International growth is very important to
us, but it's important to understand that it's a long-term
commitment.

   To get into space, astronauts have to fight gravity. To stay
strong and healthy in space, they have to make up for gravity's
absence, because muscles atrophy and bones lose calcium without the
earth's steady pull to struggle against. As a January 2000
launching date for the first resident mission to the new
International Space Station approaches, NASA is making its most
serious effort ever to break the muscle barrier to extended stays
in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-year search for a space equivalent to weight
training, scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration are preparing a series of ``resistance exercise
devices,'' machines that give weightless astronauts a workout by
giving them something to pull or push against.
</P>
<P>
   An interim device, already in use by astronauts in training,
looks like two diaper pails bolted to a crossbar. A college
student's idea for an improved version, based on the principle that
makes a tape measure snap shut, was sent aloft above Houston last
week &UR;  &LR; for testing during free fall. And a call recently went out on
the Internet for any and all notions for a permanent, far more
advanced machine, which NASA is hoping will include virtual reality
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Stringham Shepherd, the chief strength trainer for space
station astronauts and the wife of William M. Shepherd, the
astronaut who will be the commander of the January mission, said
the goal was for astronauts to retain enough strength to be able to
walk on their own after a four- to six-month space station mission.
</P>
<P>
   The crew last year began training on the interim resistance
exercise device, or IRED, which will be bolted into a passageway
between the station's modules this year. Produced by Leonardo Inc.,
a Kansas City engineering firm, the device consists of two
cylinders containing 28 ``flex packs'' _ stacked disks connected to
an outer ring by rubber straps. As an astronaut pulls a cable, the
disks spin, stretching the flaps and creating work for the
astronaut's muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepherd said the device worked better than anything that
NASA had tried before.
</P>
<P>
   But despite ingenious adjustments, the flex packs provide a
somewhat uneven, and therefore less efficient, workout, said Dr.
Suzanne Schneider, a research physiologist at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It was the need for steady pressure that led Tara Rutley, a
biology student at Colorado State University and a would-be
astronaut, to turn to so-called constant torque springs to create
the device that she and three fellow students tested in two days of
weightless flight last week aboard a NASA cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
   Like the tape in a tape measure, these springs consist of flat
strips of metal that have been compressed in the process of being
wound around a central drum. It takes force to counteract that
compression and pull the spring out; when the force is released the
spring rolls back up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rutley and her colleagues, Paul Colosky, Jon Dory and Jack
Zentner, all members of the university's branch of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, took commercially
available springs and combined them into what they called ``force
packs'' hooked to cables. In its final version, the machine could
offer the equivalent of a 500-pound weight, Colosky said.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype tested last week, as part of NASA's Reduced
Gravity Student Flight Opportunities Program, was more modest, with
a maximum of 30 pounds of resistance. ``It looks like a sit-down
home gym because we went and bought one and cut it down.'' said Ms.
Rutley, who said the cost of the prototype was about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said she was enthusiastic about the prototype, but
uncertain whether the space station's complicated construction
schedule would allow it to be seriously considered as the station's
second-generation exercise device, scheduled to replace the IRED
early in the next century. That will probably be a flex-pack
machine improved with small motors and monitors. ``I really like
the kids' idea better than what we've got,'' she said. ``I just
wish it was further along and that we'd heard about it two years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for the ``advanced resistance exercise device,'' or
ARED, to be installed after the station's unfurled solar panels
make power abundant, is shaping up as more of that kind of free for
all. Schneider said ``some really neat ideas'' have been put
forward already for devices that would match the flexibility of a
small gym with the monitoring capabilities of a laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   One robotics company, she said, has proposed combining
wall-mounted cables connected to resistance-producing motors and
virtual-reality goggles. If the astronaut chose to play baseball,
she said, the cable would mimic the heft of a gravity-bound bat
while the participant watched the ball sail out of the virtual
park.

 &HT;    SENATE PROBES STOCK FRAUD IN CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON In 1993, when his young son, James, was diagnosed
with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, Galen O'Kane quit his job
in Ellsworth, Maine, and began to trade stocks online in a bid to
offset rising medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, while surfing the Internet, O'Kane saw an ad
for an Internet newsletter, The Future Superstock. The Web site was
promoting a company called Electro-Optical, which made a hi-tech
fingerprint identification device. The newsletter touted the
company as its stock pick of the year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Kane, trained as an electrical engineer, eventually put
$23,000 into Electro-Optical. Then, last March, having taken his
son to Boston for medical treatment, O'Kane decided to stop by the
corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked into the building and was shocked to find that it was
completely empty,'' O'Kane testified at a Senate hearing Monday.
``I expected to see an assembly line, equipment and employees, but
there was nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Kane quickly dumped his Electro-Optical stock. But by then it
was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presently, my total loss is over $20,000,'' O'Kane told Sen.
Susan M. Collins (R-Maine), who is chairing two days of hearings
into securities fraud on the Internet. ``It was a great deal of
money for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that the Internet appears to provide
'cybercrooks' with profound avenues for committing financial
fraud,'' Collins said. ``It gives some consumers a false sense of
security, credibility and control regarding their investments....
Technology in some cases is mistaken for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ascent of the Internet, warned Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), ``we face the real possibility that the American stock
exchanges will become more like Las Vegas and less like Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said she was weighing legislation that would provide for
third-party verification of Internet sites that tout
over-the-counter ``micro-cap'' stocks those with market values of
under $50 million. But none of the witnesses before the Senate
permanent investigations subcommittee seemed warm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's dangers as well in too much censorship,'' said Howard
Friedman, who teaches at the University of Toledo College of Law.
He has written a book on the Internet and securities regulation,
``Securities Regulation in Cyberspace,'' which was published last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Friedman said, something needs to be done
about ``spamming,'' which allows promoters to reach large audiences
at low cost through bulk E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-policing is the answer,'' said Thomas Gardner, founder of
The Motley Fool, which has evolved into a multi-faceted service for
individual investors. As Gardner sees it, Internet securities fraud
is driven by ignorance. ``Although we believe that individuals can
and should make their own investment decisions, we don't believe
they should always do so alone,'' he told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the view of a much chastised Galen O'Kane. As he
put it in the wake of his big loss in Electro-Optical stock: ``That
was my first attempt at investing in a stock on the Internet and it
will be my last. I have continued to invest online, but now I turn
to an investment adviser for advice on all of my investments.''

 &HT;    High school reunion may take place in final game
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Avery says he doesn't stay in touch with Ricky Moore as
much as he used to. But if Duke and UConn win in Saturday's NCAA
Final Four in St. Petersburg, Fla., the two high school teammates
from Augusta, Ga.'s Westside High will have a high-profile reunion
in the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   UConn's Moore is two years older than Avery, the Duke point
guard, but in 1996, when Avery was a sophomore, they teamed to lead
Westside to a 33-1 record and a state championship. The following
year, with Moore gone to UConn, Avery led Westside to a 25-4
season.
</P>
<P>
   Avery is Duke's third-leading scorer and one of the bright
rising stars in college basketball. Moore is the team's defensive
stopper and played a key role in the Huskies' 67-62 win over
Gonzaga for the West Regional championship
</P>
<P>
   The two players were very close when Avery became a freshman at
Westside, where both his mother and father played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky kind of adopted William and they'd go one on one against
each other every chance they got,'' said Ken Wright, who coached
both players at Westside. ``It made both of them better players,
especially William.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery says the two aren't as close as they once were, but he
would certainly like the chance to play against him next Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys from Westside playing in the national championship
game? How cool would that be?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Three rookies and Coach K
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski will be making his eighth trip to the
Final Four since 1986 while the three other coaches in St.
Petersburg _ UConn's Jim Calhoun, Michigan State's Tom Izzo, and
Ohio State's Jim O'Brien _ will be there for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, in his 19th season at Duke, says the feeling never
gets old. Besides, he has a chance to join some elite company
should he win his third national title. That club includes only
John Wooden, Adolph Rupp, and Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a chance to play for the national championship
until you get to the Final Four,'' said Krzyzewski, who won his
titles in 1991 and 1992. ``Now we can talk about winning the
national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell on the money
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the shuffle of Duke's lineup of All-Americans is junior
forward Chris Carrawell, but he was a major factor in the Blue
Devils' 85-64 win over Temple for the East Regional championship.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Carrawell used to pick up spending money by beating
older guys in pickup games on the tough playgrounds of East St.
Louis, Ill. So Carrawell was more than comfortable going against
the city kids from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Temple wanted to pack their zone around All-America center Elton
Brand. Carrawell made them pay by slicing through it to hand out
seven assists, grab seven rebounds and score 12 points. He also
held Mark Karcher, Temple's best scorer, to 7-of-25 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he plays like that,'' Krzyzewski said, ``it is a
beautiful thing to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   If Michigan State and Ohio State win Saturay, it would make the
first time two Big Ten teams played for the championship since
1976, when Indiana beat Michigan. . . . Duke, UConn, and Michigan
State, were ranked No. 1, 2, and 5 in the preseason Associated
Press poll. Ohio State, 8-22 last season, did not crack the
rankings until January. . . . Ohio State is the first team to reach
the Final Four without having been in the tournament the year
before.

DOCTOR MARRIES DOCTOR: GOOD MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some years ago, well before I got engaged, I had a conversation
with a young gastroenterologist about marriage. I was readying
myself for medical school and concerned I would not meet anyone
outside of medicine. I was certain I did not want to marry a
doctor. ``No, marry a doctor,'' the fellow advised. ``When you get
paged away during your anniversary dinner, only another doctor will
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as a newly minted doctor, I got engaged to a medical
student. Although we have common interests that extend far beyond
medicine, most of my friends focus on the fact that we will both be
doctors. Like the gastroenterologist, some think being in the same
demanding field will help our marriage. Others think I was bound to
marry a doctor, given my schedule, but wonder how we will find time
to spend together. A few wink and joke about our future income.
</P>
<P>
   Like me, many young doctors today are marrying other doctors.
That was not the case fairly recently, when the vast majority of
doctors were men and dual-doctor marriages were rare. Male doctors
tended to have stay-at-home wives who took care of children and
supported their husbands and their careers. About 50 percent of
female doctors, on the other hand, have always married other
doctors. Today, when women account for almost 50 percent of medical
students and about 20 percent of all doctors, the number of these
marriages is rising rapidly. Soon, perhaps half of all young
doctors will be married to other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in The Annals of Internal Medicine set out to
discover what these marriages were like. A group of researchers
surveyed 1,208 doctors, comparing the 26 percent in dual-doctor
marriages with the rest in ``mixed marriages.'' The researchers
looked at three areas: number of hours worked and annual income,
number of children and child-rearing arrangements, and perceptions
of family and work.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, they found that dual-doctor marriages were relatively
happy and stable. Compared with other physicians, doctors in
dual-doctor marriages reported greater satisfaction in discussing
and sharing work interests with their spouses, more involvement in
child rearing by both partners and a higher family income.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Campagna, a 37-year-old cardiologist at New York
Presbyterian Hospital who recently married an internist, said he
believed that there were many advantages to marrying another
doctor. ``Sarah and I speak the same language, we belong to the
same clique,'' he said recently. ``I don't have to go home and say,
`I started a dopamine drip on a patient today. Oh, and by the way,
dopamine is a drug we use to ...''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that dual-doctor marriages were
traditional in many ways, particularly in the area of family.
Compared with other female doctors, for example, women in
dual-doctor marriages spent more time rearing children, more often
arranged their work schedules to fulfill family responsibilities,
worked fewer hours and earned less money.
</P>
<P>
   But neither men nor women in dual-doctor families said they felt
less successful than other physicians in achieving their career or
child-rearing goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shari Midoneck, an infectious disease specialist at New York
Presbyterian who is married to a gastroenterologist, agreed that
most women in dual-doctor marriages bore the brunt of child
rearing. ``The onus is on me to make sure that there's food in the
house, that the kids are ready for school, that their homework is
done,'' she said. ``My mother was there for us every night cooking
dinner. She went on all our field trips. So I want to be there for
my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Midoneck works in a practice with other women, most of whom
have children, which helps her maintain flexibility in her work.
``I never miss anything with my kids,'' she said. ``If I need time
off, I just take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Campagna, venturing an explanation for some of the survey's
results, said: ``Medicine is not a radical profession. The women
are traditional. They come from good families that stress
education.''
</P>
<P>
   But medicine has been changing and continues to change,
particularly in regard to the work ethic. Doctors, both male and
female, work fewer hours, and lifestyle and family time are top
considerations for medical students choosing specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Still, medicine remains inflexible in many respects, especially
with regard to women. For example, most residency programs do not
have formal maternity leave policies, though most female residents
are in their childbearing years. Medical schools still do not make
proper allowance for female (or male) academics who want to hop off
the tenure track to have children. A recent survey found that
female academics believe having children is a hindrance to career
advancement, though those with children had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   The system will change with time, as more women assume positions
of power, but the increasing number of dual-doctor marriages is
also bound to hasten the change. The sentiments and sympathies of
the men who now run most teaching hospitals will change when more
of them go home every night to their doctor wives. Instituting
flexible work schedules in academic medicine and on-site child care
will become more of a priority when these issues hit closer to
home. The system is bound to become more flexible, reflecting the
current reality of the profession instead of the outdated reality
of the past, benefiting men and women alike.

A NEW SCENARIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bill and Hillary Clinton saga is so incredible
that almost any scenario about their future is plausible. As a
political pair, they have broken all the old rules.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the latest speculation:
</P>
<P>
   1) The first lady decides to run for the Senate in New York. The
president resigns to move to Manhattan with her, back up her
campaign and end gossip about a marital separation. It's her
political turn.
</P>
<P>
   2) With the Clintons gone, Vice President Al Gore becomes
president and can run for the 2000 Democratic nomination as an
incumbent, strengthening his political power and the likelihood of
a general election victory. Gore is free at last.
</P>
<P>
   3) Gore then returns the favor by granting both Clintons a
blanket pardon to protect them from any future indictment. They've
been punished enough.
</P>
<P>
   Something for everyone in this deal.
</P>
<P>
   But will it work? Who knows? There are holes in this vision, as
there are in any political experiment.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, of course, insists that he will never, ever
step down before the natural expiration of his second term. Richard
Nixon said that too, just before he resigned to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's continued high approval ratings depend in part on
public appreciation of his determination to carry on despite
everything. He did just that at the dinner of a journalists' group
called the Gridiron Club last weekend, demonstrating that he can
bring spontaneous, genuine laughter and applause from a
sophisticated press and political crowd even after an evening of
satire pummeling his behavior. What a pro.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he might not see the merits of the above
scenario. The rumblings from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
operation that he might try to send either or both Clintons to jail
after the president is out of office must be deeply worrisome. It
would be tempting to let Gore protect them with the stroke of a
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sense of loyalty to his mentor should guarantee that as
president he would indeed do the Clintons the favor of a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   When Gerald Ford, whom Nixon had named as vice president, did
the same for Nixon, he took a terrible political hit. The public
thought Nixon was guilty of the Watergate crimes and didn't like
the idea that a covert bargain might have been struck.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is not Nixon. Gore can get away with this.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has a job approval rating in the mid-60s, compared with
only 44 percent who approve of the way the impeachment-minded
Congress has been behaving. A majority of the country still
believes that he should not have been impeached for private sexual
misbehavior, let alone go to the pokey for it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Nixon's crimes were violations of his public trust
involving serious constitutional abuses of presidential power. A
Gallup poll just before Nixon's resignation showed that only 24
percent of those surveyed approved of the way he had handled his
job. The public did not support an official pass on his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The current scenario, however, turns primarily on Hillary
Clinton's decision about whether to run for the Senate seat of
retiring incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. She looks good
in the polls, but if her Republican opponent is New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, it will be a tough, well-matched race.
</P>
<P>
   As her friends are becoming convinced she really wants to run,
the Republicans are growing more sarcastic about the possibility,
trying to scare her away. Conservative columnists muse that she is
too thin-skinned to take the pressure, too battered by the
president's infidelity, too unaccustomed to her own name on the
ballot rather than her husband's. They scoff at the notion that she
would be comfortable as a junior senator, one of 100 instead of the
only first lady in the land.
</P>
<P>
   My, but they underestimate her. Have they not noticed that she
is as good a public performer as her husband and seems to enjoy the
political game as much? I have watched her in action many times.
She knows how to arouse a crowd, give savvy interviews and
articulate national policy every bit as much as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   And the very notion that having little tolerance for criticism
is a problem unique to Hillary is downright silly. Guiliani and a
whole host of other male politicians have similar uneven
temperaments. Some of them have made it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Clintons can know the odds on the probability that Bill
would step aside prematurely and acknowledge that he has had his
day. Their relationship remains a mystery, a private affair that
seems to be constantly in flux. They have both invested a great
deal emotionally and mentally in their partnership.
</P>
<P>
   There must still be some glue between them despite the
humiliation and betrayal. If it binds him to her as much as her to
him, he may well accept the usefulness of reversing their roles.
After all, he would not be going into some male purdah.
</P>
<P>
   He will always be a former president, honored with endless
opportunities to serve on corporate boards, get rich and do
important things in the private sector. Look at the fun his
precedessors have!
</P>
<P>
   And if she becomes a senator and runs for president some day, he
can always manage her campaign.

LONG-LASTING IMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Why does immunization have long-lasting effects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because some of the many kinds of cells that make up the
normal human immune system are naturally able to retain a
``memory'' of the defense efforts aroused by certain infections,
said Dr. Regina Rabinovich of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infections Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain is not the only part of the body that has a
memory,'' she said. ``A vaccine fools the body into having the
memory of how to fight infection created by the vaccine rather than
by an infection.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, after an actual infection with a ``childhood''
disease like measles, which people rarely get more than once, the
immune response goes away, but certain cells are ready to fight
again extremely quickly upon re-exposure, Dr. Rabinovich explained.
The memory remains for years without a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a vaccine mimics infection to get the memory cells to do
battle, to do particular chemical and physical things,'' she
continued.
</P>
<P>
   There are many kinds of immune cells, including T cells and
different types of white cells. Their combat with disease is
extremely complex and involves long chains of interactions and
responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some vaccines, protection may last a long time, even a
lifetime, but for others vaccines may protect only a short time,''
Dr. Rabinovich said, ``just as some diseases generate an immune
response that effectively protects from a second infection, while
other diseases can get us again and again.'' &QL;

SOLID CO2 HAS EFFECT ON LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(kd) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide, a ubiquitous chemical exhaled by all animals and
incorporated into plants as their main building block, has assumed
a new and astonishing form: a solid that resembles quartz, is
nearly as hard as diamond, and transforms light in intriguing (and
potentially very useful) ways.
</P>
<P>
   By subjecting a small quantity of carbon dioxide gas to
pressures comparable to those deep within giant planets, physicists
at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California have created a
polymer of carbon dioxide, in which chains of carbon dioxide
molecules are strung together to create a bizarre substance never
seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Choong-Shik Yoo and his colleagues at the Livermore
laboratory reported their discovery of CO2 -V, the new form of
carbon dioxide, in the journal Science this month.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists filled a tiny cavity between the opposing tips of
two diamonds with a small amount of carbon dioxide. By squeezing
the diamonds together, they applied immense pressure to the cavity
between them and to the carbon dioxide inside it. With a laser,
they heated the carbon dioxide to about 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit,
and at that point, the carbon dioxide underwent a radical change.
</P>
<P>
   X-ray diffraction and other types of analysis revealed that the
carbon and oxygen atoms in the carbon dioxide had rearranged
themselves in chain-like patterns connected by single carbon-oxygen
bonds, a structure similar to that of quartz, in which silicon and
oxygen atoms are also chained together.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo and his colleagues found that as long as the pressure was
maintained, the new carbon dioxide polymer retained its form, even
when the temperature was lowered to room temperature. The highly
compressed molecular structure resembled that of cubic boron
nitride, the second-hardest of all known substances, exceeded only
by diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this stuff will prove to be as hard as cubic
boron nitride, and as good a conductor of heat as diamond,'' Yoo
said. ``But the really intriguing thing is the way CO2 -V shifts
the frequency of light.''
</P>
<P>
   CO2 -V, Yoo and his colleagues found, shifts the frequency of
laser light passing through it to its second harmonic, that is, to
a frequency double that of the incoming beam. Crystals that can do
this, yielding a green laser beam from an incident infrared beam,
for example, are important elements in a hydrogen fusion reactor
Livermore has been developing in recent decades. CO2 -V might be an
improvement over existing crystals, if it could be made in bulk
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   The forms and uses of carbon dioxide seem nearly endless. Long
used in solid form as ``dry ice,'' it is an important refrigerant.
Heated and under moderate pressure, it becomes a ``supercritical''
fluid _ a peculiar intermediate between a liquid and a gas _ that
is used to extract caffeine from coffee and to separate chemicals
from each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only just found this CO2 -V, and now we have to begin
looking for alternative ways of making it,'' Yoo said. ``In the
beginning artificial diamonds could be made only with lots of heat
and pressure, but in more recent years, people had found the
carbon-vapor deposition method of making thin films of diamond,
requiring no pressure and little heat. We'll be looking for
something like that with this new carbon dioxide.''
</P>
<P>
   Might CO2 -V be found in nature?
</P>
<P>
   ``One place to look for it,'' Yoo said, ``would be in the rocks
of Mars, where the impacts of meteors could have provided the
necessary pressure. We plan to try some impact experiments with
carbon dioxide ourselves, using Livermore's big gas gun.''

<P>
   Oblivious to its fellows, the single-celled creature called the
cellular slime mold slithers amoeba-like along the ground, lapping
up the nutrients in its path. But when the food supply runs out, it
has a biochemical panic attack, frantically sending out molecular
signals to other nearby slime molds, which in turn are sending out
signals of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by these primitive conversations, the individual cells
come together to form a multicelled organism, sprouting a stalk and
a head of spores that become the seeds of the next generation. When
these fall to the ground, the cycle begins anew.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic as it seems, this behavior is just a stark example of one
of the most familiar phenomena in the living world: the way
individuals, whether cells in a body, plants and animals in an
ecosystem, or members of a corporation or society, congregate into
complex wholes that take on autonomous existences of their own
without the aid of a central all-seeing controller orchestrating
their movements.
</P>
<P>
   Each member, simply by exchanging information with its nearest
neighbors, unwittingly contributes to the commonweal. From simple,
shortsighted, generally selfish actions, a transcendent global
behavior emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to understand on a very basic level how such patterns of
cooperation arise, scientists based at the Santa Fe Institute in
New Mexico have stripped the problem to its bones: studying how the
simplest imaginable cells _ appearing as squares on a computer
screen _ can interact to generate surprisingly complex, coordinated
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these incredible pictures in which ants are all
trying to get from one tree to another tree,'' said Dr. Melanie
Mitchell, a member of the project along with her Santa Fe
colleague, Dr. James Crutchfield, and Dr. Rajarshi Das, who
recently moved to the International Business Machines Corp. Watson
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ``They build a bridge
with their bodies and other ants can climb across. It's quite
amazing. Our motivation is to understand phenomena like that: how
information processing and communication takes places in these
distributed systems with no central control.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed even more broadly, the goal is a deeper understanding of
how a pattern emerges in nature and the universe. ``If I look out
at the world, I see a lot of structure and regularity there,'' said
Crutchfield. ``Where does that order come from?''
</P>
<P>
   The tool for this research is a computer program called a
cellular automaton. An automaton is a device, made of mechanical or
electronic components, or in this case computer software, that
operates autonomously, almost as though it were alive.
</P>
<P>
   The classic example of this artificial life was invented in 1970
by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. In the Game of
Life, a grid of cells, like a luminous piece of graph paper, is
projected onto the screen of a computer monitor. Some of the
squares are randomly colored black. These are called ``live''
cells; blank ones are ``dead.''
</P>
<P>
   At every tick of the clock, each cell in the grid examines only
cells adjacent to it (including the four diagonals). Then it refers
to a list of simple rules and responds accordingly: A live cell
with one or no neighbors dies from isolation, a live cell with four
or more neighbors dies of overpopulation, a live cell with two or
three neighbors survives. Finally, a dead cell with three neighbors
comes to life.
</P>
<P>
   Tick by tick a dazzling array of lifelike patterns unfolds,
merging, dissolving, oscillating. Like the cells of a slime mold or
the ants in an anthill, the cells of the cellular automaton trade
information only with their immediate neighbors, but they link up
into complex structures that sprawl across the screen. (There are
several places on the Web to play Life, including
www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife).
</P>
<P>
   While the Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional array,
like a checkerboard, the Santa Fe Institute scientists have made
their cellular automata (called CAs for short) even simpler, each
consisting of only a single row of black and white cells. At each
tick of the clock, each cell refers to its three closest neighbors
on the left and right. Then according to a table of rules, it turns
on or off.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of cells then appears in the row underneath.
Generation after generation unscrolls from the top of the screen to
the bottom like a roll in a player piano.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the rules and the initial configuration, different
kinds of patterns unfold. Some CAs quickly freeze up into boring
routine, churning out all black or all white forever. Others cycle
through the same pattern over and over. And still others generate a
seemingly endless variety of intricate structures that seem to
hover on the brink between complexity and randomness.
</P>
<P>
   In their own research, the Santa Fe scientists set out to make a
CA that, regardless of the initial configuration, would always
settle into a repeating pattern with a black row alternating with a
white row, blinking on and off eternally. Starting with any
randomly chosen pattern of black and white cells, the system would
converge after several hundred ticks of the clock, into this
precise lockstep pattern, reminiscent of the way, perhaps, the
cells in a heart coordinate their random firings into a steady
rhythmic beat.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish this task would be for a godlike human
programmer, like the inventor of the Game of Life, to design a
clever set of rules, imposing them from the top down. Crutchfield,
Dr. Mitchell and Das set a more ambitious goal: to see if they
could get the rules for a blinking automaton to evolve, from the
bottom up, more as they would in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Through evolution, the cells in a heart develop the ability to
beat together cooperatively; the ants in the anthill, to build a
bridge. In a computer-simulated Darwinian struggle, the cells in
the cellular automaton would evolve the ability to form
synchronized blinking patterns.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the crisp lines of the simple simulated system, the
researchers of the EvCA project (short for ``evolving cellular
automata'') hope to throw light on how individuals in nature
develop this ability to exchange information and coordinate their
behavior, carrying out tasks in ways that never would have occurred
to an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research shows how sneaky nature can be in the ways it
finds to solve problems,'' said Dr. Andy Clark, a philosopher at
Washington University in St. Louis. The solutions that emerge, he
noted, are ``quite different from our armchair design _ often
messier-looking on the surface, yet deeply efficient underneath.''

SAN FRANCISCO VIES FOR OLYMPIC GOLD IN 2012 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Put aside for now lost Olympic innocence and
negative thoughts about the International Olympic Committee and the
$1.2 million in graft paid to members to award the 2002 Winter
Games to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The instead about the possibilities for the 2012 Summer Games in
the San Francisco Bay area. Great athletes. Great exposure. Bundles
of money dropped into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the message from the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee (BASOC). First formed in 1987 with the aim of hosting the
1996 games, its members are reconstituting themselves to submit a
bid one year from now for the games 13 years hence.
</P>
<P>
   For 2012, the Bay area's U.S. competition is Cincinnati, Dallas,
Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Tampa, Fla., and the
Washington-Baltimore area. Seattle recently aborted its candidacy
because it lacked broad business support.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee names its candidate in 2002, and the
IOC makes its worldwide choice in 2005. Larry Baer, chief operating
officer of the San Francisco Giants and a member of BASOC's
executive committee, senses a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have it or you don't. When you consider the Bay
area's natural beauty, that it is the technology center of the
world, then there is an international case to be made for the Bay
area as host for the games. That, plus we have all the athletic
facilities in place,'' said Baer, adding that the host committee
will stage the games with private funding.
</P>
<P>
   BASOC was founded by Quentin Kopp, a former San Francisco
supervisor and state senator and now a San Mateo County Superior
Court judge. After Atlanta was chosen as the pick for the 1996
games, BASOC was ready to compete for the 2008 games. However, in
1997 the IOC said it would not choose a U.S. city so close in time
to the Atlanta and Salt Lake games. U.S. bidders were moved to
2012.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp has had to step down because of judicial restraints,
leaving the campaign in the hands of the 42-member BASOC. The
committee is comprised of 10 former Olympians living in the region,
three retired athletes and 29 prominent executives and individuals,
including former Secretary of State George Schultz; Bill Walsh, San
Francisco 49ers vice president and general manager; David Pottruck,
president and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.; Carl
Pascarella, president of VISA USA; and Baer.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that the Olympic committee scandal, the worst in
the IOC's 105-year history, will be a cathartic experience. They
also believe that reform measures and removal of the corrupt will
restore Olympic luster, and that if the event is properly planned
and presented, many millions of dollars could be injected into the
regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City scandal has revealed a culture of rampant
impropriety. In all, some $1.2 million in scholarships, lavish
gifts, cosmetic surgery, Browning rifles and more largess was given
to IOC members _ in exchange for their votes _ by Salt Lake City
bid committee members consumed with winning. The IOC expelled six
of its members last week, and several leaders of the Salt Lake host
group resigned in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cleaning up process taking place regarding bidding is only
working to our benefit,'' said BASOC executive committee member
George Broder, an executive at Eller Media Co. in Oakland who was a
press agent at the 1984 Los Angeles games. ``It establishes clear
rules and guidelines, and if all the bid cities abide by them, it
will be a very fair process moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles games in 1984 are regarded by the U.S. Olympic
Committee as a model for Olympic success. Private funds produced
the games, and the city used existing athletic facilities for
venues and university dormitories for housing, thus incurring
minimal capital costs. At the end, the hosts had a $230 million
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   IOC reform will help reinvent the Olympics, benefitting the Bay
area, Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is happening with the bidding process will be
comforting to us to the extent the change will be substantive,''
Baer said. ``After that, we're blessed because we have the raw
material that lends itself to an Olympics that is pretty much a
turnkey form of Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever city is selected to host the 2012 games, early, rough
projections imagine a budget of as much as $3 billion, said Mike
Moran, assistant executive director of the USOC in Colorado
Springs, Colo. Baer questions that number.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget number cannot be legitimate until you look at how
many facilities you need to build, if any. What would be $3 billion
for City `X' would be half that for City `Y' if `Y' has a minimum
of facilities to build, and I think we are City `Y,'' Baer said.
</P>
<P>
   Having begun planning in 1987, BASOC believes that with the
exception of a velodrome that will need to be built for cycling,
virtually all games can be accommodated in existing facilities.
It's all in the talk stage, but Baer and others say Bay-area
colleges and universities may be used as venues along with a host
of other facilities _ for example, Pacific Bell Park for baseball,
Golden Gate Park for archery, the San Francisco Bay for yachting _
as well as stadiums in Sacramento and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that Olympic sponsors are quickly
overcoming their queasiness about the corruption that played out in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co., a sponsor of the games for 100 years, and
McDonald's Corp. last week applauded early signs of IOC reform.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the games present a major marketing opportunity, said
John Britton, a spokesman for Pacific Telesis in San Francisco,
which contributed $20,000 of the $100,000 non-refundable payment
the Bay area was obligated to make to the USOC this year to
demonstrate its seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in supporting large events that benefit the
region, but beyond that ... we would hope to win part of that
business,'' said Britton, whose company used the 1996 Republican
Convention in San Diego to launch its wireless digital telephone
service.

 UNDATED: efficient underneath.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like animal breeders, the experimenters started with 100
untrained CAs, each governed by a set of randomly generated rules.
Each CA was then seeded with a random configuration of black and
white squares and left to churn away. After each had been tested on
100 of these initial patterns, the fittest CAs _ those that came
closest, after 300 clock ticks, to settling into a blinking pattern
_ were then pulled from the pool, the others allowed to die.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors then were allowed to ``have sex'' with one
another. Their rules, expressed as a string of 1's and 0's, can be
thought of as the genetic message _ the chromosome that determines
how the CA behaves.
</P>
<P>
   By exchanging chunks of this code, like amoebas fusing and
swapping DNA, the winners of the old generation gave birth to a new
one. In a further imitation of natural variation, the chromosomes
were also subject to random mutation, a 1 might become a 0 or vice
versa, like a molecule zapped by a cosmic ray.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using this second generation, the experiment was run
again. The fittest survivors were culled out and bred and the third
generation was put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just leave the algorithm cooking on our workstations over
night,'' Crutchfield said. ``Then we'd come back in the morning and
see what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After 100 generations, CAs almost always emerged that knew the
blinking task.
</P>
<P>
   At this point the human overseers had no idea why the solutions
that evolution had stumbled upon worked so well. ``Unraveling this
problem,'' Das said, ``was the most fascinating aspect of this
work.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a cell saw that the three cells to the left of
it were black, then it might decide to turn black at the next tick.
But what if the cells to the right of it were all white? And it
would have no way of knowing what distant cells far down the row
were doing? What if, imitating its neighbors, a cell turned black
only to find that they, using different criteria, decided to turn
white? There was no higher intelligence looking down and seeing the
whole picture, coordinating the flow.
</P>
<P>
   In another experiment, the scientists bred CAs to perform what
is called the density classification problem. Starting with a
random row of cells, the CA would compute the relative number of
black and white cells. If most of the cells in the initial row were
white, then the CA would ideally converge to a state where it
churned out nothing but white rows. And if there were more black
than white cells, it would eventually churn out all black rows.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the problem was understanding how the fittest survivors
were performing this computation. The answer was hidden somewhere
in the long row of 1's and 0's representing the rule table _ the
digital chromosome that had evolved.
</P>
<P>
   But analyzing a CA on that level would be like trying to
understand an animal's psychology by scrutinizing the precise
details of its DNA sequence. Or, the scientists wrote, it would be
like trying to explain how a pocket calculator computes square
roots by examining the flow of the charges though its silicon
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   To figure out why a CA worked the way it did, the scientists
needed to step back and take a bird's eye view. As they studied the
grids of cells churned out by the program, they noticed that they
were typically grouped into large rectangular and triangular
regions. Some were solid black, some solid white and some
checkerboard.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came when they concentrated not on the regions
themselves but on the boundary lines between them. Viewed at a
higher level of abstraction, these began to resemble tracks of
colliding particles like one sees in photographs from physics
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we didn't anticipate,'' Crutchfield said.
``In a sense, we were being artificial particle physicists.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surprising change of metaphor. Drawing on earlier work,
Crutchfield had done at the University of California at Berkeley
with Dr. James Hanson, now with the IBM Watson Research Center, the
scientists classified these ``artificial particles'' according to
various characteristics like the nature of the regions they
separated and how fast they propagated across the screen. The
result was a mathematical language that explained a CA's behavior
in terms of particles colliding and trading information.
</P>
<P>
   This new depth of understanding is the most exciting thing about
the work, said Dr. Mitchell Resnick, a computer scientist at the
Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Much
research on cellular automata and artificial evolution ``borders on
magic,'' he said. Researchers breed programs by trial and error
and, voila, something interesting emerges. But they are left
baffled by how their creations compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Fe team has helped bring rigor and insight to this
field,'' he said. ``They identify a set of patterns that help
explain how and why the evolutionary algorithm works. Their
approach is the classic scientific approach: develop new
representations that enable you to see a clear picture where others
had seen only noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing metaphors again, the researchers are pondering whether
the patterns that emerge in their simulation bear something in
common with those that emerge inside the brain. Neurons exchanging
electrochemical signals with their immediate neighbors somehow give
rise to grand thoughts and mental images representing things in the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain does not have a single center to evaluate or
coordinate computations,'' Das said. ``Yet it is able to bind
together many parallel computations to produce coherent perception
and action. I think our approach can bring a fresh perspective to
study this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Like cells in the Game of Science, the researchers gather and
trade information on the Internet, the telephone and in
face-to-face conversations, never entirely sure of the greater
pattern that might unfold.

THE ROAD TO FLORIDA, MAINE AND SYPHILIS

<P>
   Interstate 95 runs along the Eastern Seaboard linking rural
Maine to Florida, enabling people and commerce to travel north to
south. But in one area, epidemiologists believe the highway may
also be a pipeline for syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by researchers at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Pittsburgh, who
examined a decade's syphilis reports in North Carolina counties,
the disease appeared more than twice as often in North Carolina
rural counties bordering I-95 as it did in rural counties that did
not border the highway. The results appear in the current issue of
The American Journal of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   For the study, North Carolina's counties were divided into
groups based on population and whether I-95 passes through them.
Eleven counties claim a piece of the highway; 84 do not.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers obtained annual syphilis data from 1985 to 1994
for each county and examined it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 10 years, the rate among rural I-95 counties
was 38 reported cases for every 100,000 people, compared with 16
cases of syphilis for every 100,000 people in non-I-95 counties.
Though low, the national rate of syphilis surged during the
mid-1980s, reaching a high of 20.3 cases per 100,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers speculated that the high rates of syphilis along
the highway might be related to drug trafficking and distribution.
In the 1980s, cocaine was mainly imported into the eastern United
States through Miami and New York City, both of which lie along
I-95, they wrote. The emergence of a cocaine market may have
increased risky sexual behaviors that lead to syphilis and other
sexually transmitted diseases, owing in part to the exchange of sex
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Syphilis may have also been spread along the highway through
contact between truck drivers and prostitutes, the researchers
suggested, though there are no data available on the sexual
behavior of American truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rachel A. Royce, an assistant professor of epidemiology at
the University of North Carolina, said: ``While individual
behaviors contribute to the spread of syphilis, the drug trade can
amplify an epidemic and make a community more vulnerable. ``We need
to bring drug treatment and S.T.D. control together to help reduce
the community's vulnerability.''

   ULTRA-SKILLED DOCTORS MORE LIKELY TO BE SUED
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and health officials have long been eager to determine
which doctors are most likely to be sued for malpractice. Some
studies have suggested that bedside manner is the most effective
tool for preventing litigation; other experts have found that
lawsuits do not seem to be linked to actual incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists have added a new piece of data to the puzzle of
medical litigation. According to University of Iowa researchers,
family doctors with the most impressive credentials were most
likely to be sued.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined the malpractice records of family doctors who
practiced in Florida for a year or more from 1971 to 1994 and found
that doctors who possessed better qualifications, like board
certification, residency training and various medical honors, were
more likely to be involved in malpractice suits than their peers
without those credentials and awards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, male doctors and those who practiced in nonurban
areas were more likely to be sued than female doctors and those
practicing in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John W. Ely, associate professor of family medicine at the
University of Iowa, speculated that more experienced, board
certified doctors might be taking care of sicker patients.
``Therefore, they may have worse outcomes and expose themselves to
a higher risk of being sued for those adverse outcomes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Physicians who have poor interpersonal skills are
seen as cold and uncaring and are more likely to be sued for
malpractice. It's possible the physicians with the worst
interpersonal skills had the most experience and knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least,'' Ely continued, ``the study casts doubt on
whether you can use a history of frequent malpractice suits, or
any, as a way to judge a physician's skill.''

   HAZY MEMORIES OF CHATS WITH CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   Parents, therapists and police officers who give hearsay
testimony in court about young children's statements may not be
reliable witnesses, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears this month in The Journal of
Experimental Psychology, found that although adults usually can
recall the gist of a conversation they have had with a child, they
have difficulty remembering the exact wording or the structure of
the conversation. They are also likely to remember incorrectly
whether information was offered spontaneously by the child or
elicited through questions, and to confuse specific statements they
made themselves with statements made by the child.
</P>
<P>
   Courts often accept adults' reports of conversations with
children as if they are entirely accurate, said the lead author of
the study, Dr. Maggie Bruck, a psychologist who is an associate
professor in the psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins University
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four mothers with preschool-age children took part in the
study. The children spent 20 minutes playing in a separate room
without their mothers present. Afterward, the mothers were
videotaped while interviewing their children about the play
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Half the mothers were told that that they were participating in
a memory experiment and that they should try to remember the
conversation as exactly as possible. The other half were told that
the research concerned mother-child conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the mothers were tested to see how accurately
they recalled the interview. Even the mothers who were warned ahead
of time omitted large parts of the conversations when they tried to
reconstruct them. They also made significant errors when they were
asked to identify passages in a transcript of the interview that
had been altered by the researchers. They often incorrectly
attributed statements they had made themselves to their children,
and were unaware of how many questions they had asked to elicit
information.
</P>
<P>
   The results, the researchers conclude, ``raise concern about
hearsay testimony that is provided by adults about prior
conversations with young children.''

 By MARK GREEN WITH NANCY YOUMAN  
 From ``The Consumer Bible,'' published by Workman Publishing 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even before Chief Justice Marshall declared in 1819 that ``the
power to tax is the power to destroy,'' taxes had been this
country's great obsession. Political careers are lost for
supporting them; millionaires go to prison for evading them. And
the rest of us _ the ``little people,'' in Leona Helmsley's
immortal words _ are left to sweat and fret as April 15 looms near.
 &HT;    Some 115 million Americans dutifully file their income tax
returns with the Internal Revenue Service each year. Slightly over
half of taxpayers choose to go through this painful ritual alone,
sitting at the kitchen table with paper, pencil and eraser or at
the computer answering questions from a tax preparation software
program, and measuring the extent of the damage. The rest, due to
fear or financial complexity, seek solace or savings by hiring a
tax preparer.
 &HT;    Finding the right professional can truly be a taxing task. There
is no national standard or educational requirement for tax
preparers: All you need to do is click your ruby shoes together
three times and murmur, ``I am a tax preparer'' et voila, you can
hang out a shingle and get down to business. Only California and
Oregon have qualifying guidelines.
 &HT;    And while fiscal laws are in a constant flux, one in seven
preparers has in recent years canceled subscriptions to tax
information services that help keep accountants up-to-date. The
result: U.S. taxpayers demanded $100 million in damages from
certified public accountants in 1992, according to the chief
insurance liability underwriter for the accounting industry.
 &HT;    Therefore you need to take some time to find the right person to
take care of your financial health, if you choose not to do it
yourself. Step one is to decide if you'll prepare your tax return
yourself or go for professional help.
 &HT;    If your tax situation changed little since last year, or if you
have only a few pieces of information _ one or two W-2s, some
interest and investment income, and a mortgage deduction _ consider
sitting down at home one weekend with pen, pencil, coffee and
calculator and slogging through until it's done.
 &HT;    As one business journalist who has done his own taxes for 20
years explains, ``I go it alone because of an absolute conviction
that no outsider will take as much care with my return as I will,
no matter how big the fee.''
 &HT;    You should be able to knock off your return in an afternoon.
According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 3 hours and 27
minutes to prepare a 1040 Form, plus two more hours for forms
listing itemized deductions and capital gains and losses.
 &HT;    If you decide to go it alone, the IRS offers free help with
publications, phone hotlines and walk-in centers. While telephone
assistance has been notoriously unreliable, the rate of technical
accuracy had reached 89 percent by 1993, up from 78 percent in
1991.
 &HT;    In addition, call your local IRS office to find out about
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance, a program that offers free
assistance to low-income taxpayers, the disabled, non-English
speakers and, in conjunction with the American Association of
Retired Persons, low- and moderate-income citizens 60 years and up.
 &HT;    Consider also investing in a tax guidebook or, if you have a
computer, a software program.
 TAX PREPARATION SOFTWARE  
 &HT;    It may not be the most fun you'll have on your computer, but
various companies now offer tax preparation software, both in
stores and on the Internet, to replace the pencil and eraser of
old.
 &HT;    Three programs dominate the market. Turbo Tax (and its Macintosh
counterpart, Macintax) and Personal Tax Edge, both by Intuit, Inc.,
which controls 80 percent of the market, and Kiplinger Tax Cut, by
the folks responsible for your neighborhood H&AMP;R Block storefront.
 &HT;    All three follow a question-and-answer interview format similar
to how a flesh-and-blood preparer operates; all three are
reasonably user friendly; all three enable you to test different
scenarios to maximize your savings; and all three have become quite
affordable.
 &HT;    The downsides: The existing programs can be less than accurate
for complicated returns (with Turbo Tax getting the best results in
a Consumer Reports survey). They take a generally conservative
approach to the tax code, which may not suit more aggressive
taxpayers.
 &HT;    And, as one skeptic points out, ``impressive as some software
is, it can't put on a suit and wave your receipts in front of an
IRS auditor.''
 &HT;    Finally, it is worth noting that in a Consumer Reports survey of
26,000 readers, it took software users an average of nine hours to
prepare their taxes, as opposed to five hours for pencil-and-paper
proponents. However, to be fair, the former often faced more
complicated returns.
 A GOOD TAX PREPARER IS HARD TO FIND  
 &HT;    If your tax return is reasonably complex or if you need
professional backup, help is available. But not all tax preparers
are equally qualified.
 &HT;    Each year, Money magazine asks 50 tax preparers to calculate
taxes owed by a hypothetical household. In 1997, none of the 45
respondents came up with the same figure _ and none came up with
the magic number of $42,336, the figure calculated by the expert
who prepared the test.
 &HT;    Answers ranged from $36,322 to $94,438. Less than one in four
respondents came within $1,000 of the correct answer. In addition,
there was no correlation between the fees charged and the accuracy
of the returns.
 &HT;    A few pointed queries should help you come up with the right
person for the job. First, find out about prospects' professional
background. Ask how preparers stay current on tax developments _ do
they read specialized journals or attend seminars? As always,
recommendations from family, friends or colleagues are a good place
to start.
 &HT;    Find out if your preparer shares your financial philosophy _
whether he or she will aggressively push the legal envelope or act
in a conservative fashion.
 &HT;    Finally, ask how the fee is computed. Storefront preparers
generally charge based on the number of forms; enrolled agents and
CPAs, on an hourly basis. Steer clear if the fee is calculated
based on the size of your income rather than the complexity of your
return. Don't forget to ask if your preparer will reimburse you for
errors that result in interest or penalties.
 &HT;    Most important, look for someone whose skills march the
complexity of your return. Just as you wouldn't hire Albert
Einstein to tutor your child in fourth-grade math, you don't need a
CPA from one of the Big Six accounting firms to file a 1040EZ (for
``easy'') form. At the same time, you don't want to hire a rookie
if you're playing in the big leagues.
 &HT;    Tax professionals break down into four categories:
 &HT;    + Storefront preparers provide the best bang for the buck if
your filing is fairly straightforward (only a few documents).
Because anyone can claim to be a tax preparer, make sure to check a
prospective preparer's qualifications. You're probably in good
hands if you go to one of the large national chains.
 &HT;    H&AMP;R Block, which files one in seven U.S. tax returns, requires
all its employees to complete annual 11-week courses. For an
average of $50, you can expect a solid, straightforward job _ but
no fancy accounting to jazz up your refunds.
 &HT;    Unlike enrolled agents, CPAs and tax attorneys, storefront
operators cannot represent you at an IRS audit. Large chains,
however, will generally send a preparer to accompany you to the IRS
if your return is audited.
 &HT;    For business returns or complicated personal returns _ if you
sold a house, got married or divorced, want to claim depreciation
of assets or had partnership income last year _ consider going to a
more thoroughly trained professional. There are three kinds:
 &HT;    + Enrolled agents are certified to practice before the IRS after
having either worked at the IRS for a minimum of five years or
passed a rigorous two-day exam (only 30 percent pass). They are
skilled at navigating the system and can handle most functions a
CPA would serve, including complex tax returns, financial planning
and representing you at an audit, often for up to one-half to
one-third less than a CPA would charge.
 &HT;    + Certified public accountants, like enrolled agents, should be
considered for complex filings _ especially if your situation
involves large investment portfolios, business interests, trusts or
self-employment plans. CPAs may be especially valuable for
financial and tax planning.
 &HT;    But while all CPAs have some tax training, not all are experts
on individual returns. And while they are required to take 80 hours
of continuing education courses every two years to maintain their
CPA designation, they may do so in a field unrelated to your needs.
 &HT;    + Tax lawyers are the industry's 800-pound gorillas. They
generally do not assist in the preparation of individual returns
but rather intervene in complex issues like divorce settlements or
more adversarial IRS audits.
 &HT;    
 SIDEBAR: HOW TO GET HELP  
 &HT;    + To get free assistance from the IRA, call (800) 829-1040 or
your local IRS office. The hearing-impaired with TDD equipment
should call (800) 829-4059.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the American Institute for Certified
Public Accountants in your area, call (800) 862-4272.
 &HT;    + For a list of members of the National Association of Enrolled
Agents in your area, call (800) 424-4339.
 &HT;    + The IRS puts out more than a hundred useful booklets,
including Publication 1, ``Your Rights as a Taxpayer,'' Publication
17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' and Publication 910, ``Guide to
Free Tax Services.''
 &HT;    + Several organizations _ such as Consumer Reports, H&AMP;R Block,
Ernst &AMP; Young, etc. _ put out annual tax preparation guides. For
$15 or $20, these guides can help you prepare even moderately
complex returns.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow fell on Sunday evening into early Monday across
northern Pennsylvania and central New York as vigorous low pressure
moved through New England into southeast Canada. Up to 14 inches of
snow accumulated in some areas. Meanwhile, on the warm side of the
system, drenching rains and gusty winds lashed southeast New
England.
</P>
<P>
   A much more tranquil day will occur in the Northeast Tuesday as
weak high pressure slides off the Maryland coastline. Abundant
sunshine and light breezes will grace much of central and southern
New England and the Great Lakes states. Clouds and snow showers
will persist, though, in the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Weak low pressure will support scattered rain showers from
southern Ohio to the Texas Gulf Coast as it moves quickly eastward.
A few thunderstorms are even possible in east Texas and Louisiana
Tuesday evening as an advancing cold front acts to lift warm, humid
air over the region.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will provide much of the Rocky Mountain states and
desert Southwest with sunshine and mild readings. Some showers and
high elevation snows will fall, however, in northern Nevada and
southern Idaho as a disturbance moves eastward.
</P>
<P>
   An advancing storm system will bring increasing clouds and late
day showers to coastal areas in the Pacific Northwest. Snow will
blanket the Cascades above 4,000 feet, while the valleys of eastern
Washington and Oregon will be mainly dry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it will be generally sunny in southern California
with seasonal temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Syracuse Snow
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse, N.Y., is the only large city in the Northeast whose
annual average snowfall is at least 100 inches. Principally,
lake-effect snows fall throughout the winter as cold air moistened
in transit over the ice-resistant waters of Lake Ontario is lifted
over the rolling hills of upstate New York. Snow also falls from
low-pressure systems moving north up the Hudson River Valley. All
told, the average annual snowfall in Syracuse is just over 110
inches. Monday, nearly 4 inches of new snow fell, bringing the
seasonal total to 97.6 inches. More snow will arrive late this
week.

 By RUTH SHERMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Every year April 15 rears its ugly head, and I'm never ready.
You would think, since for years the IRS has celebrated this date
as its annual tax festival, that I would be prepared. You would be
wrong. Luckily, I know I am not alone. That's clear from the
monumental increase in Valium and aspirin consumption at this time
of year.
 &HT;    I begin thinking about filing taxes at the beginning of the year
when the tax forms supplant Christmas catalogs in the mailbox. Of
course, the forms are thrown on a pile on the desk with the feeling
that there's plenty of time. The due date looms someplace far off
down a misty path.
 &HT;    In February, public service announcements emphasize filing
early. There is talk about electronic filing. Mailers arrive
touting TurboTax and other software of the same ilk. W-2s and 1099s
keep arriving in the mail. You look at them, idly speculating on
why so much is taken out each year. For a moment there is a twinge
of recognition of an urgent task. But the feeling soon passes.
 &HT;    March is a lovely month. Spring is coming. You begin to think
about getting out and buying some new clothes. You think about that
CD player you want, that, in fact, you certainly deserve (you
WORKED for it, after all). You throw on your coat and head out to
the nearest electronics emporium. The tax forms by this time have
fallen into a pile under the desk.
 &HT;    On April 1, you have the feeling of impending trouble. You know
it's not your allergies (that's usually a May-June ritual). By
April 10 reality dawns: It's tax time.
 &HT;    Usually this epiphany comes about in one of two ways: A
co-worker sidles over to you and, with a barely contained smirk,
informs you that not only did she file her taxes January 1, but she
also already got back a big, fat refund that was immediately
invested in Electro-Silico Intercom International stock that
already has brought in a tidy profit of at least $15,000 (and
counting).
 &HT;    The second way? Tripping over a pile of tax forms leaking out
from under your desk.
 &HT;    No matter how the news gets through, what ensues is total,
unremitting PANIC. Where are those receipts? Why didn't I get those
W-2s? Papers start flying. Drawers are emptied out. Chaos reigns.
It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    This year, I have vowed to take steps to help ease tax time
trauma. In the spirit of good fellowship, I now offer them to you:
 &HT;    1. Make up file folders that you keep in one drawer in your
desk, clearly labeled with the tax year, with specified
subcategories (e.g., charitable contributions, medical expenses,
stocks, dividends, etc.). Whenever a critical piece of paper starts
floating around, catch it and put it into the relevant file. Now go
out and play.
 &HT;    2. Put all tax information forms into one folder.
 &HT;    3. During the year make sure all records, on paper or computer,
are kept up-to-date (this means your checkbook, too). All bank
statements should also be put into a separate file. (How does it
feel to actually behave like a grownup?)
 &HT;    4. If you use a tax preparer to do the real work of processing
your taxes, contact him or her in advance and talk over what will
be needed, and when you will have to deliver it. Keep a record of
what you are turning over and make copies of forms for your files.
 &HT;    5. If you live your life through your computer, right about the
time you're breaking open the holiday fudge is the time to put in
the order for the federal and state software you'll need for
completing your taxes. All forms are included in the software,
which then frees up one paper file that you can use for all those
long-winded Christmas letters you mean to answer but never do.
 &HT;    6. If electronic filing appeals to you, make sure you understand
all the instructions, since it can be a bit tricky. If you don't
understand it, you can call the IRS for further information.
 &HT;    7. Circle April 15 on your calendar and on that day get up, get
out and go directly to the post office. After mailing your tax
return, don't forget to stop off for the mandatory chocolate
truffles _ you earned them!
 &HT;    Now you are free to take the time to think about more important
things, like solving mysteries of the universe such as why cereal
boxes have to be ``allowed to settle'' so they're only
three-quarters full when you buy them, and why taking one bite of
dinner instantaneously triggers at least 17 telephone sales
solicitations.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Spring in America is a pretty mixed bag. On the one hand,
springtime means gardens and baseball and hours of extra daylight.
On the other hand, just as the weather turns fair and we yearn to
get out of the house, it's time for the annual downer: filing
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Few things in history are as hated as taxes. Across cultures and
classes and entire millennia, people have feared them, resented
them and hunted for ways not to pay them. But no matter how
fiercely resented, they don't go away.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ben Franklin's dictum _ ``in this world, nothing is
certain but death and taxes'' _ has been true since the earliest
dawn of recorded time.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes are at least 5,000 years old. In fact, one of the major
reasons that the Sumerians _ the world's first great civilization,
and the inventors of writing _ developed writing at all was because
priests and kings wished to keep better track of mandatory tax
payments to temple and throne. (It was also the Sumerians who
invented history's first tax receipt _ a clay tablet, carefully
scratched _ in anticipation, perhaps, of history's first tax
audit.)
</P>
<P>
   As civilization spread through the ancient world, so too did
taxes, sometimes by tithing (voluntary and not), sometimes by
excise duties, and sometimes _ the grimmest times _ by imposing
slave labor. Direct taxes also were often invoked, although with
caveats: While directly taxing a Roman citizen was considered
insulting, it was all right to tax the province (which is why, in
Luke 2:1, a pre-tax census is taking place).
</P>
<P>
   Taxation in medieval Europe was fairly hit-and-miss, with formal
taxes tending to be imposed only during crises. An example was the
so-called ``Saladin tithe,'' imposed to raise money for France and
England to overthrow the sultan Saladin during the Third Crusade;
once the crusade petered out, so did the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Medieval Europe marks the very last time taxes were not too
terribly taxing. From the 15th century on, as governments grew
larger and more expensive, taxes became ongoing, and the need for
collection more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the attempt to expand collections in the colonies
sparked resentment, then revolution. While taxes alone did not
cause the American Revolution, they certainly kickstarted the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The colonists despised England's power to tax them, less because
of the revenue loss (actually fairly light) than because the Sugar
Act and the Stamp Act reminded the colonists, each time they paid,
how unfree they were.
</P>
<P>
   With taxation so touchy a topic, the Founders were, not
surprisingly, rather vague on the subject when framing the
Constitution, content to allow this hot potato to cool off in the
hands of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   The first federal income tax appeared in America during the
Civil War. The North imposed a 3 percent tax on incomes above $600,
reaching 5 percent for incomes above $10,000 (predictably, these
rates later rose). One interesting provision of Civil War taxes was
that taxpayers' names were routinely published in the local paper,
along with amount paid. This created an excruciating dilemma:
Obviously, the less tax you paid, the less money out of your pocket
_ but then, the less good your finances looked in the eyes of your
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   While the war was in progress, there was little griping about
the income tax; there was plenty afterwards, though, especially in
the Northeast, where most of the nation's power and wealth resided.
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, East Coast congressmen tossed it out and replaced it
with tariffs on products which just happened to be manufactured in
their states. These tariffs was bitterly resented in the west _
``the west'' being anywhere west of the Alleghenies _ where
manufacturing was minimal and incomes in general far too low to
have to pay much income tax anyway. Soon the stage was set was an
east-west battle of wills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, a second income tax became law; two years later, the
Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This ruling galvanized
sectional feeling, the pro-tariff east howling that the west's
continued enthusiasm for an income tax betrayed ``communistic
leanings,'' and the pro-income tax west howling back how the
country was being taken over by its 4,000 known millionaires and
their ``whorish lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   A move arose, supported by Democrats, Populists and progressive
Republicans, for a third income tax _ this one's constitutional
legality to be guaranteed by means of an amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over an income tax amendment became, very swiftly,
a hot political issue. Those opposed to the tax (Teddy Roosevelt's
``malefactors of great wealth'') took the position _ sound
familiar? _ that taxes were unfair because they punished success
and rewarded failure.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of income tax (``the idle, the lazy, the
shiftless,'' according to their opponents) argued _ also familiarly
_ that wealth in America was becoming too concentrated, and taxes
would help to level the moneybags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, an amendment _ No. 16 _ was ratified by the necessary
36 states. Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with a $3,000
($4,000 for married couples) exemption. With personal income in
1913 averaging $621, the 16th Amendment clearly was something not
meant to apply to most people _ only the well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
   This situation didn't last. In 1913, less than 5 percent of the
population filed tax returns; by 1919, this number had nearly
doubled; by the end of World War II, close to half the American
public was filing. And it's never been that low since.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 160 million tax returns will be filed.
What's more, the whole rigmarole of taxation _ 1040s, W-2s, lO99s _
has become so common and shared an experience that complaining
about it, once thought highly uncouth, is now a conversational
icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes, like springtime, have become accepted as part of the
natural order _ even if, at best, it's the most grudging acceptance
humanly possible.

 By MARK ALBRECHT AND THOMAS RAY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We remember receiving a panicked call on a Friday afternoon from
a self-employed marketing consultant. Without warning, the IRS had
put a levy on his checking account, causing his rent check and
other payments to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   He had avoided doing his tax return one year while working on a
major project and missed the tax deadline. Even with the best
intentions of filing the return, something had always gotten in his
way. Although this happened very innocently, he was frightened and
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   During our first meeting, he confided that the tax problem had
actually started earlier. He had not filed his tax returns for the
previous seven years and the IRS presented him with a bill for
$12,000. Because he was living from month to month, there was
little hope that he could ever pay off the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   After further research, we found that the IRS had computed his
tax bill for him, without including any deductions. Using legal
deductions, we prepared the returns and most of them resulted in
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Our client was ecstatic when we informed him that he actually
owed just $1,000 and would soon be free to get on with his life.
Although the bill could not be paid in full, we still negotiated an
affordable $25 monthly payment plan and the IRS finally agreed to
release the levy on his checking account, allowing his rent and
other bills to be paid in time. Thankfully, this story had a happy
ending, but it also teaches us to care for our tax matters before
they become serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   When April 15th rolls around, nearly 20 percent of the taxpaying
population will owe Uncle Sam for current and back taxes with
little or no ability to pay their bill. These are not bad or
dishonest people. Tax troubles are often triggered by poor cash
flow stemming from unintentional circumstances such as a business
failure, job layoff, divorce or health problems. Chances are you or
someone you know will face a sizable tax bill, property lien, wage
or bank garnishment or even a seizure of valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is desperate to settle over $200 billion in back taxes
and utilizes aggressive collection techniques to reduce its
receivables. In some businesses, IRS wage garnishments on an
employee will result in termination. Countless loyal Americans feel
forced to hide in the underground cash economy.
</P>
<P>
   If you have been avoiding a tax problem, there is only one
effective alternative. Simply stop worrying and negotiate. You will
not go to jail or lose your house unless you have been convicted of
tax fraud. So don't worry!
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate options by which you can reach a settlement
without causing unreasonable hardship. You may even be able to
eliminate the tax bill or at least have it greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Your first option in handling an IRS tax problem is a monthly
payment plan called an Installment Agreement, where the balance is
paid off over three to five years. The payment amount is based on
strict IRS formulas calculating your ability to pay. At best, an
Installment Agreement puts you into a safe harbor by stopping the
collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   As part of your agreement, you will make your monthly payment
plus file and pay your taxes on time. If you fail to comply, the
collection pressure returns and you are back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that it is an expensive loan with a current
effective rate of over 17 percent in interest and penalties. Plus,
if the tax bill is large enough and requires three or more years to
pay off, the IRS may attach a lien to your assets as protection.
</P>
<P>
   The next option, called Offer in Compromise, entails a dollar
settlement with the IRS. Sometimes you can pay less than 10 cents
on the dollar for your settlement without undue harm to your credit
report. The amount of your offer is based on your net worth plus a
factor of your monthly disposable income. It is always wise to
offer payment in one lump sum. The IRS also weighs factors such as
your age, health, education and future earning potential.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the complex OIC process takes six to nine months if
handled by a competent tax professional. Thorough analysis and
proper planning of your financial and tax situation should be done
before contacting the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Upon acceptance of the OIC, you must also file returns and pay
any owed taxes on time for a period of five years. Failure to do so
will nullify the settlement, and the old tax problem will come back
in full with accrued interest and penalties. Annual tax planning is
especially important during this probationary period to ensure full
compliance and freedom from collection pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Your final option is the dismissal of taxes in Chapter 7
bankruptcy. The IRS is given three years to collect the tax before
you can file Chapter 7. However, if your financial profile is too
strong and tax liens are attached to your assets, then the taxes
may not be dismissible.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative route is Chapter 13, which enables you to pay
back the IRS and creditors, usually over three years, while keeping
assets and income protected.
</P>
<P>
   A bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for a period of
seven to 10 years. Yet with steady income and no new credit
problems, it is now possible to be worthy of new credit and
financing after just six months. However, proposed changes in
bankruptcy laws will make it very difficult to discharge taxes.
Should you decide to take this route, you would be wise to move
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do first? Get advice from an experienced tax
professional. After all, we are talking about the IRS. You are
extremely vulnerable in competing against a seasoned collection
officer and there is no time to master an understanding of the
numerous technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to save money, many people undertake this process
alone and find themselves in more costly situations. This is
clearly a time when you want representation to protect your best
interests. A licensed CPA or enrolled agent can save you
considerable amounts of money, time and hassles without costing a
small fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the negotiating process, you can now make an
honest evaluation of your finances and prepare a realistic monthly
budget. Regardless of your situation, it is also important to
budget your projected tax liability correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-employed taxpayers have the additional burden of staying
current with their quarterly estimated tax payments. Have your tax
consultant prepare a quarterly tax projection to ensure that there
are no surprises at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Try to think of your estimated tax payment as an additional
monthly overhead cost such as rent or phone. To help you to stay in
compliance with the IRS, the monthly budgeting process is a simple
yet highly effective tool which can also generate savings for a
more prosperous future.

 &HT;    International Soccer Notes: Keegan making moves, raising
eyebrows as interim coach
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Keegan's four-game interim stint as England manager gets
underway Saturday with his club in critical condition for next
year's European Championships. England, still reeling from the
contentious dismissal of Glenn Hoddle last month, needs a win over
visiting Poland (10 a.m., Pay-Per-View) to have a realistic chance
of getting out of its qualifying group. Poland and Sweden lead with
six points apiece, while England has four points.
</P>
<P>
   The national side also is seeking a dose of stability after
Hoddle was let go because of impolitic statements about the
disabled. However, Keegan, named last month to a caretaking role,
won't be around long enough to see it through because of his
commitment to coach second-division London club Fulham.
</P>
<P>
   But Keegan already has turned some heads, naming warring Premier
League stars Robbie Fowler and Graeme Le Saux to the squad. And he
hasn't dismissed reports that his wife is training to become a
faith healer. Hoddle generated media derision last summer for
saying in his World Cup autobiography that his only regret was not
bringing faith healer Eileen Drewery with the club to France.
</P>
<P>
   England: Man Utd. bid questioned
</P>
<P>
   The British Mergers and Monopolies Commission last week ruled
that Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB is not acting in the public interest in
its $1 billion offer to purchase Manchester United. Trade secretary
Stephen Byers will have the final say. The deal has been protested
because of BSkyB holds live coverage rights for the English Premier
League. . . . Tottenham Hotspur, playing a man down, won the
Worthington (English League) Cup final 1-0 over Leicester City on
Sunday. Allan Nielsen scored on a diving header three minutes into
second half stoppage time. Spurs also have qualified for the F.A.
Cup semifinal. . . . Arsenal, trying to repeat its Premier League
and F.A. Cup double, beat Coventry City 2-0 in league action on
Saturday. The Gunners, who have reached the F.A Cup semifinals, are
unbeaten in their last 17 league and cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Zidane injures knee
</P>
<P>
   Juventus midfielder Zinedine Zidane might miss both Champions'
League semifinal legs against Manchester United after injuring a
knee last week against Olympiakos. . . . Inter Milan manager Mircea
Lucescu resigned after his club was routed 4-0 by lowly Sampdoria
on Sunday. The loss followed Inter's elimination from the
Champions' League. . . . Lazio striker Christian Vieri has a broken
toe that might keep him out of Italy's Euro 2000 qualifier against
Denmark on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Elber out for year
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich, which apparently has the Bundesliga crown all but
wrapped up, will be without top scorer Giovanne Elber for the
Champions' League semifinals with Dynamo Kyiv because of a knee
injury. . . . Germany coach Erich Ribbeck named six Bayern players
to his 22-man squad for two Euro 2000 qualifiers in the coming
week.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Barca pads lead
</P>
<P>
   Dutchman Philip Cocu had two goals as Barcelona extended its
lead in the Primera Division with a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad. . .

being ousted at his current position in charge of Real Betis. He
and high-priced Brazilian playmaker Denilson have been at odds all
season.
</P>
<P>
   MLS: Fire hot in opener
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Chicago Fire opened the season Saturday with
a 3-1 win over San Jose. The Fire prevailed without forward Roman
Kosecki, who is suspended for two more games for allegedly spitting
on a referee during an exhibition. . . . Former D.C. United and
U.S. captain John Harkes has left England's Nottingham Forest and
has reported to the New England Revolution, which received him in a
trade last month. . . . Former MLS deputy commissioner Sunil
Gulati, ousted after re-signing Tab Ramos to the MetroStars without
the team's permission, has been named a consultant to the league.
Terms of his new duties were not specified.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five years of fighting with former manager Daniel
Passarella, Argentine midfielder Fernando Redondo has been recalled
to the national team. Redondo, the Real Madrid regular, will play
in a friendly next week against the Netherlands. He missed the
World Cup last year for defying Passarella's orders to cut his long
hair. Passarella also banned homosexuals and players with earrings.
. . . The Confederation of African Football has removed Zimbabwe as
hosts of next year's African Nations' Cup because of concerns about
playing facilities. The 16-country event will be played in Nigeria
and Ghana instead.

BENIGNI'S OSCAR GIVES A LIFT TO A TOWN AND AN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OSCAR-RDP, OSCAR-TV-REVIEW) 
(af) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ It was 4 a.m. when the news hit the Casa del Popolo, a
social center in Vergaio, Roberto Benigni's hometown in Tuscany. As
a giant screen, set up for the evening, showed the Italian
filmmaker joyously bounding up onto the backs of seats at the
Academy Awards ceremony, thousands of local supporters outside the
Casa del Popolo jumped up and down and screamed ``Ha vinto!'' (``He
won!'') in a perfect synchrony of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   By winning three Oscars for ``Life Is Beautiful,'' his comedy
set during the Holocaust, Italy's most popular comic became the
country's most important movie figure overnight. For Italian
cinema, which has been in an artistic and commercial slump for many
years, Benigni's recognition by Hollywood was a badly needed shot
in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   A few other Italian films, like ``Cinema Paradiso'' and
``Mediterraneo,'' have won the award for best foreign film. ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' however, was not just a critical success but a
commercial one: the biggest box office success in the United States
of any Italian film yet.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, Benigni, 46, is the first
non-English speaker to win the best-actor award, competing against
some of the best-known stars in Hollywood. Only a few Italian
actresses have won similar honors: Anna Magnani won a best-actress
award for a 1955 Hollywood film, ``The Rose Tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Loren also won an Oscar for best actress, for the Italian
film ``Two Women'' in 1961. On Sunday night, when Ms. Loren
presented Benigni with his Oscar for best foreign film, she
joyously shouted, ``Roberto!'' when she opened the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, it was almost as if Italy had won a World Cup soccer
match or a war. Benigni's Oscars led all the news programs, with
such descriptions as ``historical event'' and a ``triumph for
Italy.'' Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema expressed ``his great
personal satisfaction'' with Benigni's success. ``This is an honor
for Italian cinema and culture, as well a great personal success
for Benigni,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   Italian film critics mostly saw it as a long-needed jolt for
other Italian directors. ``The film is an extraordinary
phenomenon,'' said Tullio Kezich, a film critic for the daily
Corriere della Sera. ``Very few Italian films are critically
acclaimed and also do well in the international market, and Benigni
has shown that it can be done. The question is whether other
directors will learn the lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Italian films are like Albanian films: their appeal stops
at the border,'' he added. ``You can make money producing silly
slapstick comedies, but if you want to make something more serious
and lasting, then the example of Benigni is extremely important.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian directors expressed gratitude to Benigni, saying
his success could help revive the Italian film world. ``After 8 to
10 years of crisis, in which there was widespread disaffection
toward our cinema, which was sincerely mediocre,'' said Gillo
Pontecorvo, the director of ``The Battle of Algiers'' in 1966,
``this overwhelming success is a positive sign that comes at a time
where we see fragile signs of renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles Benigni savored his triumph. His film, nominated
in seven categories, also won an Oscar for best original dramatic
score, composed by Nicola Piovani. In his acceptance speech,
Benigni, a co-writer of the screenplay and the director of the
film, made a point of mentioning his parents in Tuscany, who have
become local celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to thank my parents in Vergaio,'' he said, ``who
gave me the greatest gift: poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The director's father, Luigi Benigni, 80, actually helped
inspire the film. After Italy changed sides in 1943, Luigi Benigni,
a poor Tuscan farm worker, ended up in a German labor camp where he
almost starved to death. In the film, Benigni's character invents
an elaborate game inside a German concentration camp to shield his
son from its horrors and to keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni said it was his father's experience _ and the sometimes
comic way he described it to his children _ that helped the
director shape his characters and plot. ``He told us about it, but
as if to protect me and my sisters, he told it in an almost funny
way,'' Benigni said in an interview last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Benigni grew up in Vergaio in postwar poverty, a class
clown and child prodigy. His parents and his three older doting
sisters encouraged his artistic bent, and after moving to Rome in
1972, he quickly made a name for himself in Italy's avant-garde
experimental theater.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, his one-man shows, risque and politically
savage, made him a cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``Johnny Stecchino'' and ``Il Mostro,'' slapstick
farces centering on his hapless comic persona, made him Italy's
biggest star and top moneymaker. But until ``Life Is Beautiful,''
Benigni was not widely known in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 he starred in ``Son of the Pink Panther,'' which did
poorly at the box office. Mostly, American audiences knew him for
his performances in Jim Jarmusch's 1986 film ``Down by Law'' and
his 1991 film ``Night on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Italian newspapers and particularly television news programs
are proudly showing how Benigni is being lionized by Hollywood
stars. The playwright Dario Fo, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize in
Literature, said he was proud of Benigni's victory. ``The fact that
he won an Oscar because he is considered the best actor in the
world is exalting,'' Fo said. ``He has shown that laughter is not a
lack of seriousness. On the contrary. Irony and lightness are one
of the highest forms of intelligence.''

OSCAR AFTERMATH: AND THE WINNER IS NOT ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geena Davis, the host of ABC's first-ever Oscar pre-show, asked
Helen Hunt about having won an Academy Award. ``Did you have the
same experience I did, that when they called your name you went,
like, out of body?'' she asked, sounding out of her body at that
very moment, not to mention out of her mind. What possessed her to
take this inane job, in which she stood on a set inside the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion looking at a huge monitor that showed the red
carpet arrivals outside? Reading robotically from a teleprompter,
she said, ``It's so much fun to catch our first glimpse of the
stars as they arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure. She must have loved the tacit admission that she was
not out there being interviewed with all the nominees. She must
have been lured by the humongous television audience the Academy
Awards and its satellite shows usually draw, no matter how tiresome
or long the ceremony (a record-breaking four hours this year). As
the pre-show pointed out, this year's television broadcast would be
seen in 117 countries. As it did not point out, ABC got $1 million
for a 30-second commercial, for the pre-show as well as the
ceremony. And no one could have guessed going in that the ratings
would take an unexpected but well-deserved tumble. (Despite being
moved to Sunday from Monday the broadcast's ratings were down at
least 10 percent from last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Bloated self-importance is an Oscar television tradition, and
this year viewers got nothing less as ABC turned the Academy Awards
into more of a made-for-television event than ever. Ms. Davis'
ill-conceived half-hour, called ``Sunday at the Oscars,'' was part
of a package intended to milk every last commercial dollar from an
evening that began with the traditional Barbara Walters special
(shown after the awards on the West Coast), and went on with the
Davis show. After the ceremony, there was an hourlong Oscar episode
of ``Politically Incorrect.'' All of it displayed the sincerity
that makes the Oscar-watching experience predictable and unique:
television provides laughable solemnity and viewers sit around
making up their own jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis show was so awkward, though, with the host alternately
giddy and stiff, that it wasn't even funny. It blatantly tried to
steal the attention other pre-shows have gotten in recent years,
notably Joan Rivers' talked-about but increasingly mean-spirited
show on the E! channel. This past weekend's ``Saturday Night Live''
shrewdly parodied it by having Ms. Rivers turn into a shrieking
vampire as she interviewed arriving stars. The Rivers show is known
for hyping fashion designers by asking stars, ``Who are you
wearing?'' as if viewers care. In truth, viewers live with the
slender hope that when a nominee is asked that other standard
question, ``How are you feeling?'' someone will finally break down
and admit, ``I feel rotten: I'm going to lose!''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Moret of CNN was borrowed to do the red carpet interviews
during ABC's pre-show. (Other channels were not allowed to
broadcast live during that half-hour.) He actually said, ``Oh,
look, here's Roberto Benigni,'' as if it were a surprise when the
actor walked before the cameras. ``Thank you, Jeem,'' Benigni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barbara Walters Special'' was a more enjoyable Rorschach
test. You could take it seriously if you liked; or you could
observe that Celine Dion's house featured gilt-and-brocade chairs
and a marble floor under a long colonnade. What better prelude to
the Oscars than this silent testament to tacky excess? A
white-haired Elizabeth Taylor, who looked as if she had borrowed
one of Phyllis Diller's wigs, said her hair had ``grown in
platinum'' after surgery for a brain tumor. Apparently in Hollywood
platinum blond is considered a naturally occurring color.
</P>
<P>
   During the first commercial break in the Walters special, you
could have flipped to E! and seen Gwyneth Paltrow and Ian McKellen
being interviewed as they arrived. During the second commercial
break you could have flipped to CNN and seen Gwyneth Paltrow and
Ian McKellen being interviewed as they were still arriving.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony itself was stuffed with all the elements
viewers have come to expect: the songs no one has ever heard, the
dance number that made no sense (a flamenco to celebrate the
Italian World War II film ``Life Is Beautiful''), and, this year,
so many obituary tributes the show threatened to become the
all-dead-stars Oscars. But however much viewers carp, high ratings
in the past gave the producers no motive to change. If they had
wanted something younger, hipper and livelier they would have hired
Conan O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become a tradition for the host to do a terrific
opening and for the show to move steadily downhill. Whoopi Goldberg
made her hilarious entrance dressed as Elizabeth I, in
Kabuki-white-face makeup, announcing, ``I am the African queen.''
She was easy to take, despite an overload of weak double-entendre
jokes. It wasn't her fault that as the evening dragged on you could
count the truly exciting moments. A highlight was Benigni, going up
to accept his award for best foreign film for ``Life Is Beautiful''
by standing on the top of his seat, climbing over Billy Bob
Thornton's head and literally hopping up the steps. Unlike most of
Hollywood, he realized that this was a night that demanded a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious moment, the controversial lifetime achievement
award to Elia Kazan, who informed on friends during the McCarthy
years, was anti-climactic and notable for its swiftness as the
camera swept the audience to see who was standing (Warren Beatty)
and who was sitting with folded arms in protest (Nick Nolte).
</P>
<P>
   In the awards' aftermath, two scenes realistically captured what
the Oscars mean to viewers. The otherwise flaccid ``Politically
Incorrect'' began by introducing its so-called ``special
correspondents,'' Bob Odenkirk and David Cross of the sharp HBO
satire ``Mr. Show.'' Odenkirk arrived wearing a long red dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you wearing?'' asked the host, Bill Maher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vera Wang,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning on ``Today,'' Jon Stewart, Tracey Ullman and
Rosie O'Donnell sat around dishing the show like regular viewers,
trashing Celine Dion's white fedora and the flamenco dancer's
flabby body. (``Maybe he looks good in Madrid,'' Ms. Ullman said).
In the end, putting Hollywood solemnity in its place is what
watching the Oscars is all about.

DEBATING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BUT KEEPING IT CORDIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass.)  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The debate over affirmative action has been going on so long
that it has become a ritual. Both sides fall into incantations,
formulas and slogans to stand for worn arguments. Fresh ideas are
in short supply as the debaters concentrate on phrases with enough
emotional punch to move voters in the referendums that have become
the focus of national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of the role-playing panelists on
``Beyond Black and White: Affirmative Action in America,'' Tuesday
night's ``Fred Friendly Seminar'' remains stuck largely in
long-held positions.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are those led by Ward Connerly, the University of
California regent hailed as the father of his state's Proposition
209 to do away with racial, ethnic and sex preferences in public
education, employment and contracting. His successful band holds
that race-conscious rules for, say, admission to college, offend
the Constitution, stir resentment among groups that do not receive
special treatment and stamp beneficiaries with the stigma of not
being able to make it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of affirmative action point out that many college
applicants, from athletes to offspring of alumni, are granted
``plus factors,'' and that ignoring the racial factor is
unrealistic and unfair. Ann F. Lewis, the White House
communications director, warns that blindness to race is a step
toward resegregation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are positions somewhere between the antis and the
pros. Tamar Jacoby, a writer who has made a specialty of looking
into the impact of affirmative action programs, reports that racial
preferences are having ``a poisonous effect'' on race relations.
She calls on government to help all the poor instead of ``making a
fetish of people's skins.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Edley Jr., a Harvard Law School professor who has
worked on the perennially hot subject for the Clinton White House,
comes down in favor of using race as a factor in student selection
but ``only very carefully.'' Whether that gets the nation much
``beyond black and white'' is itself open to argument.
</P>
<P>
   The hour's ringmaster of this and other ``Fred Friendly
Seminars,'' Charles J. Ogletree of the Harvard Law School, keeps
the conversation civil and even playful as the participants speak
as parents, spouses, college applicants and members of minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are not able to squeeze much juice out of a
much-squeezed subject, Tuesday night's model of civility is no mean
accomplishment given the passions still roiling around the issue. &QL;

`TAKING LIVES': DRIFTER SHEDS HIS AND OTHERS' SKINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1975 Antonioni film ``The Passenger,'' a disaffected
journalist exchanges identities with a man he finds dead in a hotel
room, and soon finds himself pursued by the man's wife, friends and
enemies. A similar premise underlies Michael Pye's engaging new
novel, ``Taking Lives,'' a philosophical thriller about a serial
killer who takes on his victims' identities.
</P>
<P>
   As in Pye's accomplished 1996 novel, ``The Drowning Room,'' we
are introduced to a curiously amoral and opportunistic protagonist
whose identity is constructed around a secret. And as in that
earlier novel, we are plunged into a sinister world whose
glittering surface, detailed by Pye in spare but painterly detail,
belies its shadowy mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree at the heart of this novel starts randomly
enough. Young Martin Arkenhout, a Dutch foreign exchange student,
is bumming around Florida with an American teen-ager named Seth
Goodman. When their rented car breaks down Seth tries to flag down
help, but he is struck by a passing car and left in a bloody pulp
by the side of the road. Martin checks to see if Seth is still
breathing and then unaccountably takes a rock and strikes him in
the head to finish him off. He switches watches with Seth,
appropriates his credit cards and papers and takes off. The police
will mistakenly identify the dead body as that of Martin Arkenhout.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, has settled down to college life as Seth
Goodman in New York City, where he becomes an habitue of the
downtown art scene. There he meets an awkward rich man named John
Gaul who tells him that he has just inherited a big, pink house in
the Bahamas. Seth (that is, Martin) files this information away,
and when Seth's parents insist on seeing him, he decides it's time
to move on: He will dispose of John Gaul and appropriate his life.
Gaul, he figures, is a misfit, an outsider, a man without roots or
family or friends: He will not be missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkenhout thinks he can kill, probably,'' Pye writes. ``The
boundaries weakened when he took a rock to Seth Goodman's head.
Besides, it will be Seth Goodman's crime, and he will not be Seth
Goodman anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth/Martin coolly murders Gaul, moves into his house in the
Bahamas and lives off his copious credit. In time, as he grows
restless, eager to reinvent himself, he will murder others _ always
men he can reasonably impersonate, always men with ``a lack of
mooring to the ordinary, crushing rhythms of practical life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin had always been the winner,'' Pye writes, ``the man who
knew how to reinvent himself perpetually, Faust with no need for
some cramping contract with any passing devil. He did what other
men just dream of doing, which is to change all the incidentals and
take with him, life after life, only what's essential.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he makes a mistake. On the run from police (who are
curious about an expired visa), Martin is forced to pick a new mark
quickly. He selects a professor named Christopher Hart, an art
historian who is about to head off to Portugal on sabbatical. This
Hart, however, has his own secret past: He has stolen 15
illuminated plates from a rare 17th-century book belonging to a
London museum, and the museum has appointed one of its curators,
John Michael Snell Costa, to track them down. The two men are soon
engaged in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, a game in which none
of the usual rules of fair play apply.
</P>
<P>
   It is Costa who narrates the remainder of ``Taking Lives,''
piecing together the story of Martin Arkenhout from his own
encounters with the man, from police reports and from the testimony
of others who have crossed his path. Costa, it quickly becomes
clear, has his own identity problems and his own reasons for
wanting to run away from his life _ developments that not only help
Pye advance his story line, but also help him to underscore the
dialectic in this novel between roots and rootlessness, home and
abroad, stasis and flux.
</P>
<P>
   We learn that Costa's father, a Portuguese national who raised
his family in England, has abruptly returned home to Portugal and
that the stories he has told his family about his past may not be
true. We also learn that Costa has been feeling estranged from his
wife, Anna, and their tidy little life in London, and that he wants
to visit his father in Portugal and reaffirm his Portuguese roots.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are far too many coincidences between Costa's
story and Arkenhout's story for the reader to continue to suspend
disbelief: Not only do both men end up within miles of each other
in the Portuguese countryside, but both also turn out to be
involved with the same woman. Both men also spark the interest of a
local police captain who seems to have had a mysterious
relationship with Costa's father and who has reason to suspect that
there is something fishy about the so-called Christopher Hart.
</P>
<P>
   What enables the reader to overlook these jerry-rigged
developments _ and even the novel's contrived ending _ is Pye's
ability to combine psychological insight with Hitchcockian suspense
and vivid novelistic descriptions. Pye conjures up Nassau for the
reader as a collection of houses in ``the colors of coconut ice and
sherbets,'' and a seedy Vietnamese restaurant in SoHo as ``an
Edward Hopper cafe except for the paper lanterns, and the green
lights in the fish tanks in the window.'' The sky glimpsed from an
airplane strikes Costa as ``a baroque, sentimental sky that ought
to have fat, pink cherubs lollipopping about,'' while tourists in a
Portuguese village look as if they were ``trying to make their
green guides fit the sights.''
</P>
<P>
   Such oddly palpable details anchor the more unbelievable aspects
of the story line in a tactile foreground, and combined with Pye's
storytelling verve, they make for an entertaining, if not entirely
satisfying, read.

GOP FRONT-RUNNER GEORGE W. BUSH HAVING IT BOTH WAYS ON KEY ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When a nationally renowned opponent of
affirmative action came to Texas recently, he cited an important
ally in the campaign to end race-based contracting policies in
state government: Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, state Sen. Rodney Ellis _ a Houston Democrat
and ardent backer of affirmative action _ cited his own, equally
important ally in keeping those programs: Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Which one is right?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on whom you ask, but one thing is clear: On
affirmative action, abortion and other potentially explosive social
issues, Bush has developed an uncanny ability to have it both ways,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Where does he stand on the proposal to provide state-financed
health insurance for children whose parents earn $33,000 a year or
less (for a family of four) _ a proposal many conservatives oppose?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a definite position at the appropriate time,'' Bush
says.
</P>
<P>
   What about increased penalties for ``hate crimes''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush believes all violent crimes are crimes of hate,''
says spokeswoman Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   A gay adoption ban?
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't reviewed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Far from costing him politically, the approach that some have
called ``evasive'' and ``ambiguous,'' has so far sold exceptionally
well. His approval ratings at home are at historic highs, winning
him accolades as a pragmatic, caring politician who avoids divisive
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody so blessed politically,'' said Allan
Saxe, a political analyst at the University of Texas at Arlington.
``It is the Teflon effect all over again. Nothing sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxe said Bush benefits not only from a docile Legislature that
wants to make the likely White House contender look good on
national television, but also from a high-rolling economy that has
left voters feeling complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long the honeymoon will last is uncertain, however,
particularly as other presidential hopefuls take aim at the
Republican front-runner. A day after Bush officially announced that
he would explore a White House bid, the governor was already taking
hits for his ``ambiguous'' stands on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   James Dobson, head of the media ministry Focus on the Family and
a leading voice of Christian conservatives, blasted Bush for saying
America is ``not ready to ban abortions'' even if he would like to
do so himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give us double-talk,'' Dobson said in a recent telephone
news conference. ``We don't know what he believes.''
</P>
<P>
   `AFFIRMATIVE ACCESS': The controversy over Bush's stand on
abortion illustrates the political danger of stating specifically
what you believe: somebody won't like it. On the other hand, taking
positions on controversial issues is a staple of electoral
politics.
</P>
<P>
   There is the issue of timing. Bush has made it clear that he
will not be laying out any detailed national campaign agenda before
the legislative session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many state issues _ including those with national
implications _ that Bush has long sidestepped, either by avoiding a
direct answer, delaying one until a final plan emerges or sticking
to a well-crafted slogan.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Bush's position on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has said he is against ``quotas'' and
``set-asides,'' his position on the state's affirmative action
program is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was highlighted earlier this month when Ward Connerly,
the renowned anti-affirmative action activist from California,
brought his message to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly came to lend his support to a bill, sponsored by a
Republican lawmaker from Houston, that would wipe out the state's
Historically Underutilized Business program. The HUB law is
designed to increase women and minorities' participation in state
contracting.

STUMBLING INTO OBLIVION: 10 WAYS NETWORKS ARE ASSISTING IN
THEIR  OWN DEMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By dribs, by drabs, by hook and by crook, cable TV channels are
luring viewers from the seemingly helpless broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   The old networks, you might say, find themselves on the bloody
end of the course of natural events, their comfortable oligopoly at
an end.
</P>
<P>
   All true. But some smart historian in the future might conclude
that the networks died in part from their own negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the big networks are often their own worst enemies.
With an arrogance and stubbornness stemming from their years atop
the TV heap, they are now contributors to their own decline.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 ways in which the networks hurt themselves:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Clutter. &LR;  Until the U.S. Justice Department intervened
during the Carter administration, the networks used to cooperate to
limit the minutes devoted to commercials, promotion spots and other
non-program material, through the code of the National Association
of Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the commercial load can seem overwhelming to viewers, and
it's self-defeating to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example was the NBC movie ``Alice in Wonderland'' in
February. Some viewers say they tuned out in frustration,
presumably lowering the show's ratings. Others were so angry that
they began counting commercials and promos, which by several
accounts consumed about a third of the program's three-hour time
period.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Crudity. &LR;  The first words of the 1990 fall season on CBS _
words spoken by a 6-year-old on the sitcom ``Uncle Buck'' _ were,
``You suck.'' The episode concluded with the same girl saying of
her 16-year-old sister, ``Ignore her. She's ovulating.''
</P>
<P>
   It was something of a milestone for prime-time TV. The language
was controversial in 1990 and yet seems relatively mild compared
with what can be heard today.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since ``Uncle Buck,'' the networks have trimmed
their standards and practices departments and grown more lenient
toward writers and producers who want to shock or to ``stretch the
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no accurate measure of the effect. But clearly a
segment of the prospective audience is now warier of network
programs. There has even been a network, PAX TV, founded on the
promise to eschew bad language, sexual situations and gratuitous
violence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Repeats and summer blackouts.  &LR; When did ``all new'' become a
breathless selling point for routine episodes of network shows?
About the time that ``all new'' episodes seemed to become a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, program producers provide the networks with 22
new episodes a year. In TV's earlier days, the number was more like
39. The practice of clustering new episodes in sweeps months tends
to exaggerate their seeming dearth, further frustrating viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, network executives annually bemoan the lack of original
programming during the summer. And annually do nothing about it.
The networks need summer reruns because the second airing is
typically when the network can turn a profit on the license fee it
paid to a program's owner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Demographic tyranny. &LR;  Struggling to deliver the ``right''
viewers to advertisers, the networks harm themselves by
constricting their prospective audience.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers 18 to 49 are in television's broadest band of
desirability. CBS focuses on a slightly older demographic, and the
WB network targets teenagers. But television's prime demographic is
18 to 49, and programs are tailored to appeal to that audience.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most Americans don't fall within those
brackets. According to U.S. census figures, 52 percent of the
national population is either younger than 18 or older than 49.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, because TV kowtows to advertisers, America's most
pervasive mass medium effectively ignores most of the population.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even take into account the networks' apparent
reluctance to program for blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Schedule changes. &LR;  Where can you find your favorite show
this week? Chances are, it's not the same time slot where the show
was last week.
</P>
<P>
   When the TV universe was smaller and more manageable, it was
easier for viewers to keep track of programs. Now you need a
compass and flares.
</P>
<P>
   Shows appear willy-nilly ``at a special time'' or ``on a new
night.'' Or premiere in one time period and then promptly move to
another. A move can save a failing show, but more often it seems to
damage shows. Witness NBC's ``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' which has
had five time slots in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Many series also spend more time in and out of ``hiatus'' than
petty thieves spend in and out of jail. TV critics hear it
constantly from readers: Where is ``NYPD Blue,'' or ``Promised
Land,'' or ``Sports Night''? When, if ever, will a favorite show be
back on the air?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Cheapness and loss of glamour. &LR;  It's an intangible, but the
networks seem to have shed much of their gloss in the 1990s. The
grubbiness of the business is now on plain view to the public.

GRAND CANYON-GOOF (Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - So, there still haven't
been 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon in any year after all.
Grand Canyon National Park officials have admitted they goofed. It
turns out, park rangers at the eastern entrance to the park were
counting cars, coming and going. Park visitation has actually
remained relatively stagnant for the last several years, hovering
between 4.5 million and 4.9 million since visitation first topped
the 4 million mark in 1992. The revelation that park visitors
hasn't topped 5 million put a different light on a celebration 15

MANAGEDCARE (Phoenix) - With eyes that sparkle as much as her sense

she's at the bridge table. While she takes a break as her partner
rifles through their hands looking for tricks, the Scottsdale,
Ariz., senior says she's figured it out that it's cheaper for her
to get her Medicare through managed care. But starting in January,
Anderson, her card-playing cronies at the Scottsdale Senior Center
and thousands of other Valley seniors will be unknowing
participants in a new game: how to cut Medicare costs. Under a
federal plan, Maricopa county will be a part of a controversial
experiment to see if the government can pay HMOs less to insure
seniors like Anderson. The stakes are high: The Health Care
Financing Administration says Medicare must be change or face
bankruptcy; insurers say any changes will force them to increase
premiums or cut benefits. With HMOs. By JODIE SNYDER. Story will

business, and the health organizations have targeted Arizona's
federal lawmakers to stop it, telling them that the demonstration
project, set to begin next year in Phoenix, could have a
``staggering impact'' on thousands of Medicare beneficiaries in the

 UNDATED: the public.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It might be a urinating secretary in Fox's ``Busted on the Job
III,'' or ``Pro Wrestling's Greatest Secrets Exposed'' on NBC. But
the public knows chintz when it sees it and recognizes the cynicism
of tacky, inexpensive ``specials'' designed to grab an easy rating.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the proliferation of newsmagazines, especially the
shoddier examples of the genre, have rubbed the sheen from TV.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the jewels in the network crowns are made of
paste.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Shortchanging viewers. &LR;  The networks can score early points
by promising more than they deliver. In 1996, for example, NBC's
``Pandora's Clock'' was a wretched TV movie gussied up for the
November sweeps and presented as a special event. The ruse worked.
</P>
<P>
   But as the network kept trying to defraud the public with more
sows' ears, the ratings declined. Same with NBC's saturation
campaigns for perpetual ``must see'' episodes of its regular
series.
</P>
<P>
   The networks seem to have lost respect for their own viewers.
They act accordingly, and inevitably the public becomes estranged
from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake of selling the public short extends far beyond
inflated promotional claims. It touches on every other item on this
list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Lack of originality. &LR;  The networks are repeating themselves.
Even some of the top network executives now acknowledge that TV
seems old and tired.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar culprits are the handful of TV producers _ start
with Aaron Spelling _ who dominate the airwaves because they've had
hits in the past and can make and deliver ``product.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Spelling can produce untold hours of television
programming, should he? The answer will be yes, until the networks
address the problem of too few producers making too many
predictable shows.
</P>
<P>
   TV acting is no worse than it ever was. It's probably better
than two decades ago. The practical problem the TV industry faces
is a shortage of talented writers.
</P>
<P>
   One would think, with their corporate lives at stake, the
networks would devise effective programs to seek out, train and
nurture new writing and producing talent. Isn't that what most
smart corporations do?
</P>
<P>
   Not the networks, which are the perfect corporate models of
ostriches.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. Impatience. &LR;  The sagas of ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey,'' ``Hill Street
Blues,'' ``Cheers,'' ``Seinfeld'' and other slow-developing hits
are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, the networks haven't taken the lessons to heart.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there are times when the data are incontrovertible,
and no amount of loving attention from a network can save a good
show with bad ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As the networks have grown desperate to stanch their bleeding,
though, they've quickened the hook. Promising shows are abandoned
for dead when they fail to make a fast Nielsen splash.
</P>
<P>
   Early cancellations don't just rob the networks of possible
hits; they also disillusion viewers who form attachments to those
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The networks impart the wrong message to the public. The message
is: Don't invest your emotions in this show; after all, it'll
probably be yanked from the air unceremoniously and killed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. Bad communications. &LR;  Odd that companies in the
communications business are so often among the worst communicators
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' customers are advertisers. They may treat them
royally _ who knows? _ but they've fallen far out of touch with the
public. And without the public, the advertisers eventually will
wave goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   The networks can never be accused of interactivity. In 50 years,
they've established no effective two-way pipeline between
themselves and their viewers, though better communications could
probably alleviate much of the public's disenchantment.
</P>
<P>
   Press relations would seem to be one solution, however
imperfect, for the networks. But those too have deteriorated in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   These are companies that operate capriciously, frustrate their
viewers, narrow their base, cling to the familiar and communicate
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Killed by cable? Sure, that's where the viewers have gone,
mostly. But cable might not be much more than helpful participants
in an assisted suicide.

AUSTIN, Texas: state contracting. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing a questionnaire in which the governor expressed
opposition to race-based affirmative action programs intended to
level the playing field among the races, Connerly claimed that Bush
backed the proposed ban on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But before Connerly even left town, Ellis, the state senator and
affirmative action supporter, issued a statement praising Bush's
stand, ``Thankfully, Governor Bush understands the importance of
inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, neither Bush nor his staff would say whether Bush
supports the state's Historically Underutilized Business program,
or whether he is for or against the efforts to eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for `affirmative access.' I think the state ought to do
everything in its power to provide equal opportunity for all
citizens,'' Bush said at a recent news conference. ``I think quotas
pit one group of people against the other.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   `EVERYBODY'S HAPPY': Whether the state's HUB program involves
``quotas'' is central to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The General Services Commission, composed of Bush appointees,
drafts rules that say agencies are to make a ``good faith effort''
to award a certain percentage of state contracts to women and
minorities. The percentages vary depending on the type of service
provided.
</P>
<P>
   For opponents like Connerly, those are quotas, identical to the
ones that have been successfully challenged in courts elsewhere.
For supporters, they're not quotas because the law says agencies
simply must try to meet the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the program is not in danger of disappearing on
Bush's watch, according to Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've encouraged him to be supportive of it, and if not, to not
put himself in a position in which he would be hands-on trying to
kill it,'' Ellis said. ``To my knowledge, he has never tried to
pass a bill or kill a bill that involved affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the governor of the state of Texas doesn't get
involved in my business, I try not to get involved in his business,
and everybody seems to be happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   HOMOSEXUAL ISSUES: Bush has also taken a cautious approach on
gay issues. While he has won praise for rebuking the
``name-calling'' and divisive rhetoric associated with some
anti-gay activists, his precise views on legislation addressing gay
issues are murky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he opposes same-sex marriages: ``Marriage is
sanctified by the Almighty and it's between a man and a woman,'' he
told The Associated Press. He also has said he believes that
adoptions are best left to heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has not taken a position on bills that would place a
ban on gay marriages and adoptions _ measures sponsored by Rep.
Warren Chisum, R-Pampa. Chisum said he has no reason to think that
Bush is against the bills, but he said he isn't sure whether the
governor is for them, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has taken a similar, noncommittal position on proposed hate
crimes legislation, which would increase penalties for crimes
motivated by bigotry _ including those against gays. Many
conservatives oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Hardy-Garcia, director of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of
Texas, said Bush's lack of a definitive stand on the hate crimes
bill was ``pretty hard to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all this talk about tolerance, and I don't see much of
it,'' she said. ``Because he's not saying we should all burn in
hell, people are hopeful he's tolerant. ... I think you need to do
more than just say you're tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   BUZZWORDS WORK: Despite the complaints about Bush's reticence to
precisely state his positions, analysts say it's a politically
shrewd tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarity on the issues is not exactly a criterion for winning
the presidency,'' said Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at
American University. ``You can get away with it. You can use
buzzwords.''

HEARING EXPOSES CONCERNS ABOUT STOCK FRAUD ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kristin Morris works for a small Virginia company
that sells computer equipment to the federal government and is
familiar with the Internet. Despite her background, Morris told a
Senate panel Monday that she fell victim to stock-fraud scheme over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a new tool for stock schemes and its
fast-moving technology is making the scams more widespread and
making it harder for state and federal authorities to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the Internet appears to provide
cybercrooks with ... avenues for committing financial fraud,'' said
Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which held a hearing on Internet
stock fraud issues.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 34, said she was losing money on a utility stock she
owned and began surfing the Internet in 1997 in an attempt to find
a new stock that was less ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said she ran across a site that listed small companies
that were about ready to issue stock through initial public
offerings, and was attracted to a California company that claimed
it was manufacturing new products that would allow people to use
their televisions rather than a computer to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris printed out the information about the company that was
provided on the Internet and said the description of the products,
like a special keyboard that would be hooked up to the television,
were very detailed. She then called a long-distance operator to
verify the phone number she was given on the Internet and called
the company to make sure it really existed. After talking to a
company official about the new products, Morris said she sent
$1,000 for shares of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Morris never received a stock certificate, but several months
later she received a letter from the California Attorney General's
Office telling her that the company official was arrested for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who has not recovered the $1,000, considers herself
lucky that the person who stole her money is now sitting in jail
because many people conducting stock-fraud schemes over the
Internet have yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   While federal and state law enforcement authorities have
recently established programs to combat Internet securities fraud,
the government's General Accounting Office said the rapid growth of
Internet stock scams ``could limit the ability of these programs to
protect investors.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO, most securities fraud involves companies
offering stocks that trade at less than $5 per share and often
trade for $.50 or less _ so-called microcap or penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases of securities fraud involve ``pump and dump'' schemes
where promoters push up a stock's price by making false claims
about the company, attracting new investors and raising the stock's
price. The con artists then sell their own shares to cash in on the
artificially high price, causing other investors to lose money
after the price falls. Such schemes were previously limited to
phone and mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner, the founder of The Motley Fool, an on-line firm
that provides investment advice, told the Senate panel that he
advises people to stay away from microcap and penny stocks. He said
about 75 percent of companies that issue stock at $5 or less
generally fail within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hillman, an associate director at the General Accounting
Office, said there are no comprehensive statistics available on the
incidence of securities fraud committed over the Internet but said
that federal and state securities officials call it ``an emerging
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also no firm statistics on how much money investors
have lost to Internet stock scams, but the GAO said, state
regulators have reported losses ranging from $18,000 to more than
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 7.5 million Americans buy and sell stocks over the
Internet and that number is expected to grow to 18 million by 2002.
Most on-line investors use a reputable Internet brokerage service
to buy and sell stocks. Internet stock scams typically involve
stocks that are directly purchased by an investor.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that it receives
about 200 to 300 electronic-mail complaints daily about potential
Internet fraud, up from 10 to 15 daily complaints in 1997. Since
1995 the agency has opened 66 investigations into Internet stock
fraud cases and has concluded 32 of them.
</P>
<P>
   While no legislation is pending to help state and federal
investigators combat Internet securities fraud, Collins said she
hoped the panel's hearings would be an effective means for
educating investors about the risks of buying unknown stocks over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the panel would continue to
examine Internet fraud and could develop legislation that could,
for example, make it easier for authorities in one state to
investigate Internet fraud schemes that are conducted in other
states.

 MUCH BELOVED, MANDELA NEARS RETIREMENT, CHARM INTACT  (jw) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ The pink light of dawn was on the
runway at Waterkloof Air Force Base near here when Nelson Mandela
settled into a specially padded seat aboard his presidential jet.
The flight attendant knelt to remove his shoes and, in what seemed
like a well-worn routine, helped him lift his swollen legs high
onto two pillows.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a working day for the 80-year-old president,
one that would include a visit deep into a rural backwater, moving
from the luxurious jet to an army helicopter for a hot, bumpy
hour-long ride there and another back.
</P>
<P>
   There would also be meetings here in Pretoria: business
executives, an envoy from Uganda, the president of Namibia, then
more executives. In the evening, he would address an auditorium
full of white farmers to laud a new anti-crime program.
</P>
<P>
   His day would end 15 hours after it started, a grueling schedule
that is not unusual for him, even in the twilight of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly five years in office, Mandela is still beloved, a
leader who can scold an audience for two hours and still get a
standing ovation, as he did recently after he told members of a
largely white audience in a rich Johannesburg suburb (the same one
he lives in) that they had to stop defending their privileges and
do more to transform the country into an economic democracy as well
as a political one.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity crosses all racial lines and is such an absolute
here that even opposition leaders attacking his party, the African
National Congress, pause to make it clear that they don't mean him
too. In a recent national survey, 43 percent of those asked to rate
his performance gave him a perfect 10.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the leaders of many African countries, who
use imperiousness to make themselves seem imperial, he always
strives to charm. He works crowds instead of stalking past them. He
tells white-haired women how attractive they still look. He waits
for the answer when he asks, ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He makes rueful, tongue-in-cheek comments about becoming old and
unemployed with a new wife to support. (Last July, he married Graca
Machel, widow of the Mozambican president, after divorcing Winnie
Mandela.) When choruses sing to him, he dances his trademark jig.
</P>
<P>
   But he can be cranky, too. The charm comes on at the stops. In
between, he hardly speaks.
</P>
<P>
   As he nears his self-imposed retirement, he seems reluctant to
talk about himself. His aides, responding to an avalanche of
requests for interviews, keep letting journalists aboard his jet,
but he is clearly not thrilled about it. He says the attention
should now go to Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president, who is
virtually certain to be president after the June 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing on a recent flight from the air force base to answer a
few questions, Mandela instantly dismissed the first: What does he
consider his greatest accomplishments as president? ``Such a
question is very important and should be put in writing first,'' he
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he added: ``They are not my accomplishments.
Everything I have done is to do with the ANC. I do not make the
decisions alone. When I decide to act, it is something that we
discuss. I think it is a mistake to think in terms of `the Mandela
years.' It is the era of the liberation forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Few others see it that way. As president, Mandela has had an
unfailing knack for gestures that united this deeply divided
country, gestures that perhaps no other man could or would have
made. He will no doubt be remembered more for them than for any
particular policy _ and for making them toward whites, whose
leaders put him in prison for 27 years simply because he dared to
want to be their equal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, beneath the gestures, he has left much of the day-to-day
running of the country to Mbeki, and he rarely speaks about
specific government programs.
</P>
<P>
   But his deftness at reaching across the racial divide seems
unmatchable. He had been in office barely a year when he invited
the widows of former presidents to tea, including Betsy Verwoerd,
the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the principal architect of
apartheid. The 94-year-old widow was too frail to come, so he
traveled to the whites-only enclave she lives in to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   To whites, it indicated that black leaders were not seeking
revenge. To blacks, it showed that even a lifelong racist, prodded
gracefully enough, would have tea with a black man in her home and
smile about it.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has also repeatedly and reassuringly signaled that his
government will abide by democratic principles. The first time the
new Constitutional Court rebuffed the African National Congress,
Mandela publicly accepted the verdict and expressed delight at the
court's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a case brought by the rugby league boss
questioning Mandela's decision-making process, he became the first
president to testify in court. His advisers opposed it, but he
insisted, saying the subpoena's legality could be fought over
later.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promoted charity, dragging the lords of big business
to desperate rural areas far from their vacation homes. No one
dares say no to him, so new schools and clinics sprout in his wake,
wrenched out of the ground with a little corporate arm-twisting. In
the last year, he has made 30 such trips, all successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In foreign policy, he has shepherded the country back into the
world's favor, rejoining the Commonwealth and pushing for a seat on
the U.N. Security Council. He pursues firm non-aligned status,
getting along with Israel and the Palestinians, with Cuba and the
United States. He poses for pictures with everyone from Col.
Moammar Gadhafi to Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that, he travels widely. He made nearly 50 trips
abroad during his first three years in office. Some were attempts
to broker peace in African wars; most promoted foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   That played well at home, too. After decades in which white
South Africans were international polecats and black ones were
faceless victims, both are able to bask in the glow of watching him
being feted by world leaders, whether sitting in the carriage of
Queen Elizabeth II or talking tough to the World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a hero more than president,'' said Tom Lodge, a
political analyst with the University of Witwatersrand.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the role of statesman rather than administrator,
Mandela has also helped assure a smooth transition. In the early
days, the rand dropped every time he looked tired; he once took a
physical merely to calm jittery markets. Now, the prospect of his
departure causes no panic, since Mbeki has been virtually running
the country for years.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela is not without his critics. Some say he should have been
more hands-on, others say he had serious lapses in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Why, they ask, was former President Suharto of Indonesia, a man
suspected of looting his country's treasury and with a questionable
human rights record, given South Africa's highest humanitarian
award?
</P>
<P>
   And how could Mandela have sent his justice minister to welcome
home from America the anti-apartheid activist Allan Boesak, who was
returning to face serious fraud charges? His loyalty to Boesak was
so deep that he helped raise defense funds and criticized the
prosecutor's case, for which he later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   He is also accused of tolerating incompetent Cabinet ministers
whom he personally likes and even some who are under serious
suspicion of corruption. When reports surfaced that the
thin-skinned Mbeki was forcing out talented rivals like Cyril
Ramaphosa, Tokyo Sexwale or Terror Lekota, Mandela did little to
keep them from leaving for the business world or being sidelined to
unimportant party posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a number of his appointees have not been performing,''
said Themba Sono, the president of the Institute on Race Relations,
a nonprofit research group. ``But he has not fired them. The only
real firing has been of Bantu Holomisa, and that has been for the
worst reason _ speaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   Holomisa lost his job as a deputy minister and was then drummed
out of the ANC because he continued to accuse some of his
colleagues of corruption. But the final straw appeared to be his
making public the fact that in 1994 Mandela had accepted a large
campaign donation from Sol Kerzner, the casino magnate who was then
under investigation on charges of bribing officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Mandela has grown tired in the job and is not always at
his best these days. He is impatient, attacks the news media, and
frequently lashes out at whites, though some say he does not make
clear what he wants from them. Though in the early days he often
talked of needing to keep whites here, he has lately suggested that
the country was well rid of those who have fled to Australia or
Canada because of crime and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on his plane, Mandela shrugged off some of his critics'
biggest fears: that his party wants a two-thirds majority so it can
rewrite the constitution to hobble watchdog agencies and that it is
unable to keep rising crime from chasing business, and thus
prosperity, away.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the ANC's ambitions only natural. ``As far as I am
aware every political party in the world wants to be stronger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And South Africa's crime situation, he insists, is nothing new.
Blacks, he said, have always had to live with crime; the only thing
new is that it is now affecting whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has been more or less like this in the black
areas all along,'' he said. ``But the whites did not worry. They
did not even know. We have removed the barrier between whites and
blacks, and for the first time whites are now sharing the problems
which are nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   As the elections approach, he sounds more and more partisan.
Last fall, he angrily called the country's opposition parties
``Mickey Mouse parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking recently in Houghton, the largely white suburb where he
lives, he told the audience that they had made their first serious
mistake by supporting apartheid. Now, he said, they are making a
second by shunning the ANC, which draws few white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, he said, are not vital to democracy and play
no useful purpose. ``Don't,'' he warned, ``be supporters of lost
causes.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, against his handlers' instructions, he took questions,
spoke till he was hoarse and plunged into the crowd to shake hands
and pat backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite his occasional irritability, his sense of humor
often triumphs. After the ``Mickey Mouse'' crack, one opposition
leader, Tony Leon, had shot back that Mandela was ``running a Goofy
government'' that had failed to deliver on services.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, Mandela was visiting a hospitalized friend
when he heard that Leon was also there, recovering from heart
bypass surgery. He approached Leon's bed from behind the curtains.
``Mickey Mouse,'' he called out in a deep voice. ``This is Goofy
come to see you.''

HEARING EXPOSES CONCERNS ABOUT STOCK FRAUD ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kristin Morris works for a small Virginia company
that sells computer equipment to the federal government and is
familiar with the Internet. Despite her background, Morris told a
Senate panel Monday that she fell victim to stock-fraud scheme over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has provided a new tool for stock schemes and its
fast-moving technology is making the scams more widespread and
making it harder for state and federal authorities to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that the Internet appears to provide
cybercrooks with ... avenues for committing financial fraud,'' said
Sen. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, which held a hearing on Internet
stock fraud issues.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, 34, said she was losing money on a utility stock she
owned and began surfing the Internet in 1997 in an attempt to find
a new stock that was less ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said she ran across a site that listed small companies
that were about ready to issue stock through initial public
offerings, and was attracted to a California company that claimed
it was manufacturing new products that would allow people to use
their televisions rather than a computer to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Morris printed out the information about the company that was
provided on the Internet and said the description of the products,
like a special keyboard that would be hooked up to the television,
were very detailed. She then called a long-distance operator to
verify the phone number she was given on the Internet and called
the company to make sure it really existed. After talking to a
company official about the new products, Morris said she sent
$1,000 for shares of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Morris never received a stock certificate, but several months
later she received a letter from the California Attorney General's
Office telling her that the company official was arrested for
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who has not recovered the $1,000, considers herself
lucky that the person who stole her money is now sitting in jail
because many people conducting stock-fraud schemes over the
Internet have yet to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   While federal and state law enforcement authorities have
recently established programs to combat Internet securities fraud,
the government's General Accounting Office said the rapid growth of
Internet stock scams ``could limit the ability of these programs to
protect investors.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO, most securities fraud involves companies
offering stocks that trade at less than $5 per share and often
trade for $.50 or less _ so-called microcap or penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases of securities fraud involve ``pump and dump'' schemes
where promoters push up a stock's price by making false claims
about the company, attracting new investors and raising the stock's
price. The con artists then sell their own shares to cash in on the
artificially high price, causing other investors to lose money
after the price falls. Such schemes were previously limited to
phone and mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner, the founder of The Motley Fool, an on-line firm
that provides investment advice, told the Senate panel that he
advises people to stay away from microcap and penny stocks. He said
about 75 percent of companies that issue stock at $5 or less
generally fail within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hillman, an associate director at the General Accounting
Office, said there are no comprehensive statistics available on the
incidence of securities fraud committed over the Internet but said
that federal and state securities officials call it ``an emerging
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also no firm statistics on how much money investors
have lost to Internet stock scams, but the GAO said, state
regulators have reported losses ranging from $18,000 to more than
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 7.5 million Americans buy and sell stocks over the
Internet and that number is expected to grow to 18 million by 2002.
Most on-line investors use a reputable Internet brokerage service
to buy and sell stocks. Internet stock scams typically involve
stocks that are directly purchased by an investor.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that it receives
about 200 to 300 electronic-mail complaints daily about potential
Internet fraud, up from 10 to 15 daily complaints in 1997. Since
1995 the agency has opened 66 investigations into Internet stock
fraud cases and has concluded 32 of them.
</P>
<P>
   While no legislation is pending to help state and federal
investigators combat Internet securities fraud, Collins said she
hoped the panel's hearings would be an effective means for
educating investors about the risks of buying unknown stocks over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said the panel would continue to
examine Internet fraud and could develop legislation that could,
for example, make it easier for authorities in one state to
investigate Internet fraud schemes that are conducted in other
states.

JUSTICES ALLOW TEEN CURFEW LAW, BAN ON SOME DRUG TESTS TO STAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court declined Monday to delve into
efforts by cities and high schools to reduce teen crime through
curfews and mandatory drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices left intact a Charlottesville,
Va., curfew imposed on teen-agers to keep them off the streets
overnight. The high court, also without comment, let stand a
decision prohibiting an Indiana school district from requiring
suspended high-school students to pass a drug test before they can
be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to hear the cases sets no nationwide
precedent, but it does not mean the justices could not rule on
these issues in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the curfew case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., upheld a 1996 Charlottesville ordinance that bars
anyone under 17 from being on city streets between midnight and 5
a.m. weekdays and between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Charlottesville defended its law as ``a reasonable,
constitutional exercise of (its) authority to enact legislation to
protect the welfare and safety of children.'' Parents and
teen-agers who challenged the ordinance said it ``deprives parents
of their historically fundamental right to direct the rearing of
their children'' and deprives youngsters of the ``fundamental
liberties to come and go without a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit agreed upheld the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlottesville was constitutionally justified in believing
that its curfew would materially assist its first stated interest _
that of reducing juvenile violence and crime,'' the appellate court
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision to let the Charlottesville ordinance
stand follows a similar 1994 action, when the justices rejected a
challenge to a Dallas curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The drug-testing case concerned the Anderson, Ind., school
board's effort to reinstate its 1997 policy requiring students
suspended for at least three days for disciplinary reasons to pass
a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   High-school freshman James R. Willis II refused to take a drug
test after completing a five-day suspension for fighting and
challenged the policy in court as a violation of his constitutional
privilege against unreasonable searches. The Anderson Community
School Corp., however, argued that the urine test is necessary to
deter drug use by students.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, overturning a
federal district court decision, agreed with Willis and invalidated
the drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1995 upheld the constitutionality of random
drug tests of student athletes. In its 6-3 decision, the justices
said students who participate in school sports are role models and
random drug testing of them is a legitimate method for deterring
drug use by schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the Indiana school's policy, the 7th Circuit
distinguished student athletes from pupils who have been suspended
and seek readmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug testing (of student athletes) could be construed as part
of the `bargain' a student strikes in exchange for the privilege of
participating in favored activities,'' the appeals court said. But
suspended students have struck no such deal and may be tested only
if they are suspected of using drugs, the 7th Circuit added.

HONORARY BUT NOT HONORABLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sunday night at the Oscars, evil was made benign and
shamelessness was elevated to high art.
</P>
<P>
   The old man, Elia Kazan, was escorted onto the stage by director
Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro, where he was presented
with an honorary Academy Award for lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   There was applause from some, silence from others, and Kazan
said, ``I thank you very much. I really like to hear that and I
want to thank the Academy for its courage, generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   If only he'd demonstrated a little of those same traits _
courage and generosity _ when he appeared before the House
Un-American Activities Committee on Apr. 10. 1952.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfires of the Communist witch hunts were consuming the
careers of hundreds of writers and actors and directors.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 would spend time in jail, including Ring Lardner Jr.
and Dalton Trumbo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Kazan, like many others, was a member of the
Communist Party. Mostly, they were liberals in a hurry. The
Communists were among the few actively speaking out against Hitler
in those days. They also supported minority voting rights and the
rights of labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, however, all that had changed.
</P>
<P>
   People were being persecuted for ideas they'd held 20 years
earlier. Lives ere being ruined. Careers ended.
</P>
<P>
   All a person had to do in order to save himself, was name names.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Kazan did.
</P>
<P>
   He was the best known director on Broadway in addition to
working in Hollywood, and he didn't want to limit his
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   So, he limited the opportunities of others.
</P>
<P>
   He ratted out his friends.
</P>
<P>
   And he went on to direct ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Viva
Zapata'' and ``Baby Doll'' and ``A Face in the Crowd'' and
``Splendor in the Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   He won two Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He had a fabulous career, for which the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences decided to honor him, not caring that the
top of the heap on which Kazan stood was made of ravaged lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although you and I might feel he made a mistake,'' Kazan
supporter Warren Beatty said, ``neither you nor I were around in
that period.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   Before judging Kazan we should ask ourselves what we would do to
keep a job, or better yet, what we'd tell our children to do.
</P>
<P>
   Would we tell them it's acceptable to sacrifice innocent friends
to protect themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Would we tell them people should be punished for their opinions?
Blackballed for their beliefs? Destroyed because of their
convictions?
</P>
<P>
   Only a month after Kazan played stool pigeon, the writer Lillian
Hellman went before the same committee and said, ``To hurt innocent
people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is, to
me, inhumane and indecent and dishonorable. I cannot and will not
cut my conscience to fit this year's fashions.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``On the Waterfront,'' the hero, Marlon Brando, decides to
inform on the evil men who control dock workers.
</P>
<P>
   The people Kazan informed on weren't evil, however. They weren't
dangerous. They were only sacrificial lambs to be slaughtered on
the altar of politics.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Academy Awards ceremony Sunday night none of that
seemed to matter. Kazan was old and frail. De Niro kissed him on
the head and Kazan ended his short speech by saying, ``I think I
can just slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   As if all you must to to win an argument in America is live long
enough to get in the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were blacklisted should have gotten the honorary
Oscars, not Kazan. Kazan got to make his movies. He got to live his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He got to say and do exactly what he wanted to say and do _
including Sunday night _ without ever getting what he deserved. &QL;

<P>
   And he went on to direct ``On the Waterfront'' and ``Viva
Zapata'' and ``Baby Doll'' and ``A Face in the Crowd'' and
``Splendor in the Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   He won two Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   He had a fabulous career, for which the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences decided to honor him, not caring that the
top of the heap on which Kazan stood was made of ravaged lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although you and I might feel he made a mistake,'' Kazan
supporter Warren Beatty said, ``neither you nor I were around in
that period.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true.
</P>
<P>
   Before judging Kazan we should ask ourselves what we would do to
keep a job, or better yet, what we'd tell our children to do.
</P>
<P>
   Would we tell them it's acceptable to sacrifice innocent friends
to protect themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Would we tell them people should be punished for their opinions?
Blackballed for their beliefs? Destroyed because of their
convictions?
</P>
<P>
   Only a month after Kazan played stool pigeon, the writer Lillian
Hellman went before the same committee and said, ``To hurt innocent
people whom I knew many years ago in order to save myself is, to
me, inhumane and indecent and dishonorable. I cannot and will not
cut my conscience to fit this year's fashions.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``On the Waterfront,'' the hero, Marlon Brando, decides to
inform on the evil men who control dock workers.
</P>
<P>
   The people Kazan informed on weren't evil, however. They weren't
dangerous. They were only sacrificial lambs to be slaughtered on
the altar of politics.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Academy Awards ceremony Sunday night none of that
seemed to matter. Kazan was old and frail. De Niro kissed him on
the head and Kazan ended his short speech by saying, ``I think I
can just slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   As if all you must to to win an argument in America is live long
enough to get in the last word.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were blacklisted should have gotten the honorary
Oscars, not Kazan. Kazan got to make his movies. He got to live his
life.
</P>
<P>
   He got to say and do exactly what he wanted to say and do _
including Sunday night _ without ever getting what he deserved. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I recently hired a store manager, and I
just learned that she rides a motorcycle to work. I don't think
this is the right image for our company, and I am concerned about
the example she may be setting for the rest of the staff. When she
came to the interview, she arrived in a car, and this issue never
came up. How do I approach it now? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: As it is, you are approaching this employee in the slow
lane, and the best advice is to take the next off-ramp. If this
employee is getting to work on time and in condition to fully
execute all of her responsibilities, whether she arrives on roller
blades, a pogo stick or a llama is not your concern.
</P>
<P>
   If there are specific work-related problems that are somehow
being caused by her mode of transportation, you should discuss such
matters with her. However, even if she looks like she stepped out
of a wind tunnel, which she probably does not, there is no reason
to assume that this appearance would be detrimental to her
performance.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like her motorcycling has driven into some of your
biases and stereotypes, not only regarding motorcycles but
regarding females as well. The fact is that her mode of
transportation could just as easily be telling you that she is
independent, enjoys the outdoors, cares about conserving energy and
is not one to complain about the lack of parking for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although you expressed concern about the corporate image and the
example being set, it is possible that this manager's ``approach''
to work may do wonders in both of these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was at lunch with my manager, and one of my friends stopped
by our table. When I went to introduce my manager, for whom I have
worked for three years, I went blank. He gave me a strange look and
then introduced himself. I apologized and said this can happen to
anyone. He said it does not happen to him. It's been a couple of
weeks, and he seems to be treating me differently. Should I talk to
him about it? N.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since your memory lapse at lunch has turned into a memorable
event for your manager, bringing it up again will make the incident
even more unforgettable. The best step is to concentrate on your
work and let him see that this was an isolated occurrence that has
no relationship to your performance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, your manager's reaction was revealing. Rather
than putting the matter into a reasonable perspective, he used it
as an opportunity to indicate that, in this type of situation, he
is perfect. Perhaps your failure to instantly access his name is a
sign that something deep within you is not particularly fond of
this perfect person.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if this is happening to you in many areas, you should
look into it further, but just about everyone forgets a name at one
time or another. Don't forget that there are countless examples of
brilliant individuals who operate at such a stratospheric level
that mundane matters like people's names are not in the forefront
of their minds. Given time, this incident should move out of the
forefront of your manager's mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are about 20 people in our department, but the manager
is mean to me. She yells and screams at me if I make the slightest
mistake, but rarely raises her voice to the others. I hate to say
it, but she makes me cry. What can I do? S.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: The individual that you describe as a manager is not a
manager at all _ she is a bully. This is a person who skulks around
the corporate playground, looking for someone to verbally beat up.
Importantly, bullies do not get into battles with people who may
give them a match, but search for people whom they think they can
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   If you want this nonsense to stop, your first move is to try to
act more assertively. Naturally, that is easier said than done, and
you may need to consider some assertiveness training.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than waiting for the next time she pushes you around, you
should meet with her in the moments when she is acting more like a
human. Spell out the specific behaviors that are upsetting you, let
her know exactly how you feel and then indicate that the behaviors
in question must stop now. Wrap up the meeting by letting her know
that if this type of abuse and harassment continues, your next step
will be to go to senior management or explore your legal options.
</P>
<P>
   If the bully remains bullheaded, it is time to take the next
step.

 &HT;    GOP WANTS TO OUTSPEND CLINTON ON K-12 EDUCATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Congress today (Tuesday) begins its floor battle
over next year's federal budget with Republicans proposing to spend
more than President Clinton suggested on elementary and secondary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite different from a couple of years ago when we were
fighting for our lives,'' Secretary of Education Richard Riley
marvelled Monday. ``People were seriously talking about doing away
with the Department of Education, or even of moving the federal
government out of education.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposes spending between $20.8 billion and
$22.7 billion on elementary, secondary and vocational education in
fiscal year 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In votes last week within the budget committees, Senate
Republicans proposed spending $24.1 billion; House Republicans, $22
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we got a better number in the Senate, a not-so-good number
in the House,'' Riley said. ``Of course, at this stage, they don't
say where the money will be spent or where the money will come
from, or how it will be managed within the (budget's over-all )
spending caps.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said, ``The Republican budget makes a strong commitment
to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House leaders expect the GOP budget resolutions to be
adopted with few changes, if any, before Saturday, when Congress
begins its spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions contain non-binding, but very influential,
instructions to the appropriation committees that write annual
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: It's better to be on their list of priorities
for increases than on the list of things that are recommended for
cuts,'' said Joel Parker, a lobbyist for the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP resolutions also propose unspecified cuts within a large
category of expenditures that includes higher education, Head Start
and Labor Department training services.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed spending $31.3 billion on those programs in the
next fiscal year. The House and Senate Republican resolutions both
call for spending $28.1 billion - less than is being spent this
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ed Elmendorf of the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities indicated he and other higher education
lobbyists have not panicked yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not prudent for the budget committee chairmen to say so
this early in the year,'' Elmendorf said. ``But my sense is that in
the end they'll bust the budget caps.''

COURT CUTS GALLERY'S TIES TO FRANCIS BACON ESTATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Ireland, N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Marlborough Fine Art, the gallery that handled the
artistic management of the British painter Francis Bacon for
virtually his entire career, has had all association with his
estate ended by England's High Court.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that has gone unreported until now, Justice David
Edmund Neuberger ruled in late December that an executor of the
multimillion-dollar estate who was a director of the gallery should
be removed and replaced by a new independent representative.
</P>
<P>
   The new trustee is Brian Clarke, 45, a well-known British
architectural artist who was a friend of Bacon's and of John
Edwards, 49, the painter's closest friend, to whom Bacon willed his
entire estate. Bacon, widely accepted as the greatest British
painter of his generation, died of a heart attack at the age of 82
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke had been responsible for shifting the representation of
Bacon's works from Marlborough to Faggionato Fine Arts in London
and the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, an arrangement that drew
sudden attention last October when the Shafrazi Gallery mounted a
show of 17 previously unseen Bacon paintings and photographs of his
famously cluttered London studio. Marlborough's loss of the
prestigious Bacon account and the reasons behind it became a
subject of curiosity and speculation among contemporary art experts
in London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke would say only that lawyers looking into the
administration of the estate had found ``certain anomalies'' in
actions by Marlborough that compelled them to take their court
action.
</P>
<P>
   They had become alert to possible problems when, on making their
first inquiries to Marlborough London, Bacon's gallery since 1958,
they were told that the Bacon paintings were being handled not in
London but by Marlborough Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation set off alarms since the Liechtenstein office
had been central to a scandal in New York in the 1970s over the
estate of the American painter Mark Rothko that led to the ousting
of executors; heavy fines against Marlborough; the conviction of
its head, Frank Lloyd, for tampering with evidence and the end of
its membership in the Art Dealers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Liechtenstein is also known as a place that affords corporations
high levels of secrecy and protection against demands for
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The Rothko case exposed sinister inner workings in the
supposedly genteel art world and cost Marlborough its pre-eminence
in contemporary art. Among other abuses, Marlborough was found to
have sold paintings to favored clients at less than market value
and to have collected inflated commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Bacon estate are busy in four European countries
and the United States tracking assets that the estate believes
should go to Edwards. ``They are currently putting together a case
that may at some point in the near future come to court,'' Clarke
said.
</P>
<P>
   His whole purpose, Clarke said, was to ``get John everything
that Francis left him.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal lawyer for the estate, John Eastman of New York,
said in a telephone interview from St. Barts that ``the defining
question for the estate is what is there beyond what we already
have.'' The argument presented to Neuberger for the removal of
Valerie Beston, a director of Marlborough London, was that
entrusting fiduciary responsibility to an official associated with
the gallery whose actions were being examined by the estate
presented a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clarke nor Eastman would specify what activities of Ms.
Beston's or the gallery's they had questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Parton, a director of Marlborough London, said the
gallery would not discuss any aspect of the Bacon estate. Parton
said ``no comment'' six times during a brief telephone conversation
on Monday, including to questions about whether Ms. Beston had been
a Bacon trustee or was a director of the gallery. Court documents
confirm that she was both.
</P>
<P>
   There were originally two other trustees of the Bacon estate,
Gilbert de Botton, a financier well known in art collecting circles
who was a former director of Marlborough Zurich, and Dr. Paul
Brass, Bacon's personal physician. De Botton never took up his
commission, and Brass was replaced in the same Dec. 18 action that
removed Ms. Beston. Brass, Clarke said, had acted ``impeccably''
but was simply overwhelmed by the size and complexity of the task.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and Eastman both resisted putting any value on the
overall Bacon holdings. Individual paintings have fetched up to $6
million, prompting outsiders to estimate the worth of the whole
estate at more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The estate has paid its taxes and does not need to raise any
money with sales of major works. ``We may sell a number of pictures
as time goes on, but we have no plans for any kind of big sale,''
Clarke said. ``Not even a small sale, for that matter,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's friends have found that the painter was even more
prolific than they had known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though everybody thought that they'd been through the
studio with a fine-tooth comb, we found a number of paintings
dating from the '50s,'' Clarke said. ``Since Francis died, I had
been in his studio probably 100, 150 times, and I had missed them.
John Edwards had missed them.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio where Bacon worked for the last 30 years of his life
was a giddy jumble of half-finished canvases, books, rags,
drawings, notes, twisted paint tubes, encrusted brushes and broken
furniture with bare bulbs dangling from the ceiling and smears of
paint on the doors and walls. It occupied two rooms of a South
Kensington mews house and is being disassembled, measured,
cataloged and documented for reconstruction in Dublin, where Bacon
was born and spent the first 16 years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It will be reassembled in the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of
Modern Art for public show beginning in 2001. The dismantling has
been done in archeological fashion, with highly detailed and
enumerated placement charts so that the creative chaos that Bacon
wrought in London can be precisely recreated in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More Bacon works emerged when Barry Joule, 44, a Canadian writer
who was one of the painter's neighbors, came forth with 500 oil
sketches, drawings, and worked-on photographs from 1945 to 1965
that Bacon had given him.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports in the British press of disputes and
threatened legal action between the estate and Joule, but Clarke
said that Joule shared the estate's interest in abiding by the
painter's wishes that Edwards receive everything.
</P>
<P>
   He said that talks with him were ``perfectly amicable.'' Joule
agreed with that characterization, saying, ``Things are being
worked out in a friendly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Tate Gallery bought 42 similar works on paper from
the 1950s and '60s in gouache, oil paint, ink, ballpoint pen and
pencil from Paul Danquah and Peter Pollock, friends of the
artist's, and the estate of Sir Stephen Spender. The works,
compelling early visions of the twisted figures, blurred faces,
screaming popes and butchered carcasses that were to become Bacon's
signature repertory of postwar angst, are on display at the Tate
until May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a reclusive and simple man now living in Southeast
Asia, was Bacon's closest friend for the last 16 years of his life.
Born within the sounds of the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow Church in
East London and therefore a genuine Cockney, Edwards never learned
to read or write and maintained a relationship with Bacon that
friends described as filial.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said he became involved four years ago when Edwards
approached him perplexed about delays and problems in dealing with
the estate. ``He asked if I would help him to try to understand why
the estate was not being wound up, and he asked me to become his
power of attorney. I thought it would be a very short thing, but
after a while I discovered that there were, let's say, certain
anomalies, problems without the resolution of which the estate
could not be wound up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke took on the assignment without the knowledge of the
executors, and when he found the task more daunting than he had
anticipated, he turned to Eastman, a lawyer with broad experience
in the worlds of art and entertainment. Eastman's sister, Linda,
the wife of Sir Paul McCartney, had been a friend and collaborator
of Clarke's, and the photographs of Bacon's studio that were
displayed in New York last fall were the last pictures she shot
before her death last April.
</P>
<P>
   While he declined to get into the details of his preoccupation
over Marlborough's management of Bacon, Clarke explained why he
thought the painter's estate required special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Francis Bacon was famously disinterested and uninterested in
money,'' he said. ``He lived the life of an essentially simple man
in a tiny bed-sit that was heated when very cold by leaving the gas
door open. He had a tiny kitchen that contained an open bath, and a
room with a bed and a chest of drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the last great existentialist. If you are an art
gallery representing such a man whose chief legatee can neither
read nor write and hasn't even had his own lawyer until recent
years, your fiduciary obligations are all the greater because such
a man could be described as `easy pickings.' ''

 &HT;    Unknown McGlinchy staying focused on future
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ An unfamiliar name has been a part of
Braves camp all spring, and the best part for 21-year-old Kevin
McGlinchy is that it still is.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox first mentioned the name of McGlinchy, the
hard-throwing 6-5 right-hander from Malden, Mass., as a young
pitcher to watch at the pre-spring ``Camp Leo.'' Now it's one of
the few still attached to a locker in the big-league clubhouse at
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they have in store for me, but I'm still
here,'' said McGlinchy, among three non-roster pitchers still
around. ``It's nice to be up here. It's better than being in a lot
of places, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy, a fifth-round draft pick in 1995, has done little but
help himself in six spring appearances. His 4.05 ERA is third in
the bullpen behind John Rocker (0.00) and Odalis Perez (2.45),
better than Mike Cather (5.14), Mike Remlinger (5.79), Rudy Seanez
(7.50), and Mark Wohlers (9.00).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those thing where, really, I had nothing to
lose,'' McGlinchy said. ``I just try to look like I'm in control
out there, get ahead, throw strikes and be aggressive. And pretty
much I've done that every time. Some days I'd come out real pumped
up, and I'd lose focus. But these last couple games I've come out
under control, throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy has pitched only six games above the A level in his
three-year minor-league career, and all of those were as a starter
last season for the AA Greenville Braves. He was sent to Puerto
Rico over the winter to make the conversion to a reliever,
something Rocker proved could be an faster way for a minor-league
pitcher and the Braves to help each other.
</P>
<P>
   Making the 25-man roster is a long shot for McGlinchy, given his
lack of experience, and he might be gone after the next round of
cuts later this week. But the door is still open, with the
uncertainty in the Braves bullpen _ Kerry Ligtenberg's elbow injury
and Wohlers' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his makeup,'' Cox said. ``He's so young and
inexperienced, (but) he throws strikes anyway, so what's the big
deal? He's not experienced, but he's pretty gifted. He's around the
dish. We'll see. It really boils down to just getting outs. I'm not
opposed to anything. If they're going to contribute, why not? You
don't have to have a big name to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy will buy that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where you start, it's where you end,'' McGlinchy
said. ``I think I'll make it up here some day. The only way I can
do that is take the ball every time out and do the best I can.''

   Inside pro tennis: Courier back on Davis Cup roster; Agassi's
out
</P>
<P>
   By Todd Holcomb
</P>
<P>
   Since America's best players aren't faithful to Tom Gullikson,
it's no wonder the U.S. Davis Cup captain keeps hauling out Jim
Courier.
</P>
<P>
   Although past his prime, the former No. 1-ranked player was
named Monday to the four-member U.S. team that will face Great
Britain next month in a first-round match. Gullikson also selected
Todd Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill and doubles man Alex O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras had long since ruled themselves
out of the April 3-5 match, putting a damper on the USTA's
celebration of the 100th year of Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, back up to No. 10 in the world, will be the clear No. 1
singles player. Gambill, ranked No. 44, figures to be No. 2. He has
beaten Sampras, Agassi and Britain's Tim Henman in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Courier won the clinching fifth match in five sets in last
year's first round in Atlanta against Russia's Marat Safin. If
anyone was slighted in favor of Courier, who is No. 52, it was
Vince Spadea, who beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov last week. Spadea is
ranked No. 41.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Richey Reneberg also was a candidate. He and Justin
Gimelstob won a doubles tournament at Scottsdale, Ariz., earlier
this month. Both were U.S. team members last year, and Gimelstob is
No. 66 in singles.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi quits Davis Cup
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said Saturday after his early-round loss at the Lipton
that he'll never play Davis Cup again, because the USTA fired the
team doctor. ``That's the last straw for me,'' Agassi said. ``I'll
never play again.'' USTA executive director Rick Ferman said Dr.
George Fareed, a long-time favorite among players, was a casualty
of new regulations that require board certification in specific
areas and daily treatment of athletes. Agassi called it ``another
example of how players aren't consulted about anything that
happens.'' Agassi remains bitter that last year's semifinal against
Italy was played in Milwaukee without his consultation. He said he
would have played had it been staged in California. Italy won 4-1.

THE AWFUL TRUTH ABOUT THE EASTER BUNNY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, March 24)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 (Sarasota, Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, the Easter Bunny hops into our homes on April 4, the
same day that daylight-saving time begins.
</P>
<P>
   The date also falls alarmingly close to the federal income tax
filing deadline (April 15) and within nine months or so of when all
the world's computers lock up and we revert to hunting mastodons
with flint-tipped spears and watching black-and-white TV.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? I hardly think so.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows (possibly because no one has asked) what, if any,
role the Easter Bunny plays, or has played, in the disintegration
of our American Way of Life.
</P>
<P>
   (Some may question how daylight-saving time contributes to the
disintegration of our American Way of Life and may even argue that
they prefer daylight-saving time to ``standard'' time. That is the
whole point; the Easter Bunny is fiddling with the clocks in order
to divide us and make us easier to conquer.)
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, many Americans still look upon the Easter Bunny as a
quaint bit of harmless folklore intended to bring joy to children
and profit to chocolate manufacturers, and to allow dentists to
stock a better brand of champagne on their yachts.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a small but possibly inebriated band of patriotic
citizens is working off and on between naps to expose the Easter
Bunny for the vicious fraud that he (she?) is. They call themselves
the Easter Bunny Hunters of America
(www.wsu.edu:8080/(tilde)twl/bunny/) and if you hyperventilate on
bus fumes for a few minutes, I think you'll find they make a lot of
sense. Here are some excerpts from the group's ``manifesto'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Easter bunnies are one of the rarest types of rabbits around.
They are valued because they have many uses. They have a rich,
delicious flavor that challenges any other meat except seal meat.
Their fur is of the highest quality and is great for coats and
other apparel. (It also makes good toilet seat covers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take many days to locate an Easter Bunny of legal size.
They can be found at malls and around residential neighborhoods.
They differ from regular rabbits by the noise they make. They make
a squawking noise similar to that of a chicken. They are also quite
vicious and contrary to popular belief, they are carnivorous and
prey on small mammals. They have caused many problems in the world,
the biggest one being El Nino. From their secret headquarters in
Walla Walla, Wash., these bunnies have been waging war against
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this confirms what I've been saying all along, namely 1)
While the press has been focused on Monica Lewinsky, a lot of other
news has slipped through the cracks, and 2) If you put a pair of
long ears and a fuzzy cottontail on Bill Gates, he would look a lot
like the Easter Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Some might think that the Easter Bunny Hunters of America have
gone over the edge, that their ravings remind one of the Y2K nuts
who recommend we stock up on bottled water and Spam and head for
the hills of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Easter Bunny Hunters of America are a little more
grounded in reality, thank you very much. They would never tell you
to move to Montana. Why bother? The Easter Bunny will track you
down and sink its cruel, yellow fangs into your neck like it was a
sock filled with processed luncheon meat substance.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I wish to alarm anyone. Many people have had contact
with the Easter Bunny and lived to tell about it. My concern is
that the conjunction of unpleasant events (tax time, Y2K, spring
back, fall ahead, whatever) will put the Easter Bunny in an
especially dark mood, assuming he (she?) didn't arrange it all in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Someone told me that it is fun to put marshmallow Easter Bunnies
in the microwave oven and watch them swell and burst as they absorb
massive doses of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   I don't wish to spoil anyone's Easter holiday fun, but my advice
would be that you postpone this amusing little diversion until some
other time, like, say, the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you happen to detect a whiff of Spam in the air
and notice a yellow, 3-foot-wide, bloodshot eye glaring at you
through the window.

 &HT;    Consumers might reap benefits from MediaOne, Comcast mergerBy
Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although it won't happen until the end of 1999 or
early 2000, metro Atlanta's MediaOne subscribers may see better
pricing and more sophisticated offerings when the merger with
Comcast is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta's 550,000 MediaOne and Comcast subscribers will
become part of a cable company boasting over 11 million subscribers
nationwide, giving them the greater buying power and cable
expertise that such size commands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, MediaOne's move into high speed data and telephone
service ``will proceed as planned,'' said spokesman Dave Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The ten-month wait before MediaOne becomes part of Comcast is
largely due to local and federal regulation. Each municipality in
which MediaOne operates must approve the merger. Wood says the
companies must go before every franchising authority, not just in
Georgia but nationwide. It's not expected the deal will be
contested, but it will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We going to be MediaOne until the Comcast deal is consummated.
Everything as it stands today is going to go forward,'' he said.
``Whatever business is being transacted with customers will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But once it happens, there may be exciting changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the goal of our merger is to offer the integration
of video, voice and data over a single line into the home, and
that's something we think is very exciting,'' said Comcast
spokesman Jason Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say that once Comcast/MediaOne merger is
final, MediaOne customers could see several changes in high speed
access and pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media One is one of the more aggressive rate raisers,'' says
Kent Gibbons, news editor at industry trade magazine MultiChannel
News. ``Comcast... is very aware of the need to keep increases
modest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons also thinks the merger might impact each company's cable
modem strategy and possibly bring about some consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Comcast will acquire MediaOne's 25 percent
stake in Road Runner, the Time Warner high speed cable modem
offering. Comcast already owns 12 percent of the At Home network,
the TCI/AT&AMP;T high speed venture. (Atlanta-based Cox Communications,
a unit of Cox Enterprises, owns a minority stake in AtHome, as
well.) Comcast and MediaOne are now contractually obligated to
offer cable modem Internet services with At Home and Road Runner,
respectively. That can't change until the deal is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, they said they would offer At Home where
Comcast is now and Road Runner where they are MediaOne,'' Gibbons
says. It's possible, he says, that the merger could accelerate a
combination of the two platforms into one service.
</P>
<P>
   However, both MediaOne and Comcast say it's too soon to say what
unified strategies might evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus for local subscribers will be the sheer size of the
new company, which will be the third largest cable provider in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing for customers,'' says MediaOne's Wood.
``You want to have a large footprint. The larger the company, the
greater your economies of scale. You can negotiate better with
programmers if you are talking 11 million combined MediaOne/Comcast
subscribers as opposed to five million MediaOne subscribers alone,
but again we don't know,'' he says. ``I don't know if there is any
one outstanding thing that will make a huge impression on the
customer.''

DVD SALES GROW BUT YOUR VCR IS NOT OBSOLETE

   Jim Barry's cell phone is the first clue that he has something
to do with the electronics industry. It's a little bigger than a
matchbox, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have a belt clip for it,'' said Barry, ``I'd lose
it.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is the spokesman for the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturer's Association. Its members produce cell phones,
digital photo cameras, digital video cameras, high-definition
televisions, DVD players for home theater systems and a raft of
other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The market for them is tremendous: Last year, said Barry,
Americans spent $80 billion on electronic equipment purchasing,
among other items, 18 million VCRs and 1 million DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 1 million DVDs sold last year that attracted a lot of
attention. In 1997, DVD sales were at 400,000. The under-$300
players that deliver high-quality pictures and sound for home-movie
viewing were expected to sell about 750,000 units last year.
Instead, more than 1 million were purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one-million mark is a magic number for the electronics
industry,'' said Barry, who has written about the industry for 20
years, and is former editor of Video magazine. ``A million is 1
percent of all U.S. households. At that point, you start getting
into `the neighborhood effect,' where you go to someone's house in
the neighborhood and he or she has a DVD player or other new piece
of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millionth product purchased within a year validates the
market for that product. And at that point, the efficiency of
manufacturing and marketing begins to kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   While the market for DVD continues to grow (sales this year are
expected to be double last year's), Barry said VCRs are a long way
from becoming obsolete. ``That won't happen until we get recordable
DVD disks,'' said Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The big attraction for VCRs (18 were purchased for every one DVD
sold) is that people can record what they want with them. Although
DVDs can hold an entire movie, and although there are more than
1,300 titles available, they're only good for playback.
</P>
<P>
   Recordable DVDs are on the way, ``probably within the next few
years,'' said Barry. ``Audio compact discs came out in 1982, and it
was 1992 before the first recordable CDs were on the market. That
10-year lag time has been greatly compressed now.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive gadget in his bag of tricks? I thought it
was the Panasonic Palm Theater. Not much larger than a portable
audio CD player and not much thicker than a hardcover book, the
Palm Theater has a fold-up color screen and a two-hour battery so
users can view an entire movie without recharging or changing
batteries. The unit can also be hooked to a home theater system.
</P>
<P>
   Price? It's one of those ``If you have to ask, you probably
can't afford it'' items. But since you did: about $1,300.

STEEL LOBBY TESTS ITS METTLE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Calif.)  (lh) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How strong is steel?
</P>
<P>
   Not as strong as recent events on Capitol Hill might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. steel lobby scored a victory last week with a
decisive House vote in favor of a bill that would restrict the
shipment of foreign steel, the celebration may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerably less enthusiasm for the bill in the
Senate, which has generally shown more resistance to perceived
barriers to free trade. And President Clinton opposes the measure,
saying it violates international trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   The fight in the House over the steel quota bill underscores a
growing protectionist sentiment in Congress and illustrates the
shifting political dynamics of trade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have traditionally led the fight in favor of
free trade and business opportunities abroad, find within their own
camp lawmakers more worried about jobs in their own back yards than
the dangers of bucking party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, watch as Clinton extols the virtues of an
unfettered world market even as labor unions, a key constituency,
argue that foreign competitors are clobbering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to me that you've got the White House
defending free trade and the Republican-controlled Congress is
moving toward protectionism,'' said Bryan Johnson, a trade expert
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. ``I can't
remember the last time that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost two years, domestic steel producers have been
decrying the flow of cheap, imported steel into U.S. markets.
Russia, China, Japan and several other countries with troubled
economies have turned to this country to unload goods at below-cost
prices that they can't sell back home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steel executives and workers say the flood of imports has
cost thousands of jobs and led to the closing of three plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``By allowing dumping we are deliberately sacrificing ...
productive United States jobs,'' said Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala.,
whose district includes Gulf States Steel in Gadsden.
</P>
<P>
   Aderholt is typical of a new breed of Republicans on trade
issues. His stance can be explained in purely parochial terms. He
does, after all, represent a district with a sizable number of
steel workers. But there are other factors at work.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans elected in the past four to six years have
demonstrated a wariness on trade issues, whether it's granting the
president enhanced negotiating powers or signing off on world trade
treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this reluctance appears to stem from the social
conservatism that drives some of these Republicans. On China, for
example, many conservatives blasted the GOP for favoring
most-favored nation trading status even with that country's dismal
record on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   These new lawmakers are also more sympathetic to some U.S.
workers who see a threat in the emerging global economy, one where
borders don't seem to matter as much as business profits.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of the Heritage Foundation, attributes some of that
sentiment to inexperience, asserting that the newer lawmakers
weren't around when quotas were used and bloated U.S. industries
couldn't compete effectively in world markets. ``They lack a
historical understanding of the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the steelworkers' union has been well organized and vocal
about its needs, the truth is that there are other industries that
are quite happy with the prospect of cheap steel, no matter what
the source.
</P>
<P>
   Car manufacturers, for example, oppose the steel quota bill the
House passed Wednesday and will likely fight it hard in the Senate.
``The bill represents a rush to judgment on the steel issue that is
likely to have serious economic implications, including potential
steel shortages in the U.S. at a time of increased auto
production,'' said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist for General
Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who led the fight against the steel
bill on the House floor, said far more workers would be hurt by its
enactment into law than helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use protectionism to shield one industry, 40 times
more Americans are injured,'' Drier said. ``Protectionism is fool's
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   And the upcoming presidential election may encourage both
parties to retreat to their more traditional stances on labor and
trade issues. If that's the case, America's steel interests stand
to lose support in a Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The steel lobby is forging ahead. On Tuesday, steel union
leaders are scheduled to speak before the Senate Finance Committee
about the turmoil in their industry. Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for
the United Steelworkers of America, said that alone is a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ever would have dreamed a union leader would be asked to
testify before a Republican committee on a trade bill in the
Senate?'' Hubbard asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the actual outcome of the steel quota bill is much harder to
predict. Skeptics abound, and even steel lobbyists acknowledge they
face a tougher fight in the Senate.

VATICAN MAY CUT TIES WITH TAIWAN TO NORMALIZE THOSE WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A top Vatican official said Monday that the Holy See
would reconsider its ties with Taiwan in order to secure better
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, by the Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop
Jean-Louis Tauran, was timed to coincide with the visit to Italy of
President Jiang Zemin of China. Jiang has no plans to visit the
Vatican, and relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the
Chinese government are strained.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope, who plans to visit Asia this year to conclude the
synod of Asian bishops, is eager to normalize relations with China
and improve the rights of Catholics there. China has long insisted
that the Vatican must cut ties to Taiwan as a precondition for
talks. China does not allow its Catholics to recognize the pope's
authority, and views the Vatican's desire to appoint its own
bishops as interference in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that in order to normalize our relations with
Beijing, we will have to modify the form (or relations) with
Taipei,'' Tauran told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. ``We
are willing to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that the Vatican has expressed its
eagerness to open diplomatic relations with China; Pope John Paul
II wrote a personal letter to Deng Xiaoping in 1983 asking for
direct contacts. But Tauran's timing, as well as his wording, was
the sharpest public declaration of the Vatican's intent to date. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   China, however, does not appear ready to bend. Asked about the
archbishop's comment, a Chinese government spokesman, Zhu Bangzao,
said: ``Words are not enough. You have to follow through with
deeds.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs of disagreement over the Vatican's China
policy even within the Church. Fides, the news agency of the
missionary arm of the Vatican, published an editorial by the Rev.
Bernardo Cervellera, director of Fides, in which he strongly
criticized China's demands that the Vatican break ties with Taiwan
and highlighted persecution of Catholic clergy in China by the
government. Cervellera demanded that China free two Chinese
Catholic bishops who disappeared three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican Monday disassociated itself from the priest's
editorial. The Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the
editorial was ``a personal opinion,'' and added, ``Only the Vatican
secretary of state is authorized to say what pleases or displeases
the Holy See.''

   (application system.)
</P>
<P>
   Several schools offer classes that go beyond the required eight
hours. Authorities point to Buford Tune's Academy of Personal
Protection and Safety in Nashville as a role model. Tune demands 16
hours of training, including segments on civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities wonder how many training courses offer
quality programs. Some worry about ``fly-by-night'' schools that do
not have qualified instructors, although all schools must be
certified by the state Department of Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The state reports more than 175 certified schools, although
several random calls reached disconnected numbers. Training classes
have popped up in strip malls, office buildings and isolated gun
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Safety randomly inspects classes to ensure
that instructors are teaching properly. But they cannot police
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago a Nashville television news crew broadcast a
shocking series after taking hidden cameras to a class. The footage
showed instructors giving students answers to the written test and
one teacher confiding, ``I'm not supposed to tell anybody how easy
(the class) is, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like that disturb Tune, an imposing man who, to simulate
stressful conditions, yells in his students' ears at the gun range.
He takes his duties as an instructor seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``An instructor is God to someone who has no experience,'' said
Tune, a former Nashville police officer. ``If they're not teaching
correctly, that's a scary thought. Some of these teachers can
barely spell G-U-N.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about training, Tennessee worked
several years to develop an effective application system.
Originally, Tennessee used a system similar to the one Missouri
plans to adopt. An applicant requested a permit from the county
sheriff, who could deny it for almost any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Almost instantly the horror stories started. One rural Tennessee
sheriff issued the permit and then revoked it from an applicant who
had supported his opponent in a recent election. Tune said one
sheriff told him that he would not issue a permit to blacks or
Latinos, using slurs to describe each group.
</P>
<P>
   Even when sheriffs meant well, an inconsistent set of standards
naturally developed throughout the state's 95 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws are like the Bible. We all interpret it differently,''
Arnold said. ``This sheriff says I can do this. This sheriff says I
can do that. And this one says he just doesn't care. It was a
mess.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Tennessee switched to a centralized system in which the
state Bureau of Investigation makes the final call on who gets a
permit. Residents fill out application forms at a driver's license
station or sheriff's department, listing their history of crime and
mental illness. Then they submit fingerprints for background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Applications are forwarded to the state Bureau of Investigation,
which matches names and fingerprints against state and federal
databases and grants permits if people come up clear.
</P>
<P>
   The background check presented another problem, though. Critics
said the checks were worthless, because the databases were
incomplete. Get the fingerprints For a while, local law enforcement
agencies were not sending all fingerprints of arrested persons to
the state databases. Authorities estimated that 30 percent of
felons were not accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper editorialized that the state was playing ``Russian
roulette'' with the checks.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Legislature passed a law requiring law
enforcement to send all their fingerprints to the state. If not,
the state would dock the salaries of sheriffs and police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no databases exist to check for mental illness or
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that law-abiding citizens are the ones going
through the permit process. Only about 1 percent of applications
are rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees that the new centralized system is better
than the old format. A recent change in law still permits sheriffs
to get a copy of each application from their county so they can
provide information on why an applicant should be denied a permit,
such as an ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's experience shows that once a law is passed, expect
it to change.
</P>
<P>
   At one time applicants needed to pay a bond and often had to
wait months for a permit. Now, no bond is needed and permits are
automatically issued within 90 days, even if fingerprint checks
have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   In this session lawmakers are considering measures that would
allow guns in schools and businesses that sell but do not serve
alcohol, two areas where they currently are banned.
</P>
<P>
   State observers are realizing that with the gun law in place,
its effects will be determined by how lawmakers tweak it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People carry guns, regardless,'' said Bob Barker, chief deputy
of the Sumner County Sheriff's Department, in Gallatin. ``You might
as well have a law. But if you're going to have a law, make sure
you do it right.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An apparently innocuous resolution sparked a racially
charged debate in the House Monday, with the measure's white
sponsor describing lawmakers' attempts to amend it as ''stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which would have urged _ but not required _
local school boards to display historical documents such as the
Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution and the
Mayflower Compact in schools, was tabled with the backing of its
sponsor, Rep. Scott Tolbert (R-Pendergrass). Since there are only
two days remaining in the Legislative session, tabling the measure
effectively killed it for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Non-binding resolutions usually pass the House with unanimous
support and little debate, but black lawmakers said Tolbert's
proposal ignored the role of African Americans in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Holmes (D-Atlanta) said the documents included in
Tolbert's resolution ''distort American history,'' since they
didn't include anything ''by or about African American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes offered an amendment that would have added speeches and
writings by African Americans, including Martin Luther King Jr. and
Frederick Douglass, to the list. Although the House had approved an
amendment adding documents of the Cherokee Indian nation, most
white members balked at Holmes' suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than vote on the Holmes amendment, the House choose to
table the entire resolution. The vote was 106-62, with most black
members voting against tabling the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert said he voted to table the resolution because ''what had
started out as a very non-race, purely American bill turned into
something totally stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Holmes, ''Mr. Tolbert doesn't really get it. Unless you
have inclusion by all groups, you're going to perpetuate the
distortions. ''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said his proposed amendment was ''not stupid. It's stupid
to perpetuate the myths.''

THOSE WHO LIKE IKE WANT TO KICK GLICK 
</HEADLINE>

 JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ For 84 years, the marble image of former Kansas
Gov. George Washington Glick has greeted visitors to the U.S.
Capitol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a move afoot to return Glick to Kansas and
replace him with a somewhat better-known Kansan: Dwight D.
Eisenhower of Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower, after all, was the supreme Allied commander during
World War II and went on to become president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Glick's claim to fame? He was the first Democratic governor of
Kansas, and, as one state lawmaker noted Friday, he once called a
special session of the Legislature to deal with an outbreak of
hoof-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each state is allowed to have two statues representing it in the
Capitol in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Glick, who died in 1911 and is buried in his hometown of
Atchison, Kansas is represented by a statue of another Atchison
native, U.S. Sen. John James Ingalls, a Republican who served from
1873 to 1891.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Senate adopted a resolution Friday that would begin
the switch by asking Congress to evict Glick and replace him with a
statue of Eisenhower, yet to be commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Glick's statue would be returned to Topeka for display in the
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   It's now up to the Kansas House to deal with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, offered
the resolution without funneling it through a committee for
scrutiny. ``I like Ike,'' said Bond, who was wearing a campaign
button bearing that slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said it would cost about $200,000 to hire a sculptor,
transport the work to Washington and bring Glick back to Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   He said it shouldn't cost the state anything, although the
resolution provides that the state is responsible if private
efforts to raise the money are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, careful not to criticize Glick, said his resolution would
``bring him home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bond couldn't resist referring to the special session Glick
called to deal with hoof-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   That led Rep. Janis Lee, a Kensington Democrat, to come to
Glick's defense.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the special session in 1884 led to the creation
of a livestock commission and the hiring of a state veterinarian.
She also noted that Glick won passage of legislation to limit
railroad rates for hauling corn, wheat and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as a delegate to the convention that drafted the
state constitution in 1859 and was wounded during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some of you putting your hooves in your mouths,''
Lee said of those who made light of Glick's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, the Republican who represents the 4th
District, suggested switching Eisenhower for Glick.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hanna, Tiahrt's spokesman, said, ``We simply felt it was a
good idea and a way to honor one of the most prominent Kansans, not
only in Kansas but in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, said,
``You know, if Congressman Tiahrt doesn't have better things to do
than to try to remove a statue from Statuary Hall, I think we're in
a great deal of trouble in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said state statues are placed in the Capitol's Statuary
Hall for at least six months after they arrive in Washington and
then are allocated space elsewhere in the building at the
discretion of the Capitol architect.
</P>
<P>
   The Glick statue currently stands on the entry level of the
south wing of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first effort to switch Ike for Glick. In 1971,
the Legislature tried to make the same change, but Congress, then
controlled by Democrats, ignored Kansas' resolution.
</P>
<P>
   James Maag of Topeka was a member of the Kansas House at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   With time on their hands, Maag and several other Republican
backbenchers formed a tongue-in-cheek group they named ``The Don't
Kick Glick Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Maag, a former history teacher at Dodge City Community College,
said the little-known Glick was chosen originally because Congress
requested the selection be made at a time when Democrats controlled
both houses of the Legislature in 1913 and 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Glick was the only Democrat to have been elected to
any statewide office.

COMMENTARY: PROTECTING THE SPIRITUAL _ WHEREVER IT IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a court of law, nesting falcons have far greater legal
leverage than the spiritual needs of the Northern Plains Indian
tribes. That sad fact tells us something about skewed priorities in
our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service can stop recreational climbing at a
monument or a park in order to protect nesting falcons, but it
cannot do so to accommodate religious ceremonies of American
Indians. At least, that is what some climbers argue.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
heard oral arguments concerning climbing on Devils Tower National
Monument in northeast Wyoming. The monument has a reputation as one
of the best crack climbing sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Devils Tower is considered a sacred site by Northern Plains
Indian tribes. The National Park Service, which manages the
monument, had put a voluntary climbing ban in place for the month
of June to accommodate the spiritual ceremonies of the Lakota,
Crow, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Shoshone and other Indian tribes.
June and the summer solstice have a special significance to the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, U.S. District Judge William Downes of the federal
district of Wyoming had ruled that the ban on climbing during the
month of June was constitutional, as long as the ban remained
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial climbing guide Andy Petefish and the Bear Lodge
Multiple Use Association appealed, claiming that the voluntary ban
wasn't really voluntary because the government could use its
enormous influence to coerce climbers into accepting the ban
whether they wanted to or not.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in the appeal, however, is whether the
National Park Service can constitutionally accommodate the
religious beliefs of American Indians in managing the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based Mountain States Legal Foundation, which
represents Petefish and the association, argues that such an
accommodation violates the First Amendment's establishment clause,
that the federal government is showing a preference to a religious
belief and thereby violating the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal overlooks the fact that the NPS accommodates
Christian religious ceremonies at numerous other national parks.
The Park Service asks visitors not to disrupt Catholic services in
the San Antonio Missions in Texas. The NPS closes the Ebenezer
Baptist Church, a National Historic Site in Georgia, to visitors
during special services.
</P>
<P>
   When high Mass is held at the Franciscan church in the
Tumacacori National Historic Park in Arizona, the NPS asks visitors
to remain quiet and respect the ceremony. Do these accommodations
violate the establishment clause? They have not been challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable person must insist that if it is constitutional to
accommodate Christian religious ceremonies on federal lands, then
it is constitutional to accommodate American Indian spiritual
ceremonies on these same lands. No one is forced to participate in
another's religion.
</P>
<P>
   No one is even asked to participate _ only to respect another's
religion. The land is spacious enough to accommodate all religions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the 10th Circuit Court heard the appeal,
the National Park Service closed 20 climbing routes on Devils Tower
to protect nesting prairie falcons. The ban on those routes is
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of climbers nearby could cause the falcons to
abandon their eggs or their chicks. No one has challenged the right
of the NPS to protect falcons. Nor should anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual needs the same protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have lived in the West, on the high plains, understand
the spiritual nature of the land and its wildlife. One has a sense
of awe when watching hawks and eagles in their high gyrations, when
seeing a red fox across a river, when witnessing a flight of white
pelicans circle in an upward spiral until they disappear into the
sky, or a great blue heron lift off a dead branch. One learns a
sense of place within nature, within the landscape. The landscape
feeds the deepest part of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   And there are places on the land that call to each of us, that
in some way announce their sacredness to us.
</P>
<P>
   With the same reverence that we protect our wildlife, we must
protect the spiritual wherever it is found. If we can ban climbing
to ensure the nesting of falcons, we should be able to ban climbing
to ensure that religious beliefs and ceremonies have a rightful
place in the world.

CHAMPION BALLOONISTS HONORED IN SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ As Dr. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones stepped from a
plane from Cairo Monday after becoming the first balloonists to
circle the world nonstop, a trumpeter played the ``Triumphal
March'' from ``Aida'' and a thunderous cheer rose from the
dignitaries and well-wishers who had gathered at Geneva
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In their dark blue flight suits, the champion pilots raised
their arms in a victory salute and beamed at the crowd under a cold
drizzle and overcast sky, a crowd that included children who had
been given the day off from school.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief welcoming speech, Vice President Adolphe Ogi referred
to Antoine de St. Exupery's famous children's book, saying, ``Our
little prince came down from the sky and landed in the desert among
us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Piccard, 41, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his British
co-pilot, Jones, who will be 52 next Saturday, completed a historic
19-day trip around the world in their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon
when they flew over an invisible finish line at 9 degrees 27
minutes west longitude in Mauritania. More than a score of pilots
had tried to go around the world in a balloon before, and all had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd that met the two pilots here was Richard
Branson, the billionaire balloonist who was one of Piccard's main
rivals in round-the-world attempts. The most recent of those ended
on Dec. 25 with a ditching in the ocean near Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   As the Breitling Orbiter 3 crew sprayed each other and Branson
with Champagne, Piccard praised his longtime and intense rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been friends, and even though Richard was not
the first to go around the world, I know he will still fly balloons
just for the joy of flying, a joy our elite group all share,''
Piccard said.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard and Jones spoke of ``a mysterious invisible hand'' that
had seemingly opened the way for them. After the craft had passed
Puerto Rico, he related, calculations suggested that their slow
speed would leave them out of fuel well short of their destination.
``And then,'' Jones said, ``suddenly the speed started to increase
very rapidly, up to 150 miles an hour, and I just threw all my
calculations away.''
</P>
<P>
   Their achievement has won Piccard and Jones the Budweiser Cup
and a $1 million prize from Anheuser-Busch Inc., with half to be
contributed to charities that the pilots choose. Piccard said they
would contribute the money to creating a foundation to improve
conditions for poor people in the countries that they flew over.

AIDES GET A FRONT-ROW SEAT TO HISTORY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Late on election night last November, when House
Speaker Newt Gingrich watched the Republican Party's political
fortunes drop _ along with his own _ Christina Martin was there to
offer solace. Together, they sifted through the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, when J. Dennis Hastert, a little-known Republican
congressman from Illinois, was suddenly on the brink of becoming
speaker of the House, Pete Jeffries was with him. Together, they
tallied who would support his bid.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, when House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt
hastily prepared a speech lamenting the vicious political mood
surrounding impeachment, Laura Nichols was at his side. Together,
they crafted the right words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never 9 to 5,'' Nichols added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity that I never thought that I would have,''
Jeffries said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Front row for history,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   And a seat all three have shared. Nichols, Jeffries and Martin
know what it's like to be the voice for the most powerful people in
the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   They also share another trait: All three are from Johnson
County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the legions of 20- and 30-somethings drawn to the
capital who love the battles and intrigues. And they all believe
that politics, the present toxic atmosphere notwithstanding, can be
a noble calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fighting for what I believe in,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts can peek through, however. ``I hope what we're doing here
is the right thing for the country,'' Jeffries said. ``I know that
sounds sappy and patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's some cynicism, too. ``It's not always as rewarding
as you hope it will be,'' Nichols said. ``In the last four years,
when it's been so partisan and so bitter, you don't get a lot of
satisfaction necessarily out of what you do here every day.''
</P>
<P>
   All three gained entry to the inner corridors of Capitol Hill
through a combination of serendipity and talent.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected occurrence 12 years ago eventually put the
34-year-old Nichols, who is Gephardt's communications director, on
the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' political activism started early. ``I was the kid in
eighth grade that was wearing the Jimmy Carter button to school,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Missouri graduate had just accepted her first
political assignment as Gephardt's deputy press secretary for the
Iowa presidential caucuses. She arrived the day that Gary Hart,
then the top Democrat in the race, withdrew over his affair with
Donna Rice. Suddenly, Gephardt was the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little job became a big job very quickly,'' Nichols
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses and placed second in the New
Hampshire primary, but he ran out of money and dropped out of the
race. Nichols went to Washington and, after a series of Democratic
Party positions, rejoined Gephardt as his press secretary after the
1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
   She's been his primary public voice ever since, the nexus
between his policy statements and the overall message of the House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a good ear, and she also helps me think things through
and what I'm going to say,'' Gephardt said. ``She's just very
valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   The day the House voted to impeach President Clinton, when
speaker-in-waiting Robert Livingston announced he would resign over
an extramarital affair, Gephardt, aided by Nichols and a speech
writer, put into words what everyone was feeling. His impassioned
plea for political civility produced a standing, bipartisan
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dick said spoke volumes about how heartbroken we were
about what had happened to this place that everybody loved, that it
really was no longer the place that anybody remembered,'' Nichols
said. ``It was one of the saddest days in my political career, and
it was one of my proudest days.''

   WASHINGTON _ ...my proudest days.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the White House is trying to lure Nichols, who has
also had offers from the private sector. Recently she acknowledged
that she had considered leaving Capitol Hill. Then Democratic
victories last fall put the party within sight of a House majority
in two years. Now that Gephardt potentially is the next speaker and
has been re-energized _``in his zone,'' as Nichols said _ she put
that decision on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 32, now a vice president with the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association, had not even been exposed
to politics until her freshman year at the University of Kansas in
1985. She won an internship in the office of Sen. Bob Dole, then
the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything from walk the dog _ literally _ to answering
the mail, to giving tours, to answering telephones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's break came in 1988. She was in Washington the summer
after her graduation looking for a job in economics, her field, and
the phone rang. It was the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, her resume included jobs as a White House
aide and speech writer for President George Bush, and roles in
three presidential campaigns: Bush in 1988 and 1992, a win and a
loss, and Dole in 1996, a loss. Martin said she admires both men.
But of the Dole campaign, she said, ``There was more backstabbing
than I have encountered in any political environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She has held several other political posts, with her last as
Gingrich's press secretary. Despite his combative style, Martin
said, Gingrich ``possessed all the characteristics of a favorite
uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a very good run,'' Martin said. ``We fought the good
fight against some very tough adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Her opponents would probably say the same about her. She was
always quick with the verbal stiletto, as in 1996 when she called
Clinton ``commander-in-thief'' for trumpeting his support of a
crime victims constitutional amendment after Dole already had done
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I liked about Christina was she played hard but
stayed within the foul lines,'' Michael McCurry, Clinton's press
secretary, said. ``You have to have a good sixth sense about where
the boundary lines are or you end up saying things and poisoning
debate further.''
</P>
<P>
   But by last fall, she had grown weary of the pace. It didn't
help that the Republicans had suffered surprising losses in the
election. Still, she was as surprised as anyone when Gingrich said
he would step down. Martin said she was holding in her hand the
list of Republican members who had committed to support him for
another term as speaker when she got the call.
</P>
<P>
   Like her boss, she decided to leave the House. ``It was time to
take the emphasis off adrenaline and put it back into balance and
quality of life,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeffries, 34, it was the upheaval associated with
impeachment that catapulted him to the upper reaches of Republican
congressional politics. When Gingrich went down, then Livingston,
it was his boss the party turned to.
</P>
<P>
   His job as communications director is to publicize Republican
legislation and coordinate the party's national message, ``so it
makes sense to that person sitting in Westwood, Kansas, at their
kitchen table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that table that he heard a considerable amount of
political debate. His mother, Nancy Jeffries, was the first woman
to run for a seat on the Westwood City Council in 1970. She served
11 years. She's a Democrat who reveres Franklin D. Roosevelt. Her
husband is a conservative Republican, which Pete Jeffries said,
``made for some interesting holiday dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   The son unveiled his politics at the University of Iowa, when he
became president of a Young Republicans chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' Nancy Jeffries said in mock horror. ``I was
just sick.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in 1986 with a journalism degree and little thought
of entering politics. Covering it was his intention. But while
Jeffries was working as a reporter in Cape Girardeau, Mo.,
Republican Rep. Bill Emerson offered him a job on Capitol Hill.
When Emerson died in 1996 and his wife, Jo Ann, won the seat,
Jeffries joined her staff.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides switch bosses often, and Hastert, then a
deputy House whip and a subcommittee chairman, had a job opening a
year ago. It was a step up, but Jeffries had no hint how big until
last fall, when the Hill was buzzing that Gingrich might resign and
when Hastert's name surfaced as successor.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Hastert couldn't be more different from his
predecessor. Gingrich was a bundle of nervous political energy,
often popping off in the most viscerally partisan way. Hastert is
low-key, almost to the point of being invisible. ``He tries to stay
above the fray,'' Jeffries said.

   Jeffries, whose demeanor mirrors that of his boss, said the
change in political tone is a good thing. ``We understand there's a
political atmosphere around this place,'' he said, ``but there's no
reason you can't do it in a more civil manner.''

THERE'S A REAL WAR GOING ON TO HALT SPREAD OF INFLUENZA

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Allen Parmet seems an unusual soldier in his
midtown Kansas City medical office that sits above a sub shop. He
forsakes a white lab coat for a shirt and tie. With his handlebar
mustache and spectacles, Parmet looks like a man from a bygone age.
</P>
<P>
   But this retired Air Force doctor and pilot is a battle-hardened
veteran of both Vietnam and Project Gargle. That latter operation
didn't hit the headlines, but it was an important part of the
military's fight against influenza.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Parmet is again on the front lines of a new nationwide
fight against the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Parmet, 48, is one of about 10 volunteer doctors in the Kansas
City area who keep tabs on local flu strains. In all, 350 doctors
nationwide are part of U.S. Influenza Sentinel Physician
Surveillance Network.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with cotton swabs, sentinels ship throat culture samples
on to state health departments, which send the findings to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Then the information makes its way to the World Health
Organization. There, germ experts predict what next year's
predominant _ and potentially lethal _ influenza strains will be
and what vaccine should be readied to fight them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're helping them make sure the vaccine they prepare is
appropriate,'' Parmet said.
</P>
<P>
   If the vaccine is on target, people have a better chance to ward
off those wintertime aches and pains. But if the flu shot misfires,
folks are in for a miserable season, not to mention at risk for
serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Each year between 10 percent and 20 percent of Americans
struggle with the flu. Roughly 130,000 influenza victims are
hospitalized each year and about 20,000 patients die from
flu-related health complications.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 100,000 people in Missouri received flu shots given out
by the state health department last year. Kansas did not keep
similar statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shots, the flu infiltrates some areas and
circumvents others. Different communities, even doctors in the same
town, can see widely varying numbers of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide this year, as during the past three years, the flu
has reached widespread and epidemic levels, according to Carolyn
Bridges, a physician with the Influenza Branch at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every year we have these epidemics,'' she said, ``And
when you are the one who is sick and your community is affected,
it's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   National sentinel programs have been around for a long time, but
previous ones did not work with state programs, explained Lynnette
Brammer, an epidemiologist with the federal health agency's
Influenza Branch in Atlanta. The new program, which includes 40
states and the District of Columbia, is in its second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly looking for good physicians who will
report,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Kliethermes works with Missouri's 56 sentinels, and Corinne
Miller coordinates 18 in Kansas. Both are pleased that the program
connects doctors in the field with scientists trying to fend off
the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Flu strains are constantly changing. Scientists believe many new
variations originate in Asia, because of the closeness between
people, birds and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, travelers on planes, trains and automobiles can
export flu varieties from remote agrarian regions to cities across
the globe.
</P>
<P>
   At flu command central, World Health Organization scientists
sift through reports from far-flung doctors such as Parmet to
decide how to battle the prominent, fast-traveling strains.
</P>
<P>
   The health organization gives pharmaceutical companies a shot
recipe of three flu strains, two of the dangerous A strains and one
of the milder B form. The mixture helps ready the body to fight the
illness without passing on the full-blown symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Parmet knows the consequences of making sure people get the
right vaccine. He recalled his first year as an Air Force Academy
student, when influenza left entire barracks anything but battle
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Later Parmet worked with Project Gargle, a sort of military
version of the sentinel program.
</P>
<P>
   ``An epidemic is a serious thing on a military base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a civilian, Parmet's preoccupation with fighting the flu
hasn't left him.
</P>
<P>
   During his daily routine, Parmet is on the lookout for any
flu-like symptoms among his patients, such as a cough or a sore
throat with a 100-degree fever or higher. If Parmet spots a likely
suspect, he takes a cotton swab and swipes the back of that
patient's throat, capturing samples of any viral visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people you sample, the less likely you are to miss
anything important and prevent an epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parmet packs the samples into vials and ships them off to the
state public health lab in Jefferson City. Parmet and other
sentinels also pass on information about the severity and spread of
the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilance is necessary to vanquish such viral enemies, Parmet
said. He hopes colleagues will become sentinels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for doctors to participate. It's protecting our
public health,'' he said. ``It just costs us time.''

DOW'S DANCE WILL BE ENTERTAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's worth noting that after the Dow Jones industrial average
crossed 10,000 for the first time Tuesday, declining stocks at
day's end outnumbered gainers by a significant margin in all major
trading arenas.
</P>
<P>
   It was, therefore, a historic moment worthy of brief
celebration, but hardly a cause for optimism. Despite the solid
gains of the major indexes so far in '99, this market's leadership
seems perilously narrow.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis by The New York Times focused on research
showing just how rickety the overall market is. It showed 92
percent of the Nasdaq stocks and 70 percent of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index stocks below their highs by 10 percent or more.
Meanwhile, a recent Dow Theory Forecasts analysis noted that fully
70 percent of the New York Stock Exchange stocks were trading at
least 25 percent below their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been in the right stocks, or mutual funds owning
the right stocks, you've been making money. If not, you're no doubt
wondering what all the excitement is about. This, of course, is the
way the market always works, but the imbalance between winners and
losers seems dangerously out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag mentioned by The Times was the Salomon Smith
Barney laggards indicator, which measures the number of stocks
underperforming the S&AMP;P 500 by 15 percent or more. Some 75 percent
now qualify as laggards, and a Salomon analyst cautioned that big
market corrections had occurred three of four times when this
indicator topped 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if 10,000 on the Dow isn't an important number. It
is probably the most symbolic number since the blue-chip indicator
first topped 1,000. It did so during intraday trading in early
1966, just as it did Tuesday, but didn't close above 1,000 until
November 1972.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats, 10,000 could become a ceiling rather than a
floor. After the Dow held 1,000 briefly through early '73, it began
a descent to 578, where it bottomed in December 1974. It regained
1,000 for brief periods again in 1976, 1980 and 1981, but it wasn't
until December 1982 that the Dow finally transformed 1,000 from
ceiling to launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unforeseen collapse of the world's economy, which
hardly seems likely, it's not probable 10,000 will be nearly the
restraining force 1,000 was. At the 1,000 level, the world was
facing a mounting array of seemingly intractable economic problems
unsurpassed since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 10,000 could prove a much more difficult hurdle to
get past than the other thousand milestones since a four-digit Dow
became a permanent fact of life. The pessimists say 10,000
represents for many investors a signal to trim sail. Moreover, the
longer it takes the market to secure this new high ground
permanently, the more psychologically daunting it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists say once breached, however, 10,000 will become a
strong psychological floor from which the market will soar. The
road to 11,000 or even 12,000 will be a relative cakewalk, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Dow's entertainment value for the rest of the
year will be high even if the average has trouble deciding whether
10,000 is a floor or ceiling.

VETERANS ARE SEEKING KC HOME FOR MEMORIAL TO HONOR CORPSMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIM KOZLOWSKI  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Army Col. Donald Ballard knows that Hollywood
won't make an Oscar-nominated film about him.
</P>
<P>
   He witnessed atrocities like those in ``Saving Private Ryan,''
but the movie couldn't match Ballard's horrifying experience in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard served as a Navy corpsman. He risked his life while
dressing severed limbs and tying arteries in ravaged chest
cavities.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and former Marine Chuck Wright are looking for a place in
Kansas City to build the Combat Corpsmen National War Memorial. It
would honor the men and women who saved others in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the ultimate war, the ultimate price to pay in the
war,'' said Ballard, a Medal of Honor recipient from North Kansas
City. ``It's dealing with the blood and guts and tears. And it just
tears your heart out when you can't save their lives. And these
guys are your friends, your close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The $2.5 million memorial would honor some 6,000 Army, Navy, Air
Force, Marine and Coast Guard members who died while serving as
corpsmen or medics, the term the Army started using during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Their names would be etched on a 6- to 8-foot-tall, 96-foot-long
granite arc. The names of about 50 corpsmen and medics who received
Medals of Honor also would be engraved on the wall, alongside their
photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medics and corpsmen are held in very high regard,'' said Lt.
Col. Tom Begines, a Defense Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial also would include a life-size statue of a corpsman
treating two comrades as a Marine protects them. It would stand
under a 35-foot copper dome supported by four pillars, in front of
the granite wall. Four fountains, benches and flags _ representing
each branch of service _ would round out the monument.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the memorial would stretch 300 feet, the length
of a football field. Ballard and Wright expect the total complex to
need 3 to 5 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a Vietnam veteran from Gladstone, and Ballard haven't
found a home for the memorial. They have approached Kansas City,
Independence, North Kansas City, Gladstone, Overland Park and
Olathe for a land donation. They say it would be a coup for the
host because it would attract visitors from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McHenry, deputy director of the Kansas City Parks and
Recreation Department, said that the Board of Parks and Recreation
Commissioners would have to make the decision but that he needed
more details before presenting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some precedent out there, so there is a
possibility,'' McHenry said, referring to the Liberty Memorial,
built to honor those who served in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard and Wright have collected $5,000. They have also lined
up the sponsorship of the American Legion Bennett and Dennis
Herrick Memorial Post 626, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 10906
and several other military organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help the community,'' said Roger Kohrs, a member of
the American Legion. ``It will be an asset to all veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   A pre-dedication ceremony is scheduled for Aug. 14 in
conjunction with the VFW's 100th anniversary convention in Kansas
City. The monument would be unveiled May 16, 2000 _ the 32nd
anniversary of the act that earned Ballard the Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, then 22, was returning to his platoon from an
evacuation of two casualties when the North Vietnamese attacked.
Under heavy fire, he rushed to a wounded Marine and began treating
him.
</P>
<P>
   As Ballard directed four Marines to carry the man to a safer
area, a grenade landed nearby. He threw himself on it to protect
the others. When the grenade didn't explode, Ballard threw it back.
</P>
<P>
   The act inspired Wright to begin the project, but Ballard wanted
to honor all corpsmen, especially those who had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody needs to do this before it's too late,'' Wright said.
``Before I die. Before Don dies. Why can't we recognize people
while they're alive?''
</P>
<P>
   Contributions can be sent to American Legion Bennett and Dennis
Herrick Memorial Post 626, P.O. Box 10613, Gladstone, MO 64188.

TENNESSEE'S EXPERIENCED WITH RESIDENTS CARRYING CONCEALED WEAPONS

<P>
   LA VERGNE, Tenn. _ Aside from the inventory of his wood-paneled
gun shop outside Nashville, John Arnold keeps a cache for his own
protection.
</P>
<P>
   There is a gun in his desk drawer, another in his assistant's
desk, a shotgun in an adjacent office and a spare gun in the glove
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what?'' said Arnold, owner of Specialty Arms II.
``I've never felt the need to use one for self-defense. I've never
had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of Tennesseans, Arnold is armed _ just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tennessee's right-to-carry law passed in 1994, almost
70,000 residents have applied for permits. Tennesseans have bought
more than 100,000 guns since November, with dealers reporting brisk
sales to permit holders. Missourians vote April 6 on whether to
adopt a similar law.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking to Tennessee for clues might find it too early to
tell. Skeptics and supporters have been surprised by the results.
There were warnings that the state would turn into a reckless,
modern version of the ``Wild West.'' There were predictions that
violent criminals would be deterred. So far the forecast has been
wrong on both fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Gun opponents' fears have not come true. Law enforcement
officials and legislators can think of no accidental shootings,
injuries or crimes tied to the legal carrying of guns.
</P>
<P>
   And contrary to what supporters promised, violent crime in
Tennessee actually increased 6 percent from 1994 to 1997, although
no one in Tennessee has proved that the law is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thomas, executive director of the Tennessee Sheriffs'
Association, and other state officials said their experience could
hold lessons for Missouri, a neighbor with similar population and
racial demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to destroy the state of Missouri, at least if
it follows what happened to us,'' said Thomas, a former police
chief in Alcoa, Tenn., who had doubts about the law at first. ``But
it may not do anything to make the state a better place to live,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because authorities and gun owners agree that thousands
carried guns in Tennessee, even before the law passed. One former
officer said that if he had a dollar for every gun he found on a
motorist, he ``would own the Bahamas by now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you they're carrying guns in Kansas City, too,''
Arnold added. ``The only thing the law does is make it legal.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been effects, subtle ones.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they feel safer, with polls finding a majority in
support of the law. Some law enforcement experts said people might
be feeling a false sense of security, considering that crime has
increased statewide.
Now that there is a carry law on the books, authorities say they
are taking illegal carrying, even by well-meaning persons,
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners are taking their weapons more seriously, too. A
required class is designed to teach them exactly when to use their
guns, even if they have decades of experience with firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Take Martin Bennett of Nashville. A few years ago thieves kept
breaking into cars at his auto dealership.
</P>
<P>
   One night Bennett waited for the thieves in a car. Soon he heard
the windows breaking a few feet away. Bennett emerged with a
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed the gun at the man in front of him. Don't move,
Bennett said as he turned to call the police. The man took a few
steps toward him and reached under his coat. Was he pulling a gun?
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment the man ran away.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds more and Bennett might have shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after taking an eight-hour course for his permit, Bennett
realizes he should not have brandished the gun in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most impressionable thing about the videos we saw is
stressing the responsibility and consequences involved. It makes
you think,'' Bennett said, minutes before taking his turn at a gun
range.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the training courses have helped turn gun owners
into responsible gun owners. Before applying for permits,
Tennesseans must complete four hours of training in a classroom and
on the gun range, at their own expense. Applicants also must pass
written and shooting exams.
</P>
<P>
   Not all states require training. Missouri would require 12
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough?
</P>
<P>
   Several instructors in Tennessee said no, especially for those
shooting guns for the first time. Many students request more
training on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Once approved, permit holders are not required to return to the
gun range. Some say residents should be required to follow the
example of police officers, whose job requires constant training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a crock,'' said Tom Gibson, owner of Crime Watch
security company. ``If a police officer needs more training, what
chance does John Q. Citizen have when they're confronting the bad
guy?''
Several schools offer classes that go beyond the required eight
hours. Authorities point to Buford Tune's Academy of Personal
Protection and Safety in Nashville as a role model. Tune demands 16
hours of training, including segments on civil law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities wonder how many training courses offer
quality programs. Some worry about ``fly-by-night'' schools that do
not have qualified instructors, although all schools must be
certified by the state Department of Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The state reports more than 175 certified schools, although
several random calls reached disconnected numbers. Training classes
have popped up in strip malls, office buildings and isolated gun
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Safety randomly inspects classes to ensure
that instructors are teaching properly. But they cannot police
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago a Nashville television news crew broadcast a
shocking series after taking hidden cameras to a class. The footage
showed instructors giving students answers to the written test and
one teacher confiding, ``I'm not supposed to tell anybody how easy
(the class) is, but it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like that disturb Tune, an imposing man who, to simulate
stressful conditions, yells in his students' ears at the gun range.
He takes his duties as an instructor seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``An instructor is God to someone who has no experience,'' said
Tune, a former Nashville police officer. ``If they're not teaching
correctly, that's a scary thought. Some of these teachers can
barely spell G-U-N.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to questions about training, Tennessee worked
several years to develop an effective application system.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola faces crossroads as it celebrates 100 years
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ A hundred years and counting.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola bottling system has come a long way from its mule
and wagon beginnings. But as it celebrates its centennial
anniversary here Wednesday, the bottling system is at a crossroads,
facing increasing pressure to reinvent itself for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Intense competition, the need for huge amounts of capital and
equipment, and the changing retail climate are three of the soft
drink industry's key challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them all lurks one cold fact of life _ consolidation. The
big Coca-Cola bottlers are going to continue to swallow the smaller
ones as they try to drive up soft-drink consumption to fatten the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States will drop
to fewer than 50 within five years, some analysts predict, down
from 96 today. Only 19 years ago, the country had 353 Coca-Cola
bottlers. A similar trend is occurring around the world, where
Coca-Cola is sold in nearly 200 nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the consolidation to continue,'' said Jack Stahl,
president of Coca-Cola's North America Group. ``It will happen
naturally. I think it will happen in a way that works for the
bottlers. It will work for the Coca-Cola Company. It will work for
our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike takeovers in many other industries where local
operations often are shuttered after the deals are done, the
bottling companies that emerge must be strengthened in the local
markets they serve. If not, the deals can backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the brand relevant on a market-to-market
basis,'' Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing doesn't work everywhere because of local
tastes,'' added Bob Lovell, vice president of marketing for
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United, which owns the Chattanooga plant.
``Barbecue in the South is pork. Barbecue in Texas is beef. ''
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT BEGAN
</P>
<P>
   To understand the significance of this consolidation, it's
important to first understand how Big Red operates from its Atlanta
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest beverage company does not produce or
distribute its soft drinks. It is essentially a huge marketing
company that sells the special concentrate used to make the drinks
to bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   The bottlers, some completely independent of Coca-Cola and some
owned partially by the company, then produce and distribute the
drinks in specific territories, or franchises.
</P>
<P>
   That system of franchising bottling companies dates back to 1899
when, for a $1, Coca-Cola President Asa Candler reluctantly agreed
to give two Chattanooga lawyers the exclusive right to bottle the
drink throughout most of the country. The lawyers teamed up with a
businessman and started selling franchises across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it took about $5,000 to equip the average
soft-drink bottling plant, which used mules and wagons to
distribute the product to grocery stores. Before then, consumers
could only drink Coca-Cola at soda fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the franchises were purchased as family businesses that
were passed from generation to generation. And much of the business
_ except for the mules _ remained the same until 1955, when
different size bottles were introduced. Five years later, Coca-Cola
bottlers started to use aluminum cans, and, in the early 1960s, the
company introduced new drinks, such as Fanta, Sprite and Fresca.
</P>
<P>
   Different brands and containers began to proliferate in the
1960s, '70s and '80s, while population growth, TV commercials and
other marketing efforts were driving consumption of soft drinks
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Bottlers needed more automated technology spread over larger
territories. That required lots of capital, as well as high levels
of debt in some cases, so more production plants and warehouses
could be built and equipped. More trucks and vending machines also
had to be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the game was, and still is, distribution _ you can't
sell it if you can't get it into people's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old cliche of wanting to be within an arm's reach
of desire,'' said Summerfield Johnston Jr., chairman of Coca-Cola
Enterprises, the system's largest bottler. ``That was true then,
and it's true today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottlers started to merge to maximize profits as their operating
costs rose to handle the increased volume. When the heirs of a
small, family-owned bottling operation wanted to sell out, large
bottlers were more than ready to pay the price. In fact, some of
the large bottlers would compete against each other for the chance
to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have bid against each other in the past, and I'm sure we
will in the future,'' said Lauren Steele, spokesperson of Coca-Cola
Bottling Consolidated, the system's second-largest bottling company
in the United States behind Atlanta-based CCE.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the retail climate in America was changing,
which drove bottling consolidation even further. Big supermarket
chains and convenience store operators were taking over much of the
retail industry from smaller stores. The big chains preferred to
deal with fewer and larger bottlers, which would simplify their own
retail operations.
</P>
<P>
   That situation continues to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer profile is changing among our retail customers
across America. Consolidation is taking place,'' said Lovell, the
Coca-Cola United official. ``They're more sophisticated, both
technologically and information-systems wise than they have ever
been in the past. So it means that we have to keep up with them.
... Today, we've got to have people who are much more highly
skilled in selling and communicating with these customers.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG COKE'S BIG MOVE
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. itself made a dramatic move in 1986 to further
change the bottling landscape and accelerate consolidation. Big Red
spun off some company-owned bottling operations and merged them
with two other large bottling groups, creating CCE.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Coca-Cola had a 49 percent stake in the new publicly
traded CCE. The stake is now 40 percent. Last year, Coca-Cola spent
$1.2 billion on marketing and sales-related equipment for CCE, up
54 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In just 13 years, through an aggressive acquisition program, CCE
has corralled 74 percent of Coca-Cola's volume in North America.
Last year alone, CCE spent more than $2 billion buying up U.S.
bottlers. Analyst Andrew Conway of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
predicts CCE will capture about 80 percent of the U.S. market in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be 80 percent before five years,'' responded
Johnston, CCE's chairman, when told of Conway's prediction. ``The
acquisition business is one of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coca-Cola's main rival, Pepsico, has decided to follow the
CCE bottling model. It's spinning off a publicly traded bottling
company that analysts say will intensify competition and
consolidation in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts don't necessarily think Coca-Cola or its large
bottlers will suffer over the long term from Pepsico's moves.
Several said there's more than enough business to go around,
especially if recent price increases in supermarkets stick and if
smart marketing campaigns continue to drive up consumption.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, the country's per capita consumption of soft
drinks was 31 gallons a year, analyst Conway said. Today, it's
about 56 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   But Stahl said Coca-Cola has the opportunity to boost annual
sales by 250 million cases in the United States, which translates
into an increase of 20 to 25 drinks per person per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge opportunity,'' Stahl said. ``The greater our
understanding of consumers, the greater our ability to connect with
our customers, the faster we'll create those growth cases.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes Coca-Cola is ``undersold'' virtually everywhere,
even, he quipped, in parts of its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key ways to drive up business is through high-margin
vending machines. Bottlers are responsible for financing those
machines, as well as figuring out where they can get the biggest
bang for their buck when they deploy them like an automated Red
Army.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year alone, CCE spent $800 million _ half of
its entire capital spending budget _ to dispense and service
vending machines and coolers, which bolster the sales of higher
priced, individual units of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ANCHORS AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of such enormous capital requirements, Coca-Cola
has been expanding its system of huge ``anchor bottlers,'' which
have the resources to drive up sales volume throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   CCE is the largest of these anchor bottlers, with nine others
around the world and a 10th one in the making in Japan. There is no
more than one anchor bottler in any country, and most cover several
nations. Collectively, anchor bottlers distribute in about 50
countries and comprise 45 percent of volume worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enter into anchor bottler partnerships because we expect
results beyond what we could attain alone or with multiple
bottlers,'' Coca-Cola said in its annual report that was released
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation in the soft drink industry, however, differs
from other industries. While ownership, financing and
administration may become centralized in some acquisitions, large
bottlers must maintain and even expand their local sales, marketing
and distribution forces.
</P>
<P>
   And they must keep a large part of the decision-making in the
hands of the local people because there are wide differences in
consumer preferences in different markets, as well as the need for
tailored marketing campaigns. A Coke promotion with the University
of Tennessee is not going to play well in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has to be locally run,'' said CCE spokeswoman
Laura Asman. ``It's a pretty old-fashioned formula, but it's one
that has worked well for our company. ... We have 66,000 employees,
with only a few hundred in Atlanta's headquarters.

CABIN IN THE WOODS ONCE AGAIN SHELTERS THE BEGINNING OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One spring it was a coyote that whelped under my cabin floor.
Other springs a fox brought off her kits there.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, in a hard spell of winter, a passing tire
struck down a beagle mama a short way down my country road and
scattered her orphaned pups across those wooded hills.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them made a nest beside a log at the back of the cabin
clearing and tried to find a living baying after rabbits in the
night. Eventually those two joined me indoors beside the stove, and
we spent the next 14 years together.
</P>
<P>
   It has always pleased me, somehow, that so many creatures
needing shelter have found their way to that humble place at the
woods' edge.
</P>
<P>
   This year it is a black, short-legged dog with pricked ears,
friendly eyes and no identifiable _ or even /{guessable/} _
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   I've no idea where she came from, though possibly from the house
of the new people on the far side of the road. She looks
well-enough nourished, but clearly no provision was made for the
birthing, so she'd had to find a place.
</P>
<P>
   All night I heard her little ones mewing and scuffling under the
cabin floor, directly below my bed. And in the morning, slipping
quietly onto the porch and peering around a corner, I finally saw
them.
</P>
<P>
   There were two: fuzzy bundles of cinnamon-colored fur, with
broad little faces and black markings _ the mother's gift _ around
their eyes and muzzles. I supposed she'd gone off to wherever
someone had set out a pan of food, because the pups sat pressed
close together, giving impatient little yips, wanting her to hurry
back with those faucets of life.
</P>
<P>
   I stepped outside, then, and instantly those two were gone, back
through the hole between the ground and the cabin's bottom log _
back to the dark and safety of the den.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, curiosity overcame them. One nose was thrust out,
then the other. Then both ventured forth. Plainly they knew nothing
of people, and no hand had ever touched them. Nor would mine.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke softly and, kneeling, waited a bit. One of them, the
smaller, wanted to come _ took a couple of timid steps forward but
could advance no farther. The danger was too great.
</P>
<P>
   When I stood, both disappeared into their hole again and stayed
there until most of an hour later, when I noticed from my window
that the mother had come back. She let them nurse. And afterward,
while she stood watch, they tumbled in the grass outside their den,
happy under the warm sun of another perfect day.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbed in their play, they paid no attention when I stepped
outside again. The mother came to me, cautious at first, then
eagerly. She seemed glad to be spoken to and stroked. It must be a
lonely business to bear your young unattended in the dark of a
borrowed place. Were there just the two, or did only two survive?
</P>
<P>
   There cannot be much future for cur pups who enter the world as
unnoticed accidents in a country neighborhood. Those two can
imagine nothing of what waits. For a bit longer, they will not feel
the sting of curdom, will not know they are unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   For now, life is sweet perfection _ or would be if that
two-legged creature would not come trespassing, tromping about
heavily on the boards above.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon I drove back to the city. The gate is closed now,
the cabin locked and silent, that little piece of property entirely
theirs again. And I don't begrudge their use of it.
</P>
<P>
   Their need is greater than my own. And for them, as for so many
newborns of the world, childhood lasts hardly a moment.

ARAFAT MAY DELAY PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Yasser Arafat, who is to meet with President Clinton
on Tuesday, has always been a master of the tightrope, and once
more his acrobatic skills are being put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Arafat, the Palestinian leader, faces
mounting pressure to declare a state on May 4. That is the day when
a five-year transitional period of limited self-rule, established
under the Oslo peace agreement with Israel, was supposed to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But internationally, Arafat faces equally keen pressure to defer
any declaration, since many think it would provoke Israel to react
militarily and rupture the fragile understandings built through
years of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. experts believe that Arafat
is leaning toward delaying a statehood proclamation. Although he
has consistently referred to May 4 as a ``sacred date,'' he dropped
a couple of public hints in the last two days that he would be
willing to let it pass without making history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have an independent state sooner or later,'' Arafat
said in Sweden on Sunday, brushing off a question about May 4.
``It's a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arafat is clearly seeking international guarantees that
he can present to his people, evidence that there will be a payoff
for a postponement. This might include pledges to accept a future
Palestinian state, promises of more financial assistance or limited
but immediate recognition of Palestinian sovereignty by
international institutions that lend money, issue satellite
frequencies, and mediate trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, Arafat has traveled Europe and the Arab
world extensively, from Finland to Bahrain. Tuesday's meeting in
Washington with President Clinton will be the second in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that Clinton will promise to advance
diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state. The Clinton
administration has long insisted that both Israelis and
Palestinians refrain from taking any unilateral action on the
issues _ like statehood _ that are supposed to be hammered out in
the final status negotiations between them.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton gives Arafat a kind of international recognition
just by meeting with him in the White House _ especially given what
the Israelis have dubbed the American ``snub diplomacy'' toward
their prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has not visited the White House at all this year,
although Yitzhak Mordechai, his former defense minister who is
challenging him for prime minister in the May 17 elections, was a
guest there last week.
</P>
<P>
   As Arafat flew to Washington Monday, Netanyahu was in Russia,
prompting some sarcastic commentary from Israeli columnists.
``There was a time when Israeli politicians were invited to
Washington, and Arab leaders went to Moscow,'' Akiva Eldar wrote in
the daily Haaretz Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Arafat may not be eager to rush a
declaration of statehood. The most important is that he would not
want to make an empty pronouncement. That would invite comparisons
to 1988 when, while still in exile, he issued a declaration of
independence from Algiers that many Palestinians have since mocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he can declare statehood and everything is
transformed,'' said Itamar Rabinowitz, a professor at Tel Aviv
University, a former peace negotiator and the former Israeli
ambassador to Washington. ``The calculus is complex for Arafat.
Over what territory does he announce statehood? If it's only the
land they have so far, why bother? If it's more, then he draws
lines that make future negotiations difficult. And there will be
future negotiations no matter what.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also, many believe that a declaration of statehood by Arafat
would enhance Netanyahu's chance for re-election by scaring or
angering potential swing voters, pushing them to support his
right-wing campaign. If Netanyahu launched a retaliatory military
action _ by annexing parts of the West Bank, as he has threatened _
many Israelis would rally behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat speaks in various voices on the subject of Palestinian
statehood, depending on his audience. Last Friday, addressing a
rally in Ramallah, Arafat was his fiery revolutionary self. He
promised to ``wage battles,'' if necessary, to defend his right to
declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state will be established with Jerusalem as its capital,
whether they like it,'' he said, continuing with a variation on an
Arabic saying, ``If they don't like it, they can drink from the
waters of the Dead Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, in Paris, before he flew on to Washington,
Arafat spoke like a diplomat. He said he was willing to defer a
statehood declaration if the Israelis, who have frozen the most
recent peace memorandum, engaged in ``precise and honest compliance
with everything that has been signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, arguing that the Palestinians had violated their
obligations under the latest peace memorandum, froze Israel's
compliance with the agreement in December, shortly before a
deadline to turn over a chunk of West Bank land. A few weeks later,
his government was dissolved by parliament, and Israel plunged into
a volatile election campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat does delay a statehood declaration, it is likely to be
only a short delay. After the Israeli elections, the new prime
minister will have to move quickly to reestablish peace
negotiations, analysts say. Building on the framework of the Oslo
accord, the government would have to negotiate a new time line for
compliance with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The final status talks, which deal with the issues of borders,
Jerusalem and refugees, would have to get under way immediately,
analysts say _ or else, the same threats and counterthreats will
repeat themselves next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has been pressured to postpone a declaration of statehood
_ not just by Americans and Europeans but apparently by Jordanians
and Egyptians as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, said in Amman,
Jordan, last weekend that the decision on when to make the
declaration lies in Arafat's hands. But he added, ``The Palestinian
state is a strategic goal, but the timing is a tactical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A veteran military correspondent for the Yedioth Ahronoth
newspaper, Ron Ben Yishai, reported Monday that senior officials of
the Israeli Defense Ministry feel that Netanyahu is making too much
of Arafat's declarations about statehood to his own people. He
wrote that the officials felt that Netanyahu, by issuing threats,
risked backing Arafat into a corner where he must make such a
declaration ``so as not to be appear to be a coward in his people's
eyes.''

MIRAMAX PARTY BASKS IN A GOLDEN GLOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ As the long day's journey into Oscar night slid
into the chilly morning after, Hollywood's new clown prince finally
sat down to eat.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, Roberto Benigni had waltzed across the
seats of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, trying not to step on the
big-studio egos he'd already big-footed to a pulp.
</P>
<P>
   Now the doe-eyed Italian comic and friends were yakking it up at
the Governors Ball, basking in their overnight status as part of
the new Oscar aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling that unlikely roost of semi-famous foreign actors and
offbeat flicks was Miramax Films, the once-scrappy independent
turned even scrappier Disney affiliate. Cementing its position as
Oscar's unofficial tastemaker, Miramax blew away the majors again
this year with wins in four of the big six categories: best picture
(``Shakespeare in Love''), actor (Benigni), actress (Gwyneth
Paltrow) and supporting actress (Judi Dench), plus best
foreign-language film (``Life Is Beautiful,'' the all-Benigni,
all-the-time vehicle).
</P>
<P>
   As the moussed and tuxedoed multitudes headed off to party, the
big studios licked their wounds and took whatever solace they could
in Steven Spielberg's being named best director for ``Saving
Private Ryan'' _ the biggest casualty of a costly pre-Oscar
publicity war with ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hollywood's old guard, the debut of ``Sunday at the Oscars''
was anything but super. Technical glitches and tedious shtick
marred the grueling four-hour telecast, the longest in Oscar's 71
years. The academy's controversial decision to bestow an honorary
statuette on director Elia Kazan added more gray hues to an evening
fitfully brightened by Benigni's over-the-top effusiveness and
Dench's regal dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why even the Governors Ball, the traditional first
stop on the post-Oscar pub crawl, seemed subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming through Listerine-colored lighting, with fabric
treatments and tablecloths to match, guests scarfed down white
herb-crusted salmon and chocolates shaped like vintage movie
cameras. The menu, courtesy of Wolfgang Puck, was inscribed on
individual pewter-framed party favors at each place setting.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd thinned out around 11, Warren Beatty and Annette
Bening could be seen chatting quietly with another couple near the
entrance. Gil Cates, producer of the interminable telecast, looked
like a man who could use a drink _ or a nice cup of Earl Grey tea.
By half past midnight, only a few die-hards were still getting
jiggy with the '70s boogie tunes. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
Miramax headroom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across town, (night) life was a lot more beautiful at the
Miramax party in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel, where
the studio celebrated winning 10 Oscars, including best picture for
``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The lounge, still a preeminently kitschy monument to Old
Hollywood, was stuffed with party-goers, despite being a relatively
tough ticket among A-list parties for the night.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner, best actor nominee Nick Nolte sat with girlfriend
Vicki Lewis, who plays the ditsy redheaded secretary on NBC's
``NewsRadio,'' at a small reserved table.
</P>
<P>
   She looked fabulous in a foam-green, form-fitting, vaguely
Elizabethan outfit with a corsetted top, floor-length skirt and
wonderful beading over a knee-length jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte, meanwhile, was nose-to-nose talking with evil twin Gary
Busey, who had a dark-haired beauty in tow. At other points, Nolte
was leaning back, puffing cigarettes and watching the room.
</P>
<P>
   The very sweet Lewis said they had decided against going to the
always-crazy scene surrounding the Vanity Fair party a couple of
miles away at West Hollywood's Morton's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner, new Miramax adviser and former Vanity Fair
editor Tina Brown was schmoozing by the table reserved for
playwright Tom Stoppard, who co-wrote ``Shakespeare'' and won an
Oscar for it, and some of the movie's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Near Brown was her longtime associate, former Vanity Fair
publisher Ron Galotti, who came with her from the Conde Nast chain
when Brown signed a deal with Miramax to develop a new magazine and
other media properties. Galotti is to be the publisher of Brown's
new Miramax magazine, called Blather.
</P>
<P>
   By the entrance, shorthaired and just-plain-short singer Michael
Bolton, looking dapper and tan, was eyeing the crowd as it came in.
</P>
<P>
   In a side room, best actor winner Roberto Benigni was in a booth
with his family and decidedly not dancing on tables, chairs, other
stars or anyone's jokes.
</P>
<P>
   After a relentlessly ebullient evening both in front of the
camera and backstage before journalists, the previously effusive
Benigni managed to restrain himself quietly while the party raged
on around him.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, best supporting actor nominee (and previous
Oscar winner for ``Shine'') Geoffrey Rush smoked a series of
cigarettes in that flat-handed style so popular among English and,
it appears, Aussie artsy types, while posing for pictures with
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the sushi and salmon bar (simply
scrumptious, by the way), South African sex kitten Charlize Theron
cemented her S&AMP;M credentials (already jacked sky-high by the
catfight scene in ``Two Days in the Valley'' a couple of years
back) with a floor-length black rubber skirt and brunette tresses
pulled tight against her head.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her was boyfriend and Third Eye Blind lead singer
Stephen Jenkins, with bad mutton-chop facial hair and a rocker's
look, as they picked through the food and chatted with numerous
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Another young couple in love, Rachael Leigh Cook and Ryan
Alosio, murmured like turtledoves as they moved through the room.
They are co-stars in ``The Hi-Line,'' a recent Sundance Film
Festival entry, and she appears regularly in ``Dawson's Creek'' and
recently starred in the teen ``Pygmalion''-esque flick ``She's All
That.''
</P>
<P>
   Out front, in the maddening push of limos, red-carpet paparazzi
and TV cameras, and general craziness, Vondie Curtis-Hall
(``Chicago Hope'') beat an early retreat from the scene, as did
many others, long before best actress winner Gwyneth Paltrow
showed.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the night's Elizabethan tone, many of the women
at the party wore gowns evoking that era, with huge, space-eating
volumes of skirts and shoes just this side of stilts. Few men
ventured into fashion statements, sticking to tried-and-true tuxedo
black. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
Your Standard affair &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scene was much different over at the even more exclusive
party at the Standard Hotel on the Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The recently opened hotel is owned by Andre Balacz, who also
owns Chateau Marmont a couple of miles down the strip and the Soho
Grande in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard, however, is a totally different kind of joint from
those two hotels, with a vibe that crosses Judy Jetson '60s
Futurama design with a decidedly postmodern irony.
</P>
<P>
   There's the live nudes, some of them pierced, shaved and
tattooed, that recline in turns on green-lit see-through inflatable
pillows in a wall cutout above and behind the check-in area.
</P>
<P>
   There's the diner area, taken pretty much from 1956, with curves
on every corner and waitresses wearing Madge clothes over their own
youthful curves.
</P>
<P>
   There's the blue, cushioned AstroTurf around the pool balcony,
cottage-cheese ceiling stucco, hanging ball-shaped plastic chairs,
and orange wall panels in the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The look merged with a decidedly younger crowd from the Miramax
'do, with more same-sex couples, more gaunt but beautiful models of
both genders and more relentless hipness. And, as promised in the
invitation made to look like a food-ingredient label, the party had
``0 grams of photographers.''
</P>
<P>
   The early party in the hotel's lobby and other public areas
started to break up when the bars shut down around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ( &LR; SECOND TAKE FOLLOW) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But another, much more exclusive party was already going on in
a red-lit room tucked off the diner. While the famous eased past
several beefy security guards blocking the diner's glass doors,
others pressed to get through _ with no luck. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Matt Dillon, recently shorn of former flame Cameron Diaz,
arrived with best actor nominee Edward Norton and a pack of
hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's hot young manager, Rick Yorn of Michael Ovitz's new
company, also was at the party. Yorn _ the subject of a recent
Vanity Fair piece detailing Ovitz's behind-the-scenes war with
Creative Artists Agency _ the company he used to head _ also
represents Leonardo DiCaprio and Drew Barrymore among others.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Vince Vaughan showed, without his longtime girlfriend but
with permed hair, a beard and a distinct Elvis impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Other young bachelors about town at the party included Adrian
Brody of ``The Thin Red Line'' and Steven Dorff of ``Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more than models at the party, however, including
Marisa Tomei, Rose McGowan, Julia Ormond and Gena Gershon, as well
as Sofia Coppola, who is following in her father Francis' footsteps
and about to direct her first film, ``The Virgin Suicides.'' &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
The Elton way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest tickets of the post-Oscar evening was Sir
Elton John and InStyle magazine's bash at Pagani on Melrose Avenue,
which raised $400,000 for the Elton John AIDS Foundation and
attracted more than 1,000 from the entertainment and fashion
industries.
</P>
<P>
   It officially started at 4:30 p.m. with a dinner of organic
carrot and ginger soup, Chilean sea bass with risotto and warm
chocolate tarts for dessert prepared by chef Claude Segal with host
Elton John (in a purple beaded suit) stopping at each table to make
sure everybody knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned on huge banks of televisions so guests could
watch the Oscars from their tables _ and also in the huge bar and
stage set up in a clear plastic tent where you could see
helicopters buzzing and searchlights crossing overhead.
</P>
<P>
   After the Oscars were over, the celebs started pouring in as
soon as the extensive security committee allowed them onto the
leopard print carpet leading into the chi-chi restaurant. Among
them were Oscar nominees Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Emily Watson
and Lynn Redgrave, as well as the usual A-list members such as
Helen Hunt, Geena Davis, Kevin Costner, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger,
Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Ellen DeGeneres, Anne
Heche, Jim Carrey and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   From the music industry were Lionel Ritchie, LeAnn Rimes, k.d.
lang, Rod Stewart, Janet Jackson, Natalie Cole, Whitney Huston,
Lisa Marie Presley, Mariah Carey and Donny Osmond, with a saucy
vocal group called the Pussy Cat Dolls performing ``Hey, Big
Spender,'' and other show tunes on the center stage.
</P>
<P>
   TV stars turned out, too. They ranged from old guard members
such as Jay Leno, Jane Seymour, Ed McMahon and Robert Wagner (with
daughters Natasha, Katie and Courtney) to the newer generation,
including ``Sabrina'' star Melissa Joan Hart, ``Felicity's'' Keri
Russell, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's'' Sarah Michelle Gellar,
``The Practice'' stars Dillon McDermott and Camryn Manheim, as well
as ``Caroline in the City'' star Lea Thompson, a Valley girl who
said she came for a good time _ and a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   The party was supposed to end at 2 a.m., but you know how
parties in L.A. are. They never stop until the fire marshals go in
and turn the lights out, which at Elton's soiree was about 3 a.m. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
`Saving Private' party &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Best director Steven Spielberg and his ``Saving Private Ryan''
star Tom Hanks, a best actor nominee, showed up at the
DreamWorks/Paramount party at Barnaby's, where guests dined on raw
oysters, shiitake mushroom pizza and chicken pot pie.
</P>
<P>
   Handshaking. Hugs. Air kisses. Make that big wet kisses from
Italy's ``Life Is Beautiful'' Oscar winner Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the best picture award, there was head-shaking,
too.

NATIONAL GROUPS SAY BUSH OPPOSES ABORTION RIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With opposite motives, two national organizations that speak out
on abortion are declaring that Gov. George W. Bush is against
abortion rights as he readies his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's a roller coaster for Bush, who was criticized a few weeks
ago by conservative activists and another Republican presidential
candidate for a perceived softening of his stance.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League started television advertisements in Iowa and New Hampshire
that say Bush and another prospective GOP candidate, Elizabeth
Hanford Dole, are ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The two states hold early, key contests in the presidential
nominating process next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee
said last week that Bush ``has a pro-life record and has taken a
pro-life position'' but that by portraying his stance as moderate,
the news media has been misrepresenting him.
</P>
<P>
   For his own part, Bush said Monday that he does not expect to
get everyone's vote if he runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view it in terms of winning or losing, I just know
what I believe. I am pro-life,'' Bush told reporters in Austin,
Texas. ``I've had a clear and consistent position ever since I got
into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the abortion rights group, Kate Michelman, told
a Washington news conference that presidential candidates are
trying to hide their ``extreme views'' against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Dole ``oppose a woman's right to choose'' abortion, she
said, ``but both know they must communicate more moderate views if
they are to be elected.'' If they don't tell the voters about their
real positions on abortion, she said, ``We will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to allow a single American to be fooled,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman's statements put NARRAL in the unusual position of
agreeing with the National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of criticizing Bush's stance on abortion, people who
want to ``save unborn children'' should focus on the ``extreme
pro-abortion position'' of the likely Democratic nominee, Vice
President Al Gore, the National Right To Life Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bush said the nation was not ready to overturn
Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that made abortion
legal. Instead of arguing about the case, he said, ``what we ought
to do is promote policies that reduce abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush said he believed abortion was wrong and
abortions should be banned except in cases of rape, incest or a
threat to the life of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also refused to commit himself to keeping anti-abortion
language in the national GOP's platform.
</P>
<P>
   His statements were criticized by Gary Bauer, a GOP candidate,
and by other conservative activists. They said Bush was not taking
a strong enough stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dole, a spokesman told Reuters on Monday that she opposes
abortion and ``will say it in her own way and with her own words at
the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Right To Life Committee has not seen any other
Republican candidate's stand distorted, executive director David
O'Steen said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if other candidates have taken a stronger position against
abortion than Bush, O'Steen said, ``I am not going to get into who
is more pro-life'' because all Republican candidates are in
essential agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelman told the Houston Chronicle that she saw a slight
difference between Bush and Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tries to soften it _ and Elizabeth Dole simply won't answer
the question on the issue, and I think that is not acceptable,''
Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Both would appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices who would
overturn Roe vs. Wade, Michelman contended.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Dole has not formally declared her candidacy. Both
have established exploratory committees that allow them to raise
and spend money to decide if they want to run.
</P>
<P>
   One potential Republican candidate, New York Gov. George Pataki,
says the party should jettison its official opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should focus on what divides us from Democrats and not what
divides us as Republicans,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Pataki came under fire from two GOP contenders for
taking that stand.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, appearing on ABC-TV's
``This Week'' program, said removing the anti-abortion plank from
the platform would ``start a civil war'' within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, appearing on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said the
New York governor's support for abortion rights would disqualify
him from being on a Forbes-led ticket. Last year, the
multi-millionaire publisher had said Pataki should be on every GOP
candidate's short-list of potential running mates.

PRICES AT THE GAS PUMP RISE, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have risen more than 8 cents a gallon over the
last two weeks and motorists, who had been enjoying the cheapest
gas in a generation, are likely to see further increases in the
weeks ahead, energy experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The price hike of 8.5 cents a gallon over the last two weeks _
to a nationwide average of $1.0869 per gallon for all grades of gas
on Friday _ represented one of the steepest short-term surges since
the Gulf War in 1990, according to a Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas
stations that was released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of major oil producers, including those from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, announced two weeks
ago that they planned to cut production of crude oil by 2 million
barrels a day. OPEC is expected to ratify that decision on Tuesday,
and many experts say they believe that prices could increase
another 8 to 15 cents a gallon as the summer driving season
arrives.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, even after the recent spike, gasoline prices remain
extremely low by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went up? I didn't notice,'' Yolanda Etaeper said Monday
as she filled up her Toyota at an Exxon station in Tenafly, N.J.,
where regular gasoline cost 95.9 cents a gallon, up from 90.9 cents
last week. ``What can you do?'' she said. ``You have to buy
gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the quickness and size of the recent increase has
surprised many drivers and some industry experts, who over the last
six months had grown accustomed to prices not seen since before the
oil embargo of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst with Bear Stearns, said that
the reason that refiners have been able to put through price
increases of about 15 cents a gallon on the wholesale level during
the last two weeks is ``because of very strong demand for gasoline.
It's been up 3.5 to four percent this year. That's a huge jump.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that refiners, meanwhile, are continuing using
lower-cost crude that they bought before the current run up in
prices, which will help their profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Generally it takes several weeks to pass through the higher cost
of crude to the wholesale level and then several weeks for
retailers to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unusual,'' said Ed Rothshild, a consultant based in
Washington D.C. and long an observer of energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the profit that refiners have been making on
gasoline has been falling in recent months, so when crude oil
prices began to rise in anticipation of the cuts by the major oil
producers the oil industry saw a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not begin raising prices now rather than wait?'' was the
approach taken by the refiners, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus prices for gasoline at the wholesale level began to rise
sharply in some regions as early as mid-February even before crude
oil prices began to recover.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many station owners have been scrambling to keep up with their
sharply rising wholesale costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going up continually,'' said Denise Pristera, a
manager at the Exxon on Dean Drive in Tenafly. ``I think it will go
up to $1 for regular.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil reached a low for this year in
mid-February when the price of the benchmark West Texas
Intermediate dipped to $11.37 in trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for April delivery rose by 26 cents Monday to close at
$15.50 a barrel, the highest closing price since Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in anticipation of the decision by major oil
producers to make substantial cuts, crude oil has risen by well
over $3 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Struth, an economist for Phillips Petroleum, said that
generally there is an increase of 2.4 cents a gallon in the price
of gasoline at the retail level for every $1 rise in the price of
crude.
</P>
<P>
   The higher price of crude combined with the seasonal
introduction of gasoline with lower volatility, which costs more to
make, he said, was about in line with an 8 cent a gallon average
rise the price of gasoline at the pump, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline margins have been very low through early March and
they are just beginning to recover,'' he said. ``There is some snap
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the industry can continue to further increase prices is
still uncertain, although there are some favorable trends for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories of gasoline showed a sharp drop last week. Demand
has been unusually strong due to a seasonal upturn in driving, the
strong economy and the continuing growth in the number of sport
utility vehicles, which have lower gas mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the current sharp jump prices were still on the
average only about one cent higher than in a similar period last
year and well below the high of $1.33 a gallon of September of 1997
before prices began to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   Michael E. Lattif who is president of Gateway Industries of
Danbury Connecticut, a company that imports auto and body parts and
who keeps a fleet of six vans, said the higher prices will increase
his costs. So he watches the pump price carefully and keeps up with
the latest news from OPEC on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going up all week,'' he added as he waited for his
credit card receipt at the Tenafly Exxon station. Still, he viewed
the price, 5 cents a gallon higher than the previous week, as a
good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At another station its gone up about 9 cents gallon,'' he
said.

 &HT;    CITIZENS TELL OF NEED FOR STRONGER NURSING HOME REGULATION
 &HT;    480&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Private citizens and government officials told
Congress on Monday that stronger investigation and enforcement is
needed of nursing home problems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came at the Senate Special Committee on Aging's
second hearing to examine the quality of nursing home care that
more than 1.6 million elderly and disabled Americans receive each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we're looking at allegations of poor care that never
reach the enforcers,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman
of the committee. ``The unresponsiveness to complaints is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Bryant showed the panel a sketch of what her aunt,
Catherine Hunt, looked like with her head and neck caught in the
guard rails of a bed. An aide in Hunt's Michigan nursing home found
her unresponsive after getting caught between the mattress and the
bed's guard rail. Hunt died of asphyxia at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aunt Catherine had several unexplained injuries, was left wet
and soiled on many occasions, and suffered many other
indignities,'' Bryant said. ``I often complained about the
neglectful conditions, but it did little good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant called the government's inquiry into her complaints a
``drive-by'' investigation in which the nursing home was given a
grace period to correct the problems with the beds and was ordered
to pay a $100 fine as a result of her aunt's death.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional insert.)
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Cruz told the panel that a Maryland nursing home
transferred her critically ill grandmother, Elsie Wagner, to a
nursing home closer to her family. After her grandmother died one
week later, Wagner's physician told Cruz that she would have lived
had she been hospitalized immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After writing a letter to the state Licensing and Certification
Administration for nursing homes and the attorney general's office,
Cruz said, the administration informed her they were very busy with
complaints, but assured her an investigation would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they deal with the live residents before they
deal with the dead ones,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional insert.)
</P>
<P>
   A congressional study released at the hearing showed that in
certain states, inadequate practices and limited guidance from the
federal Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) led to
undesirable policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
   These included a limited number of complaints being filed, a
failure to investigate serious complaints that alleged harmful
situations, and incomplete reports on nursing homes' compliance
with HCFA regulations and complaint investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that too often there is a yo-yo pattern where homes
cycle in and out of compliance,'' said William J. Scanlon of the
General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier GAO report found that more than one-fourth of the
17,000 nursing homes studied nationwide had serious deficiencies,
including inadequate prevention of pressure sores, failure to
prevent accidents, and failure to assess residents' needs and
provide appropriate care. While many of the homes corrected these
deficiencies, about 40 percent of the homes were found to be repeat
violators, Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   In its new report, the GAO recommended that HCFA strengthen both
its standards and oversight of states' complaint practices. Other
recommendations were to improve the HCFA management information
systems to include complaint investigation results and to more
effectively identify and respond to homes with recurring problems.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also at Monday's hearing, George F. Grob, deputy inspector
general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said
that studies of various aspects of the quality of nursing home care
in 10 states also showed that problems with the quality of care
still exist. The states were Florida, Texas, Ohio, New York,
California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the problems I have been talking about suggest that
inadequate levels of nursing home staff contribute to this poor
quality of care,'' Grob said.
</P>
<P>
   The studies also found problems with survey and certification
processes in several states, law enforcement of complaints and
family involvement in caring for elder loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA declined to send a representative to testify at the hearing
after the committee refused to allow the agency to testify prior to
the testimony of the private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of (the citizens') testimony ... is that they lived
and suffered through the response process that HCFA oversees,''
Grassley said. ``It's the testimony of citizen witnesses like these
that Congress, HCFA, and the public can learn from.''

ROMANCE AND FOLK TALES IN A TROUPE FROM TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unlike modern dance, ballet has apparently not
thrived in Taiwan, where its popularity and training have waxed and
waned. Capital Ballet-Tapei, a small 10-year-old troupe that
performed at the Taipei Theater in Manhattan on Sunday afternoon,
suggests a promising path taken, with work still to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The program's four works were choreographed by Hsu Chin-feng,
the company's founder-director, and his wife Hsu Lee Shu-hui, who
is artistic director. Hsu, who has an economics degree from
National Cheng-chi University, and his wife were both dancers in
the defunct Theater Ballet-Taipei, founded in 1980 by Marsha
Wales-Brown, a Westerner who had lived in Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Capital Ballet's members, graduates of dance departments of
the National Taiwan Academy of Arts and Chinese Cultural
University, are well schooled in classical style and on this
program were not called upon to exhibit exceptional virtuosity. In
the United States their company would be classed as a regional
ballet troupe.
</P>
<P>
   It is also obviously a creative instrument for its directors,
whose choreography sometimes draws upon Taiwanese cultural images.
Perhaps coincidentally, two of Hsu's works had a protagonist
sacrifice the object of his or her love.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Portrait of Romeo,'' inspired by a book, ``Strange Tales
From Liao-chai's Studio,'' a woman (Yeh Li-chuan) prefers to
destroy the man she loves rather than see him seduced by a rival
(Wang Mei-hua). The man (Liu Chi-ya) was pictured as a dream figure
with a white mask who comes to life when the mask is removed and
who becomes inanimate again when the heroine replaces the mask on
him.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography, set to Chopin, used conventional ballet steps
with Ms. Yeh and especially Liu, dancing fluently.
</P>
<P>
   Gesture was dominant in ``Sculptor and Goddess,'' which looked
like a Chinese ``Coppelia'' when Chen Chao-yu, as an aged sculptor,
removed a drape from Ms. Yeh, a statue come to life in a doll
dance. Things took a nicely dramatic turn when she pleaded to
remain human but was ``turned'' into a temple sculpture after being
imbued by a divine force. Chao Pei-chun was her fellow but immobile
goddess. The music was by Chu Yun-sung.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these two pungent pieces, the others needed editing and
suffered from repeated false endings. Nonetheless, Chen Ling-wen,
Ms. Chao, Shih Ya-ling, Lee Shen-chi and the especially promising
Lu Hsin-yi had the right neo-Romantic style in ``Chopin Pas de
Cinque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amis Images,'' by Ms. Hsu Lee, would look better if shorter:
But the company, which also includes Chen Yu-mei and Su Shih-chien,
plunged with energy into this mixture of ballet and folk dance,
drawn from Taiwan's Amis aboriginal people.

NATO THREATENS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST SERBS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO allies stepped up their threats
Monday, giving their top civilian leader the authority to mount
airstrikes directly against Serbian forces who are attacking ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo province. The expanded authority is
subject to consultation with Western leaders.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana already had the authority
to send an initial barrage of pilotless cruise missiles against
selected Serbian military targets, followed by a systematic
campaign to destroy Serbian anti-aircraft missile-launching sites
and other air-defense installations.
</P>
<P>
   But the threat hanging over President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia since the end of January has clearly not been enough to
make him to call off attacks against the ethnic Albanian majority
in Kosovo and accept a peace accord that would provide autonomy for
the province and 28,000 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian representatives in the Paris talks signed the
agreement on Thursday. The talks broke down the next day.
</P>
<P>
   While Western leaders have been agonizing over their decision,
Milosevic has had four full days to send thousands of heavily armed
troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials said Monday that intelligence reports showed
3,000 to 5,000 Serb troops with tanks and other armored vehicles
were moving toward Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, from
Montenegro, which along with Serbia, constitutes what remains of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said a similar force was moving south toward the
province from Serbia to reinforce the 40,000 Yugoslav army troops
and Interior Ministry police officers who began an offensive
against the base areas of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army after
the Paris talks had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a more effective deterrent to the Serbian attacks,
the Clinton administration had sought to broaden Solana's
authority. With no sign of a pause in the offensive, the allies
agreed to let Solana broaden air operations, subject to
consultations with allied leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance officials here said Solana could approve intense
strikes by more than 400 American, British and French warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Milosevic agreed to limits on troops and police
officers in talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. That agreement
has long since been abrogated.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration sought the sharper threat to give
Holbrooke and other mediators leverage in ``last-chance''
negotiations with Milosevic on Monday in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to Belgrade under instructions from the secretary
of state and the president to talk, but not to talk while the
fighting gets worse and the rampage continues,'' Holbrooke said
after having conferred here with Solana and the allies' top
military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the moment of truth,'' Solana said. ``Mr.
Holbrooke has everything he needs from NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he had also received full backing from Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine of France and British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook, co-chairmen of the Paris talks, in a breakfast meeting
with them and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   If Holbrooke succeeds, the threats will have been enough and the
allies will not be forced to break with Russia, which along with
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States, has been
trying to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he had 400 aircraft and dozens of ships armed with
cruise missiles ready to strike. ``The crews are ready, the
equipment is ready,'' he said. ``We know what the Serb capabilities
are. We know what the Serb vulnerabilities are. If required, we
will strike in swift and severe fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   His military headquarters at Mons in southern Belgium and the
sprawling NATO headquarters on the eastern outskirts of Brussels
were gearing up for sustained combat operations, officials said.
They are planning daily meetings of the 19 ambassadors here and
news briefings by allied commanders on airstrikes, if they are
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles would be launched, officials said, from allied
naval vessels in the Adriatic and from eight-engine American B-52
bombers that would fly from Britain. Serbian air defenses include
hundreds of surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns
scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials acknowledged that bombing units scattered
around the province might cause civilian casualties too, but said
pilots would do their best to minimize the effects. ``Any use of
force carries risks,'' one diplomat said. ``But there are civilian
casualties every day now in Kosovo without any NATO bombing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without ``spotters'' on the ground to guide planes to moving
targets like troop concentrations and heavy M-84 tanks, accuracy
would diminish, military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But American and allied strategists said the airstrikes would
considerably weaken Serbian forces. ``We hope at the least that
bombing would make Milosevic more likely to accept negotiations
later, if not right away,'' a senior diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies make little secret of their hope that Milosevic
will realize that after all the months of threats and blustering,
this time the allies mean business and that he will stop the
attacks and accept an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   All the allies, without exception, according to officials here,
are loath to order the 12,000 American, British, French and German
peacekeepers gathered in Macedonia to fight their way into Kosovo
to force the Serbs to accept peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not thinking of any forced entry into Kosovo,'' an
allied official said, ``and no NATO ally is asking for that.''

   POLJANCE, Yugoslavia _ The general commander of the Kosovo
Liberation Army called for NATO to launch airstrikes on Serbia to
put an end to the bloodshed, as Yugoslav army and police forces
continued their ransacking and burning of villages Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special police units were setting houses and farm buildings
ablaze here Monday afternoon, leaving a trail of dead cows and
downed wire fences, before pulling back to their base in Srbica. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no terrorists here,'' said the officer, referring to
the ethnic Albanian rebels. ``It is all calm,'' he said as he led
out a column of 20 armored vehicles and police jeeps packed with
armed men. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost every second house in this sprawling village was on fire.
Flames leapt from the windows of houses beside the main road, while
others were already gutted shells, still smoldering, their
blackened rafters collapsed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon police forces in camouflage and carrying
automatic weapons, spare magazines strapped across their chests,
walked wearily up the road and gathered at the top of the village.
They climbed into jeeps, the day's work apparently over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two dark blue armored troop carriers and a vehicle mounted with
an anti-aircraft gun accompanied the column out of the burning
village. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police riding on top waved their guns, and raised a Serbian
three-finger salute as they passed. Further down the road two
stragglers walked away from a burning house and fired a burst of
gunfire into the air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the operation was going on, the top commander of the KLA,
Suleyman Selimi, accused the Serbian military of using heavier
weaponry against his people than ever before, and called on the
international community to act to stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using more modern weapons. The kind of tanks are more
sophisticated and they are using new mortars, 120-200 mm, as well
as ground-to-ground missiles,'' Selimi said of the Serbian military
Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the KLA had signed the peace agreement because they
trusted the West and he thought NATO airstrikes on Serbian military
hardware would stop the violence. ``I think if they want to stop
the violence, they should do that,'' he said of the NATO threat of
strikes. ``If we did not trust them we would not have signed the
peace deal.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a two-story house high in the Drenica region, some 30
kilometers northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, Selimi,
who is known among fighters and villagers by his nom de guerre,
Sultan, has a view of villages for miles around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, missiles fired from a multiple rocket
launcher were audible, as was the whoosh and detonation a few
seconds later on impact. Smoke rose from Poljance and the
surrounding area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi said Serbian forces had fired powerful ground-to-ground
missiles from positions near Istok, 40 kilometers away near the
provincial border with Montenegro on Sunday. Three hit the village
of Likovac, where the KLA headquarters are based, but landed
harmlessly in a field, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A foreign doctor from Medecins du Monde running a mobile clinic
in a nearby village confirmed that mortars were hitting civilian
areas, saying he had treated two civilians wounded by mortar fire
on Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fighting of recent weeks has been some of the heaviest since
last summer. Selimi said he had lost 47 men in the last three weeks
of fighting. But he said the KLA had inflicted casualties on the
Serbian forces as well.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi, who is more than 6 feet tall and a former soccer player,
cuts an athletic figure. He wears combat fatigues and a short
military haircut. Soft-spoken, even shy, he said he studied metal
engineering in college and became one of the founding members of
the KLA in the early 1990s when he was a student. He is only 28 but
commands obvious respect from fighters and civilians alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said his forces had knocked out three Serbian tanks in a
battle for the village of Prekaz on Saturday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said his strategy was to try to defend villages as long as
possible as a conventional army would, to delay the Serbian
advance. But he acknowledged that his fighters were in no position
to compete with Serbian forces, with their heavy guns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the most important thing is not to lose any men,''
he said.  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He accused the Serbs of carrying out a scorched-earth policy,
trying to clear the area of civilians and soldiers, and then
sending in infantry to raze villages, burn crops and kill
livestock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Their aims are ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and
the destruction of the KLA,'' he said. ``By this they aim to keep
Kosovo under their control.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports of killings of ethnic Albanians
in Srbica over the weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi said he had heard that six people were killed by Serbian
police in Srbica, but he said he had only personally interviewed
one woman. She told him that her husband had been shot in front of
her and her children, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A teacher, Sabit Veliki, whose family lives in Pristina, was
killed in Srbica Saturday, according to the chief editor of the
Albanian language daily, Koha Ditore. The editor, Baton Haxhiu,
said he interviewed a man who was arrested with the teacher and
later released.
</P>
<P>
   The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedom in
Pristina has collected a list of 15 men reported arrested and
missing by their relatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without intervention from the West, the Serbian offensive would
escalate and sweep not just the Drenica region but the whole
province, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he maintained it could not defeat the KLA. ``We will be here
no matter how they react,'' Haxhiu said. ``We will hang on as long
as we can. Kosovo never belonged to the Serbs, the Albanians will
be here always.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence exploded in Pristina late Monday night when two attacks
occurred on an ethnic Albanian cafe and a restaurant. One person
was reported killed and several wounded. A heavy police presence
scared people off the streets amid reports of beatings and
harassment of civilians.

HOLLYWOOD STARS OUT-`RADICAL' EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to tell, reading the Hollywood issue of the Nation,
whether the six ``politically active members of the entertainment
community'' _  &UR; Warren Beatty &LR; ,  &UR; Alec Baldwin &LR; ,  &UR; Danny Glover &LR; ,
 &UR; Tim &LR; 
 &UR; Robbins &LR; ,  &UR; Oliver Stone  &LR; and &UR; Norman Lear  &LR; _ were together in one
room at one time for their ``conversation'' on ``Movies, Money &AMP;
Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   They agree on most things, among them disillusionment with
 &UR; President Clinton &LR; , disgust over the impeachment proceedings, the
notion of a right-wing conspiracy out to get the president and, in
general, a fondness for a liberal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But while Baldwin, for example, threw a well-publicized
fund-raising party for Clinton in the Hamptons last summer, Glover,
without mentioning that event specifically, took exception to the
process. ``Campaigning and raising money, the whole thing with
Clinton or  &UR; Gore  &LR; and those guys,'' he said, ``I refuse to do it.
Those guys who want to sleep in the Oval Office, sleep in the
mansion, it's about access.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, in the nicest terms, of course, Baldwin tries to
demonstrate that HE'S more radical than Glover. ``I think political
activism has negatively impacted my career,'' he said. ``I wish I
had been more like Danny Glover, aggressively steering my career
more toward a box-office franchise kind of career, doing the
`Lethal Weapons,' and having those successes over and over and over
again. And you say to yourself, that's a guy that's generated
enough economic good will in the community to be able to do some of
the other things he wants to do.''

<P>
   &UR; REMEMBERING JOE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A memorial for  &UR; Joe DiMaggio  &LR; is being ``quietly planned'' in
New York, says the New York Post, to be held next month at St.
Patrick's Cathedral. So far,  &UR; Henry Kissinger &LR; , for some reason or
other, is said to be the first choice to deliver the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other celebrities who have expressed interest in
participating:  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; ,  &UR; Woody Allen &LR; ,  &UR; Kevin Costner &LR; ,
 &UR; Michael Bolton &LR;  and &UR; Tom Hanks &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   P.S. New York Mets catcher  &UR; Mike Piazza &LR; , seen watching C-SPAN
at spring training, told a Newsday reporter that he's a
conservative and might run for office someday. ``I think I could
get into it,'' he said. ``Some of it is fascinating. I like the
range of opinions and ideologies in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.  &UR; Mike Oxley &LR; , R-Ohio, who coaches the GOP team for the
annual Congressional Softball Game, told Roll Call he'd be happy to
have Piazza join his team. He said Piazza might be a little
disappointed with a congressional salary, $136,700 a year, but ``we
do provide Egg McMuffins and black coffee at practices and hot dogs
at the picnic. So we're not totally without resources.''

   &UR; GLOBAL FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ In response to last week's item about British complaints that
American moviemakers are taking credit for the British achievement
of cracking Hitler's encryption code,  &UR; Jon Ahlberg &LR;  points an
accusing finger at the 1952 British film ``Breaking the Sound
Barrier,'' in which a British flier _ not &UR; Chuck Yeager &LR;  _ was
pictured as first to break the sound barrier. And several irate
readers, among them  &UR; Stan Deresinski &LR; , noted that the person who
cracked Hitler's encryption codes was neither British nor American
but a Pole,  &UR; Marian Rejewski &LR; . And regarding nude ski vacations
mentioned herein,  &UR; Clark Peterson  &LR; recommends ``It's a Small World
After All'' as appropriate music.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Gar Smith  &LR; noticed an Associated Press report last week that
identified the chief counselor to the prime minister of Hungary:
 &UR; Laszlo Toth &LR; .  &UR; Lazlo Toth  &LR; is also the letter-writing alter ego of
 &UR; Don Novello &LR; ; &UR; Lazlo Toth  &LR; was also the name of the Australian who
attacked the ``Pieta'' with a hammer in 1972. Novello says it's a
very common name.
</P>
<P>
   _ England's  &UR; Queen Mother &LR; , 98, is $6.5 million in debt, says
the Sunday Express, because of a high-rolling lifestyle that
includes expensive champagne, jewelry and clothing. Buckingham
Palace says the newspaper's report that she may have to move out of
Clarence House to pay off her debts is ``speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   _ German Chancellor  &UR; Gerhard Schroeder &LR;  is to appear as a
fashion model in a spring-summer Brioni catalog.

HOLLYWOOD STARS OUT-`RADICAL' EACH OTHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to tell, reading the Hollywood issue of the Nation,
whether the six ``politically active members of the entertainment
community'' _  &UR; Warren Beatty &LR; ,  &UR; Alec Baldwin &LR; ,  &UR; Danny Glover &LR; ,
 &UR; Tim &LR; 
 &UR; Robbins &LR; ,  &UR; Oliver Stone  &LR; and &UR; Norman Lear  &LR; _ were together in one
room at one time for their ``conversation'' on ``Movies, Money &AMP;
Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   They agree on most things, among them disillusionment with
 &UR; President Clinton &LR; , disgust over the impeachment proceedings, the
notion of a right-wing conspiracy out to get the president and, in
general, a fondness for a liberal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But while Baldwin, for example, threw a well-publicized
fund-raising party for Clinton in the Hamptons last summer, Glover,
without mentioning that event specifically, took exception to the
process. ``Campaigning and raising money, the whole thing with
Clinton or  &UR; Gore  &LR; and those guys,'' he said, ``I refuse to do it.
Those guys who want to sleep in the Oval Office, sleep in the
mansion, it's about access.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on, in the nicest terms, of course, Baldwin tries to
demonstrate that HE'S more radical than Glover. ``I think political
activism has negatively impacted my career,'' he said. ``I wish I
had been more like Danny Glover, aggressively steering my career
more toward a box-office franchise kind of career, doing the
`Lethal Weapons,' and having those successes over and over and over
again. And you say to yourself, that's a guy that's generated
enough economic good will in the community to be able to do some of
the other things he wants to do.''

   A memorial for  &UR; Joe DiMaggio  &LR; is being ``quietly planned'' in
New York, says the New York Post, to be held next month at St.
Patrick's Cathedral. So far,  &UR; Henry Kissinger &LR; , for some reason or
other, is said to be the first choice to deliver the eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other celebrities who have expressed interest in
participating:  &UR; Jack Nicholson &LR; ,  &UR; Woody Allen &LR; ,  &UR; Kevin Costner &LR; ,
 &UR; Michael Bolton &LR;  and &UR; Tom Hanks &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   P.S. New York Mets catcher  &UR; Mike Piazza &LR; , seen watching C-SPAN
at spring training, told a Newsday reporter that he's a
conservative and might run for office someday. ``I think I could
get into it,'' he said. ``Some of it is fascinating. I like the
range of opinions and ideologies in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep.  &UR; Mike Oxley &LR; , R-Ohio, who coaches the GOP team for the
annual Congressional Softball Game, told Roll Call he'd be happy to
have Piazza join his team. He said Piazza might be a little
disappointed with a congressional salary, $136,700 a year, but ``we
do provide Egg McMuffins and black coffee at practices and hot dogs
at the picnic. So we're not totally without resources.''

Barrier,'' in which a British flier _ not &UR; Chuck Yeager &LR;  _ was
pictured as first to break the sound barrier. And several irate
readers, among them  &UR; Stan Deresinski &LR; , noted that the person who
cracked Hitler's encryption codes was neither British nor American
but a Pole,  &UR; Marian Rejewski &LR; . And regarding nude ski vacations

   POLJANCE, Yugoslavia _ The general commander of the Kosovo
Liberation Army called for NATO to launch airstrikes on Serbia to
put an end to the bloodshed, as Yugoslav army and police forces
continued their ransacking and burning of villages Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special police units were setting houses and farm buildings
ablaze here Monday afternoon, leaving a trail of dead cows and
downed wire fences, before pulling back to their base in Srbica. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no terrorists here,'' said the officer, referring to
the ethnic Albanian rebels. ``It is all calm,'' he said as he led
out a column of 20 armored vehicles and police jeeps packed with
armed men. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost every second house in this sprawling village was on fire.
Flames leapt from the windows of houses beside the main road, while
others were already gutted shells, still smoldering, their
blackened rafters collapsed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon police forces in camouflage and carrying
automatic weapons, spare magazines strapped across their chests,
walked wearily up the road and gathered at the top of the village.
They climbed into jeeps, the day's work apparently over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two dark blue armored troop carriers and a vehicle mounted with
an anti-aircraft gun accompanied the column out of the burning
village. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police riding on top waved their guns, and raised a Serbian
three-finger salute as they passed. Further down the road two
stragglers walked away from a burning house and fired a burst of
gunfire into the air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the operation was going on, the top commander of the KLA,
Suleyman Selimi, accused the Serbian military of using heavier
weaponry against his people than ever before, and called on the
international community to act to stop the bloodshed in Kosovo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using more modern weapons. The kind of tanks are more
sophisticated and they are using new mortars, 120-200 mm, as well
as ground-to-ground missiles,'' Selimi said of the Serbian military
Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said the KLA had signed the peace agreement because they
trusted the West and he thought NATO airstrikes on Serbian military
hardware would stop the violence. ``I think if they want to stop
the violence, they should do that,'' he said of the NATO threat of
strikes. ``If we did not trust them we would not have signed the
peace deal.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a two-story house high in the Drenica region, some 30
kilometers northwest of the provincial capital Pristina, Selimi,
who is known among fighters and villagers by his nom de guerre,
Sultan, has a view of villages for miles around. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, missiles fired from a multiple rocket
launcher were audible, as was the whoosh and detonation a few
seconds later on impact. Smoke rose from Poljance and the
surrounding area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi said Serbian forces had fired powerful ground-to-ground
missiles from positions near Istok, 40 kilometers away near the
provincial border with Montenegro on Sunday. Three hit the village
of Likovac, where the KLA headquarters are based, but landed
harmlessly in a field, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A foreign doctor from Medecins du Monde running a mobile clinic
in a nearby village confirmed that mortars were hitting civilian
areas, saying he had treated two civilians wounded by mortar fire
on Sunday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fighting of recent weeks has been some of the heaviest since
last summer. Selimi said he had lost 47 men in the last three weeks
of fighting. But he said the KLA had inflicted casualties on the
Serbian forces as well.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi, who is more than 6 feet tall and a former soccer player,
cuts an athletic figure. He wears combat fatigues and a short
military haircut. Soft-spoken, even shy, he said he studied metal
engineering in college and became one of the founding members of
the KLA in the early 1990s when he was a student. He is only 28 but
commands obvious respect from fighters and civilians alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said his forces had knocked out three Serbian tanks in a
battle for the village of Prekaz on Saturday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said his strategy was to try to defend villages as long as
possible as a conventional army would, to delay the Serbian
advance. But he acknowledged that his fighters were in no position
to compete with Serbian forces, with their heavy guns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the most important thing is not to lose any men,''
he said.  &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He accused the Serbs of carrying out a scorched-earth policy,
trying to clear the area of civilians and soldiers, and then
sending in infantry to raze villages, burn crops and kill
livestock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Their aims are ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and
the destruction of the KLA,'' he said. ``By this they aim to keep
Kosovo under their control.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports of killings of ethnic Albanians
in Srbica over the weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Selimi said he had heard that six people were killed by Serbian
police in Srbica, but he said he had only personally interviewed
one woman. She told him that her husband had been shot in front of
her and her children, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A teacher, Sabit Veliki, whose family lives in Pristina, was
killed in Srbica Saturday, according to the chief editor of the
Albanian language daily, Koha Ditore. The editor, Baton Haxhiu,
said he interviewed a man who was arrested with the teacher and
later released.
</P>
<P>
   The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedom in
Pristina has collected a list of 15 men reported arrested and
missing by their relatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without intervention from the West, the Serbian offensive would
escalate and sweep not just the Drenica region but the whole
province, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he maintained it could not defeat the KLA. ``We will be here
no matter how they react,'' Haxhiu said. ``We will hang on as long
as we can. Kosovo never belonged to the Serbs, the Albanians will
be here always.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Violence exploded in Pristina late Monday night when two attacks
occurred on an ethnic Albanian cafe and a restaurant. One person
was reported killed and several wounded. A heavy police presence
scared people off the streets amid reports of beatings and
harassment of civilians.

 &HT;    Physics in '99: New tool may detect earlier signs of cancer
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new laser system will give doctors another tool for
peering into the human body to detect very early signs of cancer
without having to remove tissue for diagnostic tests, researchers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In tests on patients with a precancerous condition that can lead
to colon cancer, the laser-induced ``fluorescence spectroscopy''
system performed just as well as _ or better than _ biopsies and
other conventional detection methods, said physicist Mary-Ann Mycek
of Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the laser-based technique does not require the removal
of tissue, it represents a tremendous advance over the current
practice of tissue biopsy,'' said Mycek, who presented her findings
at the American Physical Society's 100th anniversary meeting in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a biopsy, a doctor removes a portion of diseased tissue and
sends it to a laboratory to determine if it is malignant,
precancerous or benign.
</P>
<P>
   Very early detection and treatment of diseased tissue can
prevent the development of cancer. Mycek said that when the laser
system can detect subtle, microscopic chemical and structural
changes in the tissue that may be symptoms of early precancerous
conditions. The technique could be widely available within a few
years, Mycek added.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports Monday at the physicists' meeting:
</P>
<P>
   _ Philip Wyatt of Santa Barbara, Calif., said he has developed a
fist-size device similar to a smoke alarm that would give an early
warning of a biological warfare attack. The physicist said the
device uses a laser to quickly detect anthrax spores or other
dangerous microbes that may be released by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   _ A theory by University of Pittsburgh physicist Ernest
Sternglass says the universe will continue to expand until it
reaches a maximum size 200 times its present radius and will
neither fly apart into dead ashes, as predicted by some, nor
collapse into a fiery point. ``It will allow life to continue
forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The next generation of computers, electronic optical
instruments and photovoltaic cells may not be based on spinach _
not silicon _ say researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in Tennessee. The scientists have developed a way to manipulate
spinach leaf proteins so that they absorb energy from the sun and
power electronic devices.

he was referencing ``Will'' as in William Avery, the Blue Devils'
brilliant young point guard.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Avery held only part of this job. Things have
changed. Now, with the Madness of March finally reduced to the
white-hot spotlight of the Final Four, the sophomore will be asked
to close the deal, running the show in St. Petersburg, Fla., for a
team that is not supposed to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure? What pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Will has done the job for us all year,'' said Langdon, voted
the outstanding player of the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Avery will be asked to do it again. Nor will he lack
high-profile backcourt company as college basketball's elite
convene at Tropicana Field for what shapes up as a pointed weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, Duke's semifinal opponent, is led by its own
point man, junior Mateen Cleaves. Connecticut brings Khalid
El-Amin, the little fat kid who usually comes up big when it
matters most. Ohio State, in turn, shows up with Scoonie Penn, the
transfer from Boston College who was named the outstanding player
in the South Regional and may be playing the best of any of them
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Four for Florida, with much at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever one turns out to be the best little big man on college
basketball's biggest stage may have much to say about whose team
will be cutting down the nets come Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, William Avery felt the heat. It was one thing
splitting this job with Steve Wojciechowski a year ago, since the
pressure was mostly on the senior.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wojo was gone, and a sophomore was left with the task of
making a promising season special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like challenges,'' he said. ``I wanted to prove to everybody
that I could do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery responded, being named Most Valuable Player of the Great
Alaska Shootout early on and rolling into the East Regional
averaging 15.1 points and nearly six assists per game. He wasn't
quite as spectacular in New Jersey but still managed 13 points and
four assists in the East final against Temple's aggressive matchup
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Others scored more, grabbed more rebounds and shot better from
the field. Carrawell even topped the team in assists with seven.
Avery ended up bleeding from a cut on the leg and needing a moment
or two to recover from being poked in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' he said later. ``I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work, and Langdon was quick to acknowledge the
source of many of his 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``William did a great job of getting me the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Will led. It might not have jumped out from the box
score, but folks who know him best appreciated the effort.
</P>
<P>
   For Mateen Cleaves, the road to St. Petersburg has been bumpy,
to say the least. Early in the season, he struggled with his
shooting, and his team followed suit as its leader tried to find
his way.
</P>
<P>
   In the NCAA Tournament, Cleaves has been up-and-down but good
enough to get the job done. Against Oklahoma in the Midwest
Regional semifinal, he missed his first eight shots. Against
Kentucky, however, he finished with 10 points and 11 assists as the
Spartans rallied from an early 13-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a melting pot on our team,'' said MSU coach Tom
Izzo. ``But for some reason, they all gravitate to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cleaves goes, so goes Michigan State. So far, he has gone
well enough to lead the way to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   He hears the fat jokes wherever he goes. At Stanford, the crowd
was particularly merciless, chanting suggestions that UConn's point
guard was not only a bit on the chunky side but a deadbeat dad,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't very classy,'' said Khalid El-Amin, a father of
two.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin responded more pointedly. With backcourt mate Richard
Hamilton out with an injury, the object of ridicule led the way
with 23 points, five assists and five steals as the Huskies picked
up a big late-season road win.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton gets more recognition, but El-Amin, a sophomore, gets
the point. His next charge is to get some points after a dreadful
West Regional final against Gonzaga, a game in which he got into
early foul trouble and missed all 12 of his shots but still managed
to make some clutch free throws in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Of the foursome, Scoonie Penn is the most unlikely entry, coming
from a team that bucked the odds to advance as a No. 4 seed,
upsetting Auburn and St. John's to emerge from the South.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, he might be the hottest commodity of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Penn is averaging 17.5 points in the Tournament. Against St.
John's in the regional final, he chipped in eight rebounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been more instrumental in Ohio State's turnaround
from 8-22 last year to its first Final Four trip in 31 years. And
none of it comes as a particular shock to Penn, who predicted an
NCAA berth this season before many others considered it a
reasonable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought we could do it,'' he said. ``But
here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, his matchup with El-Amin could go a long way toward
determining who will play for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a tremendous backcourt,'' Penn said of the
Huskies. ``When I watch UConn on TV, I usually root for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun to play against those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   When you get this far, it's supposed to be. As the likes of
Avery, Cleaves, El-Amin and Penn understand, having fun is part of
the point.

FOGGY BOTTOM OPENS A CRATERING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 28)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets. The word AT in parentheses should be
replaced by the ``at'' symbol.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent a message to Serbian
strongman Slobodan Milosevic via Charles Gibson on ABC's
revitalized ``Good Morning America'': ``Whichever side  &UR; cratered &LR; 
the talks would be held responsible.'' The use of that verb was
surely planned and tested: The same night, the Queen of Foggy
Bottom repeated that high-impact figure of speech on Jim Lehrer's
``News Hour'' on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, we in the language dodge have been watching the
new verb, to  &UR; crater &LR; , undergo what we like to call ``sense
deterioration'' (much as  &UR; cunning &LR; , which originally meant
``knowledgeable,'' slipped in sense to ``slyly clever'').
</P>
<P>
   At first, the verb  &UR; crater &LR;  (originally a noun from the Latin
word for ``bowl,'' from the Greek ``to mix'') was intransitive,
meaning ``to form a hollow.'' In World War I, it learned how to
transmit action to an object, as ``scores of mine explosions had
 &UR; cratered &LR;  it.'' In World War II, Cecil Day Lewis gave the
terrifying term a poetic twist: ``Yet words there must be, wept on
the  &UR; cratered &LR;  present.''
</P>
<P>
   The verb, still associated with the pits and pockmarks left by
bombs, then gained its metaphoric extension. Following the Persian
Gulf war, during the 1992 presidential campaign, President George
Bush used the word to describe Saddam Hussein's grudging compliance
with U.N. inspection requirements: ``I'm glad that he  &UR; cratered &LR; 
once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it means ``collapse.'' In today's diplolingo, talks
 &UR; crater &LR; . In baseballese, pennant hopes  &UR; crater &LR; . In mutual fund
management jargon, ``sales lately have  &UR; cratered &LR; .'' With constant
use, the disastrous sense of a huge meteor slamming into Earth has
deteriorated; its slang sense shows signs of fading from
``collapse'' to merely ``abandon'' or ``cast aside,'' as in, ``We
 &UR; cratered &LR;  the project.'' I await the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
``The  &UR; Craterer &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Like Judge Joseph Force Crater, who disappeared into a New York
City taxicab in 1930 and was never seen or heard of again, the
monosyllabic verb that this vogue usage has replaced _ the simple
but powerful  &UR; fail &LR;  _ has been all but lost to the public lingo of
movers and shakers. And to think how powerfully moving that little
verb once was. Words  &UR; crater &LR;  me.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, whatever became of the famous search for
the vanished jurist? According to a Detective Burns at the New York
Police Department, ``There has never been an arrest made on the
case, so it is not closed.'' For those still on the lookout, he's a
little, dignified guy with glasses, and he would now be 109 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   SCOT-FREE MUMBO JUMBO, TSK-TSK
</P>
<P>
   For a generation after the Civil War, the national bloodletting
was euphemized in the self-mocking phrase ``the late
unpleasantness.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant historians have not yet come up with the phrase to
describe the Clinton impeachment process, or the Monica Madness, or
the Clinton  &UR; Kulturkampf &LR;  (and entries will be accepted at
onlanguage(AT)nytimes.com), but during this yet-to-be-labeled
 &UR; annus incredibilis &LR; , a couple of great old phrases that deserve
examination were heaved around by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense Challenges Impeachment `Mumbo Jumbo,''' said a New
York Times headline over one of R.W. Apple's memorable articles,
which led with ``A White House lawyer ((Gregory Craig)) accused
House prosecutors today of resorting to `word games' and `legal
mumbo jumbo.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mandingo peoples of the western Sudan were reported around
1740 to have a high priest who protected the villagers called the
 &UR; Mumbo Jumbo &LR; , an Englishing of  &UR; mam-gyo-mbo &LR; , supposedly
``magician who drives away troubled spirits of ancestors.'' Other
accounts describe the  &UR; Mumbo Jumbo &LR;  as a grotesque idol used to
scare women into subjection.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the reduplicated sound was similar to the
English  &UR; mumble jumble &LR; , the sense deteriorated from ``frightened
veneration'' to ``meaningless babble; gibberish'' and further to
``jargon designed to confuse.'' It is now an attack phrase often
used by lawyers against lawyers, with the racial or sex-subjugating
overtones long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Those who grumbled about the acquittal of the president used a
phrase with an accusatory overtone,  &UR; scot-free &LR; . ``I assumed this
had to do with my own Scotch ancestry,'' writes a
Scottish-American, Duncan Steck, of New York, ``but lo, it comes
from Old Norse, meaning both a shot and a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. It has nothing to do with the slur on the proverbial
tightness of the Scots, or with their freedom. The  &UR; scot &LR; ,
sometimes spelled  &UR; shot &LR; , was a tax or required payment. It was
also a bar tab marked, or scored, on wood (the root of ``a  &UR; shot &LR; 
of booze''). ``Though I could scape  &UR; shot-free &LR;  at London,'' says
Shakespeare's Falstaff in ``Henry IV,'' ``I fear the  &UR; shot &LR;  heere:
here's no scoring, but upon the pate.'' That meant he feared
getting hit in the head in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Whether  &UR; shot-free &LR; , meaning free from either a tax or another
kind of  &UR; shot &LR; , or  &UR; scot-free &LR; , the terms came to mean
``unpunished'' with a connotation of unfair escape from
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton greeted the pope in St. Louis, Alessandra
Stanley reported in The New York Times that ``many people
throughout the world had been  &UR; tut-tutting &LR;  about the uneasy
juxtaposition.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tut &LR; , an interjection of disapproval or dismissal used by Ben
Jonson in ``Volpone'' and in reduplicated form as  &UR; tut, tut &LR;  by
Shakespeare in ``Richard II,'' is both a word in itself and an
attempt to spell an unspellable sound.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is a palatal click often represented by ``tsk, tsk,''
although that attempt at imitating the sound in print often results
in the mispronunciation ``tisk, tisk.'' Place the tongue on the
palate with lips apart and suck quickly; that's the sound of a
 &UR; tut &LR; , or a  &UR; tsk &LR; . We call that  &UR; tut-tutting &LR;  because it's awkward
to make two palatal clicks and follow them with an  &UR; -ing &LR; . Language
has its limits.

RUSSIAN EXPERTS WEIGHING DEGREE OF SUPPORT FOR BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-RDP, KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-ASSESS, KOSOVO) 
(jw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Serbia's latest offensive in Kosovo is leading some of
Russia's top foreign policy specialists to question Moscow's
longstanding support for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   With Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov set to leave on Tuesday for
Washington, Russia's top priority is to wrest billions of dollars
from the International Monetary Fund, not argue over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Given the economic stakes for Moscow, the decision by President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to press the attack against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo is more than a matter of bad timing. An
increasing number of Russian experts say it underscores Belgrade's
indifference to the Primakov mission.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Russian government, senior officials talk quietly
about their deep frustration with Milosevic. Some leading lawmakers
are more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have invested too much into this problem,'' Vladimir Lukin,
the leader of parliament's foreign relations committee, told
Russian television on Sunday. ``We must know the limits of our
support.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that Russia would welcome a NATO bombing
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist sentiment at home further demands that the Russians
give their fellow Slavs in Yugoslavia oratorical support, even
though many ordinary people do not identify with the Serbian cause.
Russian Foreign Ministry officials, for their part, continue to
argue that NATO airstrikes will make a bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Russia hoped to negotiate an accord that would obviate the need
for NATO action. Primakov put Russia's prestige on the line by
inviting Milosevic to Moscow last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Primakov sat by Milosevic's side in an ornate Russian
Foreign Ministry mansion as the Yugoslav leader denied that Serbian
forces had ever harmed ethnic Albanians and promised to ease the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to
Belgrade, urging Milosevic to seek a political settlement, Russian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But these days Belgrade does not seem to be listening to
Moscow's counsel. The Serbs, in fact, may have timed their attacks
against the Kosovo Albanians to coincide with Primakov's mission to
Washington, calculating that NATO would be reluctant to strike when
Primakov was in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a flare-up of the fighting may sour the atmosphere
for Primakov's trip or force him to defer it does not seem to have
mattered much in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   And if Russia's influence with Milosevic has dwindled, it seems
to have reached a low point with NATO. The alliance appears to have
concluded that it must take action soon if the Serbian attacks
continue, to salvage its own credibility, regardless of what the
Russians think.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Primakov has put Russia's
authority on the line and come out on the losing end. Two years ago
he engaged in an all-night negotiating session in Geneva, which
Moscow later asserted had broken the deadlock over weapons
inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   It only took a matter of months, however, before the Iraqi
leader walked away from the compromise and the Clinton
administration began planning a retaliatory strike. These days,
Moscow rarely objects to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, apparently
calculating it can do little about it.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a breakthrough is achieved in Belgrade, Moscow stands to
be humiliated again. Even if there is progress, the credit is
likely to go to Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, who arrived in
Belgrade armed with the threat of NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Primakov repeated, almost ritualistically, Moscow's
opposition to NATO bombing. But Moscow's senior diplomat in the
region, Boris Mayorsky, said Monday night that Moscow did not have
any special plan.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov appeared determined to go to Washington anyway. When
the Echo Moscow radio station asked its listeners Monday to phone
in their opinion, 69 percent of the 1,677 callers said Primakov
should not cancel his Washington mission, even if NATO attacked
Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have overinvested in terms of our support of Milosevic,''
said Sergei Karaganov, the chairman of the Council on Foreign and
Defense Policy, a group of opinion makers with ties to the Russian
government and military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean that anybody here would support the
American policy of bombing at all costs,'' Karaganov added. ``But
support for Milosevic is largely a negative. It could jeopardize
the delicate balance in our economic dealings with the outside
world, including the United States.''

POPE PLANS VISIT TO HOLY LAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul plans to visit the Holy Land next
March to mark the start of Christianity's third millenium, Israeli
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The church's most-traveled pontiff has long expressed his desire
to mark the start of the new millennium by visiting the traditional
sites of Jesus Christ's birth in Bethlehem and his death and
resurrection in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of meetings here Monday, the details and scheduling
of the visit began to be worked out among the senior Vatican
representative, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, and Israel's tourism
minister and senior officials of the Religious Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems we will have a visit,'' said Uri Mor, the director of
Christian affairs for the Religious Affairs Ministry who was
present at the talks. ``But there are extraordinary planning and
protocol details for such a visit. Those details have not yet been
released.''
</P>
<P>
   Orly Doron, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Tourism Ministry, told
Reuters that ``the minister confirmed that he was informed that the
pope will visit Israel and the Palestinian territories in March
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Etchegaray, who is coordinating the Vatican's millennial
celebrations, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Emil Salayta, an official in the Jerusalem Latin
Patriarchate, which represents the Middle East branch of the
Catholic Church, said Monday &UR;  &LR; night that the pope's intention to
visit the Holy Land is taking shape. He said there has not been an
official announcement from the Vatican, but sources close to the
church in the United States said the Vatican had unofficially
confirmed the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Salayta, who along with other priests met with Etchegaray
Monday, said the plans center around March 25, 2000, for the Feast
of the Annunciation, which in the faith marks the announcement to
Mary by the angel Gabriel that she would conceive and give birth to
a son named Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Salayta said the visit would include stops in Bethlehem, which
is under control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority;
Nazareth, which is in Israel and is the traditional site of the
annunciation; and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year old pope's health remains a critical factor in
whether he would make the visit as currently planned.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first papal visit to the Holy Land since 1964,
when Pope Paul VI came to Jerusalem. That was three years before
Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank, which includes
Bethlehem, in the 1967 Six Day War. Shortly after that, Israel
annexed Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a trip by Pope John Paul, who leads about 1 billion
Roman Catholics worldwide, have been mired in a political quagmire
over the status of Jerusalem and the deadlock in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican and most nations, including the United States, do
not officially recognize Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel claims Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital,
and Palestinians say East Jerusalem is the future capital of a
Palestinian state. Under the 1993 Oslo peace agreement, both sides
agreed to let the status of Jerusalem be determined in ``final
status'' talks that have been put on hold as implementation of the
interim agreements faltered.
</P>
<P>
   A papal visit, Israeli officials believe, could be seen as
official recognition by the Vatican of Israeli sovereignty over
Jerusalem. But Salayta disagreed with that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have much to say for both sides, a message of
reconciliation, peace, but also justice,'' said Salayta.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the planned visit to Jerusalem to the pope's visit
last year to Cuba, where he delivered a strong message about the
injustices Christians suffer underc President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect a strong message about the injustice of
Israel,'' Salayta said. ``As well as a strong message of peace.''

JUSTICES TO WEIGH RACE BARRIER IN HAWAIIAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that mixes history, race and evolving
constitutional doctrine, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether Hawaii may continue to deny anyone who is not descended
from the original Hawaiians the right to vote for the leadership of
an agency that administers tens of millions of dollars in public
money.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, set up under the
state's constitution in 1978 to oversee trust funds, for which most
revenue comes from former royal Hawaiian lands. The office's nine
trustees, who must themselves be descendants of the native
Hawaiians, are charged with spending the money on education, social
welfare and other programs to benefit native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rice is a native Hawaiian, in the sense that he was born
in the islands to which his great-great-grandparents moved in the
19th century. But this is not what the state constitution means by
Hawaiian, a term that signifies not place of birth but race.
</P>
<P>
   When Rice, a Cornell-educated rancher and polo player from the
town of Kamuela, in a remote corner of Hawaii's big island, went to
vote three years ago in the statewide election for Office of
Hawaiian Affairs trustees, he was turned away.
</P>
<P>
   He sued the state under the 15th Amendment, one of the
amendments adopted after the Civil War to guarantee that the freed
slaves would have the right to vote. It provides: ``The right of
citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost in both the U.S. District Court in Honolulu and the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, where a panel of
three judges wrote last June that the racial voting restriction was
``rooted in historical concern for the Hawaiian race'' and
justified ``because Hawaiians are the only group with a stake in
the trust'' and in the money that the trustees administer.
</P>
<P>
   That explanation did not satisfy Rice, and the question now is
whether it will satisfy the Supreme Court. Theodore Olson, a
well-connected Washington lawyer recruited for the Supreme Court
appeal by Rice's lawyer in Kamuela, John Goemans, told the justices
that the appeals court's decision ratified ``a broad and patently
offensive regime of racially segregated voting in the state of
Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the case, Rice vs. Cayetano, No. 98-818, got the
court's attention, provoking an unusually prolonged debate among
the justices over whether to hear the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's announcement, the case had been under active
consideration at the justices' weekly, closed-door conferences
since the beginning of the year, suggesting that it was subject to
a degree of vetting far greater than the typical case at this early
stage, where the question is not how to decide a case but whether
to hear it at all. The case will be argued in October.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices perceive this case as something of a hot potato,
that is understandable. While no other state program resembles
Hawaii's, the case raises far broader questions about making race a
condition of eligibility for public benefits.
</P>
<P>
   While it is certainly possible to structure a narrow decision
specific to Hawaii, as the 9th Circuit did, it is also possible to
turn this case into a battleground of the ongoing affirmative
action wars. A series of recent Supreme Court opinions has
subjected government programs that offer special benefits on the
basis of race to the same rigorous constitutional scrutiny, no
matter which race is the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting element in the case is a 1973 Supreme Court
opinion on which the appeals court based a substantial part of its
analysis. That case, Salyer Land Co. vs. Tulare Lake District,
upheld a California law that gave land owners, and no one else, the
right to vote for the management of water storage districts.
</P>
<P>
   These were ``special purpose'' elections in which property
owners had by far the greatest stake, then-Associate Justice
William Rehnquist wrote for the majority. Three liberal justices,
William O. Douglas, William Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall,
vigorously dissented, on the ground that renters, sharecroppers and
other nonowners could be injured by mismanagement of the water
supply, and ``all should have a say.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There were also these other developments Monday as the court
returned from a two-week recess:
</P>
<P>
   Professors' Workload
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld an Ohio law that both required state
universities to set standards for the amount of time professors
should devote to classroom teaching and took the question of
professors' workload off the table as a subject for collective
bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-1 decision overturned a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court,
which held that the 1993 state law violated the professors'
constitutional right to equal protection because no other public
employees were barred from negotiating with the state over their
workload. Ohio appealed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The court's unsigned opinion Monday, from which only Justice
John Paul Stevens dissented, said the state law was a
straightforward economic regulation that was constitutional as long
as it had a rational basis. The state's goal was ``to increase the
time spent by faculty in the classroom,'' the opinion said, adding
that the law ``was an entirely rational step to accomplish this
objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens objected that the court should not have issued a
decision without full briefing and argument. The justices had never
formally granted review in the case, Central State University vs.
American Association of University Professors, No. 98-1071. Stevens
said that while he had not reached a conclusion, the court's
analysis was ``mechanistic'' and ignored the issues of academic
freedom that were present in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also added a sly observation. ``While surveying the
flood of law reviews that cross my desk,'' he said, ``I have
sometimes wondered whether law professors have any time to spend
teaching their students about the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Ohio's legislators evidently had ``a similar
reaction,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Violence Against Women
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court turned down a constitutional
challenge to a provision of a federal law, the Violence Against
Women Act, that makes it a federal crime to cross state lines for
the purpose of injuring a ``spouse or intimate partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was brought by the first woman to be convicted under
the 1994 law, a Russian immigrant who was convicted and sentenced
to life in prison for conspiring in the murder of her estranged
husband, Yakov Gluzman. Gluzman, also an immigrant from Russia, was
a successful medical researcher when his wife, Rita Gluzman, and a
cousin traveled from New Jersey to New York to kill him in his
apartment in Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gluzman's appeal, Gluzman vs. United States, No. 98-1326,
argued that Congress lacked constitutional authority to turn a
crime of domestic violence into a federal offense. The lower
federal courts had rejected that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are likely to have another chance to consider the
issue. Earlier this month, the federal appeals court in Richmond,
Va., declared another provision of the Violence Against Women Act
unconstitutional, and a Supreme Court appeal is planned in that
case, Brzonkala vs. Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor's Comment
</P>
<P>
   The court accepted an appeal by New York state from a ruling
that a Queens prosecutor violated a defendant's constitutional
rights by telling the jury that the defendant had derived a ``big
advantage'' from sitting through the testimony of witnesses at his
rape trial. The implication of the comment was that the defendant,
Ray Agard, had thus been able to tailor his own testimony to what
had gone before.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had granted Agard's
petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the comment
in effect had compromised his right to attend his own trial. In its
appeal, Portuondo vs. Agard, No. 98-1170, the state asked the
justices to resolve what it said was widespread confusion over the
propriety of prosecutors' comments on defendants' conduct or
demeanor in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sibling Adoption
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court turned down an appeal filed on behalf
of a 4-year-old foster child who was separated from his 6-year-old
sister for eventual adoption by an aunt. The children's parents had
been found unfit, and a Massachusetts court approved a request by
an aunt in New Jersey to rear him. The appeal, Hugo P. vs. George
P., No. 98-7565, argued that the custody order separating the
siblings violated the boy's constitutional right to ``family
integrity.''

DELEGATIONS CALM ON EVE OF OPEC MEETING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Sometimes an OPEC meeting is an electric
affair, filled with the high drama of ministers from some of the
world's largest oil-producing states struggling to reach an accord
that will shake world markets.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's as if their work is done.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of their spring meeting in Vienna, ministers from the
11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have an air
of accomplishment. They've come to ratify an agreement already
worked at The Hague earlier this month. They've agreed to join with
a group of non-OPEC producers to pull more than 2 million barrels a
day _ representing about 2.7 percent of world output _ off the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The oil markets Monday did nothing to dampen the mood. On
Monday, April light, sweet crude oil prices rose 26 cents to close
at $15.50 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. April
heating oil rose 1.70 cents to 42.39 cents a gallon; April unleaded
gasoline rose 1.78 cents to 49.42 cents a gallon; and April natural
gas rose 7 cents to $1.769 per thousand cubic feet. In London, May
Brent crude rose 43 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $13.88 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   C.W. Hornsby, president of Hornsby and Co., a Houston-based
energy risk management services firm, said the markets moved up
Monday because of the continued positive tone to the news out of
the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But at the meeting, there are lot of signs that this time is
different.
</P>
<P>
   Absent are the flurry of secret, bilateral meetings in hotel
rooms, and the impromptu press briefings in which OPEC delegations
try to pressure one another with public statements.
</P>
<P>
   The only kind of statements being made to the packs of reporters
prowling the lobbies and hallways of Vienna's top hotels give
repeated assurances that all disputes have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians, who often arrive days before an OPEC conference to
bicker and joust with their arch OPEC rivals from Saudi Arabia,
aren't even scheduled to arrive until Tuesday, the morning of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And instead, the shopping trips, which typically characterize
the end of OPEC meetings, are already in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a congenial feeling among the delegates because they
are all facing the dilemma of low oil prices,'' said Faleh Aljibury
of Fresno, Calif., a longtime OPEC watcher. ``They have made up
their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few loose ends is the Nigerians' insistence they have
not signed off on the pact, but that has not produced much of a
stir at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   All parties seem to agree they must make substantial cuts in
production, they must convince the markets the reductions will
stick, and they must present a united front to the world, Aljibury
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen the members so determined to make the
markets believe them,'' Aljibury said.
</P>
<P>
   Mussab Al-Dujayli, an oil expert with Iraq's State Oil Marketing
Organization, said all the OPEC members are suffering because of
low oil prices. ``Everybody needs the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some OPEC members who were grousing earlier on that OPEC
heavyweight Saudi Arabia should cut more than its
585,000-barrel-a-day pledge concede that figure represents a
sizable reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Few oil analysts believe the coalition of OPEC countries and
non-OPEC producers _ Mexico, Norway, Oman and Russia _ will
completely live up to its 2 million-barrel-a-day goal. But even if
those countries reach only half that objective, that will go far
toward slimming down bloated stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those more-modest expectations, crude prices have
rallied significantly, rising more than 10 percent since the
likelihood of an agreement became apparent.
</P>
<P>
   If the parties' compliance with the agreement nears 75 percent _
not out of the question considering their adherence to more recent
cuts, argues Hornsby &AMP; Co.'s Nizam Sharief _ oil prices, which have
wallowed in recent months at record low levels _ could reach $18 or
$20 a barrel by the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, analysts agree, deserves much of the credit for
the accord because it made two major concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The kingdom agreed to drop its production below an 8
million-barrel-a-day floor. Saudi Arabia had established the mark
after the Persian Gulf War and Iraq's banishment from the world
market for all but United Nations-limited sales for food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis also accepted a key Iranian demand that Tehran be
permitted to cut back its production from a starting point of 3.6
million barrels a day, rather than from the 3.3 million barrel
level the Saudis and several other OPEC members would have
preferred.
</P>
<P>
   While their circumstances vary widely, all the OPEC members have
faced serious problems because of low crude prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis faced the prospect of coping with a one-third drop in
government revenues. Venezuela has been forced to sell $1 billion
worth of bonds to help its state-owned oil company, Petroleos de
Venezuela, raise enough cash to pay its suppliers, while
perennially troubled Nigeria had to cut government spending to its
lowest level of the decade.

 &HT;    FEAR OF GREATER CRISIS DRIVES KOSOVO PEACE EFFORT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) international categories
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Once again, the United States and its allies stand at
the brink of a risky military mission to counter Serb atrocities in
the troubled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape this time is Kosovo, a small province of 2.2
million people. There, Serb troops backed by tanks have rampaged
through rural villages, killing often execution style an estimated
2,000 ethnic Albanians over the past year and running a quarter of
a million more from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, some 40,000 Serb troops were in and around Kosovo,
with more reported en route.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke made a last-ditch effort Monday
in Belgrade to convince Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic to accept a
peace plan, President Clinton warned that NATO is prepared to
attack Serb military positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over
peace, NATO's military plans must continue to move forward,''
Clinton said in Washington. ``Serbia's mounting aggression must be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton summoned leaders from both parties in Congress for a
White House briefing on the matter this (Tuesday) morning.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the atrocities in Kosovo lies a larger strategic fear.
Continuing fighting in that pocket of Serbia the main state in
what's left of Yugoslavia might spill over into neighboring
Macedonia, where tensions already run high among minority ethnic
Albanians and majority Slavs, or even into Albania itself.
</P>
<P>
   Instability in either of those countries, in turn, might ignite
a broader Balkan war that could, U.S. diplomats have warned,
eventually pit NATO allies Greece and Turkey against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Regional experts say the chances of such a worst-case scenario
are remote, but the implications are frightening. Balkan discord
sparked it away in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed last week by the Kosovar Albanians,
control of most of Kosovo's political, judicial, legal and
educational institutions would be transferred from the Serbs who
make up only 10 percent of the population in the province to the
ethnic Albanians. The latter account for 90 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians see such an arrangement as the first step
toward creating an independent nation of Kosovo, to be dominated by
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs fear precisely that outcome, which explains why
Milosevic is opposed to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Formally the United States is opposed to independence. Clinton
has suggested, however, that if Milosevic continues to reject the
U.S.-backed peace plan, and NATO air strikes are required to break
the Serb military stronghold on the region, all bets could well be
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their (Serbs') best chance to keep Kosovo as a part of
Serbia and as a part of Yugoslavia,'' Clinton said of the peace
plan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (story can end here)
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo has affronted the world with a
humanitarian crisis closely mirroring the terror Serbs inflicted
for 3.5 years across neighboring Bosnia. There, more than 200,000
people, most of them civilians, were killed and 15 times that
number were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   That crisis ended in the fall of 1995, only after a week and a
half of U.S.-led NATO air strikes targeting Serbs and three weeks
of strong-arm diplomacy led by Holbrooke ending in the Dayton
Accords. The result was a massive U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping force
that remains in Bosnia even now, with no prospect of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   There are other places in the world, where atrocities
perpetrated upon civilians have provoked outrage. Sierra Leone, the
Sudan and Rwanda come quickly to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo, however, strikes closer to home for
many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to see people slaughtered, we don't like to see
people chased from their homes, especially in large numbers,
especially in Europe,'' said Serwer.

PUBLIC TV ATTEMPTS TO COOL HOT ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Affirmative action continues to be among the most contentious US
domestic policy issues, not surprisingly often generating more heat
than light. Legislation like California's Proposition 209, which
since 1997 has barred consideration of race and gender in hiring
state employees or admitting students to state schools, has ended
up creating more controversy than closure.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you wean adversaries from reductive sloganeering and
reflexive responses and direct them toward more enlightening and
productive dialogue?
</P>
<P>
   With ``Beyond Black and White: Affirmative Action in America,''
public television tries to both dramatize and tame the affirmative
action debate at the same time. The worthy objective of the
program, part of the long-running Fred Friendly Seminar series, is
to present a lively version of the controversy while cooling the
rhetoric and clarifying the reasoning of proponents and opponents.
It's a tall order, but the engaging hourlong program often
succeeds. Toward the end of the generally orderly panel discussion,
airing Tuesday night, even some of the more adversarial
participants find a little patch of common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The cleverly contrived format of the series is the secret of its
success. But it's also exactly this air of artificiality
deliberately distancing the arguments from the real world that
raises some doubt about the TV seminar's practical civic value.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the selected panelists are asked to respond to a
hypothetical problem. Thus, host Charles J. Ogletree conjures a
university called Big State, in the state of Westralia, where race
is used as a factor in admissions, but where such affirmative
action is polarizing the community around an initiative sounding
suspiciously like 209. The scenario is familiarly Californian, and
among the panelists is Ward Connerly, a regent on the California
Board and a leading proponent of the real initiative. There are 13
other participants, including affirmative-action advocates Ruth J.
Simmons, president of Smith College, and Harvard law professor
Christopher Edley Jr., and opponents such as lawyer and writer Ann
Coulter.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a broad-ranging conversation touching law and history
and, of course, exposing some raw emotion. But the central point of
contention can be fairly reduced to the following. Those objecting
to affirmative action claim it promotes reverse discrimination and
perpetuates an obsession with race that inhibits creating a truly
colorblind society. Their generally principled arguments,
nonetheless, often seem dryly abstract, strong on occasional
debating points but sometimes willfully blind to contemporary
social realities.
</P>
<P>
   Those in favor of affirmative action reason that a colorblind
America is a viable but distant dream, that we're a nation still
too deeply rooted in discriminatory prejudice to abandon every
race, ethnic, and gender-based ``plus factor'' or preference
designed to remedy ongoing injustice. Over and over, they cite such
widely accepted ``plus factors'' often vital to college acceptance
as athletic prowess or the legacy of family alumni. We don't ignore
these differences, says Ann Lewis, director of communications at
the White House, so how can we ignore race?
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of nuance and detail emerges in the largely
eruption-free and often congenial exchange of ideas. But the final
words sounding a note of conciliation are tentative and not
altogether credible. ``Beyond Black and White'' is exemplary as an
exercise in civility, but its good manners sometimes prevent it
from digging deeply enough into these sensitive and important
issues.

eventually pit NATO allies Greece and Turkey against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Regional experts say the chances of such a worst-case scenario
are remote, but the implications are frightening. Balkan discord
sparked World War I, and it's been Serb ferocity over much of this
decade that's been responsible for Europe's worst bloodshed since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Given the region's propensity as a tinderbox, Clinton contends
it's better to try to put out the fire in Kosovo than to risk
seeing it spread out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced we'll be dragged into this thing under worse
circumstances, at greater cost, if we don't act,'' Clinton said
Friday. (cq)
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially what you're seeing here is the beginning of a
worse problem,'' said former U.S. diplomat Daniel Serwer, a senior
fellow for Balkan studies at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a think
tank in Washington. ``What you're setting out to do is prevent that
from getting worse,'' said Serwer, who served as special U.S. envoy
to Bosnia from 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   NATO's plans for doing that revolve around some 400 warplanes
and support aircraft half of them American based in Italy, Germany
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Initial attacks would begin with the launching of scores of
long-range cruise missiles fired from four U.S. ships and two
submarines in the Mediterranean and Adriatic and from B-52 bombers.
The mission would be to knock substantial holes in the formidable
Serb air defense network of Soviet-built surface-to-air missiles
and anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   Phase two would involve attacks by stealthy F-117s and by F-16s
and F-15s accompanied by EA-6B electronic jamming aircraft. Again,
the initial targets would be anti-air defense systems and the
electronic and communications networks that support them.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, if all goes as planned, U.S. and other NATO pilots
should be able to fly over much of Serbia in far greater safety. At
that point, A-10 Thunderbolt tank killers might be expected to fly
in low and slow to target ground combat units and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO hope is that, once the Serb military begins taking
heavy losses, Belgrade will throw in the towel and agree to a peace
accord signed last week in Paris by the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement similar to the one that put a U.S.-led NATO
peacekeeping force in Bosnia calls for a NATO peacekeeping force to
enter Kosovo. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has
planned for a force of 28,000 ground troops, 4,000 of which would
be American.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to restore to Kosovo the autonomy it enjoyed until
Milosevic, the president of Yugoslavia, began stripping it away in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement signed last week by the Kosovar Albanians,
control of most of Kosovo's political, judicial, legal and
educational institutions would be transferred from the Serbs who
make up only 10 percent of the population in the province to the
ethnic Albanians. The latter account for 90 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians see such an arrangement as the first step
toward creating an independent nation of Kosovo, to be dominated by
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs fear precisely that outcome, which explains why
Milosevic is opposed to the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Formally the United States is opposed to independence. Clinton
has suggested, however, that if Milosevic continues to reject the
U.S.-backed peace plan, and NATO air strikes are required to break
the Serb military stronghold on the region, all bets could well be
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their (Serbs') best chance to keep Kosovo as a part of
Serbia and as a part of Yugoslavia,'' Clinton said of the peace
plan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (story can end here)
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo has affronted the world with a
humanitarian crisis closely mirroring the terror Serbs inflicted
for 3.5 years across neighboring Bosnia. There, more than 200,000
people, most of them civilians, were killed and 15 times that
number were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   That crisis ended in the fall of 1995, only after a week and a
half of U.S.-led NATO air strikes targeting Serbs and three weeks
of strong-arm diplomacy led by Holbrooke ending in the Dayton
Accords. The result was a massive U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping force
that remains in Bosnia even now, with no prospect of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   There are other places in the world, where atrocities
perpetrated upon civilians have provoked outrage. Sierra Leone, the
Sudan and Rwanda come quickly to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo, however, strikes closer to home for
many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to see people slaughtered, we don't like to see
people chased from their homes, especially in large numbers,
especially in Europe,'' said Serwer.

 &HT;    Physics in '99: Dissecting movements of dance to their core
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Torque, mass, parabola, trajectory _ these aren't
terms that dance across your mind as you watch a rail-thin
ballerina floating effortlessly through a series of tour jetes or
executing 32 of the whipped turns called fouettes.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kenneth Laws, a physicist who teaches at Dickinson
College in Carlisle, Pa., the terms and the tours go hand in hand,
as he explained Monday in a session called ``The Physics of Dance''
for the American Physical Society. His talk was one of hundreds of
presentations that are going on at the American Physical Society's
conference in Atlanta this week, commemorating the association's
100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Laws is a balletomane on several fronts. He has taken dance
classes, ferried his children to ballet lessons and served as board
chairman of the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when he began to wonder how dancers
accomplished all that gravity-defying stuff, he offered some
thoughts (and a set of line drawings that look like industrial
blueprints) to Scientific American's column called ``The Amateur
Scientist.'' The resulting article, published in June 1982, has
blossomed into two books and many lectures for physicists and dance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Using a model, dancer Amy Kohler of Chicago, Laws showed his
audience at the Georgia World Congress Center a 30-second sequence
from the ballet ``Serenade.'' Then he took apart the movements:
arabesque, pirouette, jete. Kohler, who has worked with Laws
before, broke down the steps into their smallest components and
demonstrated them in slow motion _ or as slow as a flying step can
be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Laws indicated _ on this elfin dancer, who carries possibly 105
pounds on her 5-foot, 7-inch frame _ the center of gravity in the
pelvic girdle. When Kohler launches herself into the air for a jete
and stretches her legs into a split, he explained, the body's
center of gravity rises _ in freeze-frame photography or with video
you can see it _ because there's so much less weight to support
beneath the pelvic girdle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes it possible for a dancer to suspend herself
for a breathtaking second in midair _ or for Michael Jordan to
float halfway down the court as he sinks yet another basket.
</P>
<P>
   Later Laws partnered Kohler in a lift that carried her about 3
feet off the ground. ``They don't call me Arnold for nothing,''
said Laws, flexing an academic bicep.
</P>
<P>
   Then he dissected the lift. Without assistance, he explained,
Kohler is able to jump only about 8 inches off the floor; if she
just stands there, he can lift her dead weight only to the same
height. It takes both their energies to create the illusion of
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler, who has danced with Chicago Ballet and Ballet Iowa and
is working on a master's degree in dance therapy at Columbia
College, said not one of her ballet instructors has explained how a
pirouette or a jete works.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I did the session in Chicago,'' she said, ``I went back
into class _ and my turns were so much better.''

 &HT;    Delta deal to buy ASA near close
 &HT;    By staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines' buyout of regional affiliate Atlantic
Southeast Airlines is as good as done.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said Monday it now holds 91 percent of ASA Holdings Inc.
shares, following a tender offer that expired last week. It already
owned 28 percent and needed a majority to prevail in the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will close at a final ASA Holdings shareholder meeting
next month, and the the regional carrier will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Delta, which made the move to gain complete control
of ASA's operations and routes.
</P>
<P>
   Delta paid $34 a share, or about $700 million, and took out a
$500 million line of credit to finance the purchase.

PHILBY'S FRIENSHIP LACED WITH DECEIT _ YET LOYAL TO THE END 
ROPE SPRUCES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kim Philby was the most devastating Soviet mole ever to
penetrate the British secret service. Graham Greene was one of the
century's great novelists and an iconoclast. Together, they forged
a complicated friendship that lasted half a century and flummoxed
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Philby was exposed as a double agent in 1963, Greene earned
the opprobrium of their native England by publicly defending
Philby's treason. Greene maintained that Philby merely followed a
higher morality than country _ his belief in communism.
</P>
<P>
   But theirs was a friendship woven of deceit as well as loyalty.
How much did Greene know of Philby's secret life as a spy? Did
Philby betray Greene as well as England? Did it continue into their
final years?
</P>
<P>
   There are tantalizing insights into these questions tucked away
in the John J. Burns Library at Boston College, where some of their
lambent correspondence is preserved in the 60,000-item archive of
Greene's manuscripts and letters. The college purchased the papers
in 1994, three years after Greene's death at age 86. Philby died in
1988 at age 76.
</P>
<P>
   The letters may be no more than the musings of two duplicitous
old men who chose to stay in touch as they aged, Philby from his
apartment in Moscow, and Greene from his villa in the south of
France. But they could also represent feints by each man to mislead
the other _ and the other's country.
</P>
<P>
   Is Philby, a full KGB colonel, speaking for that outfit in his
letters? Is Greene passing all that Philby writes to the British
SIS and American CIA, as his official biographer believes? Does it
matter?
</P>
<P>
   Both write elliptically, and glide past unspoken questions of
complicity as they exchange mordant judgments on the Ayatollah
Khomeini, John Paul II, Ronald Reagan, and other questions of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Betrayal is sticky stuff. John le Carre, an expert on the
subject, agonized over it to Timothy Garton Ash in a recent issue
of The New Yorker. Le Carre was a British spy for almost 16 years.
He betrayed relentlessly for country. The morality of the
tradecraft troubles him today. He calls the conundrum ``a question
that's haunted me these last 45 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Philby _ the model for le Carre's definitive spy story
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' _ betrayal had been a way of life
since he was recruited by the Soviets as a student at Cambridge to
spy for them. Philby's deception over the years was brilliant, and
he rose to the highest ranks of British intelligence before he fled
to Moscow, one step ahead of British agents sent to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Philby who recruited Greene, already an established
writer, into British espionage during World War II. The two became
drinking partners and fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's attraction to Philby was anchored in part by his
instinctive support of the maverick. ``Greene liked odd men out,''
says Norman Sherry, his biographer. ``He was against powerful
figures.'' Greene was also entranced by Philby's fluent ability to
deceive, a theme in Greene's fiction. ``Greene admired Philby's
ability to wear a mask so perfectly,'' says Sherry, who knew Greene
for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry says that the only argument he ever had with Greene was
over Philby. ``Somewhere in his early life, Greene said that you're
absolutely doomed if you are betrayed by your friend,'' he recalls.
Sherry reminded Greene of his early comment and Greene replied,
``Yes, yes, I still feel that way.'' But when Sherry raised the
subject of Philby the betrayer in this context, Greene became
furious. ``Greene got so damned angry that I'd caught him out,'' he
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Philby's letters are marbled with comments on global politics
and humor. Questions of deceit and betrayal aside, they reflect the
freshness of contemporary comment on what we today know as history.
And what Greene once described as Philby's ``chilling certainty in
the correctness of his judgment'' pervades his letters.
</P>
<P>
   In a missive early in 1980, for example, Philby dismissed
Khomeini with the snotty disdain of a member of London's venerable
Garrick Club while identifying with acuity the source of his
fundamentalist strength that remains relevant today, in and outside
Iran:
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to take the view that the Ayatullah is a hateful old
fraud and that his precious Islamic republic is meaningless. But
the point is that he stands for a very powerful negative _
revulsion against Great Power domination _ which is not confined to
Muslim peoples. And, for the time being, we have to live with him.
So what?''
</P>
<P>
   Philby viewed the two superpowers at the beginning of 1980 with
a gimlet eye: ``I am afraid we are in for a difficult year. I don't
believe in the Soviet threat to Europe, I don't believe in a NATO
threat to the Soviet Union (though I do believe that renewed
efforts will be made to detach our allies from the Warsaw Pact.)''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding ``this infernal Afghan business,'' he wrote, ``I need
hardly tell you that I an very unhappy about it; what may surprise
you is that I have met no one here who is happy about it. Was it
essential to take up the military option, as it is called
nowadays?''
</P>
<P>
   Is all of this misinformation? At one point, Philby sought to
assure Greene that he spoke for himself. ``When you next buy Pravda
at your local newsagent,'' he wrote, ``you will see that I am
expressing my own views, not those of the government.'' Yet in one
letter in 1980, Philby promises to pass on ``to the competent
authorities'' a Graham idea of joint action between the Soviet
Union and the United States in hot spots around the globe such as
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry, a Briton who has been working on his Greene opus for
over 20 years, is convinced that Greene gave his Philby
correspondence to Western intelligence. ``It is my belief that his
correspondence to Philby was under the instruction of SIS and the
CIA,'' Sherry says. ``He knew important people there. I'm convinced
he was hoping to make Philby a treble agent.''
</P>
<P>
   The treble agent theory is pure supposition on Sherry's part,
who concedes he has no love for Philby. He declined Philby's
invitation to Moscow for the Greene biography and stopped writing
to him after he got what he needed from him by letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, he was a traitor,'' says Sherry, noting that Philby
trained scores of agents to be sent into Albania, where they
perished. ``Philby loved to betray,'' he adds. ``He made friends
with those people he sent there, knowing he'd already betrayed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sherry maintains that Greene's much-publicized
anti-Americanism was fabricated. ``All of it was balls, in my
view,'' he says. It was, said Sherry, a ruse _ an attempt to echo
Philby's views as a way to draw him back to the West. The two men
clearly missed each other's company; as Philby reportedly told
colleagues, ``I'd like to be with &UR;  &LR; Graham Greene with a bottle of
wine between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene and Philby both despised Pope John Paul II. In a letter
in 1982, after a papal visit to Central America, Philby wrote, ``I
have a feeling that the next few years there will see much
nastiness, and I doubt whether John Paul II's visit to Hispaniola
will do much for the desamparados. I don't like the showbiz,
kissing tarmac, etc., and his views on sexual matters seem to me to
be unimaginative and unkind. As for politics, he is involved
willy-nilly and he must know it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Greene wrote to Philby three years later, ``My
Dear Kim, You know how much I share your views not only about a man
in Washington but about a man in Rome. He is the most political
pope we have suffered for many generations.'' Greene added in
reference to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan,
``I wish I was a fly on the wall when there is a meeting between
your man and the B-film actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Booze was a constant for both men and a problem for Philby. In
one letter, he described himself as ``an aging gentleman belonging
to what Auden called the cigarette and alcohol culture.'' He sent
Greene a postcard from Havana in which he offered New Year's
greetings from the Bar Floridita, ``where the daiquiri
originated.'' He signed it ``Your fan in Havana, KP,'' adding
``Muchos daiquiris en la Floridita.''
</P>
<P>
   He later wrote Greene, ``The daiquiris didn't bother my sinus,
which, if I indeed have one, has so far been as quiescent as my
liver. But I found that those infernal ice chips interfered with
serious drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Philby loved women as much as alcohol. In 1965, he inscribed a
book to the wife of fellow spy Donald MacLean that read: ``To
Melinda with love from Kim Nov 1965 _ An orgasm a day keeps the
doctors away!''
</P>
<P>
   But the light banter does not disguise the depth of the
friendship. Before Philby died, Greene visited him in his Gorky
Street apartment in Moscow, where he lived with his young Russian
wife, Rufina.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's loyalty to his old friend was most obvious in his
introduction to Philby's 1968 autobiography, ``My Silent War.''
Greene wrote, ```He betrayed his country' _ yes, perhaps he did,
but who among us has not committed treason to something or someone
more important than a country?''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ The post-Oscar King of Hollywood lives in
New York, behaves like an old-time studio mogul and has plenty of
enemies. Especially Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the unexpected triumph of ``Shakespeare in
Love'' over ``Saving Private Ryan'' as best picture, Harvey
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, which made ``Shakespeare,'' was
fielding phone calls in his Beverly Hills hotel suite and accepting
congratulations. His costly promotion campaigns for two films,
``Shakespeare'' and ``Life is Beautiful,'' had paid off even more
lavishly than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Why the 5,500 member of the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and
Sciences split their vote between ``Shakespeare in Love'' and
``Saving Private Ryan'' was the source of discussion all over
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, which produced ``Private Ryan'' with Paramount, was
nothing less than devastated, even though their World War II epic
picked up five Oscars, including one for Steven Spielberg as best
director. Executives at Dreamworks, including Jeffrey Katzenberg,
one of its founders, have said in recent weeks that Weinstein had
upped the ante by spending millions to promote ``Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg's partners, Spielberg and David Geffen, were also
known to be angry with Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, whose movie
``A Thin Red Line'' fared poorly in the Academy Award and box
office sweepstakes, said that the Oscar process had started to
resemble an expensive political campaign, and that Weinstein shared
some of the blame for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire academy process is overbloated,'' Mechanic said.
``It's like the process of trying to win an election. It's no
longer about the material or the merit. It's about how much money
you spend. It's not what the academy founders set out to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechanic said that Weinstein, who runs Miramax with his brother,
Bob, was unusual among studio executives because he was consumed
above all with winning Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other company, Miramax was set up for
specialized movies and tend to be movies that the academy
recognizes,'' he said. ``They've focused on one thing: the Academy
Award process. The rest of us are in the business of making
different types of films, some of them meriting academy attention,
some not.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was unavailable Monday morning. But more than anyone
else in today's Hollywood, this 46-year-old executive has been
compared with old-line studio moguls. Miramax employees said that
Weinstein was tough, irascible, opinionated, temperamental and
difficult but often had superb taste. His critical and commercial
successes include ``The Piano,'' ``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Il Postino,''
``Cinema Paradiso'' and ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein, a big, imposing and perennially rumpled figure who
usually has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, is both popular
and unpopular among filmmakers. He has collided with prominent
directors like James Ivory and has been nicknamed ``Harvey
Scissorhands'' by others because of his tendency to edit and take
over films. Other filmmakers, though, including Quentin Tarrantino,
Jane Campion and Billy Bob Thornton, enjoy good relations with him.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein is direct. In 1993, when he heard that Time magazine
was about to run an article revealing that Jaye Davidson, the
``female'' lead in ``The Crying Game,'' was a man (which was not a
surprise because Davidson had won an Oscar nomination as best
supporting actor), Weinstein called a top editor 18 times in one
day in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Davidson's sex a secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes him unusual is the results,'' Mark Urman,
co-president of Lion's Gate Films, which released ``Gods and
Monsters'' and ``Affliction,'' said Monday. ``Look at what happened
last night. The machinery Harvey puts in place is like a
juggernaut. All predictions, all sense of logic and in some
instances a sense of fairness is thrown out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual _ but not unprecedented _ for academy voters to
cast ballots for the director of one film while choosing another
movie as the year's best. It has happened 18 times, beginning with
the very first Oscar. In recent years, for example, Warren Beatty
won the best director Oscar for the 1981 film ``Reds,'' but the
year's best picture was ``Chariots of Fire.'' In 1989, ``Driving
Miss Daisy'' won the best picture award, but its director, Bruce
Beresford, was not even nominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love,'' an elegant comedy about a love affair
between Shakespeare and a restless woman who yearns to act, won
seven Oscars at the 71st annual Academy Awards on Sunday night,
including those for Gwyneth Paltrow as best actress and for Marc
Norman and Tom Stoppard for original screenplay. Miramax's ``Life
is Beautiful'' won the best actor award for Roberto Benigni and was
chosen as best foreign film.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise over the award for best picture extended even into
Walt Disney Studios, whose parent company owns Miramax. ``I was
stunned that `Shakespeare in Love' won after the Spielberg award,''
said Joe Roth, chairman of Disney Studios. ``It seemed like
`Private Ryan' had all the criteria to take best picture. Why
didn't it? Perhaps `Shakespeare' was able to convince a lot of
women voters to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studio executives and producers said that ``Private Ryan''
was simply not as fresh as ``Shakespeare'' in the minds of academy
voters. The Spielberg film opened in July, and although videos were
sent to academy members, many of them may not have watched again
because the material was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   One top producer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ``
`Saving Private Ryan' suffers on cassettes. If you see it at home,
you are by no means as impressed with it as you were in a movie
theater. And `Shakespeare in Love' is a more intimate picture, it
plays well on cassette. It may actually be enhanced by watching it
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   But Terry Press, the marketing chief at Dreamworks, responded:
``That goes to a larger issue. You're a member of the Motion
Picture Academy, not the television video academy. These movies are
meant to be seen in movie theaters, all of them. They're not meant
to be stopped and started and paused when the phone rings or to
feed the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   One Dreamworks executive said that ``Shakespeare'' may have
triumphed because the biggest bloc of academy voters are actors and
the film is a tribute to acting and theater. On the other hand
``Private Ryan'' is the work of a virtuoso filmmaker, and as a
result he was given the Oscar for best direction. There was the
possibility, too, that the majority of academy voters simply
preferred the comedy to the tragic war drama.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Shadowing the entire process, though, was the expensive
promotional campaign for ``Shakespeare,'' which may have reached
$10 million to $15 million, including Hollywood trade paper
advertisements as well as ads in newspapers promoting the film,
which is expanding to theaters around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed,'' said Damien Bona, co-author of ``Inside
Oscar,'' (Ballantine), who writes frequently about the Academy
Awards. ``Every day in the trade papers you were bombarded with
Miramax ads. It's nothing new. They've always done this. But the
degree to which they've done it this year is astonishing.'' In some
ways the advertising campaign for ``Shakespeare'' may have created
a sense of momentum in the minds of academy voters that helped
place the film at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gill, president of Miramax's Los Angeles office, and Marcy
Granata, its executive vice president for marketing, vigorously
denied that the company had overspent on the campaigns.

   ``A lot of people accuse us of spending more than Dreamworks,
but actually we spent less,'' said Gill. ``We counted. Basically
they bought 165 total pages in the Hollywood trade papers. We
bought 118 total pages for `Shakespeare.''' This omits, however,
Miramax's hefty promotion of the movie in general newspapers.

SOME BAROQUE DISCOVERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the New York Collegium instantly acclaimed as a
new force on the early-music scene in the city this season,
hard-working older ensembles have to be asking whether they, after
all, have been merely chopped liver.
</P>
<P>
   Artek, for one, has afforded many pleasures in its 14 seasons,
as it did on Wednesday evening in a mostly fascinating program of
French Baroque music at the Church of the Resurrection in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   What it has not achieved, and what, for that matter, the New
York Collegium has yet to show, is consistency over the long haul.
Performance levels can vary drastically from night to night and
even within a single concert.
</P>
<P>
   In this adventurous and well-stuffed program of small-scale
works, the level was reasonably high. The featured works, ending
each half of the program, were lovely solo cantatas by Michel
Pignolet de Monteclair: ``Le Mort de Didon,'' sung by Jessica
Tranzillo, a soprano, and ``Pan et Syrinx,'' sung by Barbara
Hollinshead, a mezzo-soprano.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in ``Pan et Syrinx,'' the little-celebrated
Monteclair came across as a fine and inventive composer, as he has
before in performances by another worthy New York Group, Concert
Royal.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest of the program, Enrico Gatti, a violinist,
and Colin St. Martin, a flutist, variously combined with Gwendolyn
Toth, a harpsichordist and the director of Artek, and a few other
players. Strong cases were made for works by Marin Marais, who has,
alas, slouched back into obscurity after a mild flurry of activity
surrounding the film ``Tous les Matins du Monde''; Michel Corrette,
a composer perhaps even more inventive and less celebrated than
Monteclair, and Francois Couperin.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited playing by St. Martin was not enough to elevate a flute
suite by Jacques-Martin Hotteterre above the level of Baroque
routine. Ms. Toth offered enjoyable tidbits by Jean-Henri
d'Anglebert and Louis Couperin, but Daniel Swenberg's uncompelling
account of a guitar suite by Robert de Visee served merely to make
the evening seem long.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it left a listener basically satisfied. It's just that
one of these days, that listener would like to be, and stay, wowed.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new, easy-to-use device that jump-starts a stopped
heart could save up to 100,000 lives a year, if it goes into
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   The device is an Automated External Defibrillator, a simplified
version of the defibrillators used by medical professionals on
people suffering cardiac arrest. The device delivers a powerful
electric shock to the heart, forcing it to resume beating.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is recruiting companies across the nation
to buy defibrillators and train employees in their use. On Monday,
Steve Bullock, the organization's acting president, hosted a
training session at Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the workplace that many of these (cardiac arrest)
incidents happen,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary advantage of the device is that it requires little
training, and can be used during the crucial first few minutes of a
heart attack, while the ambulance is on its way. CPR may still be
required to ensure the victim's body is receiving oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The device literally talks users through the steps of restarting
a person's stopped heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apply pads,'' the device says. ``Plug in connector.''
</P>
<P>
   It checks for a heartbeat; if none is detected, the device tells
the user to shock the victim by pressing a flashing button.
</P>
<P>
   Thedefibrillator, which was developed by Heartstream, a division
of Hewlett Packard, costs about $3,500 per unit, said David Todd of
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross eventually will expand its program to include
shopping malls and stadiums, where emergency response tends to be
slower because of difficult access, Bullock said.

KOSOVO TOPS AGENDA AS PRIMAKOV COMES TO WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov had hoped to
spend his time in Washington building support for billions in new
aid for Moscow. The Clinton administration had hoped to make
progress with Primakov on arms control and security agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But when Primakov arrives in the US capital Tuesday, his
meetings with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are
likely to be dominated by an issue that has sharply divided America
and Russia, the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, with NATO forces primed for airstrikes against Serbia in
case last-minute talks with Yugoslavia's President Slobodan
Milosevic failed to yield results, Primakov appealed to America and
its allies not to go through with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are emphatically against the use of force against
Yugoslavia,'' Primakov told reporters after meeting Monday in
Moscow with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
``We believe that political ways to influence the situation are
still far from being exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov brushed off a question about whether he might postpone
his trip to Washington over the Kosovo crisis, saying only ``I hope
there will be no raids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says Russia's opposition will not
halt the airstrikes. But it is clear that bombing the Serbs would
make the timing of the Russian premier's trip awkward for both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   They already disagree on what Russia needs to do before it gets
any more aid from the West. Primakov wants $4.8 billion from the
International Monetary Fund now to help meet Russia's payments on
older debts to the IMF, several billions of dollars of which come
due in May. The US is aware that much of the money from previous
Russian loans it supported has been spirited off to overseas
accounts, and wants a crackdown on corruption and reforms. As
Clinton put it last week, new aid will only work ``if the money
doesn't turn around and leave the country as soon as it's put in.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, irked that Primakov is bucking US interests
in Kosovo while asking for money, have called on Clinton to cancel
the trip, and Monday, US and Russian analysts said that sounded
like the best idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Primakov) does not want to be in this country if we are
bombing Serbia,'' said Michael McFaul, a specialist on Russia at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ``It would be in
everybody's interest to postpone the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the differences on economic and geopolitical issues, the
Clinton administration had hope for some progress on arms control
talks. This came after Primakov convinced the lower house of the
Russian parliament to debate ratification of the 1993 Start II
agreement that would limit both countries' nuclear arsenals to
3,000-3,500, down from current levels of over 7,000 on both sides.
But bombing in Kosovo could derail the Start II ratification, and
cut into progress on further arms- reduction talks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs success with Russia to stave off what could be a
weakness in a presidential campaign _ the sense that the Clinton
administration's policy of constructive engagement with Russia has
been a total failure, McFaul says.
</P>
<P>
   While the prospects for these talks look dim, analysts pointed
to a change in the Clinton administration's approach toward Russia
that had become evident during the preparation for Tuesday's talks.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year's economic collapse, the conventional wisdom in
Washington was that the US needed to support President Boris N.
Yeltsin at all costs, because nothing he could do would be as bad
as letting Russia fell into the hands of communists.
</P>
<P>
   These days, US Russia watchers say the US should support
Primakov and his communist-backed government, because nothing could
be worse than what might happen if the ailing, isolated and
unpredictable Yeltsin were forced to choose a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no friend of Primakov, but he is better than all the
available alternatives,'' said Marshall Goldman, associate director
of Harvard's Davis Center for Russia Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the Duma to debate Start II, which Russian lawmakers had
declared dead only a few months ago in protest of the US bombing of
Iraq, is an example of Primakov's ability to build a consensus in
Russia's contentious political climate, a skill that has won
grudging admiration for a former KGB intelligence agent, spymaster
and diplomat who has never been known as a friend of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has also won praise for giving Russia some political
and economic stability since becoming prime minister last august in
the wake of the country's financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primakov has probably achieved about as much as possible given
Russian political conditions and the very real limitations of his
present power,'' Scott Blacklin, head of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Russia, wrote in a recent commentary published on
Johnson's Russia List, a online publication on Russia.

MIT ISSUES REPORT ACKNOWLEDGING SEX DISCRIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In an extraordinary admission, top officials
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the most prestigious
science and engineering university in the country, have issued a
report acknowledging that female professors here suffer from
pervasive, if unintentional, discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always believed that contemporary gender discrimination
within universities is part reality and part perception,'' the
university's president, Charles M. Vest, said in comments to be
published in the faculty newsletter within days and already posted
on the World Wide Web. ``True, but I now understand that reality is
by far the greater part of the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Vest's comments introduced a report five years in the making
that documents a pattern of sometimes subtle _ but substantive and
demoralizing _ discrimination in areas from hiring, awards,
promotions and inclusion on important committees to allocation of
valuable resources like laboratory space and research money.
</P>
<P>
   Such discrimination, national experts say, continues and in some
ways has worsened at institutions across the country, despite the
growing number of female professors. In a report issued last month,
the American Association of University Professors found that though
women now make up 34 percent of faculties nationwide, up from 23
percent in 1975, the gap between salaries for male and female
professors actually widened in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Female faculty members involved with the MIT report say they do
not believe that the institute discriminates more than other
top-flight universities; it is simply more willing to admit it and
address the problem. A hard push to increase the number of tenured
female professors is already well under way, the report says, along
with other efforts to redress inequities in the allocation of
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's comments on the report ``are the most
forward-looking statements on gender discrimination that I've read
by a high-ranking administrator in one of these elite institutions
in the 25 years I've been a faculty member,'' said Nancy Hopkins, a
prominent molecular biologist and an initiator of the committee
that issued the report.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Birgeneau, dean of the School of Science, the section
of MIT that was the focus of the report, said Monday that he
believed the university was unusual in its willingness to make such
a document public. He also noted in his written comments: ``I
believe that in no case was this discrimination conscious or
deliberate. Indeed, it was usually totally unconscious and
unknowing. Nevertheless, the effects were real.''
</P>
<P>
   Real, but hard to pin down until three tenured female professors
in the School of Science started to compare notes in the summer of
1994. As the report describes, they quickly decided to poll their
other female colleagues, which was not difficult because in the
entire School of Science, there were only 15 tenured women,
compared with 194 men.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the report notes, the percentage of the School of
Science faculty who are women, 8 percent, has remained virtually
unchanged for perhaps 20 years. And that, too, seemed a problem,
with no sign of improving on its own.
</P>
<P>
   By August 1994, the female faculty members in the School of
Science proposed creating an initiative to improve the status of
women in the school _ to which Dean Birgeneau readily agreed _ and,
being scientists, they began to collect data, on everything from
the allocation of laboratory space to the amount of research money
professors had to apply for themselves instead of being handed it
by the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was data-driven,'' Birgeneau said of the report, ``and
that's a very MIT thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies at other schools have looked at questions of
salary and promotion and found women consistently paid and promoted
less, said Martha S. West, a professor of law at the University of
California at Davis and a member of the American Association of
University Professors' committee on the status of women. But, she
said of the MIT report, ``what's amazing about this is the
president's acknowledging that there is a `scientific' basis for
our continual perception that things are not good for us. And my
perception is that things have been getting worse, not better, for
women over the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Mary Gibson, chairwoman of that committee on the status of
women, called the MIT administration's support for the report
``absolutely remarkable,'' noting that in her experience, ``schools
tend to respond very defensively and tend to be afraid of potential
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Birgeneau said that participants in the report had not examined
its legal implications. Laying the statistical basis for the report
involved fact-finding that uncovered some interesting wrinkles. For
one, junior female faculty tended to feel well taken care of and
untouched by discrimination; it was only as they became senior
faculty, and competed for real power, that they felt themselves
increasingly marginalized and overlooked by male-dominated
networks. And that did not seem to improve with time, the report
found.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting aspect of the process was the dawning
comprehension among the faculty, men and women both, who
participated in the report that they really were seeing a pattern
of discrimination, not a set of individual cases, all of which had
``special circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Each little slight to a woman might involve an assumption that
served as an explanation: say, that a single woman might seem to
need a raise less than a family man, or that a woman might be less
likely to seek an outside job offer to propel her promotion, or
that it might seem implausible that a woman with children could
work hard enough for a given job. But they all added up. The women
``needed to prove to themselves almost at the level of scientific
proof that this was really not fair before they had the conviction
to act,'' Dr. Hopkins said. ``I thought for every case, `Well,
maybe it's about that particular woman.' I had to see it happen to
a number of women before I saw it was different women, different
fields, but the pattern was the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of discrimination can also be somewhat intangible,
said Jacqueline Hewitt, a professor of physics. Such as a tendency
to overlook women's comments in a meeting: ``These things, like how
much of a voice you have in the decision-making process, are not so
easily quantified,'' she said. ``It's hard to say exactly what's
going on, but there's a common thread.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenured female faculty members and the dean, the report
says, ``found that discrimination consists of a pattern of powerful
but unrecognized assumptions and attitudes that work systematically
against female faculty even in the light of obvious good will. Like
many discoveries, at first it is startling and unexpected. Once you
`get it,' it seems almost obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do other elite universities `get it' better than MIT?'' the
report, which is posted on the Web at
http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html, continues. ``No, and
indeed a common defense for MIT's small number of female faculty
members is that `Cal Tech and Harvard are doing just as badly.' But
to be as bad as these unenlightened institutions is not a defense
we should take!''
</P>
<P>
   MIT officials and faculty members involved in the report met on
Monday to consider their next steps. Lotte Bailyn, the chair of the
faculty and an expert on workplace equality, said that the group
had discussed trying to spread similar initiatives to the rest of
the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a beginning conversation but the goal is to keep
this kind of process going _ to keep the women involved with the
administration and to keep track of what's happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was reported on in Sunday's Boston Globe,
recommended continued vigilance, noting that in the School of
Science, there has never yet been a woman department head or even
associate head. It made a raft of other concrete recommendations,
including a yearly collection of ``equity data'' and the dismissal
of administrators who knowingly discriminated.
</P>
<P>
   It also pointed out that there was still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what was accomplished here was extraordinary,'' Dr.
Hopkins said. ``However, the number of people involved in this
initiative was tiny, and the number of years it took us to
understand it as well as we do is five years, and most of the
people at MIT have still barely heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge now,'' she said, ``is what can you do so that
this wonderful thing that has happened can become automatic and
institutionalized?''

BRITISH HALT RELEASE OF FOUR IRA PRISONERS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British government Monday halted the release of
four Irish Republican Army prisoners, a move that pleased neither
IRA sympathizers nor those who assert that the Northern Ireland
peace process has awarded too many concessions to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw, who is responsible for prisons and
law enforcement, said he needed legal clarification on whether the
prisoners were entitled to early release under the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the sensitivity of the issue and the timing, at a
point when the peace process is stalled over the fate of the IRA's
weaponry, that nearly every one saw hidden motives to Straw's move.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the party aligned with the IRA, accused Straw of
trying to assuage Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland who have
been calling for a halt to prisoner releases until the IRA begins
to turn in some of its arsenal. Sinn Fein officials warned that the
move would only inflame opinion among republican skeptics who say
the British government is supporting unionists attempting to
rewrite the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But if the move was meant to appease unionists, few of them saw
it as such. Ian Paisley Jr., son of the fundamentalist preacher who
leads the most recalcitrant of the unionist parties opposed to the
peace process, said it showed that the British government values
English lives more than those lost in Northern Ireland. Each of the
four prisoners whose releases were halted were convicted in English
courts, three for killing people in English cities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four prisoners whose releases were indefinitely put on
hold was Patrick Magee, the IRA bomber who masterminded the 1984
explosion at the Grand Hotel in Brighton which killed five people
and nearly killed its primary target, then-prime minister Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Magee, who is hated by Conservative Party members in Britain
because it was their annual conference he bombed, was supposed to
serve 35 years of a life sentence. But under the terms of the Good
Friday Agreement, which crafted a political settlement in Northern
Ireland, Magee and all other members of paramilitary groups
committed to the peace process are to be released before July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While Magee was not expected to be released for several more
months, Straw's action halted the scheduled release Tuesday of Paul
Kavanaugh and Thomas Quigley, convicted of 1985 bombings in London
that killed three people, and Gerard McDonnell, who was sentenced
to life in prison in 1986 for a bombing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Straw described the legal review sought by Straw
as a technical, not political, matter, saying Straw had legitimate
questions about how the agreement's prisoner release provisions
applied to inmates in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman denied that the government was sending a warning
that the release of its prisoners would be halted if the IRA
continues to refuse to turn in any of its weapons. Nor was the move
aimed at bolstering unionists, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said a court is likely to rule very soon, if not
Tuesday, whether the releases can go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is committed to meeting our obligations under
the Good Friday agreement,'' the spokesman said.

   But after emerging from a meeting with IRA prisoners in the Maze
prison outside Belfast, Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein assembly member
who served a lengthy prison sentence for IRA bombings, described
Straw's move as disgraceful.

<P>
   Unionists and republicans face a new deadline of April 2 to
resolve their dispute over the IRA's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists refuse to form a local government, or allow Sinn Fein
members to sit in the new Cabinet where both sides will share
power, until the IRA begins disarming. The IRA and its allies in
Sinn Fein say that nothing in the agreement links disarming to
forming a new Northern Ireland administration and triggering the
return of power from the British Parliament to a local assembly in
Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during St. Patrick's Day festivities in Washington,
President Clinton urged the parties to put their disputes aside and
implement the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in full.

 &HT;    Saving lives made easier with new, easy-to-use Automated
External Defibrillator
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new, easy-to-use device that jump-starts a stopped
heart could save up to 100,000 lives a year, if it goes into
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   The device is an Automated External Defibrillator (AED), a
simplified version of the defibrillators used by medical
professionals on people suffering cardiac arrest. The AED delivers
a powerful electric shock to the heart, forcing it to resume
beating.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is recruiting companies across the nation
to buy AEDs and train employees in their use. On Monday, Steve
Bullock, the organization's acting president, hosted a training
session at Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the workplace that many of these (cardiac arrest)
incidents happen,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary advantages of the AED is that it requires little
training, and can be used during the crucial first few minutes of a
heart attack, while the ambulance is on its way. CPR may still be
required to ensure the victim's body is receiving oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   The AED literally talks users through the steps of restarting a
person's stopped heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apply pads,'' the device says. ``Plug in connector.''
</P>
<P>
   It checks for the victim's heartbeat; if none is detected, the
device tells the user to shock the victim by pressing a single
flashing button.
</P>
<P>
   The AED, which was developed by Heartstream, a division of
Hewlett Packard, costs about $3,500 per unit, said David Todd of
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross will eventually expand its AED program to
include places such as shopping malls and stadiums, where emergency
response generally tends to be slower due to difficult access,
Bullock said.

COMMENTARY: CHINA'S CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When viewed from here, there is something
incredibly off-base about the debate on China going on in the
United States today. The best parallel I can think of is the debate
in America about Japan a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about Japan was essentially between two schools. The
``Honda school'' argued that the Japanese had basically found the
secret to endless economic success _ from just-in-time inventory to
team manufacturing _ and the only thing for America to do was to
emulate the Japanese model and accommodate them as best we could.
The ``Gen. Douglas MacArthur'' school argued that the Japanese may
have found the secret of success but they had rigged the game by
closing off their markets to others, and the right policy was to
beat down their walls and contain their rising economic power.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one school missing from this Japan debate: the
one arguing that Japan's system was deeply flawed, that while it
had a few cutting-edge global companies, the rest of its economy
resembled state-owned communist factories, and that the Japanese
wizardry for making a lot of the same thing well would no longer be
an advantage in the information age, where innovation is happening
much faster and everyone wants something different, tailored just
for him. Therefore, Japan's economy would slow to a crawl in the
1990s and the biggest problem we would have with Japan would be
managing its weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the only school missing from the debate on Japan
was the one that reflected reality. The same is true now for China.
</P>
<P>
   There are essentially two schools in the China debate. One
school says just trade with China and everything will turn out
fine, as China naturally prospers. The other school argues that
China will grow stronger and more authoritarian at the same time,
and therefore it must be contained and tamed now by U.S. power,
before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Time will prove both these schools off the mark. I believe the
key problem we will face with China over the next decade will be
managing its weakness. China may grow richer, and it may grow more
authoritarian, but it's not going to do both at the same time. In
the long run China cannot get where it wants to go, in terms of
higher living standards, without a radical political and economic
restructuring. It will not be able to cure the 40 percent of its
economy that is bankrupt banks and factories without more rule of
law, more global integration and investment, and more
democratization.
</P>
<P>
   China cannot get from here to there with its current
corruption-laden, one-party system, and moving away from that
system is going to involve some wrenching changes and internal
strains. (See dictionary for Thailand, Korea and Indonesia.)
</P>
<P>
   We debate about China as though President Jiang Zemin woke up
every morning and said, ``Hey, where can I threaten America
today?'' Nonsense. Jiang wakes up every morning and says to his
aides: ``What? Our unemployment level is now 101 million? But
yesterday you told me it was only 100 million.'' That's what he's
focused on because that's what can kill him and his party _ not
American power. Managing China's weakness _ and the turmoil it
could spew out of here _ when China's current system hits the
limits of its adaptability could turn out to be an all-consuming
task for U.S. foreign policy as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic how perceptions of the old Soviet Union now color
U.S.-China relations. U.S. conservatives look at China today and
see the 1960s Soviet Union of Sputnik, Khrushchev and a rising
communist power; Chinese intellectuals look at China today and
worry about the 1990s Soviet Union of mafiosi and social collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me for my directness,'' Yang Jiemian, an expert at
Shanghai's Institute for International Studies, said to me, ``but I
have seen what happened to the former Soviet Union. The lesson is:
If conditions are not prepared, and we change our system too
quickly, there will be great social disorder and civil war and the
Americans will not come to our rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's have a division of labor: You worry that China is a car
about to run us off the road. I'll worry that it's a car with 1.3
billion people going 80 miles an hour toward a speed bump, with
wheels that could come off at any moment.

 &HT;    Physics in '99: New tool may detect earlier signs of cancer
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new laser system will give doctors another tool for
peering into the human body to detect very early signs of cancer
without having to remove tissue for diagnostic tests, researchers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In tests on patients with a precancerous condition that can lead
to colon cancer, the laser-induced ``fluorescence spectroscopy''
system performed just as well as _ or better than _ biopsies and
other conventional detection methods, said physicist Mary-Ann Mycek
of Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the laser-based technique does not require the removal
of tissue, it represents a tremendous advance over the current
practice of tissue biopsy,'' said Mycek, who presented her findings
at the American Physical Society's 100th anniversary meeting in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a biopsy, a doctor removes a portion of diseased tissue and
sends it to a laboratory to determine if it is malignant,
precancerous or benign.
</P>
<P>
   Very early detection and treatment of diseased tissue can
prevent the development of cancer. Mycek said that when the laser
system can detect subtle, microscopic chemical and structural
changes in the tissue that may be symptoms of early precancerous
conditions. The technique could be widely available within a few
years, Mycek added.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports Monday at the physicists' meeting:
</P>
<P>
   _ Philip Wyatt of Santa Barbara, Calif., said he has developed a
fist-size device similar to a smoke alarm that would give an early
warning of a biological warfare attack. The physicist said the
device uses a laser to quickly detect anthrax spores or other
dangerous microbes that may be released by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   _ A theory by University of Pittsburgh physicist Ernest
Sternglass says the universe will continue to expand until it
reaches a maximum size 200 times its present radius and will
neither fly apart into dead ashes, as predicted by some, nor
collapse into a fiery point. ``It will allow life to continue
forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The next generation of computers, electronic optical
instruments and photovoltaic cells may not be based on spinach _
not silicon _ say researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
in Tennessee. The scientists have developed a way to manipulate
spinach leaf proteins so that they absorb energy from the sun and
power electronic devices.

 &HT;    Physics in '99: Dissecting movements of dance to their core
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Torque, mass, parabola, trajectory _ these aren't
terms that dance across your mind as you watch a rail-thin
ballerina floating effortlessly through a series of tour jetes or
executing 32 of the whipped turns called fouettes.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kenneth Laws, a physicist who teaches at Dickinson
College in Carlisle, Pa., the terms and the tours go hand in hand,
as he explained Monday in a session called ``The Physics of Dance''
for the American Physical Society. His talk was one of hundreds of
presentations that are going on at the American Physical Society's
conference in Atlanta this week, commemorating the association's
100th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Laws is a balletomane on several fronts. He has taken dance
classes, ferried his children to ballet lessons and served as board
chairman of the Central Pennsylvania Youth Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when he began to wonder how dancers
accomplished all that gravity-defying stuff, he offered some
thoughts (and a set of line drawings that look like industrial
blueprints) to Scientific American's column called ``The Amateur
Scientist.'' The resulting article, published in June 1982, has
blossomed into two books and many lectures for physicists and dance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Using a model, dancer Amy Kohler of Chicago, Laws showed his
audience at the Georgia World Congress Center a 30-second sequence
from the ballet ``Serenade.'' Then he took apart the movements:
arabesque, pirouette, jete. Kohler, who has worked with Laws
before, broke down the steps into their smallest components and
demonstrated them in slow motion _ or as slow as a flying step can
be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Laws indicated _ on this elfin dancer, who carries possibly 105
pounds on her 5-foot, 7-inch frame _ the center of gravity in the
pelvic girdle. When Kohler launches herself into the air for a jete
and stretches her legs into a split, he explained, the body's
center of gravity rises _ in freeze-frame photography or with video
you can see it _ because there's so much less weight to support
beneath the pelvic girdle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes it possible for a dancer to suspend herself
for a breathtaking second in midair _ or for Michael Jordan to
float halfway down the court as he sinks yet another basket.
</P>
<P>
   Later Laws partnered Kohler in a lift that carried her about 3
feet off the ground. ``They don't call me Arnold for nothing,''
said Laws, flexing an academic bicep.
</P>
<P>
   Then he dissected the lift. Without assistance, he explained,
Kohler is able to jump only about 8 inches off the floor; if she
just stands there, he can lift her dead weight only to the same
height. It takes both their energies to create the illusion of
weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler, who has danced with Chicago Ballet and Ballet Iowa and
is working on a master's degree in dance therapy at Columbia
College, said not one of her ballet instructors has explained how a
pirouette or a jete works.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I did the session in Chicago,'' she said, ``I went back
into class _ and my turns were so much better.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ It's the ninth inning. Astros closer Billy Wagner
is on the mound.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fastball, right?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Wagner almost certainly would have gone with his
trademark 100-mph fastball in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner, fast becoming one of the game's top closers, wants
something to complement his blazing fastball. That has led him to
develop a second pitch, a slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to head out there with another pitch,'' said
Wagner, who has 53 saves over the past two seasons. ``I think it
makes me more of a pitcher than a thrower, because now when guys
get up there they can no longer say, `OK, I've got to get ready for
the fastball.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon to see pitchers try to expand their repertoire
in an effort to remain a step ahead of the competition. That's one
of the primary reasons for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Astros lefthander Trever Miller is working on a ``drop-and-down
sidearm'' offering, pitching with a motion that allows him to come
at a hitter with his fastball and slider at a lower angle. The
angle, similar to how Los Angeles' Kevin Brown pitches _ ``but
without that kind of velocity,'' Miller jokes _ gives Miller's
pitches a different look, something that is particularly effective
against lefthanded hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, they can't pick up one arm angle,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Why do pitchers feel compelled to try different things?
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Vern Ruhle said, ``It's an addition to the basic
things they do. They are trying to give the hitter another look, or
another thought, to see if they can round themselves out a little
bit. There's a statement that says, `You're either getting better
or you're staying the same.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're staying the same, somebody else is getting better
and it looks like you've fallen back. It's a progressive mindset
of, What are you doing to improve your game?''
</P>
<P>
   Early last season, the Astros suggested Wagner work on a second
pitch. The idea was reaffirmed last fall when, on a trip to Japan
with other major-leaguers, he kept hearing the same thing from
closers Trevor Hoffman, Mike Jackson and Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Their advice: Don't throw the fastball so much.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, 27, spent the rest of the offseason working on the
slider, a pitch that starts out looking like a fastball but takes a
short, sharp break just before reaching the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The results this spring have been encouraging. Wagner is 2-0
with 14 strikeouts in nine innings while allowing one earned run.
On Saturday against Detroit, he struck out two of the four batters
he faced, going with the slider ``three or four times.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wagner will continue to rely heavily on his hard one, just
the presence of a second pitch gives him an advantage, manager
Larry Dierker said. A slider averages 6 to 7 mph less than most
fastballs and usually breaks about nine inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he throws it (the slider) enough so people know he
will throw it, that might be the tiny little difference that keeps
them from catching up to his fastball,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said the slider is the perfect pitch for Wagner, as
opposed to trying to learn a curve, which isn't as common among
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to find which pitch, or what different style, best
suits a particular pitcher. And what he is trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you try and do is imagine what's the best combination of
pitches a guy can have to make it difficult on a hitter,'' said
Dierker, who won 139 games in 14 major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy throws sidearm, you don't try and teach him to throw
a forkball,'' he said. ``You can't throw a forkball sidearm. You
have to look at the way a guy throws, and then say, `Well, here's
what he has that is good. What does he not have that would
complement that thing the most, that he may be able to learn?'''
</P>
<P>
   For many pitchers, change is a constant.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a career-high 16 wins last season, righthander Jose
Lima is trying to improve his slider and gain better command of his
sinking fastball and changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Crow, challenging for a spot in the bullpen, is working on
a delivery that will give him better command of both corners of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Crow joined the club, the Astros noticed he was successful
on the inside corner against righthanded hitters. It wasn't the
same when he threw outside. To help fix the problem, Crow has
shifted his position on the rubber in an effort to go straight at
hitters instead of throwing across his body.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to learn something new during the spring can help _ but
it also can hurt a player trying to make the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cabrera began last season with the Astros but missed most
of the year with a sore right shoulder. He didn't pitch winter ball
and entered camp last month lacking velocity on his fastball
because of the long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had my fastball like it used to be,'' Cabrera said.
``They told me if my fastball didn't return like it used to be, I
needed to work on a two-seamer (sinker) to get hitters out.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I need to throw a lot of innings and try to pick up my
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   To help offset the loss in speed, the Astros encouraged Cabrera
to continue working on getting more movement on his sinker, which
he has thrown infrequently this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Jeff McCurry has been learning a sinker to go with
his fastball and slider. His greatest concentration, however, has
been in trying to hold runners on base better by using a speedier
delivery to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera and McCurry will continue their development in the minor
leagues when the season starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (spring training) is the perfect time for a veteran pitcher
to work on something but very difficult for a guy trying to make
the team,'' Dierker said. ``Sometimes you have to take a step
backward before you take two steps forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy trying to make the team can't afford to take a step
backward.''

   In an ongoing series of the 100 greatest minds of the 20th
Century, Time, ($3.95) profiles a new batch of braniacs. Some are
predictable (such as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud) and some
offbeat (like philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and chemist Leo
Baekeland, the inventor of the first true plastic.) At 232 pages,
it is a huge issue, with other attractions as well, including a
detailed look at the balloon in which Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand
Piccard and British balloon instructor Brian Jones flew around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Punch line: How did Evander Holyfield rate a tie when he
fought Lennox Lewis? The headline ``Grand Larceny'' ought to give
you an idea. Sports Illustrated ($2.95) calls the Holyfield/Lewis
fight an ``unconscionable draw'' in a contest that clearly should
have gone to Lewis. ``Holyfield kept his belts? He looked lucky to
be alive,'' writes Richard Hoffer. ``Then seeing a jaunty Lewis,
largely unmarked, but without the belts he deserved, gave you that
old familiar feeling; shame.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At the end of his rope: Dan Osman pioneered the edgiest of
extreme sports, a thrill-ride he called ``free-falling.'' Created
by a climber who kept slipping, it consists essentially of jumping
off very high places and falling a long way, to be jerked to a stop
by a climbing rope. But last year, when Osman leaped off the
1,100-foot Leaning Tower in the Yosemite National Park with a rope
that was supposed to bring him up 150-feet short of the bottom, he
miscalculated. Craig Vetter writes about the death of the daredevil
in the new Outside ($3.95).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keeping small fry safe: Speaking of safety, a new study
reveals that 85 percent of car seats are used incorrectly. Parents
($2.95) shows which seats work well, how to fit your child to the
proper seat, and how to install the one you've got.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wired for sound: What is .MP3? It is a compression format, a
way to digitally store high quality music and sounds, to be
delivered over the Internet. It is also giving nightmares to the
music industry, because the spread of .MP3 sites on the Web herald
a coming world of instant music distribution, a world in which
record stores will be irrelevant.  &QR;  Yahoo! Internet Life ($3.99, or
on the Web at www.yil.com) tells about the coming distribution
revolution, which, right now, is missing one thing, good music by
recognizable artists in the .MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lucky 13: Everything doesn't necessarily get better when you
hit it big. Friends fall away, your privacy is reduced and you have
to leave an old life behind. On the other hand, you can afford a
new house and throw yourself a heck of a party. Those are the major
indulgences for a machinist and his wife, when they win $6.5
million (after taxes) at Powerball. Money ($3.95) profiles the
Columbus, Ohio couple, John and Sandy, who are at least savvy
enough to avoid giving their last names to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hey, no sunburn! A new generation of college students are
forgoing the beer bongs and wet T-shirt contests of Spring Break to
rebuild churches and deliver food to sick shut-ins. U.S. News &AMP;

instead of getting wasted, are getting to work.

 &HT;    A calm, thoughtful TV debate on race
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of blacks and whites of differing viewpoints sits around
a large table in front of television cameras and are pressed to
defend their positions on the role of race in America today.
</P>
<P>
   On some shows, the producers would be looking for passion,
explosive outbursts, maybe even some name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   In the restrained world of Charles Ogletree, however, there's
barely a raised voice or an interruption. Televised tranquility _
what a concept. Not that sparks don't fly; just that the intent is
not to start a conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree, a Harvard law professor, is the moderator of the Fred
Friendly Seminars, named for the late CBS News president who
exemplified some of the best impulses of TV journalism, and who
started these round tables. Ann Coulter, the jabber-jawed attorney
who was nearly ubiquitous during Monica-gate, and Ann Lewis, White
House director of communications, are the most recognizable;
they're joined by a roster of activists, academicians and people
with a tendency toward thoughtfulness even if they are members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The established format of the Friendly Seminars is for Ogletree
to pose a quasi-hypothetical situation _ a state university that
has weighted its admissions process and given preference to a black
candidate over a white _ and then challenge the panelists on the
morality of the problem. Between Ogletree's incisive questioning
and the panelists' willingness to listen rather than bark out
prepared killer sound bites, the hour is filled with more
intelligence and even genuine good will on a contentious subject
than a typical month's worth of TV debating.

 &HT;    Music back up prayers, chants
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you wonder when you see ``Abba Pater'' on sale at
stores, Pope John Paul II did not head over to the Vatican
recording studio for a day in the booth with earphones.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the pope's CD a tribute to a Swedish rock group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abba Pater'' (being released today in joint observance of Holy
Week and the 20th year of John Paul II's papacy) combines the
pope's voice with musical backdrops written _ collaged would be a
better word _ by Italian pop arranger Leonardo de Amicis. (Music
for two of the 11 tracks was provided by Stefano Mainetti.)
</P>
<P>
   The pope's voice is taken from recordings of the outdoor Masses
he has celebrated in Italy, France, Spain and the United States. In
addition to the languages of these countries, he prays and chants
the liturgy in Latin. Selections include ``Pater Noster'' (``Our
Father'') and the Beatitudes (from the Sermon on the Mount in the
Gospel of St. Matthew), as well as standard prayers from the Roman
Catholic liturgy that are given fancy new titles such as ``Christ
Is Freedom'' and ``Father of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's voice _ robust in some places, frail in others _
shows how much the man has aged in office. That vigorous Polish
cardinal, Karol Wojtyla, who greeted the world in its entire Babel
of tongues when he became pope in 1979, is now 82, an old man with
Parkinson's disease, who says he wants only to meet the new
millennium. No matter how one feels about the pope's conservative
theological positions, there is something very moving about his
all-too-discernible humanity. He is a man almost used up in the
service of God.
</P>
<P>
   What a shame the music behind him is so bland and gummy. It
ranges from phony Albinoni to pseudo-African chorus-and-drum stuff
_ ``Lambarena'' without any real Bach for backbone. It all
resembles the soundtrack to ``The Mission'' or ``Oscar and
Lucinda,'' up-river epics that are really symbolic spiritual
quests. With the voice of the pope offering a genuine ``interior
pilgrimage,'' as the CD proclaims, this musical pablum is doubly
insulting.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church has almost 2,000 years of great music
in its archives, from Gregorian chants to the mystical essays of
Olivier Messiaen. Yet the producers of this record _ Radio Vaticana
and the religious publisher San Paolo Audiovisivi, which will also
issue the title track as a music video _ ditched all of it in favor
of New Age schmaltz. How very Vatican II.
</P>

BEEF IS THE ISSUE, AS U.S. PLANS TRADE RETALIATION
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States prepared to open a new front in
its trans-Atlantic trade disputes Monday, publishing a list of $900
million in European goods like truffles and French foie gras that
could be subjected to 100 percent tariffs if American farmers were
not permitted to export hormone-treated beef to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the list were mainly food items, including Evian, Perrier,
Ricola cough drops and imported Dijon mustard. But there also were
some manufacturing goods, like mopeds and smaller motorcycles by
Bianchi of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came in response to European statements that it
would not be able to comply with a ruling from the World Trade
Organization to end its ban on hormone-treated beef by May 13. The
organization concluded that Europe's rules prohibiting sale of the
beef were based on faulty science.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become a heated political topic in Europe, along
with the arguments over whether European rules on banana imports
are designed to discriminate against fruit handled by two American
companies, Chiquita Brands International and the Dole Foods Co. The
United States has begun to impose 100 percent tariffs on $500
million in European luxury good imports in retaliation for Europe's
refusal to comply with the trade organization's rulings in that
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Like the banana arguments, the battling over beef hormones has
been going on for years. And, as in the banana case, the United
States is moving quickly to threaten retaliation, in hopes of
creating pressure on European politicians from companies that will
find themselves virtually unable to ship goods to the United States
_ unless they pay a 100 percent tariff, doubling the wholesale
price.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. trade representative's office published a
``target list'' of $900 million in goods subject to retaliation,
including Swedish hams, that list will be pared significantly
before any tariffs go into effect. American beef farmers put their
losses because of the hormone rules at several hundred million
dollars, and the final list is expected to contain about $300
million in European goods sold here.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the imposition of the tariffs, Europe could negotiate
some form of compensation for American beef farmers. But on Monday,
Peter Scher, who heads agricultural negotiations for the trade
representative's office, said that ``compensation is meant to be a
bridge to ending the ban, and the E.U. has never made it clear it
will comply with the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scher said that negotiations are under way to allow for the
hormone-treated beef to be clearly labeled for European consumers,
who could avoid buying it if they were uncomfortable with the
products. But Scher noted that there was ``no evidence of any
health risks'' related to consumption of the beef.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, more is at stake in these
battles than beef and banana exports. Clinton has argued that the
European Union has to be taught to abide by trade organization
rulings. The Europeans counter that the United States is jumping
the gun, imposing retaliation before the appeals process is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has long argued that there can be long-term health
effects to treating beef with hormones, and that the effects may
not be known for years. The United States has countered that
Europe's motivation is essentially protectionist, and that it has
used bad science in the service of keeping the market closed to
competition.

 &HT;    UConn has 'The Bounce' that counts
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he ran through warmups before Connecticut's matchup with
Virginia in December 1998, Khalid El-Amin could not ignore the
screaming Cavaliers fan in the first row under one hoop at
University Hall. Every time the Huskies' pudgy point guard drove to
the basket during the layup drill, the fan held up a Domino's Pizza
box and yelled at El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   The reference to El-Amin's celebrated midsection and affection
for all things covered in cheese, sauce and pepperoni drew a
grudging chuckle from the player.
</P>
<P>
   Then El-Amin hit only two of 13 shots in the Huskies' 74-63
victory. But that was the first and last time, he insisted, that he
ever permitted a weighty jibe to hurt his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy kept yelling at me, 'Hey, are you hungry Khalid?
When's the last time you ate? If you're not hungry now, then you
will be by halftime.' `` said El-Amin, listed generously at
5-foot-10 and conservatively at 203 pounds. ``I didn't think it
would get to me like it did, because I've heard that kind of stuff
before. But I played a miserable game. And then I promised myself
that, any time it happened again, I'd make somebody eat his
words.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his two seasons at Connecticut, the loquacious
El-Amin has been a man of his word. He has started 69 of 71 games
and his 1,060 points rank third in UConn history for a player in
his first two years. He led the club in assists and steals both
seasons and made five game-winning shots, including three in the
final 10 seconds of games.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Richard Hamilton, the pogo-stick forward and co-Big
East player of the year, is the Huskies' clutch player. In
application, however, it is El-Amin who typically has the ball in
his hands at the end of close games.
</P>
<P>
   UConn players call Hamilton ``The Bomb'' and El-Amin ``The
Bounce,'' for his ability to transfer his electric personality to
the court.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way for El-Amin almost from the moment he laced
up his first pair of sneakers at age 4 and his father, Charles
El-Amin, noticed the effortless way his son burst off the dribble
past older kids in their Minneapolis neighborhood. By the time he
was in third grade, El-Amin was playing on his brother's
seventh-grade team. Three times he led Minneapolis North High
School to the state championship, and El-Amin twice was state
player of the year. He committed to Clem Haskins' program at
Minnesota, then angered the locals by reneging on his promise and
heading to chilly Storrs, Conn., where he sensed the opportunity
for the national title was better and where ``they needed a vocal
guy like me to fire them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotion and competitiveness certainly mark El-Amin's game, but
it is his blinding quickness on the dribble that amazes opponents.
Connecticut is a team that looks to run at every opportunity, with
Hamilton and fellow forward Kevin Freeman among the best finishers
in the country, and El-Amin usually is at the middle of their
break. His jump shot frequently abandons El-Amin for stretches --
he was zero-for-12 Saturday afternoon in his foul-plagued
performance against Gonzaga -- but he is uncannily accurate at
crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   In profile, El-Amin, looks more like basketball writer than an
All-Big East player. On a playground, however, the Pillsbury point
guard would make plenty of dough, boy, hustling all the
disbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, he has used the ``Fat boy'' and ``Tubby''
barbs as motivation. In a game at Pittsburgh early this year, he
rallied the Huskies with five points in the final nine seconds,
then leaped onto the scorer's table after his game-winning
buzzer-beater to confront the fans who had taunted him. Against
Iowa last week, he twice responded to ugly chants from Hawkeyes
supporters by taking the ball the length of the court for layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like one of those Cabbage Patch dolls, you know?''
Freeman said. ``You look at him and think, 'No way can he be that
good.' But he really is a special player. And just as important,
he's a special person, too.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's style and physique are different from any of the other
Final Four point guards -- Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State,
William Avery from Duke and Ohio State's Scooney Penn.A devout
Muslim who prays five times daily and rarely makes eye contact with
visitors to the locker room, El-Amin is a mouthy, whirling dervish
on the floor, constantly calling attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that any of the other players in St. Petersburg
have been forced to learn responsibility at such a young age.
El-Amin was married at 16, fathered one son, Tezzaree, out of
wedlock at 17 and now has a two-month-old son, Ishmael, with his
wife, Jessica. He has deemed Jessica off-limits to the media, and
discussing his religion also is taboo, although he volunteered that
his father is a former imam and an older brother now holds that
title as a respected leader of his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Team manager Josh Nochimson, with whom El-Amin, Jessica and
Ishmael share a large, off-campus apartment, said last week that
Khalid plays for his sons and held up a pair of sneakers with their
names written on them. UConn coach Jim Calhoun, who had been
barraged by questions about his program's failure to make the Final
Four, it up when the subject turned to his point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredibly mature, about 15 going on 35, and very
bright,'' Calhoun said. ``People see the flash and the dash, but he
only lets you through a door to his life that he opens himself. The
place he is most comfortable is on the court, running the show, and
few people can run it like he does.''

JUSTICES HEAR HOW CLINTON SEEKS DISMISSAL OF HIV-INFECTED OFFICER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: San Antonio, Texas) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president should be able to fire an
HIV-infected Air Force major who defied an order not to have
unprotected sex, the Clinton administration argued Monday before
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The administration urged the justices to overturn a military
court's decision blocking the firing of Maj. James T. Goldsmith of
Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's attorney countered that President Clinton, although
commander-in-chief of the armed services, has no constitutional
authority to fire the airman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issue of presidential authority was at stake, the
justices appeared more concerned with the nuances of the military
justice system than with Clinton's constitutional authority as they
pressed the administration's lawyer, U.S. Deputy Solicitor General
Michael Dreeben, and Goldsmith's attorney, John Economidy of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Why was a basic personnel decision before the military's highest
court in the first place? the justices asked. But Goldsmith's saga
is anything but basic, agreed attorneys for the government and the
major.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith was court-martialed and found guilty of willfully
disobeying Col. John P. Tagnesi's order that he tell intimate
partners he is HIV-positive and to use protective methods to
prevent transfer of his infection. Goldsmith, who had unprotected
sex with a female officer and a civilian woman, was sentenced March
4, 1994, to six years' confinement at the U.S. Disciplinary
Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He also forfeited $2,500 per
month for the six years because of his disobedience and related
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court chose not to discharge him from the military,
the Air Force, acting at Clinton's behest, initiated Goldsmith's
discharge based on his conviction. Goldsmith challenged his
dismissal as unconstitutional, saying he already had been punished
for his actions and that the president's effort to fire him would
amount to a second punishment, in violation of the constitution's
prohibition on double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton sought to fire Goldsmith under a 1996 law
allowing the president to terminate officers who had been sentenced
to at least six months in prison. The major argued that the
Constitution prohibits the president from relying on that 1996 law
because it was not enacted until after Goldsmith had committed his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces agreed with the
major and issued an order Aug. 25, 1997, blocking the president.
Two months later, Goldsmith's sentence expired and he returned to
duty status.
</P>
<P>
   Dreeben, pressing the president's case, told the justices that
the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces had no jurisdiction to
rule on what amounted to a personnel dispute between the president
and Goldsmith. The major should have taken his concerns not to a
military court but to the Air Force secretary, the Air Force's
Board for Correction of Military Records or a federal district
court, Dreeben said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist questioned whether the
Board for Correction is the proper venue for a personnel issue.
Rehnquist, a published historian, noted that the Army's Board for
Correction recently ruled not on a personnel issue but on a
longstanding appeal when it cleared Dr. Samuel Mudd of wrongdoing
for setting the broken leg of Abraham Lincoln's assassin, John
Wilkes Booth, in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer then asked Dreeben why the military's
highest court would lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of
Goldsmith's constitutional challenge to the president. ``We have an
expert military court saying he (Goldsmith) is right,'' Breyer
said, referring to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Dreeben said military courts are designed to
enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice and to re-enforce
order and discipline in the ranks. Constitutional claims are more
appropriately handled in federal civilian courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Dreeben, Economidy said the Board for Correction is
ill-suited for hearing constitutional challenges to adverse
personnel actions. The board would regard Goldsmith's appeal as an
extension of the court-martial proceeding, over which the board has
no authority, Economidy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist disagreed with the attorney's argument that the
board's jurisdiction is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Economidy responded that he had no time to test the open
question of whether the board could consider the constitutional
claims of his terminally ill client. Instead, the attorney said he
turned to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces because it
certainly has jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to
presidential personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client at the time was dying,'' Economidy said. ``I had to
move very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith is still on duty at Lackland. The justices are
expected to render their decision in the case, Clinton vs.
Goldsmith, by July.

 &HT;    Comcast to purchase MediaOne; broadband on the way to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The $60 billion bid by Comcast Corp. to buy MediaOne
Group is aimed at building a global powerhouse for all manner of
digital telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the companies _ both large cable television
operators in metro Atlanta _ said they agreed to a stock swap that
will create the nation's 36th-largest corporation, putting the
combined company in position to compete for consumers and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, almost certainly bound to include job cuts after the
merger, is an endorsement of the notion that high-speed data
delivery _ broadband _ will soon be the means for transmitting
voice and information. It will be the way that consumers get their
television, video and Internet access, as well as their phone
service, all on one line. The much-ballyhooed convergence of
technologies will let either a phone or cable company be the
primary provider of service.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gantt, president of the Ansley Group, said the
Comcast-MediaOne deal is confirmation that the struggle for
dominance between cable companies and phone companies is under way.
``People are looking for a high-powered pipeline into the houses.
This is the globalization of convergence, where all the telecom
companies try to hook up the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast will pay for MediaOne in assumed debt and stock, giving
1.1 Class A shares for each MediaOne share.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consolidation has been the trend, as partners look for
more muscle in buying power and lower costs through greater scale.
Most prominent of recent months was the massive purchase of cable
company TCI by AT&AMP;T, a deal intended to give the long-distance
company a way to customer homes.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Roberts, president and chief executive of
Philadelphia-based Comcast, told reporters that the deal will let
the combined companies move up to a new league. ``In one fell
swoop, we can create the pre-eminent broadband distribution company
in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 million subscribers, the combined company would lag only
Time Warner with 12.6 million and AT&AMP;T's TCI unit with 12.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Bruce Leichtman of the Yankee Group said that bigger
companies can negotiate better contracts with programmers and
suppliers and can cut redundant costs. ``That size gives you a lot
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller carriers like Adelphia and Atlanta-based Cox
Communications can prosper, but they must at least consider
mergers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, spokeswoman Ellen East of Cox Communications, which has
about 3.8 million subscribers, said size is not all-important.
``Equally important is having the right markets, dominating those
markets and having quality operations in those markets. We may be
smaller than some, but we are far ahead in launching new
services.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cable companies are not directly competing with each
other. Their long-range rival is the entrenched local phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lillis, president and chief executive of MediaOne, said
the souped-up Comcast will be able go after customers it now
ignores. For example, the companies' networks already pass tens of
thousands of small businesses. ``We currently get just about zero
revenue from small business, but small business can buy and sell an
awful of things on the network. We see a stunning opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A strategy of luring businesses would thrust Comcast into a
market traditionally controlled by local phone companies like
BellSouth. That dominance is already under attack by large
providers like MCI WorldCom and AT&AMP;T as well as smaller rivals like
Level 3, Intermedia, NextLink and ICG Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Creech, BellSouth spokesman, said the company believes it
can compete against cable companies offering packages of phone,
Internet and television service. For instance, BellSouth offers
wireless television and high-speed digital subscriber lines for
Internet access now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mosaic approach, but in the long term it will alow us
to respond to customers with video, and high-speed Internet
access.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is vulnerable because coverage areas of its wireless
television and DSL services are both spotty. Wireless television
depends on being in sight of a tranmitter, and DSL is available on
500,000 lines out of several million in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Reali, analyst for Dataquest, said there are now about
600,000 subscribers to high-speed cable modems in North America,
compared with only about 62,000 DSL lines in service. ``But it's
going to be a very aggressive year for DSL.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has been a supporter of the broadband service known as
At Home, while MediaOne uses a service called Roadrunner. While the
companies have not said which service will get the nod, Reali said
she expects a sharing of the two that could speed the roll-out of
service for both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, like other cable companies, Comcast and MediaOne were
originally one-way systems built to transmit television signals to
viewers. But in the past several years, the cable industry has
spent upwards of $5 billion upgrading networks to handle two-way,
high-speed data. MediaOne has spent about $1 billion, much of it in
metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, both Comcast and MediaOne will have completed 70
percent of the planned upgrade, according to Roberts. ``That
broadband platform is what this merger is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge value of the Comcast deal is seen as pre-empting any
rival offers for MediaOne. But even assuming no bidding war, the
agreement is subject to approval of federal regulators and
completion is not expected until late this year. At least until
then, the companies will continue as separate entities and Atlanta
customers will see no effect on service, officials said. MediaOne
spokesman Dave Wood went a step farther, promising no rate
increases for the duration of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the merger will give the combined company about
804,000 subscribers, according to Roberts. MediaOne has about
540,000 subscribers, including operations in Atlanta, as well as
other parts of metro Atlanta counties. MediaOne lines pass about
900,000 homes, and the construction of upgraded lines for video is
now about one-third complete, said spokesman Reg Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast, the state's second-largest cable company, has systems
in parts of DeKalb County, including Dunwoody, Doraville and
Chamblee, as well as Walton, Carroll, Gordon and Paulding counties,
and in some communities outside metro Atlanta. Comcast officials
were unavailable to provide information about the extent of the
company's upgrade effort in Atlanta.

OSCAR BROADCAST LOST AT LEAST 9 MILLION VIEWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday night's Academy Awards broadcast on ABC suffered a
significant ratings drop from the 1998 version, drawing at least 10
percent fewer viewers, preliminary figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's early figures projected a 34.7 rating, which would be
6 points, or 17 percent, lower than that of the the 1998 broadcast.
But ABC's own estimate of the total number of viewers who watched
at least some part of the show was 78 million, down about 10
percent from 87 million viewers a year ago. Official ratings are to
be issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives quickly pointed out that last year's show was
wildly popular, largely because the wildly popular ``Titanic''
dominated the awards. This year was also the first time that the
Oscar ceremony was held on a Sunday night, although that decision
was made at least partly to maximize its ratings potential.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers fell far enough that the Academy Awards will
probably not even be the second highest-rated television show of
the year, after the Super Bowl, as it usually is. It won't even be
the highest-rated broadcast on ABC this season, because it looks as
if Oscar will lose to Barbara Walters' interview with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky interview this month averaged a 33.4 rating, while
ABC's estimates of the Academy Awards show put it in the range of a
28 to 29 rating. (Each Nielsen rating point represents 994,000
homes.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which charged advertisers a record $1 million for each
30-second commercial during the Oscars show (dwarfing the $800,000
figure sought but paid only for a couple of commercials for the
Lewinsky interview), tried to play down the disappointment by
noting that this year's show did better than the 1997 Academy
Awards broadcast, a gain of about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that show was the lowest-rated Oscar show in a decade. At
the time ABC said the low ratings resulted from a lack of
enthusiasm about that year's big movies, with ``The English
Patient,'' based on the novel by Michael Ondaatje, leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   This year, another English film with literary roots,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' was the big winner, taking seven awards
including best picture. Both films happen to have come from the
same studio, Miramax.

SAFETY BOARD SEEKS TO ANSWER SOME LONGSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT
BOEING 737 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Colo., Md., Fla., Conn.)  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Transportation Safety Board will try
on Tuesday to end the longest investigation in its history, and
establish the reason for two crashes and several harrowing
incidents involving the world's most popular jetliner, the Boeing
737. But after four and a half years of intensive investigation,
there are no simple answers in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The board has already issued 27 recommendations, most concerning
the possibility of rudder malfunction since beginning its
investigation of a fatal crash of a USAir jet in Pittsburgh in
September 1994. When it meets Tuesday to consider the probable
cause of that crash, it could vote to issue new recommendations,
which would cost Boeing and the airlines billions of dollars to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   One recommendation drafted by the board's staff calls for the
Federal Aviation Administration to assure that the rudder control
mechanism is more ``reliably redundant,'' one board official said.
The board often does not specify what hardware should be changed or
added, but people involved in the investigation said that
recommendation could mean a second hydraulic mechanism to control
the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Another recommendation under consideration is to broaden the
testing beyond the hydraulic valve, and to look for the possibility
that a pressure wave, like a bang in the pipes of an old house when
someone turns off a faucet, is intermittently causing malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Boeing and the FAA, which would decide if more
changes are needed, have been arguing that the stubby twin-jets
have always been safe and have been made yet safer by the many
lessons learned in the first stages of the investigation. It
centered on USAir 427, which went down in September 1994 on an
approach to Pittsburgh International Airport, killing all 132
passengers and crew. The findings, however, could also have a
bearing on the crash of United flight 585, another 737, which
crashed in Colorado Springs in March 1991, killing all 25 aboard.
That crash thus far has been attributed to a meteorological
phenomenon called wind rotor.
</P>
<P>
   Other 737s have experienced rudder problems. Most recently, a
737 operated by USAirways, as USAir is now known, made an emergency
landing in Baltimore while en route from Orlando, Fla., to
Hartford, Conn. The plane had already been equipped with a new
hydraulic valve meant to eliminate a possible problem identified
after the Pittsburgh crash _ a valve that controls a rudder has
been found to jam. When that happens, and the pilot steps on a
pedal calling for a small move in one direction, the rudder can
swing all the way in the opposite direction, and stick there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Boeing and the FAA say that a variety of changes already
made or now in progress will reduce risk to an infinitesimal level.
``We believe we have fixed any possible scenarios that may have
been associated with the accident,'' said Elizabeth Erickson,
deputy director of aircraft certification at the FAA, although she
added that it was possible no one would ever be certain of what
caused the Pittsburgh crash.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing executive, Michael Denton, a former chief project
engineer for three versions of the 737, said the investigation was
``really a very serious business for the Boeing company and it's a
very serious business for the flying public.'' He said, though,
that even without a definitive cause for the accident, ``Over the
last four and a half years, the aviation industry and the Boeing
company made the 737 a safer airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing insists that there is no sign of malfunction in the
rudder; one of its theories is that a crew member stomped on a
pedal that controls rudder movement, and held it there as the plane
then skidded through the sky, nose turned too far sideways until it
could no longer fly and then corkscrewed to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have conceded that there are no signs or
marks on the rudder's hydraulic valve, recovered from the wreckage.
But the airplane's path could have been caused only by a hard swing
of the rudder to one side, engineers say, and Boeing agrees that
the reason might have been mechanical, even if there is no physical
evidence for that.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty for so long about so popular an airplane is what
airlines, plane manufacturers and safety officials fear most. But
the FAA and Boeing say they are in the midst of a major renovation
of the planes in service, of which there are about 1,300 registered
in this country and 3,000 worldwide. Those changes, combined with
changes in procedures and pilot training, have solved the problem,
they say, even if they cannot say what the problem was.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the point, Boeing produced a video to explain its
position that the plane was safe before the crash but has been made
even safer since then. At the end of the eight-minute program, the
narrator solemnly assures listeners that there have been 50 Boeing
737 landings or takeoffs during the video's running time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the investigations have turned up troubling factors about
the plane. One is a mechanism for jamming the valve that controls
the rudder without leaving any scars or marks that investigators
can find later.
</P>
<P>
   Four board members will vote to determine probable cause; a
fifth, John J. Goglia, recused himself because he worked for USAir
at the time of the accident. A key question before them is whether
the rudder design, driven by a single hydraulic valve, meets the
standards for redundancy. Before the accident, Boeing and the FAA
said that it did, because it had two different moveable portions,
one inside the other, to translate the pilots' commands into
channeling of hydraulic fluid and movement of the rudder, and that
if one failed, the other would continue working.
</P>
<P>
   But the safety board may have identified two mechanisms by which
a single failure could cause a rudder malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and Boeing have taken several steps. One is to replace
part of the hydraulic valve, to preclude a jam in part of its
intricate mechanism from causing the rudder to move opposite from
the way the pilot wanted. Another is to reduce the maximum
hydraulic pressure _ and thus the maximum angle that the rudder can
swing _ when the plane is above a few hundred feet. (It must be
able to swing freely at low altitude, to handle an engine failure
on takeoff, when a big rudder is vital to handle the uneven thrust
from the remaining engine.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Any rudder malfunction is now more benign,'' said Ms.
Erickson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has also distributed training materials for pilots, to
teach them more about how to cope with a plane at an ``unusual
attitude,'' that is, with the wings banked at over 45 degrees, or
the nose pointing up more than 25 degrees or down more than 10
degrees. But in a position that is unusual on the eve of a board
vote to determine the cause, both the company and the FAA
steadfastly maintain that while the problem is solved, its precise
nature is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the hearing,'' said Denton, ``we don't have
conclusive evidence that would allow us to say it was flight crew
or a specific airplane system that caused the rudder to go hard
over.''

able to swing freely at low altitude, to handle an engine failure
on takeoff, when a big rudder is vital to handle the uneven thrust
from the remaining engine.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Any rudder malfunction is now more benign,'' said Ms.
Erickson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has also distributed training materials for pilots, to
teach them more about how to cope with a plane at an ``unusual
attitude,'' that is, with the wings banked at over 45 degrees, or
the nose pointing up more than 25 degrees or down more than 10
degrees. But in a position that is unusual on the eve of a board
vote to determine the cause, both the company and the FAA
steadfastly maintain that while the problem is solved, its precise
nature is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the hearing,'' said Denton, ``we don't have
conclusive evidence that would allow us to say it was flight crew
or a specific airplane system that caused the rudder to go hard
over.''

CRANBERRY BOGS  
 GETTING MARRIED IN FRANCE  
 SEEING THE LATEST FASHIONS

<P>
   Q. (italics)My family and I are interested in visiting the Ocean
Spray cranberry factory and its cranberry bogs. Are there tours and
what would be the best month to go? _ Jo Laflin, West Hartford,
Conn.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There's not much of a chance that you'll see both the bogs
and the factory on the same trip. A bog that's on display is in
Plymouth, Mass., on Cape Cod, and the Ocean Spray factory that the
public can see is in a suburb of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The bog display is part of Cranberry World, which has a museum
that uses videos and interactive displays to tell the story of
cranberry cultivation from before Pilgrim times to today. Both
modern and early harvesting tools are on view.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free, as are samples of cranberry drinks and
snacks, and there is a gift shop whose wares include
cranberry-scented candles and cranberry candy. If the demonstration
bog doesn't satisfy, a drive along Routes 3, 44 and 58 near
Plymouth and South Carver should.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-minute walk from Plymouth Rock, Cranberry World is open
this year from May 1 to Nov. 28. The hours are 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily. Information: (508) 747-2350 or (800) 662-3263. The sponsor
of the museum is Ocean Spray, a cooperative of growers in five
states and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best time of year to visit Massachusetts cranberry
country is October. That is when the bogs are flooded in a process
called wet harvesting. Water reels _ huge devices resembling
eggbeaters _ churn the water to loosen the berries, which then
float to the surface and are gathered. Also in October, from the
10th to 12th this year, there's an annual harvest festival in South
Carver, Mass., at the Edaville Cranberry Bog, on Rochester Road,
off Route 58. (It's a 15-minute drive from Plymouth.) The program
lists harvesting tours, craft demonstrations, a cranberry museum
and entertainment. Admission is free, with a suggested $1 parking
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean Spray plant, where drinks are bottled and canned, is
at 1301 American Pacific Drive in Henderson, Nev. It is part of
Cranberry World West, and in addition to exhibitions and free
drinks and snacks, visitors can pause at a viewing bay to watch
part of the production process. Often that means bottles being
labeled; there is no actual plant tour. Information: (800)
289-0917.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go the state that has become the country's
leading cranberry producer, it's Wisconsin. There, in the town of
Warrens, six miles east of I-94, you'll find Cranberry Expo, a
museum (with a video and exhibitions that include harvesting
equipment from the 1870s to today) and craft and gift shops. Open
April 1 to Oct. 31 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: $5. Cranberry Expo is at 28388 County EW, a 45-minute
drive, basically west, from Lacrosse. Information: (608) 378-4878,
fax (608) 378-4290. &QL;

   Q. (italics)We would like to get married in Paris. What
arrangements would we have to take care of to get a marriage
license? _ David A. van der Steen, Brooklyn, N.Y.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It may be good news or a nuisance, but there is a residency
requirement of at least 40 days. That means that either the
prospective bride or bridegroom must have lived in the same
departement (district) or arrondissement for at least 30 days
before the civil ceremony plus the 10 days during which the
marriage banns are published where the ceremony is to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Under French law, the ceremony must be performed by a civil
authority. And if there is a religious ceremony, it must follow the
civil one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noting that residency and other rules may vary, French officials
urge a check with local authorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for required documents, among them are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A medical certificate from each party with results of blood
tests. The certificates must be submitted before the banns can be
published and be dated within two months before the banns are
published. Americans can be examined in the United States by a
doctor approved by the French Consulate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ A birth certificate translated into French and affidavits by
the couple stating, if applicable, how a previous marriage came to
be terminated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ An affidavit (certificat de coutume) in French by an approved
lawyer stating that each party is free to marry in France and that
the marriage will be recognized in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a list of authorized translators and doctors, get in touch
with one of the French Consulates General in the United States.
Among them is one at 934 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021; (212)
606-3689, fax (212) 606-3620; www.franceconsulatny.org. &QL;

   Q. (italics)I am interested in the fashion industry and designer
collections and would like to attend runway shows given by
designers in New York. How could I arrange that? _ Nora Gorton, La
Mirada, Calif.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The showings of fashion collections in New York are for
buyers, the media and corporate sponsors, but not the general
public, according to the Council of Fashion Designers of America,
which organizes them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You won't be able to see the shows in person, but you can catch
some of the runway action on television or the Web. The men's
spring-summer collections for 2000 are scheduled for this July 26
to 29, and the women's spring-summer collections for 2000 for Sept.
12 to 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, www.7thonsixth.com, is the official fashion designer
council site. A generous dose of fashion is dispensed by E!
Entertainment Television and by Style, a cable channel that repeats
some E! programs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the regularly scheduled fashion programs are these:
</P>
<P>
   E!'s ``Fashion File,'' on Saturday at 10 a.m.,
``Video-fashion,'' on Saturday at 10:30 a.m. and ``Model TV,'' on
Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. These times apply to both Eastern and Pacific
time zones; all three shows are also on Style. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Style's ``Model,'' on Saturday at 10 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m.
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's ``Style With Elsa Klensch,'' on Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
Eastern and 7:30 a.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   VH-1's ``Fashion Television,'' with Jeanne Beker, on Friday at
7:30 a.m. on both coasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you visit New York, stop at the Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street; (212)
535-7710. From April 6 to Aug. 22, the exhibition is ``Our New
Clothes: Acquisitions From the 1990's,'' which includes the work of
Geoffrey Beene, Calvin Klein and Giorgio di Sant'Angelo. Admission
to the museum is $10. Closed Monday.

CLINTON'S POLICY ON KOSOVO FACES RISKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In six years, President Clinton has managed to
dispatch the US military to such far-flung corners of the world as
Haiti, Bosnia and Iraq without having to justify a single American
combat death.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kosovo situation threatens to snap that streak of good
fortune, diplomatic experts say. Regardless of whether Monday's
last-ditch effort by the United States to find a diplomatic
solution works or fails, US military personnel, as even Clinton
admits, are much less likely to emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy fails, American and NATO pilots are poised to
launch air strikes in Kosovo, strikes that would require the pilots
to face sophisticated Yugoslav air defenses and maybe to fly low to
go after Serbian ground troops, which would significantly increase
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic calls off an offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels and signs a peace agreement,
Americans and other NATO troops, acting as a peacekeeping force,
would be thrust into the middle of a bitter civil war. The shooting
could possibly continue up until the day they arrive _ and probably
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, this is a very dangerous climate in which
things can and probably will go wrong, in which Americans and
others are going to die, or at least we'll have to be prepared for
that,'' said Ivo H. Daalder, a former National Security Council
official who is now a visiting fellow in foreign policy studies at
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Clinton administration's efforts so far to explain
the rationale for its military plans have been insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way to make the case, and it's not an easy
case to make. Most people don't know where Kosovo is. There have
been horrific things happening, but the scale is relatively small.
If 2,000 people had died in a year, that's a lot,'' Daalder said.
He compared Kosovo to the 10-month-old war in the Horn of Africa
between Ethopia and Eritrea, where many more have died without
triggering a US impulse to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stepped up up his campaign to sway a divided
Congress and a skeptical public on why the country should become
engaged in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After devoting only a radio address to the issue last month,
Clinton last Friday began trying to lay out the case for military
action, saying of the Serbs, ``I think the threshold for their
conduct has already been crossed.'' He declared, ``If we don't act,
the war will spread.''
</P>
<P>
   He also summoned a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White
House that day, and he has invited in 50 to 60 congressional
leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, to discuss Kosovo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after returning from an overnight stay at Camp David,
Clinton said ending the tragedy in Kosovo is ``the right thing''
and the ``smart thing to do, very much in our national interests,
if we are to leave a stable, peaceful and democratic Europe to our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned a lot of lessons in the last 50 years,'' he
said. ``One of them surely is that we have a stake in European
freedom and security and stability. I hope that can be achieved by
peaceful means. If not, we have to be prepared to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that with so much at stake in Kosovo _ the lives of
American and other allied troops, Europe's role and future, the
credibility of NATO and the destabilization of American allies such
as Greece and Turkey, it is imperative that Clinton make a stronger
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the biggest immediate foreign policy
challenge of his presidency,'' said Janusz Bugajski, director of
Eastern European studies at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a foreign policy think tank. ``This is a
crisis in the middle of Europe, which threatens to spill throughout
the Balkans and threaten NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even bigger than Bosnia,'' he continued. ``Bosnia was
a much-more self-contained conflict. If this is allowed to
continue, it could draw in several neighboring states.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that any military action carries risk, Mike Hammer,
a spokesman for the National Security Council, said having a peace
agreement in hand would significantly lower the risk of casualities
and was one reason Clinton sent US special envoy Richard Holbrooke
to Belgrade Monday to try to persuade Milosevic to stop Serb
aggression in the province, where ethnic Albanians are seeking
their independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deployment of the military is never without risk,'' Hammer
said. ``However, moving into a permissive environment, where the
parties have agreed to allow a NATO peacekeeping force, is
something where the risks are considerably less, as we have seen in
Bosnia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daalder said a diplomatic settlement may be difficult. ``We're
asking Serbs to withdraw some 38,000 troops out of Kosovo, and
asking the (Albanians) to de-militarize and put their trust in
NATO. Those are big demands that may not be easily heeded to, and
we may have to use force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we deploy troops in Kosovo and haven't made the case, the
reaction in the country may force us to take action that we
otherwise wouldn't want to take,'' Daalder said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bugajski said the consequence of not acting are even
grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest failure would be if NATO and the US simply sit by
and allow these massacres and displacement of population to
continue,'' he said. However, he added, ``The question is if NATO
is to bomb, what would happen next?''

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driven in part by an aging population and the
turmoil of managed care, the nation's hospitals are experiencing a
shortage of registered nurses, especially the specialized, highly
trained nurses who staff operating rooms, emergency rooms,
intensive care units and pediatric wards for high-risk babies.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage began a year ago in California and this year it has
touched nearly all acute care hospitals, where patients go with
strokes, heart attacks and major surgery, and which employ nearly
two-thirds of all registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're experiencing what almost every hospital is
experiencing,'' said Kathleen Smith, director of acute care patient
services at St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Conn., which has
placed newspaper advertisements inviting operating-room candidates
to open houses and hospital tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a shortage of more experienced nurses, particularly in
specialty areas,'' Ms. Smith said. ``We're seeing nurses getting
older and older, and not enough new nurses are coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking response to the shortage, the St. John's Regional
Medical Center in Oxnard, Calif., the principal hospital serving
Ventura County north of Los Angeles, announced on Thursday that it
would close part of its acute care space.
</P>
<P>
   The California Nurses Association said that St. John's was
raising the pay of critical care nurses by $5 an hour, to more than
$20 an hour, angering many other nurses who have been denied
raises.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing shortages happen every decade or so and have always
corrected themselves as wages rise and lure more students into
nursing. But this time, nursing schools and hospital administrators
say the cycle seems to have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and nurses' organizations see many causes of the
decline. One is demographic. Nurses are growing older and retiring
just as the baby-boom generation approaches the age of failing
health. Women, who still make up 90 percent of all nurses, also
have far more and better-paying career choices than they once did,
including becoming doctors. And nurses often cite unintended
consequences of hospital belt-tightening, with laid-off nurses
rebuffing appeals to return to the bedside and shifting instead to
new administrative jobs with pharmaceutical and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   For several years at least, hospitals warn, the shortage will
worsen. For patients, that could mean waiting longer for a nurse's
intervention, or, in extreme cases, traveling to hospitals farther
from home for acute care. The American Association of Colleges of
Nursing says that its 500 or so member colleges, which produce
nurses with bachelor's and master's degrees, enrolled 5.5 percent
fewer nurses last year than in 1997, the fourth decline in as many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shortage appears to be a new and different type,'' said a
report last month of a survey of 338 acute care hospitals sponsored
by the American Organization of Nurse Executives, a subsidiary of
the American Hospital Association, and conducted in collaboration
with the Department of Health and Human Services and the American
Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous shortages,'' the report said, ``have been about
sufficient numbers of nurses, while this shortage appears to be
about an increased demand for nurses with competence, skills and
experience to meet patient demand for care in a changing health
care system.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloras Jones, director of nursing for the California Division
of Kaiser Permanente, the big health maintenance organization that
treats patients in its own hospitals, sees two shortages.
</P>
<P>
   There is a shortage now, Ms. Jones said, arising from a serious
lack of experienced, specialized registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are at the verge of a very serious shortage related to
the aging of the work force,'' she said. The average age of nurses
is 45, about a decade older than the average for the population.
They will be retiring with the baby-boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Of 190,000 working nurses in California, Ms. Jones said, the
state's licensing board found that 57,000, about 30 percent, were
over 50, and that half planned to retire within four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of nurses who are currently practicing are in the
46-to-58 age range,'' said Kathryn Hall, executive director of the
Maryland Nurses Association. ``Add five or ten years, and they'll
be retiring. Then you look back to the 18-to-27 age bracket, and
the numbers are just staggeringly low.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the flow of young people into nursing diminishing,
so is the quality of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a shortage in terms of educational preparation,''
said Arlene Sargent, director of the undergraduate nursing program
at Samuel Merritt College in Oakland, Calif. Jeanne Jenkins, a
spokeswoman for Merritt, said the college has kept enrollments
steady only by dipping deeper into the waiting list for less
qualified applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are seeking women who have left nursing to raise
children, and full-time nurses, who can be lured into extra
part-time assignments with wages of $30 or more an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Rowe, 33, has bachelor's and master's degrees in nursing
from Rutgers University. She is a full-time nurse in the intensive
care unit at Cooper Hospital in Camden, N.J., and is paid $20.80 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   It can be arduous work. Cooper has maintained its customary
staff of nine registered nurses each shift for the unit's 16 beds,
but to shave costs, Cooper has eliminated all but one of three to
four aides, so nurses take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Rowe and many nurses, full-time is a three-day week of
12-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So then I moonlight,'' Ms. Rowe said, through an agency called
Favorite Nurses. One day a week, the agency dispatches her to
another hospital. ``I get $30 an hour days, $36 nights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing journals and newspapers are awash with advertisements
for nurses like Ms. Rowe. ``R.N.'s'' shouts an employment agency's
advertisement for a Washington, D.C., hospital. ``Big Bonus
Bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A hospital in Colorado Springs, Colo., promises $1,000 bonuses
to local nurses it hires, $2,000 to other Coloradans and $5,000 to
nurses from other states. Like many hospitals, St. Francis Hospital
in Memphis, Tenn., is advertising $1,000 bounties to employees who
lure friends to its nursing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Nursefinders, a temporary help agency with 119 offices in 36
states, has 8,000 nurses in hospitals, but the company cannot keep
up with the demand. ``We're filling half the orders we receive,''
said Neal Ostman, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are going to new lengths to keep nurses, especially
those with young children. Dawn Murphy, director of human resources
at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., said that to retain
part-time nurses, the hospital has cut to 16 from 20 the hours they
must work to earn health and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's is also dispatching recruiters to Canada, so far with
little success. Lots of luck, said Deborah Moores, managing
director of Medhunters, a Toronto company that places nurses with
American and Canadian hospitals. ``The Province of Ontario wants to
hire 10,000 nurses,'' Ms. Moores said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has been a boon to a growing corps of nomad nurses,
called travelers. Mary Gibson, 59, of no fixed address, became a
registered nurse after raising three children. After a divorce, she
sold her home in Andover, Mass., and 11 years ago loaded a minivan
with her television, VCR, linens, dishes, pots and pans, family
photographs and stethoscope, and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   This winter Ms. Gibson is parked at a hospital in Cape Coral,
Fla., where she works three 12-hour shifts a week on a
post-operative neurosurgery floor. She has also worked in Seattle;
Phoenix; Albuquerque, N.M.; Boston; Fontana, Calif.; Washington,
D.C., and Fall River, Mass. Where next? ``It's way too soon to
think about that,'' Ms. Gibson said. ``I'll be here to mid-June.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson's actual employer is TravCorps of Malden, Mass.,
which says it has 1,300 travelers, nearly all nurses, working three
to six-month stints at understaffed hospitals. The company provides
Ms. Gibson's benefits, apartments, utilities and travel expenses,
and her wage of $20 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals that hire travelers say they are constrained by the
exigencies of managed care _ the cuts in reimbursements they
receive from Medicare, insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations. So among other cost-cutting measures, they have
eliminated the cushion of nurses that let them respond to surges in
demand for care, like flu epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, the patient services executive at St. Mary's, which
has 347 beds, keeps a permanent staff to accommodate its average of
150 patients. That staff alone is hard to maintain, so she has
added some travelers. When the number of patients exceeds 150, she
plumbs her list of 30 or 40 ``per diems'' _ free-agent nurses,
usually with other regular jobs, who can come in for a shift.
</P>
<P>
   But all the bonuses and recruiting have done little to break the
shortage. During the last shortage, a decade ago, ``employers were
able to throw dollars at it, and the nurses appeared,'' said Ms.
Hall of the Maryland Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many had left the profession but were still out there,'' Ms.
Hall said. ``Now the majority are working, so bonuses are just
luring nurses from hospital to hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools of nursing detect a big change from the days, four or
five years ago, when hospitals were laying off nurses in response
to the cost-cutting pressures of managed care and urging the
schools to cut back enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   After a long hiatus, said Mary Blegen, associate dean for
academic affairs at the University of Iowa's nursing school,
``Recruiters are coming in from all over the country, and they're
talking about sign-on bonuses.''

CRUNCH COMING FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>

By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might seem strange, considering his team is two games under
.500, but Bill Scott believes UCLA will make a push for the NCAA
baseball playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, the former Alemany High standout who has become the
Bruins' top power threat, said he hasn't changed his June plans
despite UCLA's 15-17 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned my classes around going to the (College) World
Series,'' Scott said. ``I'm not giving up and I don't think anyone
else is.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA begins the second half of its season Friday with a
three-game series at defending Pac-10 champion Washington. It's the
first of eight consecutive road games for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The season) has become hard on us,'' Scott said. ``I don't
understand it. We're looking for reasons why. I guess it's a matter
of getting everything going at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who was a 24th-round draft choice by Atlanta in 1997, has
been a bright spot. After starting just 16 games last year as a
freshman, he leads the team with eight homers and 39 RBI to go
along with a .356 batting average. Imagine what kind of a season
Scott would be having if he hadn't started slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played some bad teams and I was going 0 for 4,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott batted .615 with 10 homers as a senior at Alemany and was
also recruited by Stanford, Pepperdine and Miami. After appearing
in just 27 games last year, primarily as the designated hitter,
Scott concentrated on his defensive skills in the California
Coastal League over the summer. He has two errors and three assists
in 48 chances this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have a spot last year,'' he said. ``I wasn't
used to sitting on the bench. I wish I could have played the whole
season, but I learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bringing the heat: Arizona State won 41 games last year and
advanced to the College World Series championship game. Jay Gehrke
was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke had been a bust at ASU; he opened the season as the Sun
Devils' No. 3 starting pitcher but was sent to the bullpen after a
few bad outings. Gehrke made up his mind he was going to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's loss became Pepperdine's gain.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke, a 6-foot-6, 225-pound junior right-hander, has become
one of the nation's top closers with the Waves. He broke the school
record for saves (12) on Saturday and hasn't given up an earned run
in 17 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted an opportunity to pitch,'' Gehrke said after
closing out a 7-6 win over UCLA last week. ``I have someone who
believes in me and gives me the ball every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for teammates to notice what they had in
Gehrke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws hard and he throws strikes,'' said third baseman
G.J. Raymundo.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke's sophomore season consisted of just five games. He was
2-1 with a team-worst 7.36 ERA. Gehrke said it was a mutual
decision with the Sun Devils coaches that he not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't fit in (at ASU),'' he said. ``I wasn't really
comfortable. I had a couple of bad starts, then I didn't pitch at
all. . . . (The transfer) benefited me and them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehrke's fastball was clocked in the low 90s against UCLA. He
has 19 strikeouts and only six walks in 161/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing gas,'' said UCLA's Scott. ``We definitely had
to make an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball America named Gehrke the West Coast Conference's No. 3
professional prospect before the season; about 10 scouts watched
him pitch last week. Not bad for a kid who grew up in Fargo, N.D.,
where he didn't get a chance to play high school baseball until he
was a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was inexperienced when I got to ASU,'' said Gehrke, who also
played basketball and hockey in high school. ``Baseball wasn't my
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking a chance: Justin Lehr wasn't happy at UC Santa Barbara
because he wanted to become a full-time pitcher. He was a
second-team All-Big West catcher as a junior with the Gauchos last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr knew he would only get one season to impress professional
scouts with his pitching ability, so he transferred to defending
national champion USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely have to have the confidence to make a change
like that,'' Lehr said. ``I don't think there was a doubt in my
mind that I would pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, a right-hander, won his second consecutive game Sunday in
the Trojans' 8-5 win over Arizona. He has pitched well against the
Pac-10, with a 2.76 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 161/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a one-year deal for me,'' Lehr said. ``But I think
the change is completely positive.''
</P>
<P>
   __ That's good: Statistically, Pepperdine is just as good as its
Top 10 national ranking and 23-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves are batting .326 as a team and opponents are hitting
just .242. The staff ERA is 3.56 and features a pair of pitchers
who are 5-0, Brad Tucker and Dave Reed. Freshman left fielder Woody
Cliffords (El Camino Real) is fourth on the team in batting average
(.384).

L.A. COUNTY HOME BUYERS RANK LONG BEACH AS TOP CHOICE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beverly Hills has ZIP code cachet. Santa Clarita
offers tract after tract of new homes with vistas of rolling,
brush-covered hills. So where would new home buyers in Los Angeles
County prefer to put down roots?
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa by the Sea. Really, no joke.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive year, Long Beach is considered the
most desired locale in Los Angeles County for new home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita, fast become the in spot for maturing Generation
Xers, ranked second in the survey by The Meyers Group Consulting
Services LLC, an Irvine-based real estate consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is based on eight factors such as jobs, crime rate,
attractions and housing affordability, plus Meyers' own subjective
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach got great marks in just about every area except crime
and things to do, even thought the city has a new aquarium. Its
crime ranking, based on statistics from the FBI, was the highest in
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita, on the other hand, got the best crime ranking.
But there isn't much to do there, either, except enjoy the safe
streets. That is, assuming you can afford to buy a house there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare (Long Beach) with the ability to buy a home
at a reasonable price, where else would you rather go?'' said John
Burns, Meyers' senior managing director.
</P>
<P>
   This is how cities cities in Los Angeles County stack up as the
preferred address for new home buyers. The numbers reflect total
rankings in eight categories, with lower numbers best:
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach 22

 &HT;    On big issues, Bush takes a seatBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As his audience widens, Gov. George W. Bush
remains a presidential contender with a penchant for dancing around
the soft edges of hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   On topics like affirmative action, hate crime legislation and
making abortion a litmus test for U.S. Supreme Court nominees, Bush
is less than perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these issues _ ones that can quickly define a candidate
for a nationwide electorate looking for signals _ came up at a
Monday news conference after a Bush speech to the Texas Daily
Newspaper Association.
</P>
<P>
   On affirmative action, Bush declined to serve up a clear stance
on whether race, ethnicity and gender should play a role in
decisions concerning college admissions and awarding of state
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am for is called affirmative access. For example, I
signed the law that said if you end up in the top 10 percent of
your class that you are automatically admitted to state
universities as part of affirmative access,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That program, approved by the 1997 Legislature, has yet to
produce the results envisioned by those who saw it as a way to
attract minority students after courts struck down affirmative
action policies that gave an edge to minority students.
</P>
<P>
   On state contracts, Bush said he is ``for policies that will
encourage small-business growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm against is quotas. I'm against hard quotas, quotas
that basically delineate based upon whatever. However they
delineate, quotas, I think, vulcanize society,'' he said. ``So I
don't know how that fits into what everybody is saying, their
relative positions. But that's my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically if race, ethnicity or gender should be
factors in contract decisions, Bush replied: ``I support goals. I
think it is important to have goals. But the main goal is how do we
foster entrepreneurship. And how do we foster growth of small
business.''
</P>
<P>
   On current legislative efforts to increase penalties for hate
crimes: ``I've always said all crime is hate,'' he said,
discounting the possibility that some thief, somewhere, might be
driven by something else, perhaps hunger, greed or passion.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing hate crimes, Bush always notes that John William
King of Jasper, convicted in the dragging death of James Byrd Jr.,
was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a more harsh penalty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But King was eligible for the death penalty only because
prosecutors were able to prove he was killed during a kidnapping.
Without that finding, the racial hatred motive would not have been
sufficient to bump the crime to capital level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll deal with the bills when they make it to my desk,'' he
said. ``This is what happens during every legislative session.
Halfway through I'm asked to make comments on hypotheticals. Let's
see what the bills look like when they make it to my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if criminal penalties should be enhanced if hate toward a
specific group is the motive, Bush said, ``How do you determine
hate? That's what someone needs to explain to me, not in a press
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Bush declined to say he would use the issue as a
litmus test in making appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a president's philosophy should be a key factor in
making appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy was a driving variable when I made the decision
on the four (Texas) Supreme Court judges I named,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he would appoint only anti-abortion rights
justices to the U.S. Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   ``My criterion is going to be as to whether or not people will
use the bench to interpret the Constitution or write the laws,'' he
said. ``I believe in strict constructionism when it comes to the
Constitution of the United States and for the federal bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he appoint a judge who, perhaps in a previous life as a
politician, had taken a position on abortion not totally consistent
with his?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided if I'm running for president of the United
States yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He may or may not have, but groups involved in the abortion
fight have declared him in the race and fair game. Though Bush
believes his position is perfectly clear, it has drawn criticism
from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes abortion should be illegal except in cases
involving rape, incest or the life of the mother. But he sees
little chance of making that the law of the land anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion
rights organization, has decided Bush's position entitles him to
the ``pro-life'' label he hangs on himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Life League, another anti-abortion rights group
based in Washington, said Bush ``abdicated his right to be
described as a pro-life'' because ``he apparently does not see the
child at fertilization as a member of the human family who deserves
total protection under the law and within the context of our social
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, Bush is taking on-air shots this week from
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL Director Kate Michelman said her group will run TV ads in
Iowa and New Hampshire to show that Bush and Elizabeth Dole oppose
``a woman's right to choose . . . . but they both know they must
communicate more moderate views in order to be elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush, ``I don't expect to get everybody's vote should I
decide to run for president.''

OIL EXECUTIVES WORK THE ROOM AT OPEC MEETING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The Libyan oil minister's senior bodyguard
kept a stern vigil outside his boss' 12th-floor suite at the Hotel
Intercontinental on Monday, but not to protect him from terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, his mission was to ensure the privacy of meetings among
the minister, Abdallah Salim al-Badri, and American oil executives
who were discreetly slipping in and out. The Americans did not want
to attract attention that could be picked up in Washington, where
contacts with Libya are officially discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Such clandestine meetings are not uncommon surrounding important
meetings of the 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, such as the one that begins on Tuesday. Scores of oil
company executives and industry analysts are drawn to Vienna,
OPEC's headquarters, hoping for an audience with an oil minister.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city famed for its discretion, secret banking and
effective security, a place where American oil executives can see
Libyans, Iranians and Iraqis without stirring the ire of Washington
for skirting sanctions imposed on those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else are you going to see all these people gathered in
one place where you can further your commercial goals, don't have
to worry about traveling to difficult places like Libya, Iraq or
Iran and do it discreetly?'' asked Nordine Ait-Laoussine, Algeria's
former oil minister, now a prominent consultant who brokers such
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the time and trouble may be worth the effort. There
is hope here that the protracted decline of oil prices is coming to
an end. OPEC is on the verge of cutting its production deeply to
push up prices. The worst of the Asian crisis appears to be over,
which could stimulate demand for oil.
</P>
<P>
   There are other, politically sensitive reasons for American oil
industry emissaries to take a particular interest in this gathering
_ changes among three renegade members that suggest doing business
with them may soon be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq already is selling oil again under U.N. guidelines. U.S.
relations with Iran have shown signs of a thaw. And there is even a
crack in the ice with Libya, which made overtures last week to ease
its isolation by agreeing to relinquish suspects wanted for trial
in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has got to keep the contact with these huge oil
producers when these sanctions come off. The Americans don't know
why they are doing what they've done and how to undo it,'' said
Oscar Whyatt, former chairman of the Coastal Corp., a large U.S.
energy company. Whyatt is known for his contacts with some of the
world's most frowned-upon oil producers, including a famous visit
in 1990 with Iraq's Saddam Hussein to persuade him to release
hostages then held by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot come out of this world without any friends,'' Whyatt
said Monday as two assistants waited to accompany him to a
minister's rendezvous. He would not say whom he had met, but others
said he saw both the Libyan and Iraqi oil ministers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official from Chevron Corp., fresh out of talks with
Iraqi oil officials, confirmed the notion of talks now, business
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the United Nations and American sanctions, we can
talk. We don't sign on any deals, but we can talk,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are signing deals with Iraq, so are the French,''
he added. ``We are behind. We should be ready, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi oil already makes its way to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iraqis have refrained from selling oil directly to U.S.
companies to make a political point, they sell their oil for food
to the French and Russians, who make a profit by reselling it to
U.S. companies. Robin D'Alessandro, an oil trader with Vitol, a
large international commodities firm, said she bought Iraqi oil
through Russian intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   American oil industry representatives are not the only outsiders
who come to the such OPEC meetings. It is also important for oil
industry analysts like Gary Ross to be here. He is president of a
New York-based consulting firm, Petroleum Industry Research
Associates, and he sells advice to oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   As he came over Monday afternoon to shake hands with Prince
Salman, the deputy oil minister of Saudi Arabia in the lobby of the
ANA hotel, Ross was mindful of the importance of such connections.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting usually follows such handshakes and the knowledge
acquired in that meeting translates into money and retainers. Asked
if it was worth traveling from New York for this, Ross himself
asked: ``What do you think?''

U.S. ENVOY HEADS LAST-DITCH EFFORT ON KOSOVO

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under orders not to let Serbia delay NATO
action while Kosovo burns, an American diplomat struggled early
Tuesday to negotiate at least a cease-fire. American officials said
that talks were expected to continue into the day.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, met with President
Slobodan Milosevic for more than three hours in a last-ditch effort
to resolve the crisis and forestall NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke then returned to the American Embassy for nearly three
hours of consultations with Washington and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is engaged in a large offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Kosovo, and Washington and the West said that if
he does not agree to a NATO-led force to monitor a peace settlement
in the province, NATO will bomb Serb military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have already destroyed three of the KLA's seven
regional headquarters, a senior NATO official said Tuesday, adding
urgency to the Holbrooke mission. Milosevic has been told by his
generals, the official said, that Yugoslav troops could complete
their sweep by Friday, destroying the KLA's command and control.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission here ``is a last-ditch effort and it's got
to be quick,'' the official said. ``We want a quick determination
from Holbrooke about whether we're at the end of the process or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO have presented the talks as a final chance
for Milosevic to avoid severe military punishment; Milosevic, while
sounding tough, typically waits until the last moment to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, as Holbrooke was meeting with Milosevic,
President Clinton warned that military action could be imminent.
``If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over peace,
then NATO's military plans must go forward,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 30,000 more ethnic Albanians have been displaced
from their homes over the last few days, and said: ``We cannot
allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with
impunity,'' adding that America's security interests must include
``Europe's freedom and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
ceasefire, there was little point in talking further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke
with fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo, and we
end up with both a diplomatic failure and a military fait
accompli,'' the senior NATO official said. ``Milosevic has already
had a three-day head start.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's comment that
air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and said: ``Some allies
feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be designed to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serb military targets involved in prosecuting the war
against the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the KLA's air force,
which Western officials had said was not their goal, the official
said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done, have signed the peace
agreement. So we have a bit of a moral obligation to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb offensive followed immediately upon the sudden
withdrawal on Saturday of the some 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Asked if their
rapid removal from the province was not an invitation to Milosevic
to attack, the official said that many NATO members had been
pressing for air strikes to begin immediately, with no final
Holbrooke mission.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns with NATO, especially from the Italians, who
are a part of the contact group, combined with criticism from
within the American Congress, argued for longer consultations and a
last chance for Milosevic to change his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb military campaign of the last few days has also served
to harden solidarity within NATO about the need for air strikes,
and has allowed the Americans to push for a more intensive set of
strikes. Washington argued that initial cruise missile strikes
intended to destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defense should
be followed _ without pause for Belgrade's reflection _ by
intensive fighter and bomber attacks on Serb military positions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans said, Milosevic would succeed in his
aims to damage the KLA while NATO appeared to be standing by. That
new discussion within NATO required further time, the officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO will be blamed,'' the official said, ``it will be
blamed for delay, not for impetuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only Tuesday that NATO countries gave Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to order expanded air strikes on ``a
much more diverse target list, a much more intensive pace of
operations and an expanded geographical zone,'' a NATO official
told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said NATO was urging Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas to refrain from ``murder and bombing'' _ like the ambush
of four Serb policemen in downtown Pristina Sunday night _ that
would justify further Serb attacks. There were two more bomb
attacks on bars in Pristina, with at least one dead and eight
wounded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Serb president
met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks on Kosovo,
American Christopher Hill, EU representative Wolfgang Petritsch and
Russian Boris Mayorsky. The meeting, which the three diplomats and
Holbrooke had agreed would be limited to a discussion of the
political side of the Kosovo agreement, did not go well, said
officials at the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional and lively,'' Petritsch said. They wanted to
give Milosevic an accurate account of the political arrangements,
fearing that he had misinformation. When Milosevic called the
Albanians ``terrorists and separatists,'' Petritsch said: ``Well,
after they signed the agreement, you can only call them Albanian
autonomists.'' The agreement calls for effective self-rule in
Kosovo, but the province will remain a sovereign part of Serbia and
Yugoslavia for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Holbrooke's turn, and he concentrated on the damage
NATO was about to do to Milosevic's army and regime if Belgrade's
position did not change and the offensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Brussels, after talks with NATO leaders and the
British, French and German foreign ministers, Holbrooke said: ``We
are not _ and I cannot stress this too highly _ going to get into a
talk-while-fighting-intensifies situation in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO is ``on the brink'' of military action. ``It
is not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Solana said: ``We think that this is the moment of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is being careful not to claim that the goal of any
bombing is to force Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
Instead, NATO officials are insisting that the only goal of air
strikes is to ``degrade'' Serbia's military ability to inflict harm
on the KLA and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the human tragedy that provides NATO its legal
justification to bomb a sovereign country, especially in the
absence of any United Nations Security Council resolution
authorizing military action.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials kept up a defensive, wounded tone, and called in
Western ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry to protest the
possibility of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, said Serbs were ready
to defend themselves if the West tried to impose a solution in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want war,'' he told the Greek newspaper Ethnos. ``We
are seeking a peaceful resolution. But if someone attacks us, or if
someone imposes, then of course we will fight for our homeland.''

 &HT;    Big Band Hall of Fame swings open
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With the sun ablaze in the sky and
Sinatra resounding in the air, Sally Bennett's 32-year quest to
establish a home for the Big Band Hall of Fame came to a happy
conclusion Monday afternoon: South Florida's newest museum opened
its doors to the delight of hundreds of swing-loving well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   The museum occupies the first floor of a historic downtown
building where Palm Beach Community College began offering classes
in 1933. Thanks to a $1.9 million renovation, paid for by the
college, it's now home to such priceless bits of memorabilia as
Harry James' trumpet, Buddy Rich's snare drum, and Count Basie's
cap. To say nothing of a mirrored ball that once hung in Chicago's
famed Aragon Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel vindicated,'' said Bennett, who started the
organization in Cleveland in 1967, then moved it to Palm Beach
County in 1981. ``A lot of people didn't believe I had all these
artifacts.''
</P>
<P>
   By Bennett's own admission, the museum is small in scope:
Through photos, sheet music and assorted mementos, panels outline
the skeletal history of the big-band era, from the music's early
connections to jazz to the emergence of ``sweet'' bands to the
final heyday with the arrival of television. Other displays honor
the dozens of hall inductees.
</P>
<P>
   There's also ample space given to Bennett's efforts to establish
the hall as well as a wall of fame featuring a portrait of Bennett
and photos of her with big-band legends.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett makes no apologies for what's there, save for noting the
fact that the exhibits still need to be better labeled and a
``listening station,'' featuring more than 500 recordings, is
awaiting installation. Instead, she sees the museum as something to
build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I established the concept,'' Bennett said. ``The Country Music
Hall of Fame started out in a room no bigger than a chicken coop.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on hand seemed thrilled to have a chance to remember the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a terrific boot out of the thing,'' said Palm
Beach resident Philip Kamler, a tenor saxophonist turned bicycle
manufacturing executive. Now retired, he recalls the days when he
played ``with lots of bands'' in New York, making the union minimum
of $8 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to these guys playing rock music today. All they are
is a bunch of Johnny One-Notes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the low-key nature of the museum, Monday's ceremony
was a study in simplicity. A few congratulatory telegrams _ from
Bob Hope, Steve Allen and Jupiter Island resident Perry Como _ were
read. A few brief speeches were given. And then Bennett cut a big
red ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was music as well. A trio dubbed the Swing
Sisters sang a couple of Andrew Sisters favorites. And baritone Bob
Hoose crooned some Sinatra classics _ and added a thought of his
own between songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's neat is Ohio has the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame, and now West Palm Beach has the Big Band Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>

Fla.

SUCCESS OF `RUGRATS' COULD BE BEGINNING OF RICH FRANCHISE FOR
NICKELODEON
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ ``Rugrats: The Movie'' has became the first
non-Disney animated movie to take in $100 million in domestic
ticket receipts, becoming the 13th member of an elite and extremely
profitable club.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount, which released the $25 million Klasky/Csupo
production in November, announced Monday that ``Rugrats'' had
grossed $328,545 at 403 theaters over the weekend to go past $100.1
million after 122 days in release. What it means is the 8-year-old
Nickelodeon cable show has established itself as an ongoing
money-maker for parent Viacom Inc. through sequels, toys, videos
and theatrical productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its tremendous performance at the box office has launched a
new movie franchise which thoroughly complements the highly
successful Nickelodeon TV series,'' said Paramount distribution
chief Wayne Lewellen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the cable show draws 24 million viewers weekly, the
movie's prospects were uncertain because the style represented a
departure from classic Disney animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very gratified that there's acceptance for alternative
animation,'' said Albie Hecht, president of Nickelodeon Film and TV
Entertainment. ``We've taken a very contemporary approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats'' begins its foreign roll-out this week. ``I'm bullish
about overseas because it's a very universal movie,'' Hecht said.
``The Rugrats already speak 17 languages on the TV shows. Everyone
sees themselves in the Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats'' is the most successful of challenges to Disney's
status as king of animation, where each domestic box office dollar
represents as much as $4 of profit once the ancillary products are
factored in. Just in the last half-year, DreamWorks' ``Antz'' and
``Prince of Egypt'' have generated combined grosses of close to
$190 million, but Warner Bros. stumbled with ``The King and I,''
taking only $4 million on its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon is at work on a pair of animated projects _ a
``Rugrats'' sequel expected to be released November 2000 and the
fantasy-adventure ``Bone,'' due in 2001. It employs more than 300
animators working at its Nickelodeon animation studio in Burbank on
five TV series and movie projects.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, in a speech to Wall Street
analysts last month, stressed the value of the Nickelodeon brand
and pledged the division would release one animated movie per year
starting in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for us because we don't really have a house
style so we re-invent ourselves every time out,'' Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom investor Marvin Roffman, principal of Roffman Miller
Associates of Philadelphia, endorsed the commitment to animation.
``There's tremendous potential to create a franchise that
translates all over the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Disney has high hopes for its animated ``Tarzan,''
due June 18. Its last project, ``A Bug's Life,'' performed in line
with expectations with U.S. grosses near $160 million.

CONVERSE TELLS RODMAN HE'S OUT OF THE GAME
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Converse Inc. has told Dennis Rodman the buzzer has sounded.
Their game is over.
</P>
<P>
   After a continuing series of untoward events involving the
forward for the National Basketball Association's Los Angeles
Lakers, the North Reading, Mass., company has quietly ended his $15
million endorsement deal.
</P>
<P>
   Converse informed Rodman last week that it is exercising an exit
clause built into his contract about a year before it expires,
according to sources within the company and others close to Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Rodman, who believes Converse still owes him
about $3 million, has vowed to fight the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to use Rodman's obvious visibility to
increase the numbers in the basketball shoe area _ where sales are
flat industry-wide _ to try to solidify the core business while
expanding into fashion and performance sneakers,'' said Gregg
Hartly, executive director of the Sporting Goods Manufacturing
Association. ``It didn't work. Dennis was always in the spotlight
more for his personality problems than what he did on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Converse lagged behind its major competitors Adidas,
Nike, and Reebok in market share and in marketing punch, with no
marquee basketball player to endorse its shoes. When it began the
year by announcing it had lured Rodman away from Nike _ Technicolor
hair, tattoos, body piercing, unpredictable personality and all _
Converse engendered widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Just before signing with Converse, Rodman had kicked a
photographer during a nationally broadcast game. The NBA suspended
him for the attack; Eastman Kodak and Carl Jr.'s, a West Coast
hamburger chain, pulled television ads featuring him.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, senior vice president of marketing James E.
Solomon sought to deflect the cameraman-kicking incident by
describing Rodman as ``an inherently good individual who has a
strong competitive spirit and a good work ethic.'' But Monday
Solomon was said to be in a meeting, and he did not return
telephone calls. That left Kellie A. Buckley, senior public
relations manager, to face the questions. ``I'm not in a position
to shed any light on this,'' Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   During a national broadcast Sunday, NBC's courtside reporter,
Jim Gray, said Converse ``terminated that contract due to breach of
contract involving terms of behavior, number of games played, and
not having a deal in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts wondered from the beginning whether Rodman's
unpredictability would hurt Converse more than not having a major
NBA endorser. Then, on July 15, 1997, just seven months into the
deal, Converse's shares fell 5.9 percent in heavy trading.
Investors were said to be concerned that the demand for Rodman's
shoe, the All-Star '99, was more than 10 percent lower than the
company and industry observers had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company's numbers have worsened. Converse _ the pioneer in
basketball sneakers with its trademark hightops, the Chuck Taylor
All Star _ dropped from fifth in market share in the United States
in 1997 to seventh last year. This month, Converse reported
revenues declined by 31.5 percent from $450.2 million in 1997 to
$308.4 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales of Rodman's shoes were never what they wanted, and
the fact is now that very few athletes are doing anything these
days to sell shoes _ let alone Dennis Rodman,'' said Bob Williams,
president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Converse closed at 3 3/8, down 1/8. In the last year, it
has lost more than half its value.

SHARPTON'S STATURE ENHANCED IN RESPONSE TO POLICE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was ``Lawyers Day'' Monday, with about 70 lawyers
and an equal number of publishers, officials, and ordinary folks _
lined up outside New York Police Department headquarters to get
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee are slated to get cuffed
Tuesday. Wednesday is ``Labor Leaders Day,'' with Dennis Rivera and
a caravan of his hospital-union workers waiting to commit civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The daily procession is the handiwork of the Reverend Al
Sharpton, whose racial protests of the past have stirred much
controversy. But this time, his cause is so lauded, his tactics
have been so skillful, and his opponents have reacted so
gracelessly, that Sharpton stands on the verge of fulfilling his
longstanding dream _ to become the preeminent black leader of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the protest is the Feb. 4 killing of Amadou Diallo,
an unarmed African immigrant who was shot 41 times by four police
officers while standing on the porch of his own apartment house in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officers said afterward they thought Diallo had a gun, but
the excess of their action has touched off protests against police
abuse generally, especially in minority neighborhoods, where
officers _ many of them white and from the suburbs _ routinely
frisk anyone engaged in ``suspicious'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a grand jury investigating the incident, three
separate probes have been launched _ by Attorney General Janet
Reno, US Attorney Mary Jo White, and New York State Attorney
General Elliot Spitzer _ into whether the department's practices
betray a pattern of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The probes seem to have broadened the appeal of Sharpton's
protests.
</P>
<P>
   At least two-thirds of the lawyers arrested here Monday were
white _ the first time in 10 days of protests when white people
have numbered more than a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jewish groups _ long wary of Sharpton, suspecting him or
his followers of anti-Semitism _ are joining in. The conservative
American Jewish Committee last week echoed Sharpton's call for more
diversity in the police force and ``zero tolerance for police
abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The more liberal Jews for Racial and Economic Justice is urging
its 900 members to join Sharpton's protest Wednesday. Its director,
Cindy Greenberg, expects 40 or 50 Jews to show up and get arrested,
including a dozen rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected we'd work with Al Sharpton,'' Greenberg said
Monday, ``but he's shown great leadership on this issue. We've been
exceedingly impressed. I suspect we might form coalitions on other
issues in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, asked Monday how much longer he can sustain these
demonstrations, replied, ``As long as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has accused the protest organizers of
having purely political motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about the police,'' one aide said Monday. ``It's
more about Rudy the Republican governing the city better than his
predecessors ever wished they could have _ and they're angry about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   City Hall is especially galled that Giuliani's predecessor,
David Dinkins, had himself arrested last week _ since there were
nearly twice as many police shootings under his regime (212 in 1993
compared with 111 last year), and far more incidents of violent
crime.
</P>
<P>
   However, even some of Giuliani's supporters say the mayor could
have done more to contain the political outrage over the Diallo
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Days passed before Giuliani expressed much more than ``regret''
over the shooting. Police commissioner Howard Safir even went off
to a conference in Los Angeles shortly after the shooting _ which
Giuliani said he approved, since there was ``no crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir worsened perceptions this past weekend by going back to
Los Angeles, on the eve of City Council hearings on police
brutality, to attend the Academy Awards _ though he did show up at
the 9 a.m. hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani has denounced the protests as ``silly'' and
a ``publicity stunt'' _ which has only strengthened the protesters'
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have done so many little things to look better on
this,'' one business leader, who generally supports Giuliani, said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides insist the mayor did plenty. He postponed a
political trip to Texas. He worked with the State Department to
bring Diallo's parents from overseas, tried to meet with them when
they finally arrived, waited an hour for them in their hotel lobby,
but was turned away _ probably, City Hall suspects, at Sharpton's
urging.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton denies having anything to do with their spurning.
However, it is clear that, unlike last year's police horror _ when
the mayor promptly condemned the police torture of Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima _ Giuliani's initial inaction on Diallo
allowed Sharpton to step in and control the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, Sharpton tapped into his network of activists and
loyalists. A few thousand people attended rallies outside Diallo's
apartment, on Wall Street, at the US courthouse plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the brilliant, sustainable stroke, inspired by
civil-rights movements going back to Martin Luther King and beyond
_ the sit-in. Anyone who had ever been harassed by police or who
simply held a grudge against Giuliani _ and the numbers of both
groups are legion _ could play an active role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hardly had to call anybody to come out here,'' Sharpton
said. ``Everybody's been calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the '60s sit-ins in the South, late-'90s protesters
in New York don't have to worry about getting their heads bashed
in.
</P>
<P>
   Civil disobedience here is professionalized, on both sides of
the stand-off. Every day, at 11:30 a.m., those who want to be
arrested line up at One Police Plaza and walk through a corridor
that officers have created with barricades. They sit down at the
building's entrance, chanting slogans (``No justice, no peace'')
and singing songs (``We shall overcome''). An officer tells them
they are violating the law and orders them to move. A few other
officers lock their hands in plastic cuffs, and lead them into the
building. They are transported to a precinct a few blocks away,
booked, given a summons to appear in court, and released.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's aides even collect the protesters' names and give
them to the police ahead of time, to expedite the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, so many people wanted to be arrested, they had to be
divided into two waves. Meanwhile, 200 others marched in a circle
toward the rear of the plaza. At 12:45, Sharpton made a speech,
announced which prominent people will be marching the next few
days, told everybody to disband peacefully, and the demonstration
broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said the protests will continue until the four officers
who shot Diallo are arrested. The grand jury is expected to hand
down indictments in a week or so. The officers have not yet
testified, and their lawyers are encouraging them not to do so.

NEWS ANALYSIS: AMERICAN ENVOY HAS LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>

(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the times that Richard Holbrooke, the
Clinton administration's envoy, has negotiated with the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the room for maneuvering has probably
never been so restricted and the options so unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after President Clinton announced that Milosevic had
gone over ``the threshold,'' Holbrooke was negotiating to avert
NATO air strikes that Washington finds itself on the point of
ordering, but which administration officials acknowledge is not
their favored option.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Serbian forces march across Kosovo, torching
villages, sending refugees fleeing and bringing retaliation from
the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Holbrooke has made it
plain that he cannot remain in Belgrade very long.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Monday that they had set a
rough deadline of 24 hours for Holbrooke to get a cease-fire or
stop negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   It was too embarrassing, they suggested, for Holbrooke to be
talking to Milosevic while his forces were battering ethnic
Albanian civilians, actions that the threatened air strikes are
supposed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if Holbrooke got an immediate cease-fire from Milosevic,
he then had to pretty much restrict his talks to the terms of a
settlement calling for the deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeepers
in Kosovo. The settlement has already been signed by the ethnic
Albanians in Paris. Holbrooke said he try to persuade Milosevic
again that the agreement would benefit the Serbs because it called
for the disarmament of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has surprised Washington with his
tougher-than-expected resistance to NATO troops on Serbian soil. At
talks on Monday morning at NATO headquarters, Holbrooke suggested
there might be a chance to give Milosevic a face-saving device by
calling the troops something else but still retaining NATO control,
said a NATO diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 American troops the administration pledged for
peacekeeping could only participate if they were in a NATO force
with NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Third, if Holbrooke failed to get a cease-fire, the Clinton
administration would be faced with going ahead with NATO air
strikes against Serbia, perhaps as soon as 24 hours after the
envoy's departure from Belgrade, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that Holbrooke leaves Belgrade without an
agreement, he would go first to NATO headquarters in Brussels,
where the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, has the
authority to tell NATO commanders to go ahead with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement on Monday, Clinton said NATO's plans would
continue to move forward. On the eve of a visit to Washington by
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, Clinton also said he
had sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have indicated that they would not mind
if Primakov postponed his visit because of the threatened NATO
strikes, which Russia opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, because of the dramatic surge in Serbian military
action, the administration finds itself confronted with the choice
of air strikes sooner than it anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton said that the Serbs had reached a threshold
of violence that was unacceptable, but he left vague the timing, or
even if, air strikes would be used. It was reasonable,
administration officials argued, after Clinton's statement to send
an emissary to Belgrade to present the peace settlement personally
to Milosevic and urge him one last time to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, 1,400 international monitors, put in place
by an agreement Holbrooke reached with Milosevic last October that
has long since fallen apart, were withdrawn from Kosovo, giving
what turned out to be the opportunity for Milosevic's forces to
strike more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were aware that Milosevic
might take advantage of the vacuum left by the unarmed monitors,
but asserted that the safe departure of the monitors was the
uppermost consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' usefulness had been reduced by threats from
Serbian forces, the officials said. Because the monitors were
unarmed the danger to them had increased dramatically, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the monitoring mission, American Ambassador William
Walker, reluctantly recommended their withdrawal to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday, for safety reasons. The
secretary agreed with him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then called the Norwegian foreign minister, Knut
Vollebaek, who as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, had the authority to make the decision. The
organization, a 54-nation group based in Vienna, served as
overseers of the monitors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers virtually applauded as the monitors left Kosovo
Saturday morning, easing their exit so much that it took only six
hours instead of eight hours for the convoy of cars to make their
way over the Kosovo border and into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   This was the signal, some officials said, that Milosevic was
going to carry out his often voiced threat to start an offensive
that he bragged could finish the Kosovo Liberation Army in five to
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration finds itself getting closer to air
strikes, it also finds itself having to explain more clearly the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invited the top congressional Republicans and
Democrats to the White House on Tuesday morning to overcome
mounting skepticism about the wisdom of an air campaign against a
sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the administration has said that the purpose of the
air strikes would be to ``degrade'' the capability of the Serb
forces. The primary targets of the air campaign would be Serbian
fixed military installations in Serbia and Kosovo, a province of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating on such military targets, the likelihood of
hitting ethnic Albanian civilians, who make up more than 90 percent
of the population in Kosovo, or Serbian civilians, would be
minimized, military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration policy makers acknowledge that bombing
is ``not a good option,'' as one expressed it on Monday. ``It
creates all kinds of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes against Serbian forces would embolden the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that has been fighting for the
past year for the independence of the province.
</P>
<P>
   By strengthening the guerrillas, the bombing would also
strengthen the clamor within Kosovo for independence. Thus, very
quickly, Kosovo could change from being the autonomous region
envisioned in the Paris peace agreement to a quasi-independent
statelet, on the border of Albania and Macedonia where restive
Albanian populations would be eager to redraw their borders.
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of the administration's Kosovo policy has been
that independence of Kosovo is unacceptable. Kosovo should remain,
at least, for the next three years, an autonomous part of Serbia
and not set a precedent for breakaway ethnic groups in Europe, the
administration has argued.

MONICA FRENZY ALIVE AND WELL IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The face, the hair, the way she thanked him for
his interest, every facet of Monica Lewinsky made Mark Carpowich's
hands tremble Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Just seeing her up close was worth the wait, he said. And the
Ph.D. candidate in political science had waited more than eight
hours, since 5:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Carpowich, 25, was first in line at Lewinsky's book signing in
the Century City shopping maze, an event touted as the only US stop
on a book tour that has otherwise kept her overseas. Behind him the
line snaked past Brentano's bookstore, into the parking lot, onto
the sidewalk and around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Academy Awards, it seemed that all of L.A.
wanted a brush with celebrity of a different sort, although more
than a few book buyers had plans to give their copies as gag gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Carpowich gushed
before meeting his crush. ``This isn't a regular celebrity type of
thing. I mean I wouldn't show up for Cindy Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, his voice shaky, he added, ``She was really nice. She
shook my hand. She is so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Lewinsky was expected to scrawl her name in blue
marker almost 1,500 times, the number of copies of ``Monica's
Story'' that Brentano's bookstore reported selling before she
arrived, fashionably late. That extra 45 minutes in line had the
crowd grumbling that she had probably stayed out too late at
``Vanity Fair'' magazine's post-Oscar party.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, wearing a dark blazer over a pale blue top and with
her hair returned to its natural pouf, described the experience of
mixing with so many movie stars as ``bizarre. It was really
surreal.'' Asked whether it was a relief to have the nation's eyes
turned to other newsmakers for a change, she said ``It was
different,'' then smiled, signed the book in front of her and said,
``Thank you for coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, her fans _ some of them sitting in lawn chairs,
others sprawled on the grass, all of them jealously guarding their
spots in line _ described Lewinsky as gracious. Homemaker after
filmmaker, sales clerk after insurance executive also called her
``a part of history'' whose story they could afford for a
discounted $21.25, including tax. Lin Smith, 32, who works in movie
transportation, described the signing as ``just like the one for
Cher or Fergie, you know Sarah Ferguson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these people who are curing all these diseases and
Monica Lewinsky is the one who is going to be remembered,'' said
Kristen Wilcox, a 29-year-old student who left her home in Irvine
at 6:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Added Liberty Leigh, 39, who manages another bookstore, ``I
wanted to meet her and thank her and give her some support, to say,
`Hang in there.' She has shown strength and courage and she still
walks among us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone in line liked Lewinsky. Sir James Brown,
a 22-year-old sales clerk who was second in line, summed up the
attitude of many when he said, ``It was just too weird. How could
you not be here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story's a joke, so I'm giving them as jokes,'' said
Linda Charlan, 40, a Beverly Hills homemaker who had made friends
with the people around her after six hours in line. ``I'm getting
cigars to go along with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hahn, a 28 year old from Hollywood who wants to make
movies, got in line at 10:45 a.m. for Lewinsky's scheduled 12:30
p.m. appearance. The reason: ``I forgot my mom's birthday and want
to make it up to her with something unique.'' To kill time, Hahn
perused ``Terror in 1012,'' the chapter describing how
representatives of independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr questioned
Lewinsky when they first approached her about her relationship with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wehrman, who deals in autographs and other memorabilia,
said he is counting on continued interest in Monica Lewinsky and,
by extension, the story she told to British author Andrew Morton.
Every time he moved forward, he had to nudge along the five boxes
of books he came from New York to buy and have signed. As a crowd
formed to watch the crowd, he said he intends to hawk them on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this is the only book signing in the US so they're
going to be worth something,'' said Wehrman, 32, who paid $900 for
50 copies. ``She's going to be really scarce. I think $800 apiece
is a reasonable figure. I've already had an offer for $1,200.''
</P>
<P>
   With huge initial buildup, and a star turn with ABC's Barbara
Walters, ``Monica's Story'' has sold about 600,000 copies,
according to the publisher, St. Martin's Press, although it has
slipped from the top spot to No.3 on the New York Times best-seller
list. But her publisher insisted that Lewinsky will not attempt to
boost sales by signing books again in her hometown or anywhere else
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a piece of history, just like Marilyn Monroe and John
Kennedy,'' said Manuel Ybarra, 52, who works on an oil rig off Long
Beach when he isn't in line getting books signed by Cher, Dolly
Parton or Monica Lewinsky. ``I had to be here and, from the looks
of it, so did a lot of other people.''

CABLE GIANT COMCAST TO ACQUIRE MEDIAONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comcast Corp. Monday said it will acquire New England's largest
cable television operator, MediaOne Group Inc., combining the
nation's third- and fourth-largest cable companies into a media
giant that can compete against the likes of AT&AMP;T Corp. and Time
Warner Inc. in offering television and telephone service and
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The $55.5 billion deal is the industry's second-biggest merger
ever, slightly smaller than AT&AMP;T's recently completed acquisition
of Tele-Communications Inc. for $59.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new Comcast will have 11 million subscribers in 33 states,
trailing only Time Warner's 12.6 million customers and AT&AMP;T's 12.5
million. In taking over Englewood, Colo.-based MediaOne's
Massachusetts operations, Comcast will become the largest cable
company in the state, with 1.1 million customers. Massachusetts
will become the company's single biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scale is critical, as we are at a point in this industry where
very important public policies are going to be settled as important
technology choices are being made,'' said Charles M. Lillis,
MediaOne's chief executive. ``The new Comcast can be the global
broadband leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast officials said they expect to save as much as $575
million annually by consolidating headquarters and reducing the
combined operation's 34,000-person work force by less than 5
percent. But because Comcast has no operations in Massachusetts, a
spokesman at MediaOne's local operations, based in Chelmsford, said
no layoffs were planned locally and that there are no immediate
plans to alter cable operations or rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been a flurry of deals in the
telecommunications industry as companies have sought to build clout
and customers to offer an expanding number of communications
services, the deal came as something of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was speculation in recent months that MediaOne was in
play to be acquired, but I don't think anyone thought it was
imminent,'' said Douglas S. Shapiro, cable analyst at Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shapiro said, the merger is a good one for both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comcast with MediaOne are clearly now one of the premier cable
players with a very strong balance sheet to do other cable
investments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies generated $8 billion in sales last year,
earning $2.4 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have been growing incrementally. MediaOne has
added 200,000 Massachusetts customers from Time Warner while
Comcast recently added Greater Philadelphia Cablevisions's 79,000
customers and is acquiring controlling interest in several other
cable operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the trading and dealing has changed the whole cable
industry,'' said Bruce Leichtman, director of the Yankee Group's
media and entertainment strategies. ``There are no middle players.
The consolidation is creating three very large companies in
AT&AMP;T-TCI, Time Warner, and now Comcast with MediaOne.''
</P>
<P>
   The big three are also part owners of each other's businesses,
along with a hodgepodge of other assets. Comcast, for example, is
the primary owner of the QVC home shopping network and the E!
Entertainment Television network. It also is a major partner of a
joint venture that owns the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team and
the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne Group, which was created with the acquisition of
Boston-based Continental Cablevision in 1996 by US West Inc., was
spun out from the regional telephone company last June. It owns a
25 percent stake in Time Warner's cable business, 30 percent of
Telewest Communications PLC, the United Kingdom's number two cable
company, and a 50 percent stake in New England Cable News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this combination is very positive,'' said Philip
Balboni, president and founder of New England Cable News. Balboni
said Comcast has about 200,000 cable subscribers in southern
Connecticut who do not have access to NECN now.
</P>
<P>
   Under the merger agreement, MediaOne shareholders will receive
1.1 shares of Comcast stock for each share they hold. The swap is
valued at $80.16 a share, a 17 percent premium over Monday's
MediaOne closing price of 68 1/2. The stock rose 7 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast shares fell 5 3/8 Monday to close at 64 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger is completed, MediaOne stockholders will have a
controlling interest in the combined companies, owning 64 percent
of the equity.
</P>
<P>
   However, Comcast's top management will retain voting control of
the combined companies through separate Class B voting shares.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia-based Comcast is headed by Ralph J. Roberts, who
will remain chairman of the combined company with his son Brian as
president. Lillis, MediaOne's chairman, will become vice chairman
of the combined companies and serve on the Comcast board.
</P>
<P>
   To further ensure the acquisition gets completed, MediaOne is
barred from seeking other offers. However, if it receives and
accepts a higher offer, MediaOne must pay Comcast a $1.5 billion
termination fee.

LOVE AFFAIR WITH HER JOB COST RELIEF WORKER HER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMNER, Wash. _ Deena Umbarger never planned on a career in
social work that would take her to far-off and sometimes dangerous
places.
</P>
<P>
   But the 35-year-old relief worker was shot to death Saturday as
she sat at a tea house near the spot where the border between Kenya
and Somalia meets the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Sumner High School and the University of
Washington, Umbarger had a legal career in mind. She obtained a law
degree from Yale, which pretty much assured her of success in that
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger quickly became disenchanted with the law while
traveling from one end of the country to the other, helping set up
health maintenance organizations and other medical groups. She
decided to try something else.
</P>
<P>
   While still making up her mind on what she wanted to do, a
friend from Seattle suggested she find temporary employment with
the United Methodist Committee on Relief, the disaster relief arm
of the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries. That's where
the friend worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A job is a job,'' Maryann Workman, the slain relief worker's
mother, said Monday at the family home in Sumner. ``She took that
job until she had time to decide what she wanted to do. And she
fell in love with the work.''
</P>
<P>
   That was back in 1997. The love affair with her job was to cost
Umbarger her life.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger was shot to death while having tea with town elders
from the tiny community of Kiumigio on the border of Kenya and
Somalia. A lone gunman broke into the meeting and opened fire on
the participants.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the shooting is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger had worked for the United Methodist Committee on Relief
only about three months when she asked for an overseas assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The agency initially sent her to Kenya, but later transferred
her to the Republic of Georgia, a part of the former Soviet Union.
She had been a project manager in Kenya and was finance officer for
the agency in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger asked her agency, which feeds refugees and has peace
and reconciliation programs in Kenya, to send her back to that
African nation. ``She loved Africa,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger knew she was going back to a politically unsettled area
and had some concerns about her safety, Workman said. But Umbarger
thought she would be safe in Kenya, where she had an apartment in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kenya there is not too much fear for safety,'' her mother
said. ``But when you get to Somalia, everyone is packing guns and
it is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has been a site of armed conflict for more than a decade
and arms pass back and forth over the border area frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger was helping develop agricultural projects for the area
when she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Methodist relief officials said they are still awaiting more
details of Umbarger's death from the U.S. State Department in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports of the killing were sketchy and contradictory.
There was even a dispute over the location.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police told the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi that Umbarger was
shot on the Somali side of the border and taken to a medical clinic
in Kiunga, just south of the border, where she was pronounced dead,
embassy spokesman Chris Scharf said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan police spokesman Dola Indidis, however, said police are
still investigating on which side of the border she was shot. There
have been no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, she went into the area for meetings ... and
was attacked by a gunman who invaded the meeting. Someone unknown
just started shooting wildly,'' said Lesley Crosson, spokeswoman
for the Global Ministries board.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers at the Methodist relief agency, like
Umbarger's mother, are grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deena's death is a tragedy,'' Dr. Randolph Nugent, chief
executive of the Global Ministries board, said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did she possess a brilliant mind, she also possessed
a deep passion for justice and a love for those who so desperately
need the kind of support provided through the outreach programs.
... We regret, very much, Deena's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger was a 1981 graduate of Sumner High School. She attended
the University of Texas initially, but transferred to the
University of Washington where she graduated magna cum laude with a
degree in psychology in 1990. She put herself through college by
working in the accounting department of Group Health Cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Umbarger graduated from Yale Law School in 1994 and accepted
employment with a Washington, D.C., law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Workman said she was surprised to see her daughter leave the
legal profession and go into relief work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to stop and think that the law degree opened
doors for her. Getting a law degree at Yale gives you more options
in life. And how lucky can you get when you love your work?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Workman will have to make arrangements to have Umbarger's pet
dog, Halley, brought back from Nairobi. The dog, a gift when she
graduated from law school, has traveled everywhere with Umbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her mother, survivors include her father, Dean Umbarger
of Cypress, Texas, and two sisters, Samantha Miller of Tacoma and
Leeann Handy of Michigan.

 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I contribute at work to a 401(k) plan that is invested
in fixed-income securities. I am thinking about leaving to join
another company, and I would like to take the money with me. I
don't plan to touch the money. I only want to roll it over into an
individual retirement account and invest it in stocks in hopes of
getting a better return. Am I allowed to do this, or must I leave
the money in the old plan until I retire?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says
there's no reason why you can't roll your 401(k) money over into an
IRA. In fact, you can put the money in your pocket if you prefer.
However, if you don't roll the money over, you must pay taxes on
the amount withdrawn. And if you are not yet 59-1/2 years old, you
also would have to pay a 10 percent penalty tax.
</P>
<P>
   You should tell your plan administrator what you intend to do.
If the administrator raises an objection, ask to see a copy of the
rules governing your plan. If the rules forbid you to take away
your 401(k) money after you leave, then the rules may be in
conflict with the law. Your next step would be to complain to the
U.S. Labor Department's office of pension and welfare benefits at
(202) 219-8776.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, you will be permitted to walk away with
your money when you quit, or soon after. It may be that the plan
administrator distributes pension money to departing employees only
on certain dates. If that is the case, and you have to wait a month
or two, just grin and bear it. No need to bring the Labor
Department into the act.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Dividend Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Q: I receive a substantial amount of my income from dividends
paid out by the various companies whose stock I hold. Why is it
that the stock price is reduced by the amount of the dividend
payout on the day the stock goes ``ex-dividend''? I asked this
question of a couple of stockbrokers, and they don't have a clue. I
would think that dividends are a form of profit-sharing _ meaning
that the dollars come from operating profits, not shareholder
equity. Having the stock price reduced on ex-dividend dates tells
me that I'm not really getting anything additional for my money,
just a reallocation of funds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I can understand why you are confused, but the last
sentence of your question hits the nail on the head. The payment of
a dividend is indeed just a reallocation of funds _ from the
company treasury to you.
</P>
<P>
   You seem to imply that there is some authority figure out there
decreeing that the price must go down after a dividend is paid. In
fact, there is no official markdown. It is simply a case of the
market doing the logical thing. Prospective buyers automatically
will offer less for the stock the day after a dividend is
distributed because they won't get the dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way:
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you agree to buy a dozen rubies from a jeweler at $500
apiece, or $6,000 for the lot. The jeweler gives you one ruby
today, and you pay him $500. Tomorrow, he will deliver the
remaining 11 rubies and ask for the balance. In effect, that lot of
rubies went ex-dividend by $500 today. Do you think you still
should pay the jeweler $6,000 tomorrow after paying $500 today?
</P>
<P>
   Getting Paid in Stock
</P>
<P>
   Q: The officials of a private startup company have asked me to
accept some of the company's stock as compensation for services
rendered. What are the tax implications if I accept? Do I have to
determine a theoretical value for the stock and report it as
taxable income? Or can I wait until there is an initial public
offering so that the value will be indisputable?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I'm afraid you can't wait. The moment you receive the
stock, it becomes taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   However, you shouldn't be forced to figure the value of the
stock yourself. The company must obtain an appraisal of the stock
it gave you so that it can report the amount to the IRS on Form
1099.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the appraisal will become your cost basis in case
you ever sell the stock. Keep your fingers crossed and pray that it
goes public soon, because IPO stocks these days have a delightful
tendency to climb very far, very fast.

 Airline Web Sites Take Off
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Confounding the experts, the nation's airlines have turned into the
800-pound gorillas of the Internet travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their share of online travel bookings soared from 20 percent in
1996 to 50 percent last year and is expected to exceed 60 percent
of the rapidly growing market three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, travel consultants were saying the
airlines could never dominate the online market. That's because
unlike online travel agencies, they have an obvious bias: They
limit their Web sites to their own flights.
</P>
<P>
   But one leading airline _ American _ has been making a big
splash with its own online travel agency, called Travelocity, which
offers complete schedules and bookings for all the airlines, not
just its own.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity _ at  &LR; www.travelocity.com  &LR; _ is running neck and
neck in volume with the biggest independent online agent,
Microsoft's MSN Expedia  &LR; (www.expedia.com).  &LR; They each are booking
$11 million worth of travel per week.
</P>
<P>
   American and other airlines also are luring hordes of customers
to their own Web sites by offering a selection of ultra-bargain
fares that aren't available anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   And they are providing other attractive inducements as well _
most notably, generous amounts of frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent-flier deals on the United Airlines Web site
 &LR; (www.ual.com)  &LR; won the allegiance of Jacqueline John, a photo
editor with Sunset magazine in Menlo Park, and her boyfriend, John
Cleary, who works for the California Institute of Technology in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   They fly United whenever they visit each other on weekends _
``just because of the frequent-flier miles,'' Cleary says. In a
year and a half, they each have earned enough miles for &LR;   &LR; free
round-trip flights to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would prefer that you book directly with them because
they don't want to pay commissions to travel agents, online or
offline.
</P>
<P>
   And they would rather have you book on their Web sites rather
than going through their telephone reservation clerks because that,
too, saves them money.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are in a penny-pinching mood because many of them
spent the early part of this decade losing money and flirting with
bankruptcy. Now that the industry is looking reasonably healthy
again, it is doing everything in its power to stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring this, Delta recently caused a storm of protests
from consumer groups by slapping a $1 surcharge on all flights not
booked online. However, none of the other airlines was willing to
go that far, and Delta quickly withdrew the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have put the screws to the traditional, offline
travel agents in recent years, slashing the commissions for
agent-booked business from a flat 10 percent of the total fare to
either 8 percent or $50 per round-trip, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   They compensate the online travel agents even more stingily _ a
maximum commission of $10 per flight _ on the premise that those
agents don't need big commissions because their costs are low.
</P>
<P>
   Most conventional agents have responded to the squeeze by
charging their customers a $10 or $15 fee for each booking.
Customer fees used to be unheard of, but the agents feel they have
no choice if they want to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of any meaningful customer resistance to
the service fees,'' said Paul Rudin, senior vice president for
legal and industry affairs with the American Society of Travel
Agents in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   That may be correct _ for now. Vasts hordes of travelers still
lean heavily on travel agents, if only out of habit.
</P>
<P>
   But as more households go online and as the savings from
Internet bookings attract more attention, there is bound to be
erosion in the market share held by traditional agents.
</P>
<P>
   Although they are being squeezed even harder than the
conventional agents, the online agencies haven't imposed fees on
their customers _ yet. They can't risk alienating customers while
they are still in a formative stage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they remain mired in red ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not profitable yet,'' acknowledges Suzi LeVine, product
manager for MSN Expedia.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than charge fees, Expedia hopes to enhance its bottom
line by rustling up more advertising for its Web site, which
already is generously festooned. Its home page yesterday featured
ads from the Hyatt hotel chain, American Express and the Barnes &AMP;
Noble bookstore chain.
</P>
<P>
   Expedia also hopes to expand its bookings of hotel rooms and
rental cars and to diversify into vacation packages and cruises,
all of which command larger commissions than airline bookings.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of airline travelers still book their flights
through conventional travel agencies. It is a century-old tradition
that won't die easily.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, about $3.9 billion worth of travel business will
be booked via the Internet, according to Jupiter Communications, a
New York consulting firm that tracks online services.
</P>
<P>
   While that is only a 1.3 percent sliver of the $300 billion
worldwide travel industry, it amounts to nearly twice the Internet
total for 1998, notes Fiona Swerdlow, a Jupiter analyst.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, online travel bookings should be closing in on $12
billion annually, Swerdlow says, and the potential seems
practically unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has become the ATM of the travel industry,'' says
Mary Papenfuss, managing editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter
in San Francisco. ``It's definitely a problem for travel agents.
It's definitely in the airlines' best interests to cut out the
middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Dackman, director of public information at the
Exploratorium in San Francisco, recently discovered the advantages
of online flight booking when she tried to make reservations for a
vacation trip to Italy by phoning a couple of airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time on the phone, but I couldn't get days
and cities I wanted at a reasonable price,'' she complains.
</P>
<P>
   A friend tipped her off to Travelocity, and she logged onto the
Web site and followed the prompts, filling in her preferred dates
of departure and return.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, she recalls, ``it came up with a fabulous
price'' _ a $668 round-trip Lufthansa fare. That was less than half
the lowest price she had been quoted over the phone by the airline
reservation clerks.

 Column: Investor Relations Consultant Gets Booted From
National  Organization 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Lisa Herbst, the Silicon Valley investor relations consultant who
recently settled an insider trading case with the federal
government, has been ousted by the national organization that
oversees her profession.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors of the National Investor Relations
Institute voted late last week to terminate Herbst's membership for
violating the organization's code of ethics, says NIRI chief
executive Louis Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several parts of the code that we felt she was in
violation of, but one was enough,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   The NIRI board decided to terminate her membership after holding
a hearing for Herbst, where she testified via telephone. The
Pleasanton investor relations consultant presented her case and
attempted to defend her membership, which was jeopardized by the
insider trading allegations made by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1998, Herbst allegedly used nonpublic
information to trade on clients Adobe Systems of San Jose, Asyst
Technologies of Fremont and Splash Technology Holdings of
Sunnyvale. As part of her settlement, Herbst agreed to return all
profits from her stock trades, with interest, and pay a penalty.
Her total fine was $32,799.
</P>
<P>
   During her NIRI hearing, Herbst refused to answer questions from
the board on the advice of her lawyers. As part of her February
settlement with the SEC, Herbst neither denied nor admitted any
guilt but is prohibited from discussing the details of her
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with Herbst's situation say the SEC contacted
the investor relations consultant after being quoted in Street
Smarts on &UR;  &LR; March 2. SEC officials reminded Herbst that talking
about her case violated her deal with the government and that it
could sue her for breach of settlement, the source says. Herbst
would not comment for this column.
</P>
<P>
   The national NIRI decision was the third shoe to drop on Herbst.
The first was her SEC settlement, and the second was her dismissal
from the office of the local NIRI chapter in Silicon Valley. Street
Smarts spotlighted Herbst's settlement with the SEC, noting that it
was rare for the government to go after investor relations
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Herbst's case was noteworthy because she was a
two-time president of the Silicon Valley chapter of NIRI, which
voted to oust her from office while her status with the national
organization was under review.
</P>
<P>
   One would think that an officer of a professional organization
responsible for setting the standards for an industry would have a
fullunderstanding of the laws and would avoid compromising
situations. But two distinct juries of Herbst's peers have ruled to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   It was critical for NIRI to take Herbst's miscues seriously. If
the group failed to take action, NIRI's credibility and authority
would have been undermined. For the most part, the organization has
earned the respect of corporate America, and its members have kept
their noses clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that NIRI has terminated a person's
membership for cause since we were formed in 1970,'' Thompson
notes.
</P>
<P>
   But the importance and sway of investor relations, which is a
relatively young field, has grown immensely during this bull
market. Public companies with active stocks have learned that
sophisticated investor relations departments can play a huge role
in shaping the perception of their companies' performance on Wall
Street, especially when it comes to the art of managing earnings
expectations of financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the IR directors' relatively newfound clout is rather
tangible. It is not uncommon for in-house IR officers to report
directly to chief financial officers _ even at huge corporations.
Outside consultants often gain similar access to executive suites.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the power of the IR community has increased, so has the
temptation to abuse the power of the office. All of this might
partially explain the SEC's heightened interest in investor
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the SEC made it illegal for investor relations
consultants (usually those who are not employees of the
corporation) to receive stock or stock options from public
companies as a form of payment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of abuses related to rules that allow companies to
distribute stock to their own employees, the SEC will not allow
consultants who provide investor relations counsel or shareholder
communications services to receive stock from their clients. The
new rule will become effective April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtably, this is a hot-button issue for the Bay Area, where
outside investor relations consultants tend to accept stock more
than any other region accept for New England, Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that this is going to cause some heartburn,'' says
Thompson, who will address the Silicon Valley chapter of NIRI on
this topic next week.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's new rules are in line with NIRI's own guidelines,
which state that IR consultants should not own stock in their
clients. Period.
</P>
<P>
   As a personal matter, Thompson takes it one step further and
doesn't own individual stocks at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern has always been regarding conflict of interest,''
Thompson says. ``You might be less interested in getting (certain)
news out there if it's going to pound your stock.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: AMERICAN ENVOY HAS LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See KOSOVO, KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-RUSSIA, KOSOVO-RDP)  
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the times that Richard Holbrooke, the
Clinton administration's envoy, has negotiated with the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the room for maneuvering has probably
never been so restricted and the options so unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after President Clinton announced that Milosevic had
gone over ``the threshold,'' Holbrooke was negotiating to avert
NATO air strikes that Washington finds itself on the point of
ordering, but which administration officials acknowledge is not
their favored option.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Serbian forces march across Kosovo, torching
villages, sending refugees fleeing and bringing retaliation from
the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Holbrooke has made it
plain that he cannot remain in Belgrade very long.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Monday that they had set a
rough deadline of 24 hours for Holbrooke to get a cease-fire or
stop negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   It was too embarrassing, they suggested, for Holbrooke to be
talking to Milosevic while his forces were battering ethnic
Albanian civilians, actions that the threatened air strikes are
supposed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if Holbrooke got an immediate cease-fire from Milosevic,
he then had to pretty much restrict his talks to the terms of a
settlement calling for the deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeepers
in Kosovo. The settlement has already been signed by the ethnic
Albanians in Paris. Holbrooke said he try to persuade Milosevic
again that the agreement would benefit the Serbs because it called
for the disarmament of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has surprised Washington with his
tougher-than-expected resistance to NATO troops on Serbian soil. At
talks on Monday morning at NATO headquarters, Holbrooke suggested
there might be a chance to give Milosevic a face-saving device by
calling the troops something else but still retaining NATO control,
said a NATO diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 American troops the administration pledged for
peacekeeping could only participate if they were in a NATO force
with NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Third, if Holbrooke failed to get a cease-fire, the Clinton
administration would be faced with going ahead with NATO air
strikes against Serbia, perhaps as soon as 24 hours after the
envoy's departure from Belgrade, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that Holbrooke leaves Belgrade without an
agreement, he would go first to NATO headquarters in Brussels,
where the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, has the
authority to tell NATO commanders to go ahead with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement on Monday, Clinton said NATO's plans would
continue to move forward. On the eve of a visit to Washington by
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, Clinton also said he
had sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have indicated that they would not mind
if Primakov postponed his visit because of the threatened NATO
strikes, which Russia opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, because of the dramatic surge in Serbian military
action, the administration finds itself confronted with the choice
of air strikes sooner than it anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton said that the Serbs had reached a threshold
of violence that was unacceptable, but he left vague the timing, or
even if, air strikes would be used. It was reasonable,
administration officials argued, after Clinton's statement to send
an emissary to Belgrade to present the peace settlement personally
to Milosevic and urge him one last time to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, 1,400 international monitors, put in place
by an agreement Holbrooke reached with Milosevic last October that
has long since fallen apart, were withdrawn from Kosovo, giving
what turned out to be the opportunity for Milosevic's forces to
strike more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were aware that Milosevic
might take advantage of the vacuum left by the unarmed monitors,
but asserted that the safe departure of the monitors was the
uppermost consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' usefulness had been reduced by threats from
Serbian forces, the officials said. Because the monitors were
unarmed the danger to them had increased dramatically, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the monitoring mission, American Ambassador William
Walker, reluctantly recommended their withdrawal to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday, for safety reasons. The
secretary agreed with him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then called the Norwegian foreign minister, Knut
Vollebaek, who as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, had the authority to make the decision. The
organization, a 54-nation group based in Vienna, served as
overseers of the monitors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers virtually applauded as the monitors left Kosovo
Saturday morning, easing their exit so much that it took only six
hours instead of eight hours for the convoy of cars to make their
way over the Kosovo border and into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   This was the signal, some officials said, that Milosevic was
going to carry out his often voiced threat to start an offensive
that he bragged could finish the Kosovo Liberation Army in five to
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration finds itself getting closer to air
strikes, it also finds itself having to explain more clearly the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invited the top congressional Republicans and
Democrats to the White House on Tuesday morning to overcome
mounting skepticism about the wisdom of an air campaign against a
sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the administration has said that the purpose of the
air strikes would be to ``degrade'' the capability of the Serb
forces. The primary targets of the air campaign would be Serbian
fixed military installations in Serbia and Kosovo, a province of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating on such military targets, the likelihood of
hitting ethnic Albanian civilians, who make up more than 90 percent
of the population in Kosovo, or Serbian civilians, would be
minimized, military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration policy makers acknowledge that bombing
is ``not a good option,'' as one expressed it on Monday. ``It
creates all kinds of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes against Serbian forces would embolden the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that has been fighting for the
past year for the independence of the province.
</P>
<P>
   By strengthening the guerrillas, the bombing would also
strengthen the clamor within Kosovo for independence. Thus, very
quickly, Kosovo could change from being the autonomous region
envisioned in the Paris peace agreement to a quasi-independent
statelet, on the border of Albania and Macedonia where restive
Albanian populations would be eager to redraw their borders.
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of the administration's Kosovo policy has been
that independence of Kosovo is unacceptable. Kosovo should remain,
at least, for the next three years, an autonomous part of Serbia
and not set a precedent for breakaway ethnic groups in Europe, the
administration has argued.

FORMER HOSTAGE SUES IRAN, SAYING IT SPONSORED KIDNAPPERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (jw) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Anderson, the journalist who was held hostage for more
than six years in Lebanon, sued the Iranian government Monday for
what he said was its role in his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 51, who teaches journalism at Ohio University in
Athens, said he expected the federal government to resist his
lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Such lawsuits have been possible only since 1996. Three of
Anderson's fellow hostages won a $65 million judgment against Iran
in August.
</P>
<P>
   But no money has been collected. In October, President Clinton
waived a requirement passed by Congress that month that federal
agencies help recover such claims, and U.S. government lawyers have
fought efforts to obtain those damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is not to win the lawsuit,'' Anderson said Monday.
``The trick is to get money out of anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law allows legal action against countries that the
government accuses of sponsoring terrorism against U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed in October, requires the State and Treasury
departments to help recover damages. But Congress gave the
president the power to bar such help ``in the interest of national
security.'' The administration used that power in the previous
case, saying such lawsuits constrained its diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration wishes we would just go away,''
said Anderson, contending that the government sees such suits as
complicating foreign policy. ``But we are not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Anderson claimed that the government of Iran
sponsored the Islamic radicals who held him captive for more than
six years in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was taken hostage on March 16, 1985, in Beirut and
freed 2,454 days later, on Dec. 4, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, in which Anderson seeks $100 million in damages,
names as plaintiffs himself, his wife, Madeleine Bassil, 49, and
their daughter Sulome, 13, who was born after her father, who was
then the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was taken captive as he returned from a playing a game of tennis in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants the Islamic Republic of Iran and
its Ministry of Information and Security.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that Anderson's kidnappers, members of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, were part of ``a politico-paramilitary terrorist
organization'' with ties to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Seyed Mohammad Hadi
Nejad Hosseinian, has rejected claims that Iran supported the
kidnappers and said that there was ``no shred of credible
evidence'' that it financed Hezbollah, according to a statement
faxed to The Associated Press by the Iranian government. The
statement said that Iran condemned international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is named as a state sponsor of terrorism by the State
Department, along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Sutherland, who was also held hostage with Anderson, has
said he plans to file a similar suit within the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's suit contends that Iran is the main sponsor of the
Party of God, ``providing it with funding, direction and training
for its terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that Anderson, while being held hostage, was fed a
poor diet of bread, cheese and rice, and that he was beaten,
taunted and humiliated. It claims he was often threatened with
death, and that he heard his fellow captives beaten and one die. It
says he grew so depressed that he beat his head against a wall
until he bled.

ONLINE PRIVACY GROUP DECIDES NOT TO PURSUE MICROSOFT CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Monday, a nonprofit watchdog group founded to
monitor online privacy policies scolded but declined to pursue an
audit of one of its biggest donors, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It was an awkward decision, both because of Microsoft's
contributions to the group, TRUSTe, and because it comes at a
crucial point in negotiations between the United States and the
European Union over whether companies can effectively police
themselves in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe, a Santa Barbara, Calif.-based nonprofit organization,
monitors the Internet privacy policies of about 500 companies. The
group's officers said that Microsoft had compromised consumer
privacy and trust with an identifying number in its Windows 98
operating system that was surreptitiously collecting consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   But it found no privacy violations involving information
collected through the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, TRUSTe's certification process covers data that
is collected specifically by microsoft.com, a TRUSTe licensed
site,'' TRUSTe said in declining to seek an independent audit of
Microsoft's practices or to revoke its seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates heavily criticized the decision and the
distinction on which it was based.
</P>
<P>
   ``It illustrates the fact that these seals don't deliver the
real privacy protection that people want and deserve, and
self-regulation is sham regulation,'' said Jason Catlett, president
of Junkbusters Corp., who filed the complaint with TRUSTe.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett called for an immediate investigation of Microsoft by
the Federal Trade Commission, saying the TRUSTe decision showed
``that self-regulation has failed for a systemic reason that we can
expect to see repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision was seen as a sticky one for TRUSTe.
Microsoft, a premier corporate partner, contributed $100,000 to the
group.
</P>
<P>
   And it comes at time when the United States is involved in
intense negotiations to persuade the European Union that
self-regulation and self-enforcement of data privacy practices are
effective enough to meet a stringent new EU privacy law that
threatens to disrupt electronic commerce between the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A key provision of that law prohibits any company doing business
in the European Union from transmitting personal data to any
country that does not guarantee comparable privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while a representative of the European Union was in
Washington for negotiations, the Better Business Bureau started its
own seal program to monitor the posted privacy practices of Web
sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Catlett's complaint, which was sent to TRUSTe on March 12,
stemmed from recent reports that the latest version of Microsoft's
Windows generates a unique serial number that can gather private
information from users even when they request to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``In TRUSTe's opinion, the investigation confirmed that the
technology `bug' already acknowledged by Microsoft did transfer
Hardware IDs to the Microsoft secure server regardless of whether
users chose to send this information or not,'' TRUSTe wrote in a
statement posted on its Web site Monday afternoon. ``While this
event does not fall within the boundaries of the TRUSTe License
Agreement, it did, in TRUSTe's opinion, compromise consumer trust
and privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the company was made aware of what had occurred, it took
the necessary action to remedy the problem.'' Microsoft applauded
TRUSTe for its investigation.
</P>

   ``I would say that we believe that the system and process in
place by TRUSTe worked well here,'' said Tom Pilla, a spokesman for
the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash. ``A watchdog
complaint was filed. TRUSTe conducted a thorough investigation in
keeping with its standard operating procedure. After a thorough
review of the facts, it publicly issued its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett agreed that TRUSTe ``diligently did what they were
constitutionally able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``By design, that is very little. They did rebuke
Microsoft. But they didn't call in an auditor. They haven't caused
any consequences for Microsoft other than this rebuke. It really
demonstrates that self-regulation is a toothless tiger.''

CHINESE DENY GETTING SECRETS FROM FIRED LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials say that Wen Ho Lee, the Taiwan-born
American scientist suspected of leaking nuclear secrets, attended
two scientific meetings in China in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But in a report issued late Sunday night by the New China News
Agency, Chinese scientists vehemently deny that Lee gave away plans
for making advanced American warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Lee ``is no more than a fabrication,'' the
report quotes professor Li Deyuan of the Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics as saying. Lee has been
dismissed from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for
violating security rules, but he has not been charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Professor Li, Wen Ho Lee attended an
international symposium on hydromechanics in Beijing in 1986, which
was simply and totally a meeting about basic scientific matters,''
the news agency report said. ``Lee delivered an open lecture about
calculating the methods of hydromechanics in a research institute
in Beijing, which was also fundamentally basic science and nothing
to do with `secrets.'''
</P>
<P>
   American intelligence and law enforcement officials have said
Lee has told them that he had unauthorized contacts with Chinese
scientists, but they have not provided details of what he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese news agency account said Lee also attended the
International Computation Physics Conference in China, with Li as
chairman, in June 1988. The meeting, attended by more than 200
scientists from various countries, was said to have been
co-sponsored by the Beijing applied physics institute, Drexel
University in Philadelphia and the American government's National
Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee attended the 1988 conference with the approval of his
employers at the Los Alamos laboratory, the report said, and
delivered a paper titled ``Material Void Opening Computation Using
Particle Method.'' Lee's presentation ``covered general basic
research and did not involve any confidential information,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist identified as the secretary-general of that
conference, Zhang Tianyuan, said the meeting had involved
``general-purpose academic talks and never touched upon the secrets
of the W-88 nuclear warhead.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they believe that China stole important
design elements of the W-88, a miniaturized nuclear warhead useful
for building multiple-warhead rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing applied physics academy involved in the two meetings
conducts research on nuclear weapons for the military as well as on
peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency report also sought to refute the broader charges
that China had taken advantage of economic and scientific exchanges
in the last two decades to steal military technology. It said
charges made by congressional investigators that China stole
secrets of the neutron bomb, of the W-88 warhead and of simulated
nuclear explosions were ``an obvious calumny.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under orders not to let Serbia delay NATO
action while Kosovo burns, an American diplomat struggled early
Tuesday to negotiate at least a cease-fire. American officials said
that talks were expected to continue into the day.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, met with President
Slobodan Milosevic for more than three hours in a last-ditch effort
to resolve the crisis and forestall NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke then returned to the American Embassy for nearly three
hours of consultations with Washington and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is engaged in a large offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Kosovo, and Washington and the West said that if
he does not agree to a NATO-led force to monitor a peace settlement
in the province, NATO will bomb Serb military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have already destroyed three of the KLA's seven
regional headquarters, a senior NATO official said Tuesday, adding
urgency to the Holbrooke mission. Milosevic has been told by his
generals, the official said, that Yugoslav troops could complete
their sweep by Friday, destroying the KLA's command and control.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission here ``is a last-ditch effort and it's got
to be quick,'' the official said. ``We want a quick determination
from Holbrooke about whether we're at the end of the process or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO have presented the talks as a final chance
for Milosevic to avoid severe military punishment; Milosevic, while
sounding tough, typically waits until the last moment to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, as Holbrooke was meeting with Milosevic,
President Clinton warned that military action could be imminent.
``If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over peace,
then NATO's military plans must go forward,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 30,000 more ethnic Albanians have been displaced
from their homes over the last few days, and said: ``We cannot
allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with
impunity,'' adding that America's security interests must include
``Europe's freedom and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
ceasefire, there was little point in talking further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke
with fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo, and we
end up with both a diplomatic failure and a military fait
accompli,'' the senior NATO official said. ``Milosevic has already
had a three-day head start.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's comment that
air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and said: ``Some allies
feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be designed to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serb military targets involved in prosecuting the war
against the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the KLA's air force,
which Western officials had said was not their goal, the official
said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done, have signed the peace
agreement. So we have a bit of a moral obligation to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb offensive followed immediately upon the sudden
withdrawal on Saturday of the some 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Asked if their
rapid removal from the province was not an invitation to Milosevic
to attack, the official said that many NATO members had been
pressing for air strikes to begin immediately, with no final
Holbrooke mission.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns with NATO, especially from the Italians, who
are a part of the contact group, combined with criticism from
within the American Congress, argued for longer consultations and a
last chance for Milosevic to change his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb military campaign of the last few days has also served
to harden solidarity within NATO about the need for air strikes,
and has allowed the Americans to push for a more intensive set of
strikes. Washington argued that initial cruise missile strikes
intended to destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defense should
be followed _ without pause for Belgrade's reflection _ by
intensive fighter and bomber attacks on Serb military positions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans said, Milosevic would succeed in his
aims to damage the KLA while NATO appeared to be standing by. That
new discussion within NATO required further time, the officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO will be blamed,'' the official said, ``it will be
blamed for delay, not for impetuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only Tuesday that NATO countries gave Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to order expanded air strikes on ``a
much more diverse target list, a much more intensive pace of
operations and an expanded geographical zone,'' a NATO official
told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said NATO was urging Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas to refrain from ``murder and bombing'' _ like the ambush
of four Serb policemen in downtown Pristina Sunday night _ that
would justify further Serb attacks. There were two more bomb
attacks on bars in Pristina, with at least one dead and eight
wounded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Serb president
met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks on Kosovo,
American Christopher Hill, EU representative Wolfgang Petritsch and
Russian Boris Mayorsky. The meeting, which the three diplomats and
Holbrooke had agreed would be limited to a discussion of the
political side of the Kosovo agreement, did not go well, said
officials at the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional and lively,'' Petritsch said. They wanted to
give Milosevic an accurate account of the political arrangements,
fearing that he had misinformation. When Milosevic called the
Albanians ``terrorists and separatists,'' Petritsch said: ``Well,
after they signed the agreement, you can only call them Albanian
autonomists.'' The agreement calls for effective self-rule in
Kosovo, but the province will remain a sovereign part of Serbia and
Yugoslavia for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Holbrooke's turn, and he concentrated on the damage
NATO was about to do to Milosevic's army and regime if Belgrade's
position did not change and the offensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Brussels, after talks with NATO leaders and the
British, French and German foreign ministers, Holbrooke said: ``We
are not _ and I cannot stress this too highly _ going to get into a
talk-while-fighting-intensifies situation in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO is ``on the brink'' of military action. ``It
is not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Solana said: ``We think that this is the moment of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is being careful not to claim that the goal of any
bombing is to force Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
Instead, NATO officials are insisting that the only goal of air
strikes is to ``degrade'' Serbia's military ability to inflict harm
on the KLA and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the human tragedy that provides NATO its legal
justification to bomb a sovereign country, especially in the
absence of any United Nations Security Council resolution
authorizing military action.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials kept up a defensive, wounded tone, and called in
Western ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry to protest the
possibility of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, said Serbs were ready
to defend themselves if the West tried to impose a solution in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want war,'' he told the Greek newspaper Ethnos. ``We
are seeking a peaceful resolution. But if someone attacks us, or if
someone imposes, then of course we will fight for our homeland.''

<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Serb president
met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks on Kosovo,
American Christopher Hill, EU representative Wolfgang Petritsch and
Russian Boris Mayorsky. The meeting, which the three diplomats and
Holbrooke had agreed would be limited to a discussion of the
political side of the Kosovo agreement, did not go well, said
officials at the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional and lively,'' Petritsch said. They wanted to
give Milosevic an accurate account of the political arrangements,
fearing that he had misinformation. When Milosevic called the
Albanians ``terrorists and separatists,'' Petritsch said: ``Well,
after they signed the agreement, you can only call them Albanian
autonomists.'' The agreement calls for effective self-rule in
Kosovo, but the province will remain a sovereign part of Serbia and
Yugoslavia for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Holbrooke's turn, and he concentrated on the damage
NATO was about to do to Milosevic's army and regime if Belgrade's
position did not change and the offensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Brussels, after talks with NATO leaders and the
British, French and German foreign ministers, Holbrooke said: ``We
are not _ and I cannot stress this too highly _ going to get into a
talk-while-fighting-intensifies situation in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO is ``on the brink'' of military action. ``It
is not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Solana said: ``We think that this is the moment of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is being careful not to claim that the goal of any
bombing is to force Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
Instead, NATO officials are insisting that the only goal of air
strikes is to ``degrade'' Serbia's military ability to inflict harm
on the KLA and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the human tragedy that provides NATO its legal
justification to bomb a sovereign country, especially in the
absence of any United Nations Security Council resolution
authorizing military action.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials kept up a defensive, wounded tone, and called in
Western ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry to protest the
possibility of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, said Serbs were ready
to defend themselves if the West tried to impose a solution in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want war,'' he told the Greek newspaper Ethnos. ``We
are seeking a peaceful resolution. But if someone attacks us, or if
someone imposes, then of course we will fight for our homeland.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under orders not to let Serbia delay NATO
action while Kosovo burns, an American diplomat struggled early
Tuesday to negotiate at least a cease-fire. American officials said
that talks were expected to continue into the day.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, met with President
Slobodan Milosevic for more than three hours in a last-ditch effort
to resolve the crisis and forestall NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke then returned to the American Embassy for nearly three
hours of consultations with Washington and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is engaged in a large offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Kosovo, and Washington and the West said that if
he does not agree to a NATO-led force to monitor a peace settlement
in the province, NATO will bomb Serb military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have already destroyed three of the KLA's seven
regional headquarters, a senior NATO official said Tuesday, adding
urgency to the Holbrooke mission. Milosevic has been told by his
generals, the official said, that Yugoslav troops could complete
their sweep by Friday, destroying the KLA's command and control.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission here ``is a last-ditch effort and it's got
to be quick,'' the official said. ``We want a quick determination
from Holbrooke about whether we're at the end of the process or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO have presented the talks as a final chance
for Milosevic to avoid severe military punishment; Milosevic, while
sounding tough, typically waits until the last moment to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, as Holbrooke was meeting with Milosevic,
President Clinton warned that military action could be imminent.
``If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over peace,
then NATO's military plans must go forward,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 30,000 more ethnic Albanians have been displaced
from their homes over the last few days, and said: ``We cannot
allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with
impunity,'' adding that America's security interests must include
``Europe's freedom and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
ceasefire, there was little point in talking further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke
with fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo, and we
end up with both a diplomatic failure and a military fait
accompli,'' the senior NATO official said. ``Milosevic has already
had a three-day head start.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's comment that
air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and said: ``Some allies
feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be designed to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serb military targets involved in prosecuting the war
against the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the KLA's air force,
which Western officials had said was not their goal, the official
said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done, have signed the peace
agreement. So we have a bit of a moral obligation to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb offensive followed immediately upon the sudden
withdrawal on Saturday of the some 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Asked if their
rapid removal from the province was not an invitation to Milosevic
to attack, the official said that many NATO members had been
pressing for air strikes to begin immediately, with no final
Holbrooke mission.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns with NATO, especially from the Italians, who
are a part of the contact group, combined with criticism from
within the American Congress, argued for longer consultations and a
last chance for Milosevic to change his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb military campaign of the last few days has also served
to harden solidarity within NATO about the need for air strikes,
and has allowed the Americans to push for a more intensive set of
strikes. Washington argued that intial cruise missile strikes
intended to destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defense should
be followed _ without pause for Belgrade's reflection _ by
intensive fighter and bomber attacks on Serb military positions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans said, Milosevic would succeed in his
aims to damage the KLA while NATO appeared to be standing by. That
new discussion within NATO required further time, the officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO will be blamed,'' the official said, ``it will be
blamed for delay, not for impetuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only Tuesday that NATO countries gave Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to order expanded air strikes on ``a
much more diverse target list, a much more intensive pace of
operations and an expanded geographical zone,'' a NATO official
told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said NATO was urging Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas to refrain from ``murder and bombing'' _ like the ambush
of four Serb policemen in downtown Pristina Sunday night _ that
would justify further Serb attacks. There were two more bomb
attacks on bars in Pristina, with at least one dead and eight
wounded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Serb president
met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks on Kosovo,
American Christopher Hill, EU representative Wolfgang Petritsch and
Russian Boris Mayorsky. The meeting, which the three diplomats and
Holbrooke had agreed would be limited to a discussion of the

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under orders not to let Serbia delay NATO
action while Kosovo burns, an American diplomat struggled early
Tuesday to negotiate at least a cease-fire. American officials said
that talks were expected to continue into the day.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, met with President
Slobodan Milosevic for more than three hours in a last-ditch effort
to resolve the crisis and forestall NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke then returned to the American Embassy for nearly three
hours of consultations with Washington and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is engaged in a large offensive against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Kosovo, and Washington and the West said that if
he does not agree to a NATO-led force to monitor a peace settlement
in the province, NATO will bomb Serb military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have already destroyed three of the KLA's seven
regional headquarters, a senior NATO official said Tuesday, adding
urgency to the Holbrooke mission. Milosevic has been told by his
generals, the official said, that Yugoslav troops could complete
their sweep by Friday, destroying the KLA's command and control.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission here ``is a last-ditch effort and it's got
to be quick,'' the official said. ``We want a quick determination
from Holbrooke about whether we're at the end of the process or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington and NATO have presented the talks as a final chance
for Milosevic to avoid severe military punishment; Milosevic, while
sounding tough, typically waits until the last moment to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, as Holbrooke was meeting with Milosevic,
President Clinton warned that military action could be imminent.
``If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over peace,
then NATO's military plans must go forward,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that 30,000 more ethnic Albanians have been displaced
from their homes over the last few days, and said: ``We cannot
allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with
impunity,'' adding that America's security interests must include
``Europe's freedom and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
ceasefire, there was little point in talking further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke
with fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo, and we
end up with both a diplomatic failure and a military fait
accompli,'' the senior NATO official said. ``Milosevic has already
had a three-day head start.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's comment that
air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and said: ``Some allies
feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be designed to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serb military targets involved in prosecuting the war
against the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the KLA's air force,
which Western officials had said was not their goal, the official
said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done, have signed the peace
agreement. So we have a bit of a moral obligation to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb offensive followed immediately upon the sudden
withdrawal on Saturday of the some 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Asked if their
rapid removal from the province was not an invitation to Milosevic
to attack, the official said that many NATO members had been
pressing for air strikes to begin immediately, with no final
Holbrooke mission.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns with NATO, especially from the Italians, who
are a part of the contact group, combined with criticism from
within the American Congress, argued for longer consultations and a
last chance for Milosevic to change his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb military campaign of the last few days has also served
to harden solidarity within NATO about the need for air strikes,
and has allowed the Americans to push for a more intensive set of
strikes. Washington argued that initial cruise missile strikes
intended to destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defense should
be followed _ without pause for Belgrade's reflection _ by
intensive fighter and bomber attacks on Serb military positions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Americans said, Milosevic would succeed in his
aims to damage the KLA while NATO appeared to be standing by. That
new discussion within NATO required further time, the officials
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO will be blamed,'' the official said, ``it will be
blamed for delay, not for impetuosity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only Tuesday that NATO countries gave Secretary-General
Javier Solana the authority to order expanded air strikes on ``a
much more diverse target list, a much more intensive pace of
operations and an expanded geographical zone,'' a NATO official
told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said NATO was urging Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas to refrain from ``murder and bombing'' _ like the ambush
of four Serb policemen in downtown Pristina Sunday night _ that
would justify further Serb attacks. There were two more bomb
attacks on bars in Pristina, with at least one dead and eight
wounded, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Serb president
met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks on Kosovo,
American Christopher Hill, EU representative Wolfgang Petritsch and
Russian Boris Mayorsky. The meeting, which the three diplomats and
Holbrooke had agreed would be limited to a discussion of the
political side of the Kosovo agreement, did not go well, said
officials at the meeting, which lasted 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional and lively,'' Petritsch said. They wanted to
give Milosevic an accurate account of the political arrangements,
fearing that he had misinformation. When Milosevic called the
Albanians ``terrorists and separatists,'' Petritsch said: ``Well,
after they signed the agreement, you can only call them Albanian
autonomists.'' The agreement calls for effective self-rule in
Kosovo, but the province will remain a sovereign part of Serbia and
Yugoslavia for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Holbrooke's turn, and he concentrated on the damage
NATO was about to do to Milosevic's army and regime if Belgrade's
position did not change and the offensive stop.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Brussels, after talks with NATO leaders and the
British, French and German foreign ministers, Holbrooke said: ``We
are not _ and I cannot stress this too highly _ going to get into a
talk-while-fighting-intensifies situation in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that NATO is ``on the brink'' of military action. ``It
is not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's Solana said: ``We think that this is the moment of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is being careful not to claim that the goal of any
bombing is to force Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
Instead, NATO officials are insisting that the only goal of air
strikes is to ``degrade'' Serbia's military ability to inflict harm
on the KLA and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the human tragedy that provides NATO its legal
justification to bomb a sovereign country, especially in the
absence of any United Nations Security Council resolution
authorizing military action.

from their homes over the last few days, and said: ``We cannot
allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with
impunity,'' adding that America's security interests must include
``Europe's freedom and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
ceasefire, there was little point in talking further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke
with fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo, and we
end up with both a diplomatic failure and a military fait
accompli,'' the senior NATO official said. ``Milosevic has already
had a three-day head start.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark's comment that
air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and said: ``Some allies
feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be designed to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serb military targets involved in prosecuting the war
against the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the KLA's air force,
which Western officials had said was not their goal, the official
said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done, have signed the peace
agreement. So we have a bit of a moral obligation to the KLA.''

withdrawal on Saturday of the some 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the

KEVORKIAN TELLS JURY HE DID NOT INTEND TO KILLNHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Acting as his own lawyer for the first time in
his five trials, Dr. Jack Kevorkian on Monday told a jury
considering murder charges against him that he did not intend to
kill a seriously ill Michigan man when he injected him with a
lethal dose of chemicals last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian, who has said that he has presided over more than 130
suicides, said he was no more a criminal than is an executioner,
whose ``intent is to do his duty.''
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors objected to his arguments, Kevorkian told
Judge Jessica R. Cooper of Oakland County Circuit Court, with
jurors out of the courtroom: ``I despise a human being dying in my
hands. But my intent isn't to kill the person. I thought it was my
duty as a physician to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, John Skrzynski, told the jury that the case
was about no broader issue than the death of Thomas Youk, a
52-year-old Michigan man who was suffering from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue you will decide is whether Jack Kevorkian has the
right to kill or whether he's accountable to the law and guilty of
murder,'' Skrzynski said in his opening statement. ``Jack Kevorkian
killed Tom Youk and Jack Kevorkian did not have the right to
kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In four previous trials on charges of assisted suicide, juries
have acquitted Kevorkian three times and failed to reach a verdict
once. This time, Kevorkian decided to intensify the debate on
assisted suicide by actively administering the lethal drugs to Youk
in Youk's home last September, rather than setting up his ``suicide
machine'' that let patients inject themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian videotaped the injection and gave the tape to the CBS
News program ``60 Minutes.'' In the broadcast, Kevorkian said he
was daring prosecutors to charge him.
</P>
<P>
   After the broadcast of the videotape, prosecutors charged
Kevorkian with first-degree murder and delivery of a controlled
substance. They also charged him with assisted suicide, but dropped
that count in an apparent effort to prevent Kevorkian from
presenting evidence about Youk's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Before jury selection began early on Monday morning, Kevorkian
told Ms. Cooper that he was prepared to defend himself. This day in
court was something he had wanted for a long time, Kevorkian said,
adding that only he has a good enough understanding of his beliefs
to adequately present his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain points I can bring out better than any
attorney,'' he told the court during a thorough questioning session
in which Ms. Cooper tried to determine if Kevorkian understood the
risks of representing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been planning this all along,'' Kevorkian said.
</P>
<P>
   In the questioning, Ms. Cooper explained the weight of the
charges and the maximum penalty associated with both.
</P>
<P>
   When she cautioned Kevorkian that he was facing a prison term
that could last the rest of his life, he responded: ``There's not
that much of it left, Your Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian will enlist the legal advice of David Gorosh and Lisa
Dwyer, the two lawyers who had argued his case in pretrial
hearings, but they will serve only as advisers and be prohibited
from voicing objections, addressing the court or questioning
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gorosh said he urged Kevorkian not to represent himself, but
that Kevorkian told him over the weekend that he would not follow
that advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised Dr. Kevorkian that in our opinion it was in his
best interest to have lawyers represent him,'' Gorosh said, ``but
it is his constitutional right to represent himself.''

PORTUGAL'S LAST DAYS IN MACAU MARRED BY CHINESE TROOP ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ In less than nine months, this postage-stamp Portuguese
colony will be absorbed into China. And its 502,000 residents, most
of whom are Chinese, have few illusions about which side is calling
the shots in the twilight of the transition to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the president of Portugal, Jorge Sampaio, served notice
Monday that Macau's colonial rulers will not go quietly. Sampaio
said he was prepared to boycott the handover ceremonies next
December to protest China's handling of the transition,
particularly a decision to send troops to the enclave prior to the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here with my face looking up,'' he said. ``I will
not be here with my face looking down, because we are a country
with pride.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit here last week, Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen
of China said his government would send an advance guard of the
People's Liberation Army before the transfer to establish a
garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Sampaio said the joint declaration governing Macau's return to
China did not permit China to station troops in the colony, and
that Chinese officials had not justified their decision to depart
from the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a change, there has to be an explanation,''
he said. ``We don't think the explanation has been satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese leader's remarks came in a meeting with foreign
journalists at the end of his five-day visit here. Sampaio's trip
was supposed to generate good will between Portugal and China in
the waning days of Portuguese rule. But with the two countries at
loggerheads, the transfer of Macau to China may end up being as
acrimonious as that of its more prominent neighbor, Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Sampaio met with Qian on Friday. But Sampaio said he did raise
the issue of troops because he believes the dispute should be
settled in bilateral talks later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not being belligerent,'' Sampaio said several times.
``We are waiting for an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   China insists it has the right to deploy soldiers because it
will be responsible for Macau's national security after Dec. 19.
Although it has not said so explicitly, people here suspect the
troops will crack down on gangs, which are waging a deadly war for
control of Macau's lucrative gambling trade.
</P>
<P>
   After a rash of shootings in the enclave, Chinese officials
expressed concern that security was breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   Sending troops in advance would mimic what China did in Hong
Kong, sending an advance guard prior to that handover, in July
1997. At midnight on July 1, more troops rolled across the border
in trucks _ heading for their barracks, where they have remained
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Although the last British governor of Hong Kong clashed with
China on many issues relating to democracy and rights prior to the
transfer, Britain and China did not clash over the deployment of
troops in Hong Kong because Britain had maintained a garrison
there, and it was a foregone conclusion that China would take it
over. Although Macau does not have a garrison, many residents
assume that China will send in troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people don't see it as much of a threat,'' said Ricardo
Pinto, the director of Ponto Final, a Portuguese-language weekly
newspaper here. ``But it seemed like a slap in the face to the
Portuguese.''
</P>
<P>
   China's about-face was particularly surprising to the Portuguese
because a top Chinese official had previously declared that the
enclave was too small to require a garrison. Macau has not had a
military presence since Portugal withdrew its troops after the
Portuguese revolution in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his visit as ``a show of optimism,'' Sampaio said he
hoped China and Portugal could resolve their differences. But he
added that Portugal would rather leave some issues unresolved than
back down. ``We would like that this period end with dignity for
all concerned,'' he said.

<P>
   TEOTIHUACAN, Mexico _ The crowds, half a million people dressed
in white with red headbands, clambered over a towering ancient
pyramid and packed the broad ceremonial avenue below it. When the
sun reached its noon zenith they closed their eyes and turned to
it, stretching their palms upward to absorb the invigorating rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am recharging with positive energy,'' said Alma Lourdes
Gonzalez, a 23-year-old shopkeeper, who radiated calm contentment
despite the huge throng pressing around her. ``I am opening my
heart and body to let out the bad vibrations and fill up with
everything positive.''
</P>
<P>
   To honor what they took to be the last spring equinox before the
millennium, multitudes of Mexicans across the country flocked on
Sunday to pyramids and sacred shrines of their pre-Columbian
ancestors, communing with the cosmos and soaking in force from the
luminous sun that their forebears venerated.
</P>
<P>
   Pained by economic crises and political scandals, countless
Mexicans are responding to the millennium's approach by summoning
spiritual reserves and turning to mystical beliefs. Many have mixed
their deep Catholic faith with a search for modern meaning in the
civilizations that arose in these lands before the Spanish
conquest.
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest celebration took place at the stately ruins
at Teotihuacan, a city founded 1,900 years ago, which became a
flourishing religious capital before fading mysteriously in the
seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   The event here overshadowed any of the political demonstrations
in Mexico in recent years. At least a thousand people spent the
frigid night Saturday on a ledge near the top of the 200-foot-high
Pyramid of the Sun, to be present at the all-important moment of
sunrise. By midday the lines into the huge archeological park were
so long that many thousands of people were not able to enter in
time for the noon ceremony worshipping the sun. The highway to the
site was clogged for miles.
</P>
<P>
   There were bricklayers and doctors, teen-agers and grandparents.
What they seemed to have in common was a longing for relief from
bad news about their political leaders, family pressures and the
grind of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gathering enough springtime energy to last me the whole
year,'' said Maria de la Paz Hernandez, a 47-year-old lawyer who
perched near the pyramid's top. ``The sun comes up all over the
world. It will help me to think positive thoughts always and to ask
for blessings for all of humanity and not just for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Miguel Angel Kirel Macedo, 36, a painter who said he had
been drawn in recent years to pre-Hispanic imagery, emerged serene
from an hour of meditation. ``Our physical bodies activate an
energy which is concentrated in the pyramid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With its many enigmas, Teotihuacan is an appropriate setting for
religious quest. After a century of excavation, it is not known
exactly who lived here, what language they spoke or all the gods
they worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mexicans here did not seem worried about the specifics
of the cultures they sought to recontact. Magdalena Perez, 40, a
merchant, said she brought her two daughters to the equinox
festivities ``to make sure they understand our Mayan past.'' The
Maya did thrive in Mexico, but hundreds of miles to the south of
Teotihuacan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scientific inquiry, the day brought a glorious
potpourri of religions and re-creations of an idealized past. At
6:46 a.m., when the sun burst out from behind the black hills
circling the ruin, a group of residents from surrounding villages
who called themselves Tlahuizcalpantecutli (a phrase said to mean
``followers of the lord of the star of dawn'' in some pre-Hispanic
language) held a welcoming ceremony at the pyramid's summit.
</P>
<P>
   They blew on conch shells, held up braziers of fire and copal
incense and played on drums. On a cloth altar they laid out
amaranth seeds, corn kernels and black beans for Tonatiuh, a sun
deity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make these offerings to open the doors of the cosmos and
receive this great sacred illumination in our hearts,'' said
Ricardo Cervantes Cervantes, a taxi driver who led the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   A long line formed for a spiritual healer in a tall black hat
who waved a cluster of feathers and recited prayers to cleanse his
patients. Humberto Garcia Lopez, a 20-year-old student, wept after
the purification rite. He said he hoped it would bring peace to his
family, torn by fights between his two teen-age brothers and his
father.
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of the pyramid, dancers in ostrich feather
headdresses and loincloths performed an Aztec ritual, although the
Aztecs lived in Teotihuacan. A few feet away, a determined Catholic
priest celebrated a traditional Sunday morning Mass for a small
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the last time Mexicans gathered in these numbers was
when Pope John Paul II visited in January. Many of the visitors
here said they had also been in the streets to see the pope. They
saw no tension between his strict Catholic teachings and their
choice to spend a day garnering strength from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sent here by God,'' said Cruz Villegas Diaz, 46, a
truck driver who led a delegation of Christians to greet the
equinox. ``Our Lord will spill His light down on us and fortify the
outer physical wrapping of our bodies to deepen our spiritual
faith.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: AMERICAN ENVOY HAS LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See KOSOVO, KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-RUSSIA, KOSOVO-RDP)  
(sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the times that Richard Holbrooke, the
Clinton administration's envoy, has negotiated with the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the room for maneuvering has probably
never been so restricted and the options so unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after President Clinton announced that Milosevic had
gone over ``the threshold,'' Holbrooke was negotiating to avert
NATO air strikes that Washington finds itself on the point of
ordering, but which administration officials acknowledge is not
their favored option.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Serbian forces march across Kosovo, torching
villages, sending refugees fleeing and bringing retaliation from
the guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Holbrooke has made it
plain that he cannot remain in Belgrade very long.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said on Monday that they had set a
rough deadline of 24 hours for Holbrooke to get a cease-fire or
stop negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   It was too embarrassing, they suggested, for Holbrooke to be
talking to Milosevic while his forces were battering ethnic
Albanian civilians, actions that the threatened air strikes are
supposed to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if Holbrooke got an immediate cease-fire from Milosevic,
he then had to pretty much restrict his talks to the terms of a
settlement calling for the deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeepers
in Kosovo. The settlement has already been signed by the ethnic
Albanians in Paris. Holbrooke said he try to persuade Milosevic
again that the agreement would benefit the Serbs because it called
for the disarmament of the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has surprised Washington with his
tougher-than-expected resistance to NATO troops on Serbian soil. At
talks on Monday morning at NATO headquarters, Holbrooke suggested
there might be a chance to give Milosevic a face-saving device by
calling the troops something else but still retaining NATO control,
said a NATO diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000 American troops the administration pledged for
peacekeeping could only participate if they were in a NATO force
with NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Third, if Holbrooke failed to get a cease-fire, the Clinton
administration would be faced with going ahead with NATO air
strikes against Serbia, perhaps as soon as 24 hours after the
envoy's departure from Belgrade, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the event that Holbrooke leaves Belgrade without an
agreement, he would go first to NATO headquarters in Brussels,
where the secretary general of NATO, Javier Solana, has the
authority to tell NATO commanders to go ahead with air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement on Monday, Clinton said NATO's plans would
continue to move forward. On the eve of a visit to Washington by
Yevgeny Primakov, the Russian prime minister, Clinton also said he
had sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin ``about the urgency of
the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have indicated that they would not mind
if Primakov postponed his visit because of the threatened NATO
strikes, which Russia opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, because of the dramatic surge in Serbian military
action, the administration finds itself confronted with the choice
of air strikes sooner than it anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton said that the Serbs had reached a threshold
of violence that was unacceptable, but he left vague the timing, or
even if, air strikes would be used. It was reasonable,
administration officials argued, after Clinton's statement to send
an emissary to Belgrade to present the peace settlement personally
to Milosevic and urge him one last time to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Saturday, 1,400 international monitors, put in place
by an agreement Holbrooke reached with Milosevic last October that
has long since fallen apart, were withdrawn from Kosovo, giving
what turned out to be the opportunity for Milosevic's forces to
strike more forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they were aware that Milosevic
might take advantage of the vacuum left by the unarmed monitors,
but asserted that the safe departure of the monitors was the
uppermost consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors' usefulness had been reduced by threats from
Serbian forces, the officials said. Because the monitors were
unarmed the danger to them had increased dramatically, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the monitoring mission, American Ambassador William
Walker, reluctantly recommended their withdrawal to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright on Thursday, for safety reasons. The
secretary agreed with him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright then called the Norwegian foreign minister, Knut
Vollebaek, who as chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, had the authority to make the decision. The
organization, a 54-nation group based in Vienna, served as
overseers of the monitors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Serb soldiers virtually applauded as the monitors left Kosovo
Saturday morning, easing their exit so much that it took only six
hours instead of eight hours for the convoy of cars to make their
way over the Kosovo border and into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   This was the signal, some officials said, that Milosevic was
going to carry out his often voiced threat to start an offensive
that he bragged could finish the Kosovo Liberation Army in five to
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration finds itself getting closer to air
strikes, it also finds itself having to explain more clearly the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has invited the top congressional Republicans and
Democrats to the White House on Tuesday morning to overcome
mounting skepticism about the wisdom of an air campaign against a
sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the administration has said that the purpose of the
air strikes would be to ``degrade'' the capability of the Serb
forces. The primary targets of the air campaign would be Serbian
fixed military installations in Serbia and Kosovo, a province of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   By concentrating on such military targets, the likelihood of
hitting ethnic Albanian civilians, who make up more than 90 percent
of the population in Kosovo, or Serbian civilians, would be
minimized, military experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, administration policy makers acknowledge that bombing
is ``not a good option,'' as one expressed it on Monday. ``It
creates all kinds of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Air strikes against Serbian forces would embolden the Kosovo
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group that has been fighting for the
past year for the independence of the province.
</P>
<P>
   By strengthening the guerrillas, the bombing would also
strengthen the clamor within Kosovo for independence. Thus, very
quickly, Kosovo could change from being the autonomous region
envisioned in the Paris peace agreement to a quasi-independent
statelet, on the border of Albania and Macedonia where restive
Albanian populations would be eager to redraw their borders.
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of the administration's Kosovo policy has been
that independence of Kosovo is unacceptable. Kosovo should remain,
at least, for the next three years, an autonomous part of Serbia
and not set a precedent for breakaway ethnic groups in Europe, the
administration has argued.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Comcast Corp. said Monday that it would acquire
MediaOne in a $53 billion merger that will create the third largest
cable television company in the nation but has little to do with
television.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is driven by the cable industry's race with telephone
companies to offer superfast access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the only two industries that have communication cables
passing almost every house and business in the country, cable and
telephone companies are positioning themselves to grab a share of
the other's business. Indeed, AT&AMP;T earlier this year paid $55
billion for the cable provider TeleCommunications Inc. just to get
access to wires that can carry phone and Internet services in homes
along with television.
</P>
<P>
   The local Bell phone companies will begin offering high-speed
Internet access over standard telephone lines this year throughout
much of the country. This leaves cable operators facing a kind of
competitive threat unknown in their local television monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether or how much the merger would
affect rates for cable customers, though it is certain they will
not go down.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons MediaOne was willing to be acquired is that it
will reduce the cost the combined company pays for cable
programming. But those savings _ as well as any increases in cable
rates as industry regulation ends this year _ will almost certainly
be invested in technology to provide data services, and eventually
phone services, to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a race to be first to offer Internet access and
ultimately telephone service to the upscale neighborhoods that will
buy it first,'' said Howard Anderson, president of the Yankee
Group, a media consulting firm. ``It's called the `first move
advantage.' If customers go with the phone companies, it will be
hard, if not impossible to lure them back to cable. So cable
companies want to get big so they have as much cash flow as they
need to build their Internet business. Size is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast's president, Brian Roberts, said that both Comcast and
MediaOne had raised their rates 5 percent last year, which he
called a conservative increase. And he made a point of warning that
any attempt by the Federal Communications Commission to institute
price controls on cable rates would harm cash flow that the
companies have been investing in upgrading their systems to handle
Internet and phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ambrust, an analyst at Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates, a media
consulting firm, said the 5 percent increase imposed last year by
both companies was ``middle of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has six million cable subscribers, primarily along the
Northeast corridor from Baltimore through Washington, Delaware,
Philadelphia, New Jersey and Connecticut. MediaOne has about five
million customers, most of them in the Boston area, though it also
has cable systems in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia-based Comcast, with a market value of $24.4
billion, is controlled and managed by the Roberts family through
9.4 million shares that carry 15 votes each. That gives the family
80 percent of all votes. Individual investors own 30 million shares
of single-vote stock, and 328.6 million shares of nonvoting stock
are owned by institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Since MediaOne is valued at $41.7 billion, its president, Chuck
Lillis, was asked at a news conference why it was not his company
that was doing the acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roberts didn't want to sell,'' Lillis said.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, MediaOne was the more obvious takeover target. A
spinoff of U.S. West, it is the only large _ and still independent
_ cable company that is not controlled by a single shareholder or
family. And it is viewed as having significant room for improved
management. Compared with Comcast, whose profit margins on cable
operations are about 48 percent, MediaOne has margins of about 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast is offering 1.1 of its shares for each of MediaOne's 664
million shares. The Roberts family will keep control because all
the shares being offered are nonvoting stock. Based on the closing
stock prices on Friday, before the deal was announced, Comcast was
paying $80.16 a share,
</P>
<P>
   The one glitch in the deal could be MediaOne's relationship with
Time Warner. MediaOne owns 25 percent of Time Warner Entertainment,
the spinoff that includes Warner Bros., Home Box Office and 10
million of Time Warner's 12 million cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his father, Ralph, the company's 79-year-old founder
and chairman, both said Time Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, has
been extremely supportive of the deal. But some bankers and others
suggested that Time Warner, with a market capitalization of $80
billion, could play spoiler by making its own bid for MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have blocking rights on the sale of MediaOne,'' a Time
Warner spokesman said, emphasizing that it had no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast's Brian Roberts insisted that Time Warner had no such
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides agreed that once the merger was complete, the
combined company will not get MediaOne's seat on the management
committee of Time Warner cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Still deals are like courtships, and an unexpected rival can
inspire possessive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As one investment banker put it: ``On the one hand, MediaOne has
been sitting there for two years, no one made a bid, and Time
Warner is the most logical guy given that they already have an
interest.'' He added, ``When somebody says speak now or forever
hold your peace,'' that can prompt a move.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in Comcast fell $5.375 on Monday to close at $64.75 while
stock in MediaOne rose $7.75 to close at 68.50.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast said cash flow for the merged companies in 2000 would be
about about $1.9 billion after all cost savings had been factored
in. Brian Roberts said he planned a 5 percent cut to the combined
34,000-person work force. Assuming those improvements, Comcast
would be paying about 15 times MediaOne's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is the upper end of recent transactions,'' said
Salvatore Muio, who heads his own investment management firm.
``However in a stock deal, that is rather meaningless, since the
stock price fluctuates.''
</P>
<P>
   When the merger is complete, MediaOne shareholders will own
about 64 percent of the equity of the combined companies. Using
Friday's closing prices, Comcast paid $80.16 per share, based on
its closing price of $72.875. That represented a 32 percent premium
to Friday's close of $60.75.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Salomon Smith Barney and Davis Polk Wardell
represented Comcast as bankers and legal advisers respectively.
MediaOne's investment bankers were Lehman Bros and Allen &AMP; Co. Weil
Gotshal and Manges were legal advisers.

REPORTS OF ABUSE OF ELDERLY ARE IGNORED, PANEL IS TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Ind., La.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Complaints about the abusive treatment of elderly
people in nursing homes are often ignored for many months by state
and federal officials, congressional investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of people who have died in nursing homes told Congress
they were outraged that no one had looked into their complaints
about substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Scanlon, director of health care studies at the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said
that the federal government would spend $39 billion on nursing home
care this year, but that complaints about serious harm to nursing
home residents ``often go uninvestigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Scanlon said, federal officials do little to prod,
supervise or monitor the states, which are responsible for the
initial investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon and two relatives of nursing home residents testified at
a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, headed by Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office found that one-fourth of the nation's
17,000 nursing homes had deficiencies that caused ``immediate
jeopardy or actual harm'' to residents. Most fines and other
penalties proposed by the federal government are never actually
imposed, and nursing homes that correct deficiencies often violate
the law again, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Seckman, acting president of the American Health Care
Association, a trade group for nursing homes, said that inspectors
often focused on ``technical violations posing no jeopardy to
residents.'' The government often seemed more eager to punish
nursing homes than to work with them to fix problems, Seckman said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced a major initiative to improve the
quality of care in nursing homes last July, but the accounting
office found that problems persisted in many states.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said the states had failed to investigate hundreds of
complaints like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Baltimore nursing home had no hot water for months at a
time. A resident was ``sitting in urine for extended periods of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A resident of a Detroit nursing home fell, shattered her hip
and complained of pain, but X-rays were not taken for three days,
and then only after the family demanded attention for her.
</P>
<P>
   _ A patient at another Michigan nursing home had maggots in the
sores of his feet, but the staff would not send him to a hospital
because the home's nursing director feared that a state agency
would be called in to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   _ At a Seattle nursing home, ``call lights'' were not answered,
and residents received incorrect medications.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on March 8, the Senate Aging Committee invited
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the federal Health Care
Financing Administration, to testify at Monday's hearing. But the
Clinton administration refused to testify, saying the committee had
violated protocol by allowing ordinary citizens to testify prior to
officials from the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Senators of both parties said the administration's demand was
petty and unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally unacceptable,'' said Sen. John Breaux of
Louisiana, the senior Democrat on the committee. Sen. Evan Bayh,
D-Ind., said the administration was acting ``in a fit of
bureaucratic pique.'' Grassley said the administration's refusal to
testify suggested that it was not serious about responding to
consumers' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the HCFA, said he agreed
that ``we need stricter standards for the prompt investigation of
serious complaints.'' States will now have to investigate any
complaint of ``actual harm'' to a nursing home resident within 10
working days, Hash said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Gloria Cruz, told the committee that she had been
frustrated in efforts to get Maryland authorities to investigate
the death of her grandmother in October, one week after being
released from a Baltimore nursing home. Ms. Cruz said she filed a
complaint asserting that the nursing home had been negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz said a Maryland health official told her that the state
authorities were very busy because they received 80 complaints a
month and had to ``deal with the live residents before they deal
with the dead ones.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Carol Benner, director of licensing and
certification at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene, said: ``I would hope that my staff would not be that
insensitive. This nursing home did not have a poor track record. We
investigate complaints immediately when we can make a difference.
But if a resident has died, we can investigate at a later time
because it's clear that the investigation won't have an impact on
that resident.''

NATO POISED FOR AIRSTRIKES ON SERB FORCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S.-led NATO forces made final preparations for
airstrikes against Serbian military positions amid last-minute
pressure Monday on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to
sign a Kosovo peace agreement and allow international troops to
police the deal.
</P>
<P>
   An aerial bombardment by NATO and a spirited response from
sophisticated Yugoslav air-defense installations could lead to the
most high-powered military conflict in Europe since World War II.
Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said Yugoslavia would respond to
airstrikes ``with all the resources we have.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned Milosevic in statements from Washington as U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke held yet another face-to-face talk with the
Yugoslav leader in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of military action,'' Holbrooke said
before he met with Milosevic. After four hours of talks with
Milosevic, Holbrooke advised Clinton administration leaders in
Washington that there had been no significant progress, U.S.
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke reported by a secured telephone line to Albright and
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who then briefed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Additional Milosevic-Holbrooke talks were expected Tuesday in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, the U.S. sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on state television in Belgrade, Holbrooke
blamed Milosevic and his top aides for the prospects of military
strikes by NATO. ``They have the power to stop this tragedy,''
Holbrooke said. ``They have the power to reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Milosevic is known for his brinksmanship, Yugoslav
leaders had signaled there was little chance for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``No pressure can change our principled stand,'' Jovanovic said
in a CNN interview before the Milosevic-Holbrook meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a statement at the White House, repeated his
preference for a resolution ``by peaceful means,'' but added: ``If
not, we have to be prepared to act. ... Serbia's mounting
aggression must be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO leaders said they were ready to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very substantial and detailed plan for such an air
campaign, which can be rather long and protracted,'' Gen. Klaus
Naumann, NATO's military chief of staff, said in a CNN interview
from alliance headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the diplomatic push, Russia voiced anew its opposition to
NATO military moves against Serbia, and the U.S. Senate debated
whether use of American forces should require specific
congressional authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, pressed toward a procedural
vote Tuesday on her call for barring U.S. participation in NATO
airstrikes until the House and Senate concur and Clinton lays out a
detailed plan for U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison apparently lacked the votes to cut off debate on her
proposal. Clinton planned to call a bipartisan group of House and
Senate members to the White House on Tuesday in a bid to dampen
congressional criticism of the policy as the prospect of airstrikes
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison conceded ``timing is bad'' for the debate, ``but I
don't know when it gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we go bombing sovereign nations, we ought to have a
plan,'' she said. ``Before we put one American in harm's way, I
want to know what is the intention here. What is the reality?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., responded that the measure could lead
to ``a policy of paralysis.'' Biden, senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said the only question for NATO is:
``What will happen if we don't act?''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Milosevic as a cold-blooded murderer, Biden recited
graphic details of the killing reportedly being carried out now by
Serb forces against the ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   If there are NATO airstrikes, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said, the ``immediate goal is to degrade the ability to repress the
Kosovar people.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright denied reports the United States was also considering
use of ground troops unless Milosevic agrees to a peace deal and
allows NATO forces to help police the deal. Albanian Kosovars have
signed off on such a plan, but Milosevic has rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans for a ground part of this,'' Albright said.
``We obviously have an intention for Americans to be part of a NATO
implementation force. But there are no plans to use ground forces
as a part of this initial strike activity or follow-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the principal republic in
Yugoslavia and is populated primarily with ethnic Albanians. When
many of the Albanians intensified their separatist drive last year,
Milosevic responded with a military crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting raged in portions of Kosovo on Monday between
government forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, news
services reported. Several villages were ablaze, and there were
unconfirmed reports of new mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Serb forces are now engaged in further
attacks on Kosovar civilians,'' Clinton said. ``Already more than
40,000 Serb security forces are poised in and around Kosovo with
additional units on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart reported ``tens of thousands of new refugees heading
back to the mountains, all of this bringing us closer to the
humanitarian crisis we've been working very hard to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   And the spokesman was clear on Clinton's view of Milosevic. Does
the U.S. president trust Milosevic, the White House spokesman was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people have been killed in the year of conflict,
and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic criticized NATO's move toward airstrikes in a letter
to the British and French foreign ministers read on Yugoslavian
state television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your people should be ashamed, because you are getting ready
to use force against a small European nation because it protects
its territory against separatism and its people against
terrorism,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was ``strong unity'' among NATO allies for
air raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that we cannot allow President Milosevic to
continue the aggression with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton had written President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia to again detail the rationale for NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are categorically against the use of force against
Yugoslavia,'' Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
reporters in Moscow as he prepared for a trip to Washington on
Tuesday. ``We believe that political levers to influence the
situation are far from being exhausted yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, however, said that the United States and its allies
``have gone the last mile here. ... Time has run out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said a NATO decision to launch airstrikes ``is not
constrained by the timing of Prime Minister Primakov's visit'' to
Washington.

CRUISE LINE PLEADS GUILTY TO UNTRUTHS ON DUMPING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In a surprise move, Royal Caribbean Cruises pleaded guilty
Monday to criminal charges of making false statements to Coast
Guard inspectors in an effort to conceal discharges of oily waste
water from one of its ships on three separate occasions in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The company pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
to all three counts of an indictment brought last month. The plea
was entered without any agreement with prosecutors on sentencing
and came as a surprise to government prosecutors. The company faces
fines of at least $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief hearing before Judge Consuelo Marshall, an attorney
for Royal Caribbean, Jan Handzlik, admitted that crew members
aboard the Nordic Prince presented records concealing illegal
discharges of contaminated waste water into the Pacific Ocean three
times in 1994 during routine Coast Guard inspections. The ship
regularly sailed from Mexico to Los Angeles and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   William Carter, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case,
said outside the courtroom that the ship's record books were
replete with false entries intended to hide the fact that the
ship's pollution-control equipment was not functioning. Carter said
investigations into similar false bookkeeping were continuing in
New York and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty in Miami and in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, to similar charges covering the same period of
time involving five ships, including the Nordic Prince. Those pleas
were the result of a plea bargain, but Justice Department officials
said the agreement did not limit the government's authority to
bring additional charges in other jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The charges to which Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty last June
represented the largest criminal case of ocean pollution ever and
focused attention on difficulties in regulating the fast-growing
cruise industry, in which every major ship sailing out of American
ports is registered with a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment at the
Justice Department, said the Los Angeles charges were based on
conduct that was distinct and independent from the actions covered
by the Miami and San Juan plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its earlier agreements, the company instituted new
environmental regulations aboard its ships and began installing new
pollution-control equipment to reduce its discharges to well below
international and U.S. requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean, the world's second-largest cruise company, had
fought the original charges by claiming that its ships operated
outside U.S. jurisdiction because the company was incorporated in
Liberia and its ships flew Liberian and Norwegian flags. But
federal judges in San Juan and Miami rejected the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys had speculated that the company might raise
the same jurisdictional question in Los Angeles in the hope of
winning more sympathetic treatment, but Monday's plea seemed to
indicate that Royal Caribbean has abandoned that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Martenstein, a vice president for the cruise company at its
Miami headquarters, declined to discuss the company's legal
strategy or the status of the other criminal inquiries. But she
indicated that Royal Caribbean wants to end the string of
embarrassing cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that what was done was wrong,'' she said.
``We have acknowledged these incidents. We've already apologized.
We've already paid a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   While each of the three counts in the Los Angeles case carries a
potential $500,000 fine, the ultimate fine could be much higher.
The law allows the judge to assess penalties equal to twice the
revenue gained from each of the cruises involved in the guilty
plea. Carter said the government was still trying to calculate the
revenue from the cruises.

<P>
   RANALAI, India _ The Christian settlement here _ until this
month a thriving community of 1,200 Baptists _ is now a smoldering
ruin. Women stumble through jagged remains of mud walls and step
over charred beams, beating their chests, sifting the ashes through
their fingers and crying out in sorrow for the homes they have
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Christians have lived here, in Orissa state, since the 1930s,
and by all accounts it was a place where they and their less
numerous Hindu neighbors lived in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas, Hindus came to the modest, tin-roofed Baptist
church bearing gifts. And each year the Christians hiked up Kharam
Hill to apply fresh paint to a big white cross on a giant boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cross had been there since before I was born,'' said K.S.
Surya, a school principal and a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   It was this public symbol of their faith that was the source of
the conflict that led to the destruction of their community.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians here in Ranalai say local members of the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which now leads a national
coalition government, used the symbol to stir up animosities, but
the local head of the party denies it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Bharat Paik, president of the party here in the Gajapati
district, accuses the Christians of burning down their own houses.
His charge is the same one made by Hindu nationalists in Gujarat,
in the west, who accused Christians of burning down their own
prayer halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the Christians have the cross on the hill?'' Paik
asked. ``The hill was not leased to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began on the night of March 8. Someone climbed
Kharam Hill carrying a bucket of whitewash and turned the Christian
cross into a trident, symbol of the Hindu god Shiva, by painting a
horn on each end of the horizontal bar.
</P>
<P>
   The next day village elders formed a peace committee of six
Christians and six Hindus to resolve the problem. They met under a
mango tree in front of the small schoolhouse and agreed they would
let the cross be slowly cleaned by rain. The Christians would no
longer give it a fresh coat of whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   But the morning of March 13, villagers awoke to find that
someone had washed away the horns that had made the cross a
trident.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions festered for two days. Then on March 15, Christians
called the local police to report the problem. Three police
officials came to the village that day and another peace committee
meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Christians _ 200 to 250 households _ and the
Hindus _ about 50 households _ agreed that Hindus would whitewash
the boulder, obliterating both symbols.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell and the meeting ended, men from the two
communities shook hands. The police, confident of a successful
resolution, did not call for reinforcements. Late the next morning,
about 150 Hindus gathered at the boulder, whitewashed it and then
came back down to the village through the sultry, hazy heat.
</P>
<P>
   The police say someone threw a rock that hit a Hindu on the
forehead. Rumors of attack began to spread. Sanjeev Marik, the
divisional police chief, said events cascaded out of control. The
Christians say they believe that what happened next was planned in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Rocks began to fly. People were screaming and yelling. Some
Hindus pulled out homemade guns and shot three Christians in their
legs.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the hullabaloo, Hindus from nearby villages began
converging on Ranalai. Kamison Karado, a Christian villager, said
he saw Hindus pouring gasoline on the thatched rooftops of
Christian homes, then throwing matches. They shouted, ``Victory to
Lord Ram!'' another Hindu god.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians fled to a field, where they watched their
community go up in flames. Not a single one of their homes was left
untouched. More than 150 mud huts were gutted by fire, and the rest
were looted. ``They took everything, even the cot,'' said Manual
Karado, a pastor who lives in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the Christian part of the village was still
smoking. Chito Karar, in a pink sari, walked back and forth through
what had been her mud hut, singing her woes in a keening lament.
``Oh my God! The whole house is burned,'' she sang in Oriya, her
native language. ``The utensils are burned. The rice is burned. The
clothes are burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Just behind her lay the Hindu part of the village, where the
homes were untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The police have arrested more than 40 people suspected of
involvement in the attacks, most of them Hindus. None of the Hindu
villagers would give their names or talk. One said only: ``We did
not burn their houses. We do not know who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few steps away, some of the state's highest ranking police
officers sat under the mango tree where the peace committee had
met, musing about what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is the opium of life,'' said Kulamoni Deo, the
state's inspector general of police. ``It is a very personal thing
you do in your house. Why did they paint the cross in a public
space? Is it for propaganda?''
</P>
<P>
   Marik, the divisional police chief, said that it was logical to
ask why the cross became a source of conflict now, but that he had
no real answer. Nor did he see any direct evidence that the
Bharatiya Janata Party or any other Hindus had been involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go asking questions that way,'' Marik said, ``then
Jesus and Rama are the cause. You could say these two fellows are
responsible. If you look at it that way, there's no end to it.''

U.N. WARNS U.S. TO PAY DUES OR LOSE ASSEMBLY VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States will need to pay at least
$250 million to the United Nations this year if it is to avoid
losing its vote in the General Assembly, the U.N.'s senior
financial officer has warned.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Connor, undersecretary general for finance and
management, pointed out that the figure was appreciably more than
the $197 million that the United States paid toward the end of last
year to avoid losing its vote in the Assembly this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, a country cannot vote in
the General Assembly if its total unpaid dues exceed the sum of its
total assessments for the last two years. The U.S. vote in the
Security Council, which is far more powerful than the General
Assembly, would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said it was becoming increasingly difficult for the
United States to avoid losing its vote for two reasons. The first
is the cost of peacekeeping operations is falling rapidly. That
reduces the assessment, increasing the risk that total U.S. debts
to the United Nations of $1.6 billion would exceed its last two
annual membership bills.
</P>
<P>
   A second difficulty is the tendency for Congress to place
conditions on U.N. payments like freezing the budget and seeking
assurances that the organization will not create an international
army.
</P>
<P>
   That slows the rate at which the administration can hand over
the money, after congressional approval, Connor said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking change in the U.N. finances he discussed was
the decline in peacekeeping costs. After bumping along for most of
the U.N.'s history at about $400 million a year, the peacekeeping
budget took off in 1992, climbing rapidly to more than $3 billion
in 1994 and 1995. But 1996 brought a sharp decline, to just under
$1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The budget has fallen further, to an expected $900 million this
year, and it is projected at $650 million in 1999, after decisions
to phase out operations in Angola and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said the U.N. financial position, usually precarious, was
better in a number of ways at the end of 1998 than it has been for
years. At $736 million, its cash reserves were higher than at the
end of 1997 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Unpaid dues are also lower than in those two years, at $2
billion. And unpaid debts to member states to cover peacekeeping
troops and military equipment are also slightly lower, $872
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, 117 member countries had paid their
dues in full.

U.S. DESIGNATES 6 POWER PLANTS TO BURN STOCKPILED PLUTONIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., S.C., Va.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department chose six commercial nuclear
power plants Monday, in the Carolinas and Virginia, to burn
plutonium from nuclear weapons stockpiles, and chose a consortium
involving Duke Power Co., Stone &AMP; Webster and Cogema Inc., a French
nuclear company, to make the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department will pay the consortium $130 million to
design a plant to make the fuel, but will not ask Congress for
money to build the plant until progress is made in negotiations
with Russia to dispose of its own weapons plutonium, department
officials said Monday. President Clinton and President Boris
Yeltsin have agreed in principle that each side should dispose of
50 tons of plutonium, enough for thousands of bombs, either by
using it as reactor fuel or mixing it with highly radioactive
waste. The Energy Department is trying to do both.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which faces opposition from some safety advocates, is
to run the reactors on a mix of 33 percent to 40 percent plutonium
and enriched uranium, which the plants were designed to use.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are: Catawba 1 and 2, near York, S.C., which are
owned by several municipal electric companies and Duke; McGuire 1
and 2, near Huntersville, N.C., which are owned by Duke alone, and
North Anna 1 and 2, owned by Virginia Electric and Power Co., near
Mineral, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a swords-to-ploughshares type program,'' Mike Tuckman,
executive vice president of nuclear generation at Duke Power, said
in a conference call with reporters. ``Quite frankly, I have
difficulty understanding why anybody would be opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Duke, owned by Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte,
N.C., and Virginia Power, owned by Dominion Resources Inc., would
save money on fuel by using the plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   But several nuclear experts are critical of the plans. The
Nuclear Control Institute, an antiproliferation group based in
Washington, argues that a plutonium core makes a nuclear accident
slightly more likely. In addition, according to the group, moving
plutonium into civilian reactors would create security problems:
The fuel would have to be guarded until it was loaded into the
reactor, because it could be stolen and turned back into weapons
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, a nonprofit
group that studies the safety of manufacturing nuclear weapons,
says the environmental record of some of the European partners is
poor.

BELCHER IS BIG BONUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Angels signed pitcher Tim Belcher last Dec.
18 to a two-year contract worth $10.2 million to provide innings
and veteran leadership. The Angels expect him to pitch deep into
games and give them a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   The club also got a little bonus in Belcher _ an opening-day
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chuck Finley's sore neck has put him behind in his
preparation for the season, Belcher will make his third career
opening-day start. He started the opener for the Dodgers in 1989
and for the Royals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins has not told Belcher that he's got
the assignment yet. He's a little superstitious. ``I've told guys
early and the next thing you know. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Collins conceded that Belcher, 37, is smart enough to figure it
out for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher will pitch in one more Cactus League game on March 27.
On April 1, he'll pitch in a minor-league camp game in Mesa to
remain on his normal rotation while the rest of the team takes the
day off. On opening day April 6, he will start against the
Cleveland Indians at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher made 88 pitches in 52/3 innings Monday against the San
Diego Padres, giving up three runs (none earned) and five hits in
the Angels' 8-5 win. He did not allow a hit until the fifth, when
the Padres scored three times, aided by two Angels errors.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a guy thing: Catcher Phil Nevin had four hits Monday,
but it shouldn't have come as a surprise. He had a new coat of
toenail polish applied Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin said his daughter painted his toenails one night last year
after he fell asleep and the next day, he hit a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin had a big day despite getting whacked on top of the head
and knocked woozy when hit by Gary Matthews Jr.'s bat on Matthews'
follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mo knows: First baseman Mo Vaughn had a double, single, two
walks and one RBI, both of his hits going to the opposite (left)
field and both with two strikes and with men on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to situational-hit as much as I can,'' Vaughn said. ``I
really try to concentrate on that, that's what you work on. You get
up with guys in scoring position, you've got to get them in.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New York City's Police Commissioner Howard Safir
came under mounting criticism, 141 people, including State
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, were arrested Monday in the largest act
of civil disobedience yet protesting the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was held just after Safir was forced to defend his
officers at a City Council hearing into the police department's
street crime unit. Four officers from that unit fired a total of 41
shots at Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant, killing him in
the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, Safir's aides said that he might not testify
at the City Council hearing because of a scheduling conflict. But
after being photographed at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles on
Sunday night, the commissioner flew back to New York to attend the
hearing at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Monday's protest _ several hundred marched
outside police headquarters in lower Manhattan, and the number of
arrests was the highest yet in protests in the case _ indicated
that public anger over Diallo's shooting showed no signs of abating
nearly seven weeks after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' McCall, the highest-ranking black
elected official in New York State, blocked the entrance to police
headquarters and was arrested along with Earl G. Graves, the
publisher of Black Enterprise magazine; Ed Lewis, the publisher of
Essence magazine; the comedian Dick Gregory, and dozens of lawyers
and several City Council members fresh from their hearing on the
police department.
</P>
<P>
   All were handcuffed, following police guidelines, as Rep.Charles
Rangel, D-Harlem, and former Mayor David Dinkins were last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the main political drama on Monday was at the city council
hearing, where council members had been eagerly awaiting a chance
to question Safir, only to be rebuffed by his office over the last
few days. Police officials refused to say whether Safir's
scheduling conflict with the council hearing involved the Oscars,
but the photos of the commissioner in Los Angeles in black tie
proved embarrassing, given what was going on back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was completely private,'' Marilyn Mode, a police
spokeswoman, said of the commissioner's trip. ``This was his
weekend off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said that he had no problem with Safir's
trip to the Academy Awards ceremony. ``He has every right to some
degree of relaxation, like every other human being,'' the mayor
said on Monday after returning from a speaking engagement in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer _ who was
arrested in Monday's protest and spent about six hours at the
Seventh Precinct station house before being released _ said that he
thought the out-of-town trip sent the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a police commissioner at the Oscars last night.
There was a mayor golfing in Arizona,'' he said. ``They both have
been in denial about the pain this is causing the city. They both
seem not to get it, not to understand that we have submitted
ourselves voluntarily for arrest not for fun, but to send a
message.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attending the Oscars, Safir went to a party held
by Tina Brown, the former New Yorker editor, for her new magazine,
called Talk. Andrew Stengel, a spokesman for Miramax Films, which
owns the magazine, said that Safir had been invited to the party by
Ron Galotti, the magazine's publisher, who is a close friend of the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Safir cut his trip short to return for
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In defending Safir, the mayor also addressed suggestions over
the weekend by Gov. George Pataki that Giuliani has not responded
well to criticism over the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've done everything we can to try to deal with this
in a sensitive and emotional and rational way,'' Giuliani said,
pointing to a series of efforts ranging from his attempts to help
the Diallo family to new sensitivity training now given to officers
of the street crime unit and the drive to attract more city
residents to the police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can to try to deal with the pain and
suffering that this causes _ because there's no question it causes
a great deal of pain and suffering,'' said the mayor, who did not
mention Pataki by name.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking to a class at Pace University, former Police
Commissioner William Bratton said that he agreed with the Rev. Al
Sharpton that Giuliani does not grasp the depth of feeling in black
and Hispanic neighborhoods about police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Sharpton has clearly indicated that he doesn't
believe the mayor fully understands the feeling of the minority
community about this issue,'' Bratton said. ``I share that opinion.
The mayor is going to have to understand that these demonstrations
are reflections of a deep-rooted feeling, particularly in the
minority community, that something is not working the way it should
as it relates to police and community relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir, too, adopted a conciliatory tone in his opening remarks
to the city council. ``There's been a lot of rhetoric around the
city,'' he said, ``and I think the kind of dialogue we're having
here today is the kind of dialogue that's really needed to bring
the kind of healing to the city that reasonable people need to talk
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called to examine the street crime unit, which
has come under growing scrutiny since the shooting of Diallo. The
unit, which is assigned to high crime areas and is charged with
taking illegal guns off the streets, is already the subject of a
Federal civil rights investigation into whether its officers stop
and search people without probable cause in their quest to make gun
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Safir defended the unit. ``My view is, and I
believe that the facts and figures will bear it out, is that this
unit is one of the prime reasons for the reduction of violent crime
in the city,'' he said, promising to furnish the council with data
next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Sheldon Leffler, the chairman of the council's
public safety committee, said that he had serious concerns about
the unit. He noted that in more than 80 percent of instances when
the unit has stopped and frisked someone, no arrest resulted, and
that roughly half of the unit's gun arrests are eventually thrown
out of court. ``It would seem to me that there's good reason to
think you're engaged in a fishing expedition and a random
approach,'' Leffler said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir vigorously denied that charge.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing grew testy when Safir listed a number of black
leaders whom he has worked with, mentioning Dennis Walcott, the
president of the Urban League, Sadique Wai of the United African
Congress and Roy Innis of the Congress for Racial Equality, who has
often sided with Republican causes.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Robinson, a city councilwoman from Brooklyn, slammed her
hand down on the table and shouted, ``That's an insult!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson later joined the protesters being arrested outside
police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   One person noticeably absent from the protest was former Mayor
Edward Koch, who had planned to get himself arrested but was
instead hospitalized Monday morning with low blood pressure. In
contrast to earlier protests, those in recent days have drawn more
moderate political figures, like McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to go to jail because I think it is
appropriate,'' McCall said before his arrest. ``I think I have a
moral obligation to make this statement today in the hope that it
will bring about reconciliation and healing, which is so badly
needed in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   The politicians were joined by dozens of lawyers _ some in Legal
Aid Society caps, others in pinstriped suits and at least one
wearing a bow tie _ who noisily decried the shooting before they,
too, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Kuby, a Manhattan trial and civil rights lawyer, led the
lawyers in what has now become a familiar chant in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we want?'' Kuby asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice!'' his fellow lawyers chanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do we want it?'' Kuby asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now!'' they replied.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, police officers arrested the lawyers, affixing
plastic flex-cuffs to them and taking them by van to police station
houses for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters were not released until six hours later,
and police officials blamed the delays on problems with a computer
that determines whether those arrested have outstanding warrants
against them.

RUSSIA WILL FIGHT ANTI-SEMITIC TIDE, PRIMAKOV TELLS U.S. JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised a group of
American Jews Monday that the Russian government will combat a
rising tide of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov provided the assurance in a meeting with
representatives of the Anti-Defamation League. The Kremlin has
condemned anti-Semitism, but Primakov has previously said little
about the problem, although he has Jewish family roots.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to fly to Washington on Tuesday to seek Western
financial credits, however, he spoke out in an apparent effort to
set a positive tone for his mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say unambiguously that the government takes a very strong
position against any manifestation of nationalism, including
anti-Semitism,'' Primakov told the Jewish group, its
representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   They also said that Primakov promised to support new legislation
to clamp down on fascist and extremist groups. He was reported to
have said that he wants Jews to feel at home in Russia and to have
condemned the anti-Semitic tirades of Albert Makashov, a former
general and a Communist lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Makashov has to be condemned fair and square
and unambiguously for his pronouncements in an open and undisguised
way,'' Primakov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of Russia's currency in August, there have
been growing incidents of anti-Semitism. Many Jews in Moscow say
they do not feel in danger, but the problem is more serious in the
provinces. Earlier this month, for example, the lone synagogue in
the Siberian city of Novosibirsk was vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   Makashov has been one of the most vitriolic leaders of the
anti-Semitic crusade. He has blamed Jews for the nation's economic
ills. In a recent speech in southern Russian city of Rostov, he
virtually invited Cossacks to sack Jewish homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist-led parliament, however, has declined to condemn
him. On Friday, 104 members voted to censure Makashov while 133
rejected the measure. Instead, the parliament charged that the
press is exaggerating the danger of Russian fascism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primakov plans to meet on Thursday in the United States with a
group of American Jews. Abraham Foxman, the national director of
the Anti-Defamation league, said Primakov's remarks Monday were
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is his first significant public statement condemning not
only anti-Semitism in Russia but the specific utterances of
Makashov,'' Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel also met here with
Primakov Monday and expressed concern over anti-Semitism and the
sale of Russian missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu indicated in an interview on Russian television that
he was prepared to discuss cooperation on high-technology projects
and the possible purchase of air defense systems from Russia. That
could be an incentive to Russia to cut off the sale of missile
technology to Iran, a top Israeli and American priority.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at a Moscow Synagogue on Sunday, Netanyahu condemned
anti-Semitism and invited Russian Jews to immigrate to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible epidemic, which is above all dangerous for
the society in which it is developing,'' he said. ``I want you to
come to Israel, but the choice is in your hands.''

EDITORIAL: A NEW THREAT TO IRISH PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 23: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's peace agreement is facing the most serious
crisis of its 11 months of life. David Trimble, the Protestant
Unionist who is first minister of Northern Ireland's new assembly,
is set to appoint a cabinet of 10 ministers, 2 of them from the
IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein. But he will do so only if the IRA
starts to turn over its buried weapons and explosives. Such
disarmament, while not required now under the peace agreement, is
clearly reasonable. The IRA's refusal to begin even token
disarmament could destroy the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA would be more likely to compromise if weapons alone were
the issue. But more important to IRA hard-liners are the IRA
fighters who preceded them, whose memory, they feel, would be
dishonored by disarmament. Symbolism, not military need, is driving
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape of modern civil war is strewn with agreements
wrecked over disarmament. A 1994 peace treaty for Angola required
the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi's organization to turn in its guns.
It did not, and last year used them to restart the war. After
Cambodia's civil war ended in 1991, the U.N. failed to disarm Hun
Sen's forces. He then threatened his way back into power after
losing an election.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in Northern Ireland is that disarmament, or
decommissioning, should matter little. Urban terrorism requires
only bombs easily built after a trip to a hardware and gardening
store. Unlike Savimbi and Hun Sen, who wanted power, not peace,
Sinn Fein's leaders have staked their lives on peace. Some in the
IRA may desire more violence, but it is credible that the
organization has genuinely changed.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the IRA so determined to keep all its weapons now? In
part because disarmament is a symbol of trust, which many Catholics
do not feel. In El Salvador, the guerrillas turned over most of
their weapons to the United Nations after the war ended. They felt
safe in part because former guerrillas were joining a new civilian
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholics in Northern Ireland do not yet have this sense of
security. The latest illustration was the murder March 15 of the
attorney Rosemary Nelson, who had defended a man accused of an IRA
killing of two police officers. She said she had received death
threats from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's
overwhelmingly Protestant police. Her accusation is credible to
many Catholics because there is evidence of possible official
complicity in previous killings. One is the 1989 murder of Patrick
Finucane, a lawyer with accused IRA clients. The British government
has asked a constable from England and the American FBI to
supervise the RUC investigation into Ms. Nelson's death. But the
RUC cannot be impartial. Britain assigned London police the task of
investigating threats against Ms. Nelson. It must also take the
investigation of her death out of RUC hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders argue that Trimble is making demands not
required by the peace agreement, while changes wanted by Catholics,
such as police reform, are still far off. This is correct, but
misses the point that Protestants also lack trust. Many do not
believe the IRA has really changed. In part because of the IRA's
refusal to disarm, the peace agreement is in serious danger of
rejection by Protestants in the assembly. Allowing Sinn Fein
ministers into the cabinet before the IRA turns over a single gun
is seen by Protestant groups as surrender.
</P>
<P>
   London and, notably, Dublin have sided with Trimble on this
issue. They are asking the IRA to make at least a symbolic start
toward disarmament. The IRA _ and Protestant paramilitaries, which
are also declining to disarm _ have so far refused. ``The dead
control the thinking of the living,'' says Paul Arthur, a professor
of politics at the University of Ulster. Each side constantly asks:
How much can we give up before we betray our dead? They need to be
asking: How much can we hold back before we betray the living?

PHONE CALL COULD MEND A FRACTURED FRIENDSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ He is, as always, standing tall and strong in
the morning sunshine at Joker Marchant Stadium, but there is no
mistaking the pain in Larry Parrish's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It is deep and it is real and he doesn't know exactly how to
make it go away.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when we would both rather be talking about baseball and
starting pitchers and what Parrish, who manages the Tigers now, is
going to do about the nice problem of having too many good, young
outfielders, we're talking about hurt feelings instead.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about friendship and integrity and all those
things that, in the end, are more important than baseball.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about Buddy Bell, who, until Sept. 1, was probably
the closest friend Parrish has had in the game.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't spoken since that day.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours earlier, in Sarasota where Bell is now the
Reds' minor-league director and manager in waiting, I had seen the
same pain on his face, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I want to talk about,'' Bell said quietly.
``It's not an issue with me.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes said something different. It is very much an issue with
Bell, just as it is an issue with Parrish. And it's an issue with
baseball people, who care so much about both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tito told me the other day I needed to call Buddy,'' Parrish
said yesterday before the Rangers and Tigers played an exhibition.
``I've definitely been thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito is Phillies manager Terry ``Tito'' Francona. He and many
others in baseball are as distressed as I am about the falling out
between Bell and Parrish over what amounts to little more than ugly
rumors and misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   They are good men, so much alike, so strong in values and
conviction. They connected instantly when Parrish came to Texas in
1982. They each combined a passion for life and the game they loved
with an essential decency that became the foundation for the
respect and affection they had for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Bell and Larry Parrish: On any list of all-time Rangers,
they're together, right at the top.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it seemed so fitting when they came together again in
Detroit two years ago, Bell as manager and Parrish as his bench
coach. This, you figured, was like reuniting a knife with a fork or
peanut butter with jelly; like Staubach with Pearson, Pippen with
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy and L.P.: This was, again, a perfect pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Together they would resuscitate the moribund Tigers, bringing a
spark back to one of the American League's charter franchises.
</P>
<P>
   And then real life came along and spoiled it.
</P>
<P>
   First came Bell's firing Sept. 1. Suddenly he was gone and
Parrish was interim manager. He got the job full time in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Happens in baseball every year. A manager gets canned, a coach
the manager had brought in as his right-hand man is asked to step
into the job. It's not particularly pleasant for anyone involved,
but it's the way the game too often works.
</P>
<P>
   Except this time the greatest casualty is a 17-year friendship.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the situation is what part, if any, Parrish
played in Bell's firing. Did he privately second-guess his friend's
baseball decisions? Was that confidence betrayed?
</P>
<P>
   It has become almost a ``he-said, no-he-said'' situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard anything about this was a few days after
Buddy was fired and Al Kaline came back from a card show in New
York,'' Parrish said. ``He told me Buddy was up there ripping me,
saying I'd back-stabbed him. I said, `Whaaaaat?' ''
</P>
<P>
   If either of them had picked up a phone and talked then, you
probably wouldn't be reading this now. They could have talked it
out. But pride and stubbornness got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't call me either,'' Parrish said defensively. ``It
hurt me and I didn't think I'd done anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record _ and Bell privately acknowledges this even now _
nothing Parrish did had anything to do with Bell's mutual parting
with the Tigers. Mark that down to irreconcilable differences with
general manager Randy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Friends _ insiders who are close to both men _ say they have no
reason to believe that Parrish said anything derogatory about
Buddy. It would have been totally out of character, based on their
history together.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's loyalty to his friends is unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as loyal a person as you'll ever meet,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Was Parrish, excited about getting his chance to manage in the
big leagues, as sensitive to Bell's feelings about being fired as
he might have been? Perhaps not. Has he changed some things from
the way Buddy did them to put in his own tweaks? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about baseball,'' Parrish said. ``It's
not right or wrong. It's just different ways of doing things. If
anybody said Buddy messed the club up last year, that would be
wrong, because we just weren't that good a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish, sometimes honest to a fault and wanting to be loyal to
his employers, admits he hasn't always handled questions from the
media as well as he might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to answer questions without stepping on
anybody's toes,'' he said, ``and sometimes you step all over them
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   So Parrish puts off the phone call, waiting, trying to figure
out where to start and what to say.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers visit Sarasota, Bell makes sure he's somewhere
else. He puts up a disinterested front, trying to act like all this
doesn't matter anyway, but he's not fooling anyone.
</P>
<P>
   One of them _ Parrish probably, because Buddy feels like he's
the offended party _ needs to pick up the phone and make the call.
</P>
<P>
   It should have happened a long time ago. This is a friendship
worth saving.

IN A FREEWAY LAND WITHOUT A CAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Southern California has for so long been the land of the freeway
that the idea of negotiating it carless seems daunting, even
revolutionary. But as traffic has thickened so that many highways
become eight-lane parking lots during increasingly extended rush
hours, residents and visitors are turning to public transportation
to get around, and municipalities are extending mass transit
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers to far-flung or rural destinations in the region may
still need a car, but for those willing to do a little homework,
getting around Southern California by bus, rail, trolley, subway or
even air can be inexpensive and convenient alternatives to the
frustration and anxiety of the highways.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered this firsthand on a recent bus trip into downtown
San Diego from my home near Mission Bay, about seven miles away. At
the Old Town transit hub, two couples of retirement age got on. In
the four days they had been in town from Sioux City, Iowa, they
said, they had seen a lot of San Diego without a car _ the Zoo, Sea
World, Coronado, Old Town, the harbor (by boat). They recommended
the Old Town Trolley, a narrated tour of much of San Diego that
allows passengers to get on and off wherever they choose.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were delighted with how easy it had been to
travel by bus, trolley, taxi and boat, and with the advice they'd
got from local residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is an excellent resource for information about
traveling around the area. A recent search of ``Southern California
mass transit'' turned up timetables, fares and phone numbers for
train, subway, trolley and bus service and plenty of maps.
</P>
<P>
   James Mohler operates www.transit-rider.com, a site devoted to
mass transit in California with many helpful hints. Another
independent but quirkier site for insider information is Nik
Trendowski's www-scf.usc.edu/maburke/transit/. His
spur-of-the-moment trip by public buses from Los Angeles to San
Diego and back by Amtrak in one day sounded like fun, and he
offered other tales of the bus system and a listing of interesting
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Around Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area sprawls across several counties and is
served by a motley assortment of private and municipal transit
systems. But the new light-rail Blue and Green Lines, and the
nearly finished Red Line subway, in combination with buses and the
new Metrolink commuter train line, can make getting around
manageable, even enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   The metropolitan bus lines have a mixed reputation, with reports
of rude drivers who stop where and when they deem best, but as mass
transit becomes more popular, this may improve.
</P>
<P>
   There are some areas of maximum convenience for those without
cars, besides downtown Los Angeles, which is well served by all
transportation, including Amtrak. Most lines converge there at
Union Station, where the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation
Authority operates one of its customer service centers, which
provide maps, timetables, transit passes, tickets and free bike
permits; it is open Monday to Friday 6 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus fares are $1.35, and
transfers are 25 cents. Weekly passes cost $11; children under 5
ride free.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sgt. Jake Bushey of the Los Angeles Police
Department, security for the MTA system has been handled for the
last two years by the city police. Security within the stations,
and on the trains and buses, includes plainclothes and uniformed
officers patrolling stations and trains along with security
personnel hired by the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is panhandlers at the station exits,'' he
said, with the Hollywood, Wilshire, and downtown stops being the
prime panhandling sites.
</P>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, besides having a lovely pedestrian promenade with
restaurants and theaters, and its famous pier and beach, has the
Big Blue Bus line, with routes connecting to Los Angeles
International Airport (the No. 3 bus) and the Getty Museum (the No.
14), among other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   It also has the Tide Shuttle, a subsidiary service that cruises
up, down and around Santa Monica itself for 50 cents, and the No.
10 express bus ($1.25), which shoots along (or so one hopes) the
Santa Monica Freeway to downtown.
</P>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, at the south end of the Blue Line trolley, has a
free downtown bus service, the Passport, that goes to attractions
like the Queen Mary and the Aquarium of the Pacific, a new
water-taxi service between attractions that costs only $1, and a
visionary Bike Station, a municipally financed center with rentals,
repairs, information and bike parking. Nearby are 33 miles of
bicycle paths around the port.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Transit also operates $2 round-trip buses to the
Getty Museum on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. There is also
regular bus service (90 cents) to the Long Beach Airport, which is
served by the regional carrier Win Air, as well as American West
and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES AIRPORT has frequent shuttles that connect to the
Metro Green Line. From there, a transfer to the Blue Line at the
Rosa Parks station will take travelers north to downtown (at the
Seventh Street Transfer Station, a switch to the Red Line will take
one to Union Station, three stops to the east, or north up to
Wilshire Center).
</P>
<P>
   From the Rosa Parks station, the Blue Line also goes south to
Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ROUTES TO ATTRACTIONS, according to Mohler, include the MTA No.
460 bus, which goes from downtown (it stops at Sixth and Hill
Streets) to the Norwalk Green Line, Knott's Berry Farm and
Disneyland (one can catch this bus from the Norwalk Green Line
station, as well). There is also a bus line, the No. 420-424, from
downtown to Universal Studios and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Line subway is completed in 2000, North Hollywood
will be more accessible from downtown by mass transit. In fact,
five more stations, including Hollywood and Vine, are scheduled to
open June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The popular (and free) Getty Museum is served by the No. 434
bus, in addition to the Big Blue Bus from Santa Monica. The No. 434
also serves Malibu, and is worth a ride, Mohler says, just for a
glimpse of that community.
</P>
<P>
   FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO, the most convenient trip is by
Amtrak, although many airlines offer the 120-mile flight between
Los Angeles International and San Diego International.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has frequent trains in each direction; the trip takes
about 2 hours, 40 minutes, and the standard adult fare is $22. (At
the Fullerton Amtrak stop, passengers can connect across the street
to an Orange County Transportation Authority bus, the No. 43 south,
to Disneyland.)
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound buses also connect the two cities, with a stop in Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Coaster, a commuter line with fewer trains at midday and on
weekends, runs between the Santa Fe depot in downtown San Diego and
Oceanside in north San Diego County. It stops at many interesting
beach towns along the way, like Carlsbad, where Legoland opened on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Around San Diego  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Diego itself is served by an efficient bus line, as well as
a trolley system that covers much of downtown and extends all the
way to Santee in the east and south to the San Ysidro border
crossing, a short walk from Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 992 municipal bus links San Diego International Airport
to the downtown San Diego transit hub in less than 15 minutes, and
stops at all three terminals. At the Transit Store downtown,
visitors can find bus or trolley maps for specific routes.
</P>
<P>
   A new transfer policy allows two hours of travel in any
direction, with bus transfers valid for the trolley and vice versa
(though fare surcharges could apply); a trolley day pass and a
discount ticket package are available. On weekends, up to two
riders 18 and under with a paying adult travel free; monthly passes
allowing unlimited travel on buses and trolleys are $50.
</P>
<P>
   The bus fare is $1.75 (dollar bills are accepted) for most
lines, but the elderly and students pay less. As in Los Angeles,
trolley tickets, $1 and up depending on distance, are sold through
vending machines at all stations, but it is pretty much an honor
system, with tickets checked occasionally by fare inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The north part of San Diego County, in addition to the Coaster
train, also has the new PAL Shuttle bus, which stops at the
Carlsbad Coaster station, Palomar Airport (where you can catch
United Express and American Eagle flights) and Legoland, among
other destinations. Prepaid tickets are $3, half the regular $6
fare.
</P>
<P>
   North County Transit District buses connect most towns in that
part of the county _ from Oceanside to La Jolla to Ramona _ but the
distances involved and the infrequency of the buses (usually about
half an hour) can make getting around a chore.
</P>
<P>
   On Two Wheels
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, bicyclists can transport bikes free on all MTA
buses, almost half of which are equipped with racks in the front,
with most of the remainder to be fitted by June. Some regional bus
lines, like Long Beach Transit, do not handle bikes; in Orange
County, most municipal buses have bike racks.
</P>
<P>
   A piece of advice from Mohler: before getting off the bus,
bicyclists should alert the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Bikes are allowed on MTA railways with a free permit, but not
during rush hours. Metrolink trains, which operate primarily for
commuters and have the most frequent service during rush periods
into and out of downtown Los Angeles (but have very limited weekend
service), also have free space, two bikes per car.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycles can also be taken free onto San Diego municipal and
North County buses; there is space for two bicycles on a rack at
the front of each bus. A permit to take a bike on the trolley costs
$4 at the Transit Store, and is valid for three years (photo
identification necessary).
</P>
<P>
   On the Coaster, bicycles ride free, and are stored on the lower
level of the train, through the doors marked with a bicycle emblem
(this being San Diego, surfboards less than six feet are also
allowed).
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, and for the most part in San Diego, there are
bike paths along the major rivers. The San Gabriel and Los Angeles
River paths are popular with recreational cyclists and, to a lesser
extent, commuters (reconstruction of the Los Angeles River path
should be completed by summer). Esthetics and safety on the paths
should improve as use increases, with call boxes planned for the
future. &QL;

   For Wine Lovers, A Palace in Portugal &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a new addition to the network of government-run inns,
called pousadas, in Portugal: the 31-room Pousada Solar da Rede in
a 17th-century Baroque palace built by the Italian architect
Niccolo Nazzoni. The decor is also 17th century, with reproductions
of furniture of the period.
</P>
<P>
   The palace is set in a 100-acre vineyard and olive and orange

   They had no alphabet and left no documents about their culture.
Most of what is known about the Thracians, who, from the earliest
historical times, occupied land that is now part of Bulgaria,
northern Greece, western Turkey and Romania, came from the writings
of their neighbors, especially the Greeks and the Romans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient Gold: The Wealth of the Thracians, Treasures from the
Republic of Bulgaria,'' which will open Wednesday at the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston, offers some more clues. The exhibition
includes more than 200 gold and silver objects, dating from before
4000 B.C. through 400 A.D., many of them unearthed since the 1970s
from royal tombs and burial mounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists have turned up highly sophisticated artifacts that
depict the Thracians as warriors, masters of horse-drawn chariots,
and skilled goldsmiths and potters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One jug in the exhibition, from the fourth century B.C.,
features two intricately gilded horsemen in trousers and chitons
aiming their spears at a boar, a detailed female bust and a female
head that attaches the handle to the body of the jug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another vessel from the same era is shaped like a helmeted
female head, engraved with a Tree of Life and adorned with a sphinx
atop the handle. A third gold piece, from 1500 B.C., consists of
three ovoid vessels soldered together in an arrangement that
allowed liquids to be mixed and poured together through one spout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient Gold'' also includes royal necklaces, rings and other
jewelry, armor, fancy horse bridles and adornments, chariot
decorations, and bowls and ceremonial objects. They come from 19
Bulgarian museums, and many have never before been out of the
country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient Gold'' will remain at the Museum of Fine Arts until
June 6, then move to the Detroit Institute of Arts, June 27 to Aug.
29. &QL;

   Easter Chase: Bring Your Own Basket &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the Easter season, children visiting New England have a
choice of historical sites for egg hunting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Newport, R.I., the Preservation Society of Newport County is
sponsoring its 10th Annual Easter Egg Hunt and Brunch on the lawn
at Rosecliff, the 1902 white-glazed terra cotta mansion built by
Stanford White and modeled after the Grand Trianon at Versailles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 10 a.m. next Saturday, two concurrent egg hunts will
be held: one for toddlers through age 5, the other for children 6
to 12. Prizes will be awarded to the lucky ones who find the 12
eggs, out of a total of 1,000, that bear the names of the society's
other properties. After the event, an informal brunch of eggs, ham,
fruit and muffins will be served to the children and their
parents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the event for nonmembers is $27.50, $12 for
children 6 to 12 and $3 for the 3 to 5 set. The event, with the
Easter Bunny on hand, will run rain or shine. Reservations are
required. For information, call (401) 847-1000, extension 140 or
150. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In North Bennington, Vt., egg hunting will take place on the
grounds of the Park-McCullough House. This 35-room Victorian
mansion, built in 1865, is operated by the Park-McCullough House
Association and serves as the community center. Sponsored by the
local Lions Club, the hunt for several hundred eggs will begin at
noon on Easter Sunday or, in case of rain, at the same time the
next Sunday, April 11. All ages are welcome, but the event is
intended primarily for younger children. Admission is free.

2 PROPOSED ITALIAN BANK COMBINATIONS WIN FAVOR OF MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Share prices of two big Italian banks sought by domestic
rivals increased in value Monday, reflecting investors' delight
with the premiums that buyers will pay to gain greater size in
Italy's fragmented banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deals _ a stock offer upward of $16 billion by
Unicredito Italiano for Banca Commerciale Italiana, and San
Paolo-IMI's $9.7 billion bid for Banca di Roma, also in stock _
were both disclosed over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Banca Commerciale stock rose nearly 5 percent in Milan trading,
to 7.547 euros, or $8.23, after reaching an intraday high of 7.95
euros. Banca di Roma's shares gained 7 percent, closing at 1.512
euros.
</P>
<P>
   The offers mark the latest in a series of large-scale
combinations among European banks intended to strengthen their
positions for the rapid growth expected as the Continent's
financial markets effectively merge into one. Earlier this month,
Banque Nationale de Paris, one of France's largest, sought to
become the world's largest bank by assets by bidding for two
domestic rivals, Societe Generale and Paribas, and offering more
than $37 billion in stock. Other huge mergers within national
boundaries have taken place over the last year in Spain, Germany
and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's banking system has been particularly sclerotic, the
victim in the past of political intrusion, poor management and weak
or nonexistent financial services. But a decision by the Italian
government in the early 1990s to take the country's state-owned
banks public, new legislation on their independence and the
pressures of European financial unification have started a
transformation of the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the current deals, Unicredito will exchange eight of its
shares for every five of Banca Commerciale, at a 17.5 percent
premium based on Friday's closing stock prices; San Paolo will
exchange two shares for every 19 of Banca di Roma, at an 18 percent
premium.
</P>
<P>
   Banca Commerciale has yet to respond to the offer; Banca di Roma
told San Paolo it is studying the offer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Italian combinations succeed, they will create two big
banking groups _ one led by San Paolo as the nation's largest, with
$308 billion in assets, and the Unicredito-led group second, with
assets of $280 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What is notable about these banking combinations, as well as the
proposed deals in France, is that they are indeed confined to
national boundaries. Some analysts say that in banking, the
obstacles to large mergers and acquisitions across European borders
largely remain blocked by political interests, labor union
resistance and rigid bank ownership structures.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while analysts agreed that the deals could help loosen the
Italian banking industry, they said further reorganization would
probably come within national boundaries before significant mergers
or acquisitions across borders.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hoge, European banking analyst at Credit Suisse First
Boston in London, said foreign bidders were discouraged by
political pressure that they go easy on in cutting jobs. And given
the low return on equity of banks in Italy _ an average of 5
percent _ the motivation for entering the market diminishes. Thus,
he said, with few exceptions, ``instead of outright cross-border
takeovers, what you'll see will be banks taking equity shares in
foreign banks'' without making full acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   That Unicredito and San Paolo should find themselves at the
vanguard of the action is not surprising. Unicredito, which wants
to call the new combined company Eurobanca, is run by Alessandro
Profumo, 42, a former McKinsey banking consultant who is among the
most aggressive modernizers in Italian banking. San Paolo, which
merged last year with the investment bank IMI, has long been a
force in the heavily industrial north of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Major institutional investors in the Italian banks welcomed the
combinations. Deutsche Bank, which owns shares in both Unicredito
and Banca Commerciale, called the proposed combination a ``positive
step, in view of the reorganization of the Italian banking
market.'' ABN Amro, the Dutch bank that earlier this month acquired
an 8.75 percent share in Banca di Roma, likewise welcomed the San
Paolo bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government also expressed approval. Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema, speaking at a news conference, said, ``We have
followed these developments, having at heart the possible
invigoration and modernization of our banking system, which was
undoubtedly very fragmented.''

VIVENDI OF FRANCE ACQUIRING U.S. FILTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vivendi SA of France is to acquire the United States Filter
Corp. for $6.2 billion in cash, or $31.50 a share. The deal,
announced Monday, would create a $12 billion behemoth that would be
``the largest company in one of the world's fastest-growing
industries,'' said Rodok Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are a jigsaw-puzzle fit. U.S. Filter, based in
Palm Desert, Calif., is the largest global supplier of industrial
water-treatment equipment and services. It is 14 times bigger than
its nearest-sized competitor, Ionics Inc. Vivendi's Generale des
Eaux subsidiary dominates global municipal markets.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on the acquisition were first reported in the The
Wall Street Journal Monday. The deal would create a company that
derives 60 percent of its revenue from municipalities, 30 percent
from industry and 10 percent from users like consumers of bottled
water.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect antitrust problems. The merged company would
still have just a small part of the global market for water
treatment and services, which is now $300 billion and growing 8
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   That market is highly fragmented. Water-treatment chemical
companies like Nalco and Hercules Betz Dearborn are huge sellers to
the global industrial market, while Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA of
France is a formidable No. 2 to Vivendi in municipal systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water utilities will ultimately be cleaning up water, too,
particularly in places like China,'' said Purna R. Saggurti, an
investment banker at Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There are also tens of thousands of small companies filling tiny
market niches. ``This is a highly segmented industry that finally
has a clear leader setting the pace,'' said Christopher Bodnar of
Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co., who expects the U.S. Filter acquisition to
spur a flurry of smaller deals.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the role of acquiree seems a strange one
for U.S. Filter. The company was founded in 1990 on the premise
that customers for water treatment were tired of dealing with 15 or
more vendors to buy pumps, valves and other items needed to gather,
cleanse and distribute water. U.S. Filter set out to gobble up
enough smaller competitors to be able to offer one-stop shopping.
</P>
<P>
   It has bought hundreds of tiny companies, as well as a few big
ones. Last year, for example, it paid $1.5 billion for Culligan
Water Technologies, a leader in bottled water and residential water
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Heckmann, U.S. Filter's chairman, first met
Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chairman, three years ago, when
Heckmann broached the idea of U.S. Filter's buying Aqua Alliance,
Vivendi's American arm. ``They were so much bigger than us,
Jean-Marie just laughed,'' Heckmann recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But by January, U.S. Filter had grown to $5 billion in annual
sales, and Heckmann approached Messier again. ``This time, his
answer was, `Why would I want to get out of the U.S.''' Heckmann
recalled. They continued talking, and the idea of a combination was
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to start looking outside our borders for
growth, and we knew that we'd need a partner to do that,'' Heckmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Filter also needed help getting into the fast-growing
municipal water market. Municipalities want suppliers with track
records, and U.S. Filter has run very few municipal water systems.
Moreover, municipal water treatment is capital-intensive, and U.S.
Filter ``is loaded with debt and pretty much capped out,''' said
David Manlowe, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The equity market was no answer. Investors, concerned that
industrial customers like the semiconductor industry are cutting
capital spending, have been bailing out of water-treatment stocks.
And they have been particularly wary of U.S. Filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been major earnings disappointments or blowups,
but they've grown so rapidly that the risk factor was pretty
high,'' Lache of Deutsche Bank Securities said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Filter's stock was trading in the mid-40s in 1997, yet fell
as low as $11.50 last fall. Last week, it bounced back to the 30s,
but few analysts expect that it would have gone much higher.
Indeed, even big owners like the Bass Brothers, who acquired about
8 percent of the company in a 1997 real estate deal that translated
to about $26 a share, have tendered their shares.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Filter's stock closed at $30.375 Monday, down 12.5 cents.
Vivendi, a $35 billion conglomerate that derives most of its
revenue from telecommunications and television, is not traded in
the United States.

CABLE TV AND THE INTERNET, TOO: BATTLING WITH THE BELLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Pa., D.C., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is cable television passe? One could have thought so from the
way executives of Comcast Corp. and MediaOne Group Inc., two of the
nation's biggest cable companies, trumpeted their $53 billion deal
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cable, the word of the day was broadband _ jargon
for delivering high-speed data services, video and potentially even
phone calls over advanced communications pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis was not a surprise. Delivering an integrated basket
of advanced services has become the main goal of almost every
communications company in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital future, cable companies will be on the same
playing field as the giant phone companies. Indeed, the new
Comcast's most important rivals will be companies like Bell
Atlantic. So while cable television provides most of of the
combined Comcast-MediaOne's revenue and profits today, that
business is not as glamorous nor does it offer as much potential as
data services, broadband and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Providing advanced services, primarily high-speed access to the
Internet, will likely be as vital to the combined company's future
as is making sure that television service does not cut out during
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But in its reliance on cyberspace the enlarged Comcast, which
will be the nation's No. 3 cable company, is hardly alone. The
entire cable television industry is set to battle the local
telephone industry to determine which sector will provide the
United States' roughly 100 million homes with office-caliber
Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Comcast-MediaOne, however, has a strong chance to
emerge as the cable carrier with the best combination of size and
Internet familiarity. Among the nation's biggest cable companies,
only Cox Communications Inc. would deliver high-speed data services
to a larger proportion of its customers, according to the Yankee
Group, a technology consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Comcast has convinced at least some major
players in the technology world that it really means business about
broadband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they get it,'' said John Chambers, chief
executive of Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of advanced data
networking equipment, speaking Monday from Phoenix, where he had
just finished speaking to more than 300 senior Comcast executives.
``They talk on their announcement not about cable but about an
integrated data, voice, video strategy. And they want to not only
deliver that to the home but offer integrated offerings. They
understand the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their depth of understanding, the future has not yet
arrived. Including the effect of Comcast's pending $700 million
deal to acquire control of Jones Intercable Inc., a combined
Comcast-MediaOne would sell high-speed cable modem service to only
about 135,000, or about 1.3 percent, of its roughly 10.6 million
customers, according to the Yankee Group. Cox would sell cable
modem service to 67,000, or about 1.8 percent, of its roughly 3.7
million customers.
</P>
<P>
   That would put the new Comcast far ahead of, say,
Tele-Communications Inc., which AT&AMP;T Corp. recently acquired for
more than $30 billion. TCI sells high-speed data service to fewer
than one-third of 1 percent of its customers, partly because its
network has not been as thoroughly upgraded to offer data service
as have Comcast's and MediaOne's, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it outstrips many of its competitors, Comcast is
in the same situation as the rest of the communications industry in
having a long way to go before it makes high-speed Internet service
into anything resembling a mainstream service. Only about a quarter
of the nation's homes are linked to the Internet at all, and at
roughly $500 a year, cable modem service remains an unaffordable
luxury for many.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the chief obstacle in the way of the cable industry's vision
of creating a broadband nation will not be price. It will be the
local phone industry, which is bigger than the cable industry, has
more money than the cable industry and has more customers than the
cable industry. It may even have more influence in Washington than
the cable industry (though that one is probably a toss-up).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest markets for both MediaOne and Comcast are in
territory dominated by Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's No. 1
local phone carrier. Even more relevant to the new Comcast than
Bell Atlantic's size is the fact that Bell Atlantic plans to offer
high-speed Internet access over normal phone lines in areas
covering 7.5 million homes by the end of this year, a figure that
Bell Atlantic plans to increase to more than 14 million by the end
of next year. If Bell Atlantic can stick to that schedule, it may
secure many of the households that could have become the new
Comcast's best customers. MediaOne's biggest market is around
Boston, while Comcast's biggest market stretches from Washington to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems are often faster than the new high-speed modems
deployed by phone companies. The trade-off is that cable modem
users share transmission capacity with their neighbors, while
high-speed phone-line users generally get their own private data
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put two cable companies together, but that doesn't change
the nature of their product,'' said Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman. ``We think that our product is the winner and that
it's more than competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering advanced data services, the new Comcast may even
face internal problems. Comcast is part of the At Home cable modem
consortium, which also includes AT&AMP;T, while MediaOne is part of the
rival Road Runner group, which is led by Time Warner Inc. The two
groups are vying to become the leading cable modem operator. That
rivalry, of course, did not prevent Time Warner from forming a
joint venture with AT&AMP;T to offer local phone service, but in an
interview, Brian Roberts, Comcast's president, said that the Road
Runner-At Home question was ``the only thing that's not perfectly
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, perhaps the main strategic question for the
new Comcast is how much talent and investment can be directed
toward new initiatives like the Internet and perhaps phone service
without undermining the cash cow of its core television business.
For all of Monday's talk about broadband, the cable is still the
thing for companies like Comcast and perhaps for MediaOne, which
split from U S West, the Bell local phone giant, just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner Inc., and
Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner's cable television unit,
Roberts said: ``If you go to the traditional cable people _ Jerry,
Joe Collins, probably the Coxes, the world, the Comcasts _ they
believe in a television-centric future that gets enhanced by these
new things. If you go to the AT&AMP;Ts and the MediaOnes of the world,
people from a phone background, they see video as the beginning and
hey, the phone business is 10 times bigger and data even more than
that. One of the things I like is there will be a healthy balance
of those two ideas in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Roberts said he suspected he knew which way the future was
tilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in the cable business,'' he added. ``But that said,
my daughter had a sleep over two weeks ago and she wakes up _ she's
11 years old _ and she and her friends go downstairs Saturday
morning and they want to go on line. They did not go to watch
cartoons. I was shocked. I said, `Who are you chatting with? You're
all in the house.' And they said, `Oh no, we have friends out
there.' ''

SEC CHAIRMAN SEEKS MUTUAL FUND CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, proposed strengthening oversight of mutual funds by
independent directors Monday but stopped short of offering the more
sweeping changes that he had considered.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt proposed requiring that a majority of mutual fund
directors, instead of the present 40 percent, be independent of the
firm managing the fund and that independent directors nominate
their replacements. However, Levitt noted, many funds already have
boards that are three-quarters independent directors or already
have self-nominating independent directors.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed that outside lawyers and auditors for fund
boards be independent of the fund-management company and that funds
be required to disclose more information about directors, such as
any relationships they have with the funds' investment adviser and
how much money, if any, they have invested in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these initial measures would be the most significant
changes in a generation, this is just the beginning,'' Levitt said,
adding that SEC officials would examine other issues in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an industry conference in Palm Desert, Calif.,
Levitt did not embrace the more far-reaching changes debated at an
industry roundtable he convened in February. These included giving
independent directors the power to terminate a fund manager's
contract at any time, requiring former fund-company officers to
wait up to five years before serving as independent directors, and
examining whether fund directors who are also executives of the
fund-management company should be paid for their board service.
Those options are still being reviewed, SEC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual steps he talked about struck me as relatively
modest and not very controversial,'' said Kenneth Scott, a Stanford
University Law School professor. ``The most important aspect of the
speech is that he chose to make it, that he wanted to follow up on
the roundtable conference a month ago and continue to signal that
in his mind, this is, and should be, an important item on the SEC's
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's push to improve mutual fund governance comes after
several tumultuous years for fund directors, who have occasionally
found themselves the targets of shareholder lawsuits and nasty
proxy fights after tangling with fund managers. In fact, Levitt now
says the SEC, which had been sharply criticized for not aiding
embattled fund directors in some cases, will ``continue to look for
opportunities to support independent directors where appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual-fund industry officials declined to say whether they
would endorse the proposals made Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas Levitt put forth are certainly worth looking at, but
to commit to them, we'll have to see exactly the form in which they
are proposed,'' said Matthew Fink, president of Investment Company
Institute, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The ICI also said it had formed its own six-member advisory
group to study ways to improve fund governance. The group, which
includes fund company executives and independent fund directors but
no one unaffiliated with a fund company, could report suggested
changes by this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also likely to examine closely other suggestions
Levitt made Monday: encouraging separate insurance coverage for
directors and fund managers in case one sues the other; heightened
scrutiny of practices such as the directing of trades to a
brokerage firm that in return gives valuable equipment or services
that do not necessarily benefit fund shareholders; and more
disclosure to shareholders of funds' tax-adjusted returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the right issues,'' said Robert Denham, the former
chief executive of what was then Salomon, Inc., and now a prominent
Los Angeles lawyer. In particular, he said, disclosing tax-adjusted
returns is ``necessary for investors to be able to make informed
judgments about whether particular funds are appropriate for
taxable accounts.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IN OLD CUBA WITH DIHIGO AND LASORDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the Baltimore Orioles play Cuba's national team in Havana
on Sunday, somebody should take the time in the pre-game ceremonies
to remember a baseball player not many current fans are aware of:
Martin Dihigo, the only Cuban with a bronze plaque in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, the New York Yankee
right-hander, is now baseball's most celebrated Cuban. And every
year you hear how Tony Perez and Tony Oliva deserve to be in the
Baseball Hall of Fame. But already there is Martin Dihigo, perhaps
the most versatile ballplayer in the game's history.
</P>
<P>
   Although primarily a pitcher and shortstop, he also played every
other position, even catcher. And he could hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only guy I ever saw,'' Johnny Mize, the Hall of
Fame first baseman who finished his career with the Yankees, once
said, ``who could play all nine positions, manage, run and
switch-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the decades before Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color
barrier after World War II, Dihigo could not play in the major
leagues. Instead, he played in the Negro leagues, mostly for the
New York Cubans (his eventual ticket to Cooperstown) when he wasn't
playing in Cuba or elsewhere in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate how gifted Dihigo was, in 1938 in the Mexican
League his .387 average won the batting title and as a pitcher he
was 18-2 with an 0.90 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Lean and graceful, Dihigo provided a Joe DiMaggio-like majesty
to Cuban baseball that thrived in the dazzle of old Cuba in those
years. Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and a few others were making
maybe $500 a month in the Negro leagues, but when Paige and Gibson
went to Cuba, they made as much as $4,000 a month, plus a free
luxury apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Perez and Oliva, old Cuba produced Orestes
``Minnie'' Minoso, Mike Cuellar, Luis Tiant, Jose Cardenal (now a
Yankee coach) and Bert Campaneris.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba's baseball diamonds occasionally had rough edges. In
the pre-Castro era when Tom Lasorda, the longtime Los Angeles
Dodgers manager, was a left-hander in the Dodger farm system,
dozens of promising players honed their talent in the Cuban Winter
League. Honed their fists, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1952, I was pitching for Almendares against a big Cuban
first baseman I didn't like, Chiquitin Cabrera,'' Lasorda has often
recalled. ``I turned him upside down a few times, then I hit him in
the ribs. Here he was coming at me with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as he was about to swing the bat, I threw my glove in his
face and tackled him. I don't know how I did it, but I lifted him
up in the air and swung him around. That set off a dandy. The next
thing I knew, I'm in court with Cabrera, who is really in a jam
because he attacked me with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magistrate asked me, `Do you want to press charges?' and I
told him, `No, just let me pitch to him again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lasorda was at the beach with his wife when a
Cuban army officer ordered him to get in a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to expect,'' Lasorda said. ``We go up this
winding road into the mountains to this beautiful home with
soldiers with rifles _ President Batista's palace. Batista himself
comes out to apologize to me for what Cabrera tried to do. Batista
asked me, `Is there anything we can do for you?' and I tell him the
same thing, `Just let me pitch to him again.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I pitched to Cabrera, he knew what was coming. I
let one go that turned him upside down and inside out, but he never
said a word.''
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1949, Monte Irvin, soon to be a New York Giants
slugger, didn't say a word either. He just listened as his Cuban
manager, Dolf Luque, a Cuban pitcher for the Giants in the '30s,
asked Terris McDuffie if he could pitch because the scheduled
starter's arm was sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got more rest than anybody else,'' Luque said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' McDuffie said. ``I just pitched two days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' Luque said. ``This is an important game.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie kept shaking his head. Luque walked away. Moments
later, McDuffie looked up to see the manager holding a .45.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDuffie,'' Luque said quietly, ``you are the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All you got to do,'' McDuffie said, ``is gimme the ball.''

GONZALEZ UNDETERRED BY CONTRACT TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez vowed this
winter that his contract status would not become a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time American League most valuable player appears to be
correct in that assessment, and his white-hot spring serves as
proof.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was 2-for-3 with a two-run single and a walk in four
plate appearances in the Rangers' 3-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers
yesterday at Joker Marchant Stadium. That improved Gonzalez's
batting average this spring to .444 (16-for-36) with two home runs
and 11 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have a preoccupation with their contract,''
Gonzalez said. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's representatives, Jim Bronner and Fernando Cuza, met
10 days ago with Rangers president Tom Schieffer and general
manager Doug Melvin in Port Charlotte, Fla., for what both parties
described as exploratory discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer and Melvin learned that Gonzalez wants to remain with
the Rangers beyond the 2000 season. Gonzalez learned that the
Rangers share that desire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the parties did not discuss specifics on the length and/or
value of a contract extension, Schieffer said. Gonzalez will earn
$8.5 million this season, and the Rangers will likely exercise
their option for the 2000 season that will pay the outfielder $7.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez avoids conversations about his contract, but he said no
further discussions between his representatives and the Rangers are
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of my mind,'' Gonzalez said. ``It's too early to
worry about my contract. Baseball is the only thing on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said he concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan is committed to this game,'' Oates said. ``Guys, we don't
know half of what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez can be found most nights at the Rangers' Charlotte
County Stadium complex working with personal trainer Angel
Precinal. That commitment is seldom publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``His prime years may be ahead of him,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make Gonzalez worthy of a contract worth more than the
one the Anaheim Angels gave first baseman Mo Vaughn, who signed a
six-year contract worth $80 million this winter?
</P>
<P>
   Could Gonzalez command more than the seven-year, $105 million
contract pitcher Kevin Brown received from the Los Angeles Dodgers
this winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best time to talk about a contract is the winter,''
Gonzalez said. ``Right now, it's time for me to play baseball.''

NHL WILL WATCH WINGS FOR TRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barring a major surprise, the eyes of the NHL will be on Detroit
today to see if the Red Wings shore up their defense before the 2
p.m. CST trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Avalanche acquired Theo Fleury last month. The
Stars bolstered their lineup with the acquisition Sunday of winger
Benoit Hogue. The Flyers already had traded for winger Mark Recchi.
And the Phoenix Coyotes made a slick pickup in taking versatile
center Robert Reichel last week to answer a glowing need on the
second line.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel had a goal and an assist in his first game with the
Coyotes onSunday, a 4-1 victory against the Los Angeles Kings and
is expected to be in the lineup tonight when the Stars unveil a
lineup featuring Hogue on the second line at left wing.
</P>
<P>
   And now, it's time for the Red Wings to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit News yesterday reported that defenseman Uwe Krupp
(who signed a four-year, $16.4 million, free-agent contract in the
summer) will not return this season and that his career could be in
jeopardy because of a back injury. That means, the Red Wings likely
will make a deal for a defenseman today. The problem is, the
high-quality defensemen available are themselves fighting injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars captain Mark Tinordi of the Washington Capitals has
been out a month and likely will miss the first round of the
playoffs with a broken foot. Ulf Samuelsson of the New York Rangers
is out two to three weeks with a broken bone in his foot.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were expected to be in heavy demand on the trade
market. But now, what do teams like the Red Wings do when they're
eyeing damaged goods?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very interesting place right now,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said of the trade market. ``It seems like
there's still plenty of activity out there.''
</P>
<P>
   While no major deals were announced yesterday, there was plenty
of chatting among general managers. Gainey said the Stars have a
few calls out, but wouldn't specify more than that. With Hogue in,
the Stars still could try to swing a major deal for a second- or
third-line center _ going after the likes of the New York
Islanders' Trevor Linden or Claude LaPointe. Or they could simply
pick up a spare-part defenseman to bolster their depth in the event
rookie Brad Lukowich isn't ready for the competition level of the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could do nothing. After all, the Stars have the best
record in the NHL and already have addressed the one weak spot in
the lineup by acquiring Hogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we'll know \Rtoday\S,'' Gainey said coyly.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also will know what the rest of the league has.
Phoenix still is seeking defensive help. The Avalanche also could
use an extra defenseman. The Edmonton Oilers have been changing
their lineup every day after adding goalie Tommy Salo, defenseman
Christian Laflamme and forwards Daniel Cleary, Chad Kilger and
Ethan Moreau. The Calgary Flames have lost Fleury, but have added
veteran Tom Chorske, and the San Jose Sharks are said to be
flirting with Linden, Shayne Corson of the Montreal Canadiens or
Joe Juneau of the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, Flames and Oilers are all potential first-round
playoff opponents for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, a hundred deals are rumored. Most notable are the
Flyers searching for another defenseman and the Ottawa Senators'
interest in Canadiens center Vincent Damphousse.
</P>
<P>
   In a minor deal yesterday, the Stars signed free-agent
defenseman Alan Letang from the Canadian National Team and assigned
him to the Michigan K-Wings. Letang, 23, likely comes with the
recommendation of Stars defenseman Doug Lidster, who was helping
coach the Canadian National Team before being signed by the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Letang was placed on waivers and sent to the Michigan K-Wings,
along with winger Jamie Wright.

 CHANGES COME TO CAMPBELL SOUP, TOYS `R' Us, PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring has sprung and the change in seasons has brought a change
in the status of several accounts and assignments, with billings
estimated at $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest shift involved the Campbell Soup Co., which is
reassigning media planning and buying for United States brands _
with billings estimated at more than $200 million _ to the Media
Edge in New York, the media services arm of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Those duties, for products like soups, juices and pasta sauces,
had been handled since 1995 by the Campbell Media Alliance in New
York, a media services unit set up by the TN Media unit of True
North Communications specifically to work for Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assigning our media activities to the Media Edge is a logical
extension of our partnership with Y&AMP;R,'' Tim Callahan, vice
president for global business development at Campbell in Camden,
N.J., said Monday. His reference was to Young &AMP; Rubicam
Advertising, a sibling of the Media Edge, which is one of two
agencies handling worldwide creative assignments for Campbell
brands along with the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Campbell eliminated the advertising sibling of
the Campbell Media Alliance _ Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding Worldwide _
from its agency roster in November.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the Media Edge offered ``some technologies and
modeling'' that ``will give us efficiencies and effectiveness in
our media.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Drexler, chairman at TN Media in New York, attributed
the departure of the assignment to a disagreement over
compensation. Of the approximately 35 employees of the Campbell
Media Alliance, he added, ``some have chosen to leave for other
positions and some who have expressed an interest in staying will
be retained and we will try to redeploy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Gordon, president and chief executive at the Media Edge,
said she expected to hire about 25 additional employees to handle
the Campbell media services. Rather than forming a stand-alone unit
for Campbell, she added, the duties will be handled within the
Media Edge the way the agency works for clients like the Clorox Co.
and the Colgate-Palmolive Co.
</P>
<P>
   Another change involved Toys ``R'' Us Inc., which dismissed its
incumbent creative agency, Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, by
eliminating the shop from a review on its account, with billings
estimated at $50 million. The dismissal came as the review, which
began early last month, was narrowed to finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Thaler, which had handled creative assignments since
March 1998, was eliminated by mutual agreement, said Warren
Kornblum, chief marketing officer at Toys ``R'' Us in Paramus, N.J.
Discussions were continuing about the status of the incumbent media
agency, he added, which is Quantum Media International in New York,
owned by Bohbot Entertainment and the Media Inc. unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kaplan Thaler, president and chief executive at Kaplan
Thaler, has worked for Toys ``R'' Us for almost two decades there
and at J. Walter Thompson New York and Wells BDDP; she also wrote
the Toys ``R'' Us jingle that begins ``I don't want to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they feel they need a global agency,'' Ms. Kaplan
Thaler said, ``and that's fine. I wish them luck.'' This will
enable the agency to ``pitch some competitive accounts,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Three agencies seeking the creative account were also
eliminated: Bozell Worldwide in New York, a unit of True North;
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, and
the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the
TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are a team of two Leo Burnett Co. units in
Chicago, Leo Burnett USA, creative, and Starcom Media Services,
media; Deutsch Inc. in New York; Doner in Southfield, Mich.; the
Media Edge, and a team of two Interpublic agencies, Ammirati Puris
Lintas in New York, creative, and Western Initiative Media, Los
Angeles, media.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision is expected by the end of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In another change, Progressive Insurance is ending a brief
relationship with Arnell Group Brand Consulting in New York and
embarking on a review of its creative and media planning
assignments, with billings estimated at $70 million. Media buying
will remain in house.
</P>
<P>
   Moira Lardakis, a spokeswoman in Cleveland for Progressive, part
of the Progressive Corp., said Arnell, which had worked for the
company since August, was not among the agencies being invited to
take part in the review. Progressive will invite about 20 shops to
participate and expects to make a decision in the next two months,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The review stems from ``an evolution in Progressive's overall
brand-building effort,'' Ms. Lardakis said, to focus on
``direct-response advertising and cooperative capabilities.''
Arnell, which has no direct-response operations, specializes in
brand- and image-building campaigns; its work for Progressive
involved introducing an elaborate campaign centered on driving
safety that licensed the movie character E.T. and included
sponsorship of the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIII last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial mission was clearly image and awareness,'' said
Peter Arnell, the chairman at Arnell. ``The notion of going to
direct is a huge surprise, out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have neither the expertise nor the interest'' in
direct-marketing assignments, Arnell said, adding that he suggested
to Progressive hiring Draft Worldwide in Chicago, a unit of
Interpublic that specializes in direct marketing, or Deutsch, which
has a direct-marketing unit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, David Pecker, who will soon become chairman and chief
executive at American Media Inc. in New York, is undertaking a
review for an assignment with billings estimated at $50 million to
promote the company's two weekly tabloids, The National Enquirer
and Star.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment, covering consumer and trade advertising, is
intended to help ``delineate the two brands,'' said Pecker, who is
finishing up as president and chief executive at Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines in New York, part of Lagardere Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Enquirer positioning is news you want to read about
tomorrow,'' he added, ``while Star is more celebrity-driven.''
American Media is being acquired by Evercore Capital Partners LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker confirmed a report this week in the trade publication
Advertising Age that he had asked six agencies for proposals for
campaigns. The agencies, all in New York, are Arnell; Deutsch;
DeVito/Verdi; DiNoto/Lee; Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners, part of Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi PLC, and Mezzina/Brown. A decision is expected in early
May.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker and Arnell have worked together on several projects for
Hachette Filipacchi magazines like Elle, George, Mirabella and Sony
Style. While ``Peter and I have been friends for a long time,''
Pecker said, ``we want to give everybody a fair chance.''

<P>
   Put away the party hats, the bunting and the punch bowl. For the
moment, Dow 10,000 seems to be receding into the mists of what
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after again brushing the magic number, the broad market
averages drifted downward. The Dow Jones industrial average lost
13.04 points to close at 9,890.51. In addition, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.28 points, to 1,297.01. The Nasdaq
composite index, which has been the top performing index this year,
lost 25.33 points, a decline of slightly more than 1 percent, to
finish at 2,395.94.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a momentous day, by any means. That the stock market
is struggling after touching the tantalizing 10,000 mark several
times in the last several sessions, however, makes some investors
wonder whether there will be more down than up for share prices in
the weeks ahead. Are the market's gains of the first few months of
1999 all there is?
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Dow closes above 10,000 soon, several strategists
believe investors would be wise to limit their stock market
expectations for the rest of the year. One reason is that bond
yields keep inching up, making those investments increasingly
attractive to investors. Monday, the 30-year government bond traded
at a yield of 5.57 percent, up from 5.52 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps a more troubling reason to fret about the market's
immediate future is the recent weakness in technology stocks, a
previously dominant force in the bull's run. With the group
faltering, the continued strength of the overall market comes into
question.
</P>
<P>
   Technology's impact on the market looms large for several
reasons. Of the 10 industry sectors in the S&AMP;P 500 index,
technology is the largest. Technology stocks make up 19 percent of
the value of the S&AMP;P, up from just 8.4 percent 10 years ago. Of the
35 new companies added to the S&AMP;P index last year, 10 were
technology concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a much bigger factor in the market than it is in
the economy. Though technology accounts for only 6 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product, companies in the sector produce 12
percent of the S&AMP;P index's total earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise, then, that technology shares have been the
crucial fuel inside the stock market rocket of the last three
years. In that time, returns in technology stocks were not just
better than any other sector, they were roughly double those
produced by the next highest-performing group _ in last year's
case, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this hot streak is on ice. The bellwether technology stocks
that led the market up _ IBM, Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Intel
and Compaq Computer, among others _ are now well off their highs.
Intel is down more than 18 percent from its peak of two months ago,
and IBM is about 15 percent below its January high. Cisco has
fallen 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, concerns that Dell Computer may be shipping fewer
personal computers in the current quarter drove its shares down 5.9
percent, or $2.375, to $37.875. Kevin McCarthy, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp., cut his earnings
forecast for Dell in the April quarter by almost 12 percent. The
stock is down 30 percent from a high of $54.3125 on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   And worries that weak computer demand will keep Compaq Computer
from meeting analysts' earnings expectations has pressured that
stock. Compaq has fallen more than 38 percent in less than two
months. It closed Monday at $30.125.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, analysts are cautious about many technology
companies. Christine Callies, U.S. equity strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston, points out that except for the largest
technology stocks, analysts' revised earnings projections in the
overall group are either flat or negative.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment strategists have argued that weakness in
technology shares will not hurt the overall market because other
industry groups, such as financials and capital goods companies,
will take over the market's leadership. The current fluctuations
represent a healthy sector rotation and nothing more, according to
these people.
</P>
<P>
   But Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, is not so sure. ``One thing that tech has going for it
is it's open ended,'' he said. ``The products and concepts are so
exciting, these stocks can keep going up multiple points a day,
weeks in a row. I don't think the potential of the financials and
capital goods companies is that great.'' Now that tech is no longer
driving the market, Wien believes its upside is limited.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime trader recalls another era when technology stocks
led the market up: the go-go years of the early 1970's. IBM, Xerox,
Polaroid and a technology conglomerate called University Computing
were among the darlings that helped propel the Dow Jones average
over 1,000 in 1973. One by one, they crumbled. And they took the
overall market down with them.

IS MICROSOFT MOVING TO SETTLE? U.S. SAYS NO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way the Justice Department sees it, if
Microsoft Corp. and the government are to begin talks to settle the
antitrust suit now at issue in federal court here, Microsoft will
have to make the first move. So far, that has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not received any settlement proposal from Microsoft,''
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, said Monday in response to a
report in The Wall Street Journal that Microsoft had indicated an
interest in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding at the antitrust
trial, has indirectly urged both sides to reach for a settlement
during the recess that began at the end of February. The trial is
scheduled to resume in April.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they are open to such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it is willing to show flexibility on some issues
but not others, noting, as one executive put it, that ``settling
this case without the need for more protracted litigation would be
good for everyone concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Monday, Klein said, ``The Justice Department
has always been and remains open to a settlement that fully
protects consumers and assures that similar antitrust violations do
not occur in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues on which Microsoft is expressing a willingness to
negotiate are generally those on which the company has already
shown flexibility in the market. Over the last year, it has
loosened some of its restrictive contracts with Internet companies
and has allowed computer manufacturers to customize the opening
screen of the Windows operating system to a degree. But the company
says it is not willing to negotiate in the areas that seem most
important to the Justice Department and the 19 states that are
pressing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any settlement must preserve Microsoft's ability to add new
features to our operating system as technology advances,'' a
company executive who demanded anonymity said Monday. With that,
Microsoft is signaling its unwillingness to give up the ability to
bundle other software products with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of the Microsoft Web browser with Windows set off
the antitrust suit. A three-judge appeals court panel ruled in a
related case last June that Microsoft had the right to add new
features to Windows, if the addition benefited consumers. Based on
comments and questions he has posed in court, however, it is not at
all clear that Jackson believes that the inclusion of a Web browser
with Windows has significantly benefited consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department wants Microsoft to make the first move
toward settlement talks because government lawyers think they have
the upper hand after more than four months in court in which they
threw the credibility of many Microsoft witnesses into doubt. But
Microsoft's lawyers also believe they have presented a strong case.
So even if settlement talks begin before the trial resumes, lawyers
on both sides say the odds of success are long.

<P>
   Comcast plans to acquire Mediaone for $53 billion, creating the
nation's third-largest cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, has almost nothing to do with television. The

POPE REPORTED TO PLAN VISIT TO JERUSALEM NEXT MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's tourism minister announced Monday that Pope
John Paul II intended to visit Jerusalem in March next year to
celebrate the millennium. It would be the first papal trip to the
Holy Land since Paul VI visited Jerusalem in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the trip
``for now has not been set,'' adding that neither the date nor the
itinerary has been worked out, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism minister, Moshe Katsav, said: ``The pope's office
will publish statements at a time and place they choose. The pope
has the intention and desire to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, stood by
Katsav's side, but did not confirm the announcement directly. ``The
year 2000 is a celebration of Christ and his life in this land,''
the cardinal said. ``Therefore it is only natural that the pope
would come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli television's Channel One, which is state-owned, reported
that the pope was also expected to visit Bethlehem and Nazareth in
the Palestinian territories in a three-day visit to the area from
March 24 to 26 next year. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat,
has invited the pope to visit Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pope long ago indicated a desire to include
Jerusalem in the Roman Catholic Church's jubilee celebration of the
millennium, political tensions between the Israelis and the
Palestinians _ particularly the dispute over the fate of Jerusalem
_ have stalled plans for a trip.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Vatican established diplomatic relations in 1994,
but the Vatican has never recognized Israel's 1980 annexation of
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been slowly and somewhat ambivalently gearing up for
what could be an onslaught of Christian pilgrims next year. The
millions expected _ estimates have ranged from 2.5 million to 6
million _ will present a logistical challenge for the tourism
industry and local churches.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a forum in Jerusalem last month, Archbishop Pietro
Sambi, the Vatican's ambassador to Israel and the Palestinian
territories, said he expected many of the millions of Catholic who
will travel to Rome next year to continue on to Jerusalem.

TELETUBBIES TAKE ON BUBBLY CHUBBIES AS CUTE GOES TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Teletubbies'' _ those four cuddly, cooing,
antenna-topped dolls that arrived on American television from
Britain last year and have generated $800 million in sales from
spinoff toys and other kiddie products _ have distinctive features:
human but ``extraplanetary,'' their makers and marketers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubbly Chubbies,'' four cuddly dolls that arrived in
Wal-Mart's 2,435 stores this month, have remarkably similar
features: pastel colors, large cute eyes and button noses,
protruding earlike headphones, and squat, chubby bodies _ rather
human but with an extraplanetary appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether too remarkable, Ragdoll Productions Ltd. and Itsy
Bitsy Entertainment Co., the owners and marketers of Teletubbies,
contended Monday in a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
against Wal-Mart, the world's largest retail chain, with $137
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bubbly Chubbies characters are obvious, studied knockoffs
of the famous Teletubbies characters,'' the plaintiffs charged in a
suit that accused Wal-Mart of trademark and copyright infringement
and asked for unspecified damages and the immediate recall and
destruction of all Bubbly Chubbies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fashioning Bubbly Chubbies after Teletubbies to
capitalize on the enormous demand for their products, Ragdoll and
Itsy Bitsy contended, Wal-Mart chose the name Bubbly Chubbies
``deliberately to rhyme with Teletubbies,'' and adopted a logo and
packaging that is ``an obvious and studied imitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The objective, Ragdoll and Itsy Bitsy said, was to ``cause
consumers to be confused in believing that the Bubbly Chubbies
characters are the Teletubbies characters, or somehow related to,
sponsored or approved by the owners of the Teletubbies
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Maher, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of
Bentonville, Ark., said Monday night that the company had not been
served with the lawsuit and declined to comment, except to say:
``The company would never knowingly infringe anyone's copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at an audience of toddlers, the Teletubbies characters _
``Tinky Winky,'' ``Laa-Laa,'' ``Po,'' and ``Dipsy'' _ were created
for a British Broadcasting Corp. television series that began in
1997 and became an overnight sensation. The series is now aired in
120 countries in 21 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April 1998, the series began on the Public
Broadcasting System in the United States, and it is now broadcast
on 323 PBS stations, reaching 97 percent of American households.
Extensive marketing, features in newspapers and magazines and other
promotions have turned the Teletubbies into cultural icons.
</P>
<P>
   Through licensing agreements, cloth dolls, plastic figurines,
pajamas, slippers, books, videos and other products based on the
Teletubby characters have blitzed the United States and Canada, and
many of the items have become top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a set of Teletubbies in some markets was being sold
for up to $100, though individual plastic figures were available
for $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Comparatively, the lawsuit said, the Bubbly Chubbies characters
``are sold at a much lower price.'' It said that ``constitutes
unfair competition under the law of New York'' and causes the
plaintiffs ``irreparable harm.''

EDITORIAL: THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his motivation, Gov. George Pataki made sensible
suggestions on Sunday about how New York City's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, should respond to the civic turmoil over the shooting of
Amadou Diallo by police officers. Part of political leadership,
Pataki said, is ``listening to criticism and responding
appropriately to criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Giuliani's responses have been in the right direction.
He has expressed his dismay at the shooting and reached out to the
dead West African immigrant's family. The problem is that the scale
of those responses has not been large enough. Moreover, there is a
public perception that Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir are defensive rather than open in their attitude. Safir
fumbled badly over the weekend by turning up at the Academy Awards
in Los Angeles at a time when the city council was in doubt whether
he would appear at a public hearing Monday on police tactics. He
did attend the hearing, and spoke of the need for ``dialogue'' and
``healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing is needed because the city's minority communities have
been wounded by fear of the police. A cross-section of elected
officials and civic leaders are joining the continuing protests at
Police Headquarters because they regard Giuliani's and Safir's
responses as inadequate to the depth of that wound. These two
leaders must move beyond their statistic-filled and rhetorical
responses.
</P>
<P>
   So far it has been the protesters, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton,
who have done a good job of reaching out and broadening their
message. The volunteers for arrest have come to include elected
officials, Jewish leaders, former Mayor Edward Koch and the Rev.
Floyd Flake, who has been one of Giuliani's most prominent black
allies. Monday 141 people were arrested, and although many are
political rivals of the mayor, their unity carries a message beyond
politics-as-usual.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says Sharpton's motives are political and
self-aggrandizing, and he may have the same opinion of Pataki's.
But to say that politicians behave politically is to state the
obvious. What matters is whether they are right. In this case,
those calling for a broader, deeper show of mayoral leadership are
right.

 &HT;    Man threatens Little League coach with pistol, is held for
evaluation
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A man who reportedly pointed a pistol
at the head of a Little League coach for five minutes Sunday during
an argument over a batting cage was ordered held Monday without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   John Skrandel, 28, was charged with aggravated assault after the
incident. A judge Monday ordered him to undergo a psychiatric
examination. Skrandel is scheduled to return to court at 9 a.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 players, ages 11 and 12, ran to safety after they saw
the gun, police said. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Skrandel, a recently-divorced attorney, was at the Osborne Park
batting cages with his 6-year-old son. Michael Adams, a Little
League coach, asked Skrandel to move to another cage because the
one he was using was the only one that could accommodate the Little
League pitching machine, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Skrandel refused and when Adams insisted, Skrandel attacked him
with an aluminum baseball bat, a police report said. Adams, a golf
professional at the PGA National community, blocked the bat and
threw it away.
</P>
<P>
   Then Skrandel went to a gym bag and pulled out a .40-caliber
Glock pistol with laser sights, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 44, of Palm Beach Gardens, told police Skrandel went into
a combat shooting stance and pointed the weapon at his head while
screaming obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   A recreation league worker called 911 on her cell phone after
seeing the altercation. Skrandel unloaded the pistol before police
arrived and did not resist arrest, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams wasn't available for comment Monday, but his wife, Margie,
said her husband told her, ``I wasn't afraid. I knew there was
nothing I could do. It was out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Margie Adams: ``I think the ones who were terrified were
the kids. They ran everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' children, Amanda, 9, and Matthew, 11, also were there.
``They were so scared they were shaking all through practice,''
Margie Adams said.

   The hearing in the Netherlands, where Gucci is incorporated, was
requested on Friday by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the
world's largest maker of luxury goods, after Gucci announced that
it had struck a deal to sell a 40 percent share to Francois
Pinault, owner of Au Printemps, France's biggest department-store
chain, to thwart LVMH's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman, asked the court to
invalidate the Gucci-Pinault deal, and replace Gucci's board with
an independent overseer. At the same time, LVMH began an
$81-a-share offer for all the Gucci shares it did not already own.
LVMH has been pursuing Gucci since January, when it announced that
it had assembled a 34.4 percent stake in the company and demanded
representation on its board.
</P>
<P>
   The Gucci-LVMH battle has come to symbolize the kind of
unfettered takeover wrangling, intrigue and cross-border alliances
that are expected to increase in a more and more cohesive Europe.
Already, the phasing in of the single currency, begun in January,
is being regarded as a catalyst for recent big banking deals.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for Gucci has pitted two willful French
billionaires, Pinault and Arnault, against each other for control
of a legendary fashion designer, which almost everyone regards as
Italian despite its corporate base in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Dutch court had ordered Gucci and LVMH
to negotiate a settlement, but on Friday, the day those talks were
to begin, Gucci sprang the surprise deal with Pinault, infuriating
LVMH.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a full day's hearings, the Dutch court rejected
the LVMH request to invalidate the Gucci-Pinault deal and rejected
the naming of an independent overseer for Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   But the court reinstated LVMH's voting rights as a Gucci
shareholder, which it had frozen in the earlier order. It also
ordered Gucci and LVMH to discuss LVMH's bid for all of Gucci's
shares, a ruling that set the stage for the takeover fight to
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, called the rulings a
``total victory,'' since the court effectively rejected LVMH's two
central demands. He said Gucci would ``go through the procedure''
of discussing the LVMH bid, though he made clear that the Gucci
board was not prepared to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   James Lieber, an American lawyer who is senior vice president of
LVMH, said LVMH viewed the court's ruling ``with great
satisfaction.'' Reached by phone in Amsterdam, he said, ``Once
again, we have observed that the rabbits De Sole pulls out of his
hat are the source of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the court order for a resumption of talks, and
argued that Gucci's ``board has the duty to get the highest
price,'' and that was clearly LVMH's. His company is bidding $81 a
share, compared with $75 from the Pinault group.
</P>
<P>
   But De Sole said the Gucci board was not required to accept the
highest price. Justifying acceptance of a lesser bid, he said, was
the management independence that the Pinault group had assured
Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give up control,'' he added. ``They invested in the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The next stage in the struggle, it appeared, would be for the
allegiance of Gucci's big institutional investors in the United
States. While these investors ``have been loyal to De Sole in the
past,'' Lieber said, ``they have indicated they wanted to review
the agreement'' between Gucci and Pinault.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, De Sole accused LVMH of attempting to sway the
views of investors, and said he had received firm assurances of
support from three major mutual fund groups _ Scudder, Templeton
and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   LVMH was dealt a further blow when Standard &AMP; Poor's said it was
placing LVMH under observation for a possible reduction of its
credit ratings because of the financial strain the bid for Gucci
would put on its finances.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci shares rose 10 percent to 73.7 euros. LVMH fell slightly,
while Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, Pinault's company, fell 6 euros or
4 percent to 144 euros.

FOR FINAL FOUR TEAMS, PATHS WERE DIFFERENT, GOAL THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Some of the coaches have cried. Their players
have slapped high-fives, fashioned necklaces from the nets snipped
after winning regional championships and, as Connecticut coach Jim
Calhoun joked Monday, are nursing sore shoulders from
congratulatory backslapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no trouble getting our kids to class on time,'' Calhoun
said. ``They got there early to hear how well they did. I was just
as bad. I showed up for coffee early, too, to get my back patted.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State. Duke. Ohio State. UConn. Each team's story line
is as different as the four regions they traveled through to reach
the Final Four of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans bring Magic to Florida _ as in Magic Johnson. He
drove the bus to Michigan State's last championship appearance in
1979 and won the collision with Indiana State and a guy named Larry
Bird.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils (36-1) offer destiny. They have won four
tournament games by an average of 30 points and, in many corners,
have become locks to win their third national championship in the
eighth Final Four appearance for coach Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes are a fast-breaking advertisement for the second
chance. Their coach, Jim O'Brien, left Boston College two years ago
after a bitter dispute with administrators. Their guard, Scoonie
Penn, followed his coach, sat out a season and now shines as the
brightest Buckeye of all. His teammates were 8-22 last season and
have pulled off the most dramatic turnaround in NCAA history.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are making history, crashing their first Final Four
after three regional final losses that had confined Calhoun to that
sports limbo called Unable to Win the Big One.
</P>
<P>
   Now forget all that because it has nothing to do with which team
will win it all next Monday in St. Petersburg, Fla. Human interest
doesn't win championships _ defense, dominant players and desire
do.
</P>
<P>
   And Duke leads in all three categories. The Temple Owls had
fewer turnovers and more second-chance points but shot just 42
percent _ a tournament high for Blue Devils opponents _ and lost by
21 points in the East Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Elton Brand is the best big man in the country. Temple
coach John Chaney proclaimed Trajan Langdon the ``best pure
shooter'' he has seen in years. And National Basketball Association
scouts and executives said the freshman Corey Maggette would be the
top player selected if he decided to enter the draft. He's a Duke
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Scarier is that back in October, Krzyzewski told his players
that nothing short of a national title was acceptable. They not
only embraced it, but also believed their press clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be cocky or anything, but we're definitely a
championship-caliber team,'' Blue Devils forward Chris Carrawell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Closer than many care to believe is UConn. The Huskies (32-2)
beat bigger and underrated Gonzaga, 67-62, in the West final by
holding the Zags to 35 percent shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga outrebounded the Huskies by 47-33. These feats were
especially impressive because UConn's one true big man,
6-foot-11-inch Jake Voskuhl, spent important minutes on the bench
with foul trouble, as did its floor general, Khalid El-Amin, who
was 0 for 12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are deeper and more athletic than Duke. They go nine
deep; the Blue Devils spell their top five with scaled-down minutes
from Chris Burgess, Nate James and Maggette. ``Whoever says we
bring waves and waves of players didn't do well in math,'' said
Krzyzewski, who has been both amused and irritated by the
perception that his team is loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies also have blue-chip talent. The all-America forward
Richard Hamilton does more than score, though he had 21 points in
the regional final. He shut down Richie Frahm and handled the ball
while El-Amin was on the bench. When he is focused, El-Amin is a
better floor leader than the Blue Devils' William Avery _ though he
lacks the Duke guard's 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   In Voskuhl and Kevin Freeman, the Huskies boast a tough, smart
interior that has yet to be intimidated by some of the best inside
men in the country. They play in a league with talents like Ron
Artest and Tim James and will not shrink from Brand.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that the Big Ten representatives, Ohio State
(27-8) and Michigan State (33-4), earned their way to Florida. The
Buckeyes, especially, were impressive, upsetting top-seeded Auburn
and St. John's in the South. Penn and Michael Redd have been the
most impressive backcourt duo in the tournament. But getting there
may be enough of a reward for a young team.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Spartans are hard to get excited about. They
turned the ball over 19 times against Mount St. Mary's, let
Oklahoma and Mississippi stay in the game with them and withstood a
Kentucky charge.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State coach Tom Izzo and O'Brien have echoed Calhoun's
remarks that the Blue Devils are the best team in the country. But
all are hoping for what they call in boxing a puncher's chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are far and away the best team in the nation,'' Calhoun
said again Monday. ``But I haven't always seen the best team win.''
</P>
<P>
   And his Huskies have the best chance of connecting on that
roundhouse blow next Monday in Florida.

 &HT;    Border Patrol wants to talk with relatives of Hatians believed
killed
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ A top-ranking official with the U.S. Border
Patrol is looking for people who believe they lost relatives from
Haiti in this month's immigrant smuggling catastrophe that cost
from 15 to 40 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Roberts, third-in-charge of the Border Patrol's office for
the southeast United States, and a Border Patrol intelligence agent
visited the Haitian American Community Council in Delray Beach
Monday and obtained a list of those who fear their relatives were
lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol is still trying to verify the number and names
of people who drowned and whether there was one boat or two, said
Art Bullock, West Palm Beach Border Patrol chief. The three
survivors of the shipwreck 26 miles off the coast of West Palm
Beach gave conflicting accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the immigrants may also be able to help identify
the smugglers or provide other information, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol staff from the West Palm Beach office has not yet
visited Delray Beach, the heart of the county's Haitian community,
as part of its investigation into the March 6 smuggling wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have the man-power for it,'' Bullock said of his
eight-member staff. Nor does he have any Creole-speaking officers.
And other leads were more important to follow at first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once his office receives the relatives' names, Creole-speaking
immigration inspectors from Miami International Airport will help
interview them, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral for Michaelle Dieujuste, one of the women recovered
from the smuggling shipwreck, will be buried at 1 p.m. Saturday at
Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Delray Beach, said Daniella
Henry, executive director of the Haitian American Community
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives thought they had buried her on March 13, but because
the medical examiner's office released the wrong body, Dieujuste's
relatives mistakenly buried another smuggling drowning victim,
Immacula Fleurentin.

EDITORIAL: RISING OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices are heading up, as Saudi Arabia and other oil
producers seek to restrain the supply of oil. Those higher prices
will dampen the economic boom in the United States but will not
cause severe problems for this country. The rise should serve as a
reminder to Americans that energy conservation, largely forgotten
as oil prices have fallen to their lowest level in years, remains
an important goal.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-producing countries, meeting in Vienna, are expected on
Tuesday to agree to reductions in production totaling about two
million barrels per day. If the cuts are made, that would be more
than enough to assure that oil prices will rise.
</P>
<P>
   The increases have already begun. The benchmark price of west
Texas intermediate crude oil, which fell from above $25 per barrel
at the end of 1996 to under $11 at the end of last year, has
rebounded to above $15. Demand for oil in Asia is beginning to rise
as economies start to recover. American gasoline demand has been
rising at a fast clip due both to the boom here and to the growing
sales of inefficient sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors that Saudi Arabia, which is to make the biggest
cuts, has threatened that, if other oil producers do not live up to
their promises to cut, it will produce oil as fast as it can to
disrupt their markets. Such a move would send oil prices plunging,
so the threat may be enough to restrain production for some time,
notwithstanding the fact that some countries have broken previous
promises to reduce output. Frederick Leuffer, the oil analyst at
Bear Stearns, thinks the price of crude oil could climb back to $20
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Such a rise in oil prices would reduce the economic pain for
major oil exporters, among them Russia and Indonesia, but it would
slow economic growth in other countries. For Americans, the move
means that inflation is likely to rise, albeit not by huge amounts,
and that spending on consumer goods is likely to slow from the
recent torrid pace.

NAVY ADMIRAL REMOVED FROM POST OVER AN AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two-star admiral in charge of the Navy's air
forces in the Mediterranean was formally relieved of his duties
Monday after an investigation found that he had had an adulterous
affair with a civilian and then lied about it to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Rear Adm. Paul (Scott) Semko, a graduate of the
U.S. Naval Academy who rose through the ranks over nearly three
decades, received a punitive letter of reprimand for violating
Article 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which
prohibits ``conduct unbecoming an officer.''
</P>
<P>
   The punishment stopped short of criminal charges, but within the
Navy's hierarchical system of promotion, a punitive letter of
reprimand almost always becomes an indelible mark on an officer's
resume that effectively ends his or her career in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Though prosecutions of adultery in the military are relatively
rare, the case against Semko follows a highly publicized series of
cases involving sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a two-star Army general, David Hale, agreed to plead
guilty to eight counts of misconduct stemming from affairs he had
with the wives of four subordinate officers. In December, a
one-star admiral, John Scudi, agreed to early retirement at a lower
rank, with a reduced pension, and penalties including 30 days of
house arrest, after investigators accused him of steering $150,000
in government contracts to a woman with whom he was having an
adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials noted that the charges against Semko, though
serious enough to warrant punishment, did not involve other
accusations of wrongdoing, as with Scudi. The officials, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, said Semko's relationship involved a
woman not connected with the Navy and, evidently, did not directly
affect the ``good order and discipline'' of his commands.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the Navy in Naples, Italy, said its
inspector general opened an investigation into Semko's behavior
``based on an anonymous letter'' received in January.
</P>
<P>
   Semko, who is married and has two grown children, took over his
command in May 1998. A pilot, he previously held several command
posts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said the affair had lasted some time during Semko's assignments in
the United States but had ended by the time he took command in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to adultery, he was accused of making false official
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Semko, 50, appeared on Monday before Adm. James Ellis Jr., the
commander of naval forces in Europe, in what is known as an
admiral's mast. Earlier this month, he was temporarily relieved of
his duties as the investigation continued; that was made permanent
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he will serve in Ellis' office, awaiting reassignment.
While he could theoretically receive another command, the officials
said that was unlikely.

EDITORIAL: WATERED-DOWN RACISM RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Tuesday, March 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By killing a resolution condemning ``the racism and bigotry
espoused by'' a white supremacist group called the Council of
Conservative Citizens, Republican congressional leaders have set
back their party's effort to be viewed as inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was proposed a month ago by Rep. Robert Wexler, a
Florida Democrat, but garnered only a small number of Republican
co-sponsors, including such New York lawmakers as Michael Forbes
and Peter King. They, at least, saw the need to distance the House
from the extreme group, which has cultivated connections to the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of embracing the resolution, Republican leaders
decided to kill it. To cover their tracks, the Republicans plan to
pass a substitute resolution Tuesday that contains a strong general
denunciation of ``all those who promote racism, anti-Semitism,
ethnic prejudice, or religious intolerance'' but omits any mention
of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, pressed to explain his refusal to back a version of
Wexler's resolution in the Senate, gave dancing answers that
recalled his shifting explanations after news accounts exposed his
links to the council. To his credit, the majority leader has
condemned the racist views of the council, but he has resisted
repudiating the group itself.
</P>
<P>
   The original resolution gave Lott a new chance to sever his
connection with the council and ease doubts about his commitment to
fairness as the leader of the Senate. Sadly, he declined.

POLICE MAY HAVE UNDERSTATED STREET SEARCHES, SPITZER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An elite police unit that includes the four officers
who shot Amadou Diallo may have vastly underreported the number of
people it has stopped and searched on the streets in the last two
years, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said in a radio
interview broadcast Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, whose office is investigating whether the
stop-and-frisk practices of the Street Crime Unit have violated the
civil rights of minority residents, said the unit may have searched
hundreds of thousands of people in the last two years without
finding any basis for arresting them.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department says that the unit searched 45,000 people
in 1997 and 1998, as measured by the paperwork filed by the
officers, and made 9,500 arrests. A police spokeswoman said Monday
that the unit has properly complied with the policy to report all
searches.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since Diallo was shot, critics of the Police
Department have repeatedly cited statistics showing that the unit
arrests only about one-fifth of the people it stops and frisks.
Critics say this ratio is evidence that many of the searches are
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said in the radio interview that officers have told him
that when they frisk people and find nothing, they usually do not
file the paperwork, a form called a UF250, that is required by
department policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Brian Lehrer on WNYC-Radio, which was
taped on Friday and broadcast Monday, Spitzer said: ``I've spoken
to many officers who say that they do not fill out the forms, the
250, for every stop-and-frisk, and they may fill out, at most, one
in five, or one in 10. In which case we may have had several
hundred thousand stops-and-frisks, with only the 5 to 10 thousand
arrests, in which case the ratio would become that much more
overwhelming, and suggestive of something that we need to think
about very carefully.'' He acknowledged that his evidence was
anecdotal.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Spitzer's comments, Marilyn Mode, the Police
Department's deputy commissioner for public information, said
Monday, ``I think he's wrong.'' She added, ``Police officers are
supposed to fill these forms out, and we have every reason to
believe they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office is looking into accusations that,
in violation of the law, the Street Crime Unit searches mostly
young black and Hispanic men based mostly on race and ethnicity,
with little or no reason to suspect that they have committed
crimes. In the interview with Lehrer, Spitzer called the matter of
police searches ``the most serious civil rights issue, in my view,
facing the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit's frisking practices are also being investigated by the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have vigorously
denied that the searches are without merit or are based on race.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which numbers 380 officers out of a 39,000-officer
force, accounts for 40 percent of the illegal guns seized by the
police.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Four members of the Street Crime Unit, in search of a serial
rapist, fired 41 shots at Diallo, 22, a unarmed street peddler from
Guinea, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment house in the
Bronx last month. Diallo was hit 19 times and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has become the most sensitive political issue in
the city, with protesters arrested daily in front of Police
Headquarters, and Giuliani regularly deriding them and the press,
while defending the police against a barrage of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's office reflected some of that sensitivity Monday,
refusing to elaborate on his remarks, or even to repeat them. His
press secretary, Darren Dopp, said the office could not discuss an
investigation in progress, though Spitzer appeared to have done
just that. Dopp said Spitzer was unavailable for comment.

STAMINA WORRIES PARK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Right-hander Chan Ho Park came off a career
high in innings pitched _ then went to Bangkok, Thailand, and
pitched for his native Korea in the Asian Games. Korea won the gold
medal, Park's stature grew and now Park is concerned about the
adverse affects of all that pitching late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Park was loosey-goosey after his best outing of the spring, a
six-inning masterpiece in which he struck out six and allowed three
hits in a 4-1 win against the Kansas City Royals on Monday. But he
also knows something is odd this spring, and it's not just his
solid place in the Dodgers' starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good, but I'm worried for later in the season,'' Park
said. ``I'm ready so quick in spring training because I pitched in
the winter. It makes me worry that later in the season, maybe I'll
get tired too quick. That's why I'm trying to be more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Park is being touted as the No. 2 starter behind staff ace Kevin
Brown and is coming off a 15-9 season in which he pitched 2202/3
innings. But he's also a very different pitcher in the first and
second halves of the season. Park was 16-12 with a 4.09 ERA in
April, May and June. He was 18-10 with a 3.21 ERA from July to
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's going to have any trouble late in the
season,'' pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``The guy is in great
shape and we, as coaches, can make sure he stays that way. We'll
watch his pitch counts and make sure he stays strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The year-round pitching isn't the only thing that could weigh on
Park as the season moves along. A contract talk is expected, though
it's clear Park doesn't want to talk much about it. He is two
arbitration hearings away from free agency, but already Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone and Park's agent, Steve Kim, have had
preliminary discussions about a long-term contract. Park is trying
to stay clear of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pressure,'' Park said. ``I don't want to think about
the contract during the season. I don't want to lose a game and
then think, `Oh, I have to sign a contract soon.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keeping the rhythm: Right-hander Ismael Valdes has been the
best Dodgers pitcher this spring in every aspect, which is why he
wants to stay with his current routine. While many of the Dodgers
bolted from Dodgertown after Monday's game for a day of R&AMP;R, Valdes
asked to stay around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to pitch, so he's going to pitch in the Triple-A
game,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in the minor-league game will enable Valdes to work
every fifth day, which has worked well so far. Valdes is 2-0 with a
0.71 ERA in four spring starts.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hundley watch: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he's
thinking about using catcher Todd Hundley when the team travels to
Kissimmee on Thursday to face the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the latter part of the week,'' Johnson said.
``He's going to need to catch a few times. It takes time to work up
to nine innings.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Johnson said shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, bothered by shin splints the last few days, should be
ready to play Wednesday against the Cleveland Indians. . . .
Right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna on Sunday came out of his
workout without pain, Johnson said, which is a big step in getting
him ready for the season.

PATRICK HERON, 79, ABSTRACT PAINTER AND CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Heron, prominent in Britain since the 1940s as an
abstract painter and as a vigorous critic and advocate in the
international art world, died on Saturday at his home near St. Ives
in Cornwall, England. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery in London,
said that Heron was one of the most influential figures in postwar
British art.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Heron wrote, ``It is obvious that color is the
only direction in which paintings can travel.'' Working with color
that was saturated and voluptuous, he aimed at a boiling energy
that would captivate the observer.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that the investigation of color _ color in itself,
color as form, color as the maker and definer of space _ was ``the
only activity still open to a painter that was not in some way a
retreat into the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In midcentury, some of Heron's paintings were tall and thin in
format and built up with narrow horizontal, interrelated bars of
pure color. Nothing like them had been done in England, and they
were received with widespread perplexity.
</P>
<P>
   Later, near-circles and near-squares, each in a strong tonal
contrast to the others, were intended to look as if they were
moving back, forth and sideways in relation to one another. These
were among the more sumptuous British abstract paintings beginning
in the mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Heron was conspicuous as a painter, an art critic and a member
of a group of artists and writers who lived in or near St. Ives.
From 1947 till 1950 he was art critic for The New Statesman, then
the liveliest weekly magazine in Britain. From 1955 until 1958 he
wrote regularly for the American magazine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate postwar years he spoke out for Matisse,
Picasso, Leger, Bonnard and Braque as masters who were
insufficiently known in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Ives he came to know a cosmopolitan group of painters,
sculptors and potters. Among them were Naum Gabo, Ben Nicholson,
Barbara Hepworth, Alfred Wallis and Bernard Leach.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Leeds on Jan. 30, 1920, Heron could almost be said to
have been born to color, in that his father was a textile
manufacturer who in 1929 founded a firm called Cresta Silks for
which Paul Nash and other well-known English artists were happy to
make designs.
</P>
<P>
   Heron was honored with major exhibitions at the Whitechapel Art
Gallery (1972), the Barbican Art Gallery (1985) and, above all, at
the Tate Gallery in 1998. Though already frail, he was buoyed by
the bravado of his lifelong delight in color.
</P>
<P>
   He was married in 1945 to Delia Reiss, who died in 1979. He is
survived by two daughters.

 &HT;    Lady Dogs on way to San Jose
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ For the first 13 minutes against Iowa State Monday
night, Georgia played some of its best basketball of the season
with a trip to the Final Four on the line. And for most of the
remaining 27 minutes, the Lady Bulldogs battled their own sloppy
play and some feisty resistance by the Cyclones in the last stop on
the way to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lady Dogs held on despite a late Iowa State rally for an
89-71 victory in the Mideast Regional final to earn them their
fifth trip to the Final Four later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller won Mideast Regional MVP honors and scored a
career-high 33 points for Georgia (27-6), which plays either
Tennessee or Duke Saturday in a national semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   Coco Miller had 16 points, Pam Irwin-Osbolt had 15 and Angie
Ball had 11 for Georgia. Iowa State was led by 19 points from
Desiree Francis.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (25-8), making its first trip ever to the Elite 8
after upsetting Connecticut on Saturday, doggedly fought back in
the final five minutes, applying a rare full-court press to force
Georgia into turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-point basket by Frese with 3:28 to play cut Georgia's lead
to 74-63, but Kelly Miller sank two free throws on the ensuing play
and the Cyclones threw an inbounds pass away. But Angie Welle
banked home a trey for a 76-66 score, the closest Iowa State would
get.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had trouble making free throws, missing five of its next
seven, but Coco Miller canned two from the line, then pulled down a
big rebound on an Iowa State miss as the clock wound down under two
minutes. Georgia's Deana Nolan typified the chaotic nature of play
early in the second half, when Iowa State crept back to within 12
points, rousing nearly 3,000 Cyclones fans who made the trip across
the Midwest. Nolan picked up three fouls in 56 seconds, as Iowa
State went into the bonus within the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A jumper by Desiree Francis helped Iowa State close to 40-28 at
the 16:52 mark. The Lady Dogs also played sloppily, turning the
ball over in the open floor and failing to box out. But Iowa State
never found the range from the perimeter, and Georgia warmed up
enough to made a comeback nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller broke the Georgia record for 3-pointers in an NCAA
game, and buried her sixth trey with 12:59 to play for a 53-35
lead. Iowa State got only four free throws and a bucket in the
following sequence, and back-to-back baseline jumpers by Nolan and
Tawana McDonald made the score 59-37 with 11:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was very apparent near the end of the first half that
Georgia's biggest battle was going to be keeping the sharp edge
maintained over the first 13 minutes, when the Lady Dogs bolted out
to a 31-10 lead. Georgia made 13 of its first 20 shots, with Kelly
Miller hitting her first eight attempts from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Iowa State was a miserly 3-for-15, with Georgia's
ball pressure taking out the Cyclones' lethal 3-point shooters.
Iowa State made only two of nine treys, and went without a field
goal for 7:50 as Georgia kept the heat on.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa State began mixing up zone defenses toward the end of
the first half, and that confused Georgia, which missed six
straight shots as the Cyclones cut it to 16 at 31-15 on a drive by
Tracy Gahan with 4:26 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also encountered foul trouble in the middle, with
McDonald and Angie Ball each picking up two personals, and its
inside game was ineffective against the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin-Osbolt hit two straight jumpers and Ball sunk one as
Georgia finished the half strongly, leading 37-22. Kelly Miller had
18 points and Irwin-Osbolt had nine at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Frese, who leads Iowa State with 17 points a game, was limited
to six, but her teammates shot only 25 percent from the field.

THE FASHION DESIGNERS' ANNUAL GALA SETS THE DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Council of Fashion Designers of America's annual
awards gala, until this year a highlight of New York's winter
social season, is now a late-spring event. The black-tie affair
will take place on June 2 at the 69th Regiment Armory, in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Fern Mallis, the council's executive director, had said earlier
that the new American show dates in February for the fall
collections would mean that her organization would have to move its
awards show, normally held in February.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the council expects finally to complete negotiations
to televise the show, sometimes called the Oscars of fashion. The
move has been in the works at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still in its final stages of negotiation, but it's going
to be on television this year,'' Ms. Mallis said. She would not
reveal details of the pending agreement. In the past, both network
and cable television representatives have come to the table. The
program will not be shown live, Ms. Mallis added.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to this year's dinner, for which 1,000 guests are
expected, will have the same price as last year's _ $1,500 each.
Tables, which will seat 10, will range from $15,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The honorees for the gala are to be announced at a news
conference on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Among the categories honored will be designer of the year for
women's wear, designer of the year for men's wear and accessory
designer of the year. Nominees for the Perry Ellis Awards for new
design talent in men's and women's wear will also be revealed on
Wednesday, but the winners will not be named until the night of the
gala.
</P>
<P>
   Starting last year, the design council began to allow its
members to vote on some awards, along with the usual panel of
retailers and journalists. These included the Perry Ellis Awards,
the Lifetime Achievement Award and the International Designer of
the Year Award. ``Designers said they wanted to have more
participation,'' Ms. Mallis said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it has been more than a year since the last awards, the
industry has voted on winners in most categories based on three
collections _ two from last year along with those shown in
February.
</P>
<P>
   It is now seeping into fashion that women who crave comfort in
clothes should not have to give up style, trends or designer
touches to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The moment seems to have given birth to Skye, a new collection
by Gale Parker, a former designer at Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker, who has a full head of vibrant gray-flecked hair and
crinkly laugh lines, is an interesting story.
</P>
<P>
   As a young girl of 19, she modeled for Valentino, and then
worked in design for Halston and Diane Von Furstenburg, and edited
at Vogue. She later fell in love and moved to California. There,
raising children and getting a little bored, she bumped into an old
friend, Joel Schumacher, whom she knew from his days as a window
designer at Henri Bendel. Schumacher, now a top producer, was then
still young to the film industry, but he secured several styling
and costume design jobs for Ms. Parker on his films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the movies to go to Ralph,'' Ms. Parker said. She
stayed with Lauren from 1989 through 1995, and has since worked for
the Limited and in her own consulting business until starting Skye
with Karen and Phil Sadick.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker is the designer, and the Sadicks help with financing
and running the company. The also own Chelsea Textiles, a home
accessories company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker likes an easy, bohemian classic look for her
collection. There's a floor-length burgundy mohair and cashmere
cardigan over a matching dress, a velvet peasant top in rich
russet, a gray viscose quilted jacket with ornate frog closures,
and long skirts with the most elegant elastic waists you have ever
seen, beaded and embroidered with folkloric touches.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $120 to $800 retail, and Ms. Parker hopes to
have the collection available in stores soon.

 FORMER JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN WARNS OF NATO CASUALTIES
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATO has the ability to destroy much of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's military infrastructure, but had better be
prepared to suffer some casualities in the process, Gen. John
Shalikashvili, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili, President Clinton's principal military adviser
for four years until his retirement in 1997, said he will be
surprised if Milosevic holds firm and subjects his country to NATO
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does refuse to back down and NATO is forced to act,
allied planes may find the skies over Yugoslavia much more deadly
than those over Iraq, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia's air defenses are well-integrated and very
formidable and could pose some problems for NATO pilots,'' said
Shalikashvili, who also served as supreme allied commander in
Europe before becoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He said Yugoslavia has been able to study U.S. and allied
military tactics against Iraq and to prepare its defenses
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to compare this to Iraq, but Yugoslavia's defenses
are every bit as good, if not better, and we won't have the
capability to take out their command and control systems quite so
easily,'' the retired four-star Army general said. ``The Serbs have
had time to learn from Iraq and have had the time to take advantage
of what they've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said Operation Desert Storm against Iraq marked
the first time that such a lethal combination of advanced weapons
and technology was used, including cruise missiles, stealth
bombers, electronic warfare techniques and precision bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that came as a great surprise to the Iraqis,'' said
Shalikashvili, who now lives near Tacoma. ``It allowed us to
operate with a great deal of latitude. If it becomes necessary in
Yugoslavia, the result will be the same in the end, but it will not
be as easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first few days, I think you need to go on the
assumption that you will suffer casualties. That's the only prudent
way to approach this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said one of his main concerns is that the Clinton
administration may have delivered ultimatums before it garnered the
necessary domestic support for its Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult when you're not involved day-to-day... but
what I always worried about is before you issue ultimatums or
threaten force, you make sure that you have done all your homework
and have the concurrence and support you need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Monday took up legislation aimed at blocking funds
for any military intervention in the Kosovo crisis unless President
Clinton first obtained congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we go bombing sovereign nations, we ought to have a
plan,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a sponsor of the
restricting legislation. ``There is no clear policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said the task in Yugoslavia in some ways will be
tougher than Iraq because NATO is not going in to wage all-out war,
but to conduct air strikes and to coerce Milosevic to sign a peace
agreement. And it will not have gathered the massive assets
available for the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbian troops are currently sweeping through
Kosovo Albanian villages in what Shalikashvili said is probably an
attempt to destroy the Kosovo Liberation Army's command and control
system. He said it would be nearly impossible for NATO air strikes
to immediately stop the ground operation and ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo's scattered villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what you can do is make ethnic cleansing very costly,'' he
said. ``It has never been a question of going after tanks and
individual police and army units on the ground. I don't think
Milosevic would be terribly persuaded if you just shot up some of
his tanks. You've got to hit his high-value targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Those targets include the Yugoslav command and control network,
its air traffic control system and communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to use the same approach we used with Saddam
(Hussein, in Iraq),'' Shalikasvili said. ``If he comes out of his
box, you have to hit him hard enough to get him back inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili said the United States has ``painted NATO into a
corner.'' If Milosevic refuses to back down, the organization must
act if it is to maintain its credibility. Otherwise, he said, NATO
will end up like UNPROFOR _ the toothless U.N. Protection Force in
wartime Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of NATO will certainly not be enhanced if NATO
chooses not to take any action,'' he said. `I think it would set a
bad precedent if NATO without good reason backs away.''
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, Milosevic dragged out negotiations as
long as possible and usually was able to take the process to the
brink before backing down. Shalikashvili said he's probably using
the same strategy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic sees this as a good opportunity to wipe out the
opposition,'' he said. ``But it would surprise me if he chose to
proceed and for us to start bombing and, in the end, to allow the
destruction of all these high-value Serb targets. I don't think
he's that kind of man. He's gambling that we will give him enough
time to do what he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke would decide Tuesday
whether to continue talks with Milosevic, Shalikashvili said:
``That's one more day in which Milosevic can continue to do what he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the retired general said, ``if anybody can bring
Milosevic to the negotiating table, it's Dick Holbrooke.''

   NEW YORK _ Dr. Aubre de Lambert Maynard, an authority on surgery
to treat heart, chest and abdominal wounds who was credited with
saving the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after he was
stabbed in 1958, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard was long associated with Harlem Hospital Medical Center,
where he was director emeritus of surgery. The hospital's cardiac
operating suite was named in his honor in 1972. He had also been a
special lecturer and clinical professor of surgery at Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20, 1958, when Maynard was chief of surgery at Harlem,
King was stabbed by a deranged woman at a book-signing on 125th
Street. During the attack, a steel blade was plunged into King's
chest, where it was firmly lodged in the sternum.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, no attempt had been made to remove the blade before
Maynard took over in the operating room, as that could have led to
a fatal hemorrhage. He carried out the operation under the eyes of
many anxious notables, including Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Aubre Maynard was born in Georgetown, Guyana, on Nov. 17, 1901.
He received degrees in mathematics and physics from City College in
1922.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioned that engineering held no prospects for blacks, he then
received a medical degree from New York University in 1926, only to
find the same racial obstacles at public and voluntary hospitals in
the city and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Harlem Hospital was then at the heart of a growing black
population and Maynard, placing first in the annual internship
examination, won a position there. He was the first black to be
hired as an intern at the hospital, and he helped open doors for
other blacks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Harlem Hospital became one of the country's first
important medical institutions with a racially integrated staff at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
   That came about under the leadership of Dr. Louis T. Wright, a
graduate of Harvard Medical School and national executive chairman
of the NAACP. Maynard, a close associate of Wright, was a staff
surgeon from 1928 to 1952 and then director of surgery until 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He established a division of thoracic surgery and worked on the
surgical procedures for lung, esophagus and cardiovascular
conditions. The unit established his professional reputation and
enhanced the hospital's as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview, Maynard recalled the pressure surrounding
the surgery on King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a momentous occasion for Harlem Hospital because it was
a man of Dr. King's position who was known all over the world,'' he
said. ``For him to be brought to Harlem Hospital for a dangerous
thing like that, where his life was at stake, it was a challenge.
Could Harlem Hospital show that it was up to this task?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' Maynard continued, ``it was a city hospital, and it
was looked down upon. It was up to me to show the world that it
could be done there.''
</P>
<P>
   King, recovered from his injuries, left the hospital in less
than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard was the author of many articles on his specialty and
contributed chapters to textbooks. He wrote ``Surgeons to the Poor:
The Harlem Hospital Story'' (Appleton, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Janine, survives him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Sunday, about 1:30 p.m. in Los Angeles, and Randolph Duke,
the designer, relaxed and triumphant, is having a pedicure.
</P>
<P>
   There are those designers who send armies of assistants to Los
Angeles to entice Oscar celebrities into their clothes, but for
those like Duke, Pamela Dennis, Mark Badgley of Badgley Mischka and
Kevan Hall of Halston, there is no surer way of getting their
designs on Hollywood's elite on its biggest night of the year than
by planting themselves in town days before the event.
</P>
<P>
   For these designers, Oscar night is a fashion Olympiad filled
with grief, 24-hour work days and, when things go right, gleeful
triumph. On Sunday all four of these designers walked off with a
prize. Most notably, Badgley Mischka dressed a newly romantic
Jennifer Lopez in a black strapless full-skirted silk gown. Duke's
catches included Kim Basinger, Minnie Driver and Geena Davis in the
silver-sequined dress she wore as a presenter. Ms. Dennis' big win
was Liv Tyler in her lavender strapless gown, and Hall dressed
Sarah Michelle Gellar, queen of the teen-age market.
</P>
<P>
   But getting to that point meant harrowing nights that ended at 1
a.m., followed by days that began at 3 a.m. Duke was trying to buy
some well-earned relaxation on Sunday, a few hours before the
arrivals at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. ``Thank you,'' he said
as he bade goodbye to his pedicurist. ``It didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that the same could be said of the previous four days he and
other on-site designers had spent luring stars into their clothes.
Despite creating temporary studios in glamorous hotels like
L'Ermitage and the Avalon in Beverly Hills, drudgery was never far
from hand. Hall flew directly into town from a fabric show in
Paris, and although he has a home in Los Angeles, he set up shop on
Tuesday in the L'Ermitage. It was crucial that potential clients
and stylists, who are conduits to the stars, could get to him
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's first order of business was to set up racks for the
clothes shipped from New York and to ready a VCR for a tape of his
collection. He also had to deal with the lighting. ``In a hotel
room everything is mood lighting,'' he said by phone. ``If you're
here to do business, you need halogens to really see the detail of
the gown better.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Mark Badgley touched down ``at the crack of
dawn'' and headed straight for the Four Seasons for a fitting with
Andie MacDowell, who was vacillating between two of his dresses.
``We talked about shoes and the jewelry,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Following his meeting with Ms. MacDowell, Badgley sped to the
Chateau Marmont hotel to meet with Ms. Lopez. She was not there,
but he left the dress he had brought from New York for her with his
assistant, Karen Handley. The next day, Friday, he was on a plane
back to New York, not knowing which dress, if any, Ms. MacDowell
would choose.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Miss Handley called him to say the dress fit Miss
Lopez, she liked it and so did Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, who
accompanied the actress to her fitting.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock edged toward lunchtime at L'Ermitage, Hall
observed, ``We didn't have breakfast.'' He and his publicity
assistant, Rebecca Lewis, had begun the day at 9 a.m. by readying
two dresses for the local tailor. They returned numerous telephone
messages from journalists, stylists and celebrities' press
representatives. ``These are calls I did not anticipate,'' said an
elated and exhausted Hall, who was joining the Oscar race for the
first time. He took over the design reins at Halston from Randolph
Duke last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be here,'' Hall added. ``You have all the
gowns and suits here for the clients to really see, and you can fit
them and give them a lot of personal attention. Celebrities and
women generally love to work with the designer.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Duke, now on his own, was on his second trip to the Oscars, and
he worked intensely with Kim Basinger on her white strapless gown,
even heeding her suggestion to change the fabric. Having parted
ways with his longtime publicist, Sandra Graham, who helped him
engineer an Oscar triumph last year by putting Minnie Driver in one
of his designs, Duke had his hands full.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up working with everyone personally,'' he said later.
``The minute I picked up the phone I got a call-back.'' Duke, did
not, however, know what he was getting into in the case of Ms.
Basinger. At 8:30 a.m. Saturday, he comandeered a car to the Los
Angeles airport to pick up Ms. Basinger's altered dress sent from
New York by Federal Express. ``We had a little problem with fitting
Kim,'' Duke said. ``I asked for my seamstresses to come out to Los
Angeles, but they just couldn't. They're 60 years old. They have
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Duke met Rita Wilson, Tom Hanks' wife, for a fitting at
her house. ``It's amazing what you have to go through to dress
someone today,'' Duke said. ``It's like a fashion show: work, work,
work, try, try, try, look, look, look.'' But the publicity gained
by having a nominee or presenter wear one of his dresses was worth
every effort, he continued, adding, ``This can put fashion
designers on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   As evening came to Los Angeles on Saturday, the unexpected break
came for Hall: Whitney Houston wanted to try on his dresses, and
Hall took off in a flurry.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ms. Houston took nothing from Hall. ``It was still
good,'' Hall said Monday. ``I got to meet Whitney and set up future
appointments with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's nightmares gave way to Sunday morning's insanity. At
1 a.m. Sunday, Ms. Dennis was on her way to the Beverly Hills Hotel
to see if she could offer something Ms. Houston might like.
``Someone was rehearsing, she didn't have a dress, we haven't eaten
all day,'' Ms. Dennis said later Sunday in a kind of
discombobulated frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dennis had a limited selection for Ms. Houston. The designer
had sent out several dresses for stars to look at, and some seemed
to be hoarding them. ``Do these people keep things to keep them
away from other people?'' Ms. Dennis asked.
</P>
<P>
   Foodless and sleepless, Ms. Dennis had answered approximately 70
messages over the weekend, at least half from accessory designers
urging her to push their wares with the stars. But they picked the
wrong designer. Ms. Dennis had a trove of accessories from her own
personal wardrobe for any star who needed them.
</P>
<P>
   In the wee hours of Sunday morning, Ms. Houston, a friend of Ms.
Dennis', had still not made up her mind about what to wear. Ms.
Dennis was on her way to the rescue with a full skirt with rose
trim and a tube top. ``I hope to God it fits,'' the designer said.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:45 p.m. Sunday, she made a second visit to Ms. Houston,
after picking up shoes for her at Barneys.
</P>
<P>
   It was just about this time that Duke was pampering his feet.
``I pulled my personal credit card out a lot of times,'' Duke said.
``I haven't seen anyone pull out a checkbook. Is it appropriate to
send them a bill? I don't know what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke's pedicure was almost over. ``I just got a call an hour ago
saying Kim was wearing the white,'' he said happily.
</P>
<P>
   A weary Duke had chosen to skip the final Sunday fitting for Ms.
Basinger. He left things in the hands of Steve Chester, his
creative director, who called from the actress' house with the good
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like when an actress gives me something about what they like
and what's best for them,'' Duke said. ``Although some know better
than others, Kim is very involved, which I respect.''

CROPS FAILING IN DODGERS FARM SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ There was a time when you could count on a
couple of things from the Dodgers: The team would be in the thick
of the division race and have one of the top rookies in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   From Jackie Robinson to Todd Hollandsworth, the Dodgers have
prided themselves on their farm system and its ability to produce
Rookies of the Year. The organization boasts 16 award winners since
1947.
</P>
<P>
   But after having the top NL rookie for five consecutive years
from 1992-96, the Dodgers have been shut out of the award the last
two seasons. On the surface this doesn't seem to be a big problem,
but it's a sign the farm system is beginning to show some cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the present and near future isn't good. Trades
have cost the Dodgers much of their young talent. Top prospects
such as Paul Konerko, Dennis Reyes, Peter Bergeron, Ted Lilly and
Wilton Guerrero were traded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The team's lack of depth in the system is illustrated by
Baseball America's rankings of the top 100 prospects. The rankings
are subjective but have the input of general managers and scouts.
The Dodgers' top prospect in those rankings is catcher Angel Pena,
listed at No. 41. He's the only Dodger on the list.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers must dip into the minors to replace an injured
player, there's little from which to choose. That's why the team
brought so many journeymen _ catcher Rick Wilkins, infielder Scott
Livingstone, reliever Greg Cadaret _ to spring training this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's where it needs to be,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said of the farm system. ``I think we have some help,
but we don't have the insurance you'd like in all areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Kevin Malone is now the general manager, in large
part, because of his very, very strong background in scouting and
player development,'' club president and CEO Bob Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Malone's first actions was to reorganize player
development. Charlie Blaney, with the Dodgers 32 years including
three as vice president of minor-league operations, was forced into
retirement. Bill Geivett was brought in from the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays to take charge of the minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work harder than any other professional sports
organization,'' Geivett said. ``The people that we have must have a
passion for this. It must be their job, their hobby, what they want
to do. I won't be comfortable with our minor-league system until we
can reach down and grab whatever players we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the Dodgers' 24 minor-league coaches weren't asked to
return. On the scouting side, director Terry Reynolds was
reassigned. Ed Creech was brought in from the St. Louis Cardinals
to head the amateur scouting department. Also, Acey Kohrogi was
named director of Asian operations and Jack Zduriencik was named
director of international operations.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been a change in how the Dodgers scouting
department evaluates players. Instead of labeling a player as a
major-league talent, the Dodgers now rate their players in seven
categories, including all-star or superstar potential, utility
players and pinch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Creech) is a quality evaluator,'' St. Louis general manager
Walt Jocketty said. ``There hasn't been a lot of change in the
organization and sometimes that's good. Sometimes you have to bring
change to bring in fresh ideas and fresh people. I think they're
taking a step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong minor-league system is paramount to consistent winning.
Look no further than the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. Those
organizations are built on the farm system, dipping into the
free-agent market to fill holes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees needed extra outfield help down the stretch a
year ago, they turned to the minor leagues and Shance Spencer, who
hit .373 during the final 27 games, including 10 home runs.
Meanwhile, the Braves called up Bruce Chen to fill a hole in their
starting rotation. In four starts, Chen was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the 1999 Dodgers have been built through the
marketplace. Of the 28 players expected to battle for a spot on the
25-man roster, 16 became Dodgers through trades or free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the free-agent signings of pitchers Kevin Brown and
Alan Mills and center fielder Devon White were needed for the short
term _ and the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful you need that foundation in player
development, and right now we're just building that foundation,''
Malone said. ``We're not looking for the short fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think we're making these major-league,
free-agent acquisitions for the short term. They don't understand
that the truth of the matter is those signings were made as much
for the present as it is for the future. It buys us time to
replenish the farm system.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's come with a hefty price tag: Those free agents have
pushed the Dodgers' payroll past $80 million. It was an investment
in the future the team had to make if the farm system is to bear
fruit again. &QL; 
MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE MINORS
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at top minor-league prospects who are no longer
with the Dodgers: &QL; 
__ Paul Konerko: Two-time L.A. minor-league Player of the Year . .
. traded to Cincinnati, which sent him to Chicago (AL), where he
will play every day. &QL; 
__ Dennis Reyes: Was 2-3 (3.83 ERA) in '97 and 0-4 (4.71 ERA) in
'98 . . . traded to Cincinnati, where he was 3-1 (4.42 ERA) and
will start in '99. &QL; 
__ Ted Lilly: California League (A) Pitcher of the Year . . .

IN EGYPT, MRS. CLINTON PARRIES QUESTIONS ABOUT SENATE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Hillary Rodham Clinton deflected questions Monday
about whether she plans to run for the Senate from New York, but
said she was looking for a way to advance the issues involving
children and women ``I've spent more than 25 years working on.''
</P>
<P>
   With even shopkeepers here speculating that Mrs. Clinton might
run, she paused during a 12-day tour of North Africa Monday to
address questions about her plans. She repeatedly emphasized that
she was here to promote goodwill and good works, not her political
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with a lot of people in the last month,'' Mrs.
Clinton said of her consideration of a campaign, ``and I will
continue that when I return home. But right now I want to focus on
the issues that are really at the base of this very important
partnership and friendship between the United States and Egypt,
which I think is in the best interests, long-term, of the people of
both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first full day of her trip, Mrs. Clinton hopscotched
across Cairo Monday at a pace that would exhaust many candidates,
let alone diplomats. She paid an hourlong call on President Mohamed
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt then stopped at a bazaar, an educational
center, a health clinic, a synagogue, and a church, squeezing in a
lunch and a reception along the way.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton toured two mosques. She
is trying on this trip in part to encourage religious tolerance and
allay any suspicions of American regard for Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Of six questions from reporters, four dealt with the Senate
race, although Mrs. Clinton did not always choose to interpret them
that way. Asked about her ``future plans'' by an Egyptian reporter,
she responded: ``Well, tomorrow I'm going to Luxor.'' The audience
laughed and clapped.
</P>
<P>
   Trying another gambit, an American then noted that some people
who spoke with the first lady Monday told reporters that they hoped
Mrs. Clinton would run. What was her reaction? ``I have enjoyed
meeting all of the people that I've met so far,'' Mrs. Clinton
said, ``and we've talked about important issues that are really
critical to the lives of the people in Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reporter asked the question head-on: Was the first
lady considering a campaign? Mrs. Clinton replied that she would
keep consulting people about it, but that for the time being she
was thinking about Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But after a more roundabout question about the best way to
promote her ``global mission'' on behalf of women, Mrs. Clinton
became more expansive. ``I don't know the answer to that,'' she
said. ``But I do know that I want to continue speaking out on
behalf of the issues that I've spent more than 25 years working on,
having to do with improving the lives of children and giving more
opportunities of all kinds to people, particularly women, and
improving relations around the world, among democracies, and making
it clear that we have a lot to learn and give to one another in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Any way that I can continue to do that I intend to.
But the form that will take I really, I can't predict at this
time.'' Mrs. Clinton, who had previously issued only a written
statement and made an oblique public joke about the Senate race, is
considering a campaign for the seat to be vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During this Middle East tour, Mrs. Clinton is not visiting
Israel _ a stop important to many New Yorkers _ because, her aides
had said, it would be improper for her to go so close to the
elections there. She intends to visit Israel and Jordan later this
year, they said.

MOYA FALLS FROM NO. 1 SPOT AFTER LOSS AT LIPTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Carlos Moya, the world's No. 1 player, wore
an invisible bounty on his head along with his signature white
headband as he shuffled out to the grandstand court Monday for his
fourth-round assignation with the scruffy Sebastien Grosjean of
France at the Lipton Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But when Moya stalked away from the broiling court 2 hours 39
minutes later, he was no longer a marked man, no longer No. 1 and
no longer a contender at this bustling $4.6 million event.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Moya was the victim of a 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (11-9) upset
crafted by a 20-year-old player in baggy shorts and a wrong-way
baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I win, but I win,'' said Grosjean, who
escaped three match points belonging to Moya during their madcap
tie breaker, then converted his own second match point with a
laser-like forehand down-the-line pass.
</P>
<P>
   Moya intercepted the pass, but his feeble backhand volley found
its way to the net and died without crossing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he was a little bit nervous,'' Grosjean said of the
loser, who was also a little bit contentious and exited the court
without shaking the hand of the chair umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Moya's premature demise guaranteed that second-seeded Pete
Sampras, who manhandled Albert Costa of Spain, 6-4, 6-4, at sunset,
will regain his No. 1 spot on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, a two-time Lipton champion who has not won this title
for five years, had thrown a minor tantrum when he learned that his
fourth-round match with Costa was scheduled for the grandstand.
Thanks to the interminable outing of Moya there, Sampras was
switched to the stage he prefers, the stadium, and took care of
business in 81 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras seemed more apprehensive about his coming quarterfinal
against seventh-seeded Richard Krajicek than excited about
regaining his ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it once and I'll say it a thousand times, it doesn't
matter what you're ranked this time of year,'' Sampras said.
``Don't get me wrong; I'm pleased, but I'm more concerned about my
match tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is 2-5 against Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   When Moya, 22, the French Open's reigning champion, usurped
Sampras at the top by reaching the final last week at Indian Wells,
Calif., he responded to his first outing as a No. 1-ranked target
by faltering in that final against unseeded Mark Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Here on this windswept tropical island, Moya faltered again,
this time battered less by his opponent _ whose hit-or-miss
flailing produced 81 unforced errors _ than by his own inadvertent
blend of tentative ball-striking and anxious mistakes. Moya
double-faulted eight times and had 72 unforced errors, an
unconscionable display for a topspin artisan like himself.
</P>
<P>
   The red and yellow Spanish flags that had waved so boldly in the
jam-packed bleachers during the first set were flying at
half-staff, and the spectators were marveling at the audacity of
this fleet-footed French scrapper in the same breath that they
mispronounced his name as ``Gross-jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Frenchman did not seem to mind that nobody knew who he
was. Grosjean, who loves Florida so much that he intends to
relocate to Boca Raton with his wife, Marie, and 5-month-old baby,
Lola, just stuck his racquet in the air and applauded the crowd
with his free hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' he said. ``Here, I have pleasure to play.
This is my best win. It's great here.''
</P>
<P>
   In other matches, 16th-seeded Serena Williams, on a tour-leading
13-match unbeaten streak after capturing her first career titles
back-to-back at Paris and Indian Wells, pounded Magui Serna of
Spain into a speedy surrender, 6-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was serious, I stayed focused, I was motivated,'' said the
17-year-old Williams, who faces third-seeded Monica Seles in the
Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Corretja, seeded fourth, was yet another Spaniard who had a
bad day at the Lipton despite his 12-4 record here.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja had a chance to claim the No. 1 ranking by winning this
title, but instead of advancing to the quarterfinals, he fell, 7-5,
6-3, to fourth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In another upset on the men's side, 30th-ranked Nicolas Kiefer
of Germany followed his ouster of fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter by
ambushing 12th-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the United States Davis Cup team, Tom Gullikson,
has selected Jim Courier, Jan-Michael Gambill and the doubles
specialist Alex O'Brien to join Todd Martin on the squad that
tackles Britain, led by the top 10-caliber duo of Tim Henman and
Greg Rusedski, in the first round next month in Birmingham,
England. Gullikson's options were narrowed when Pete Sampras, Andre
Agassi, and Michael Chang deemed themselves unavailable for the
April 2-4 encounter, but he consoled himself with a positive
statistic. ``I will say that between Jan-Michael, Jim Courier and
Todd Martin, we have a 13-2 record over the two English players,
but there's a lot that goes on when putting together a team,'' said
Gullikson, who was informed by Agassi that he will never play Davis
Cup again because he is outraged by the USTA's dismissal of Dr.
George Fareed, the longtime team physician.

GOOD DEED REPAID WITH APPARENT LOOTING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's the old saying, no good deed goes
unpunished? You don't have to remind Mike Motazedi.
</P>
<P>
   His good deed was taking pity on a local homeless man a couple
of months ago and giving him a job.
</P>
<P>
   In January, I wrote about the kindhearted Motazedi, owner of a
suburban Woodland Hills 7-Eleven convenience store, and how he set
60-year-old James Cooper up in an apartment and bought him some
clothes while he was in training to take over the graveyard shift
at the store.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, around 11 p.m., police say, Cooper paid him
back.
</P>
<P>
   The store surveillance video camera caught Cooper making two or
three trips in and out of the store with his arms full of
merchandise, police said. Police arrived and called Motazedi, who
took stock: The safe was empty, the cash register was empty, and
cartons of cigarettes and other merchandise _ altogether valued at
around $3,500 _ were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Burglary detectivesfrom the Los Angeles Police Department's West
Valley Division took the videotape from the store as part of their
grand-theft investigation, said Detective Supervisor Roland
L'Heureux.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until around 3 a.m. Thursday that some of Motazedi's
night owl customers figured something was wrong when they walked
into the Ventura Boulevard store and no one was in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called the police, and the police called me,'' Motazedi
said Monday, still in a bit of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hurts, but it doesn't change my mind,'' Motazedi said.
``People need a second chance, and I'll continue to give them one.
Life sometimes isn't fair. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
This time, I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing that hurts most, say Motazedi and store manager Daljit
Singh, is that Cooper didn't bother to lock up the place when he
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought we were doing a very good thing helping him,
but he obviously didn't think so,'' Singh said. ``We had no idea he
would do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   When I talked to Cooper in January, he was extremely grateful
for the job opportunity while being very candid about his past,
including a stretch in prison 30 years ago for robbery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him (Motazedi) about it, and how I lost everything to a
bad gambling habit in the '60s and early '70s _ my marriage, my
home, everything,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   He figured once Motazedi heard all the shady details of his
background, the store owner would say, sorry, but he couldn't be
trusted behind a cash register.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Motazedi hired him.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman was impressed that the homeless man never
hassled any of his customers, and was always courteous to everyone
as he pushed his shopping cart filled with bottles and aluminum
cans down the boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew was the man I had seen outside on the street, not
the man from 30 years ago,'' Motazedi said at the time. ``This man,
I felt I could trust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He promised not to gamble again if I hired him,'' Motazedi
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night he didn't show up for work. He asked for a second
chance, and I gave it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night, police said Cooper paid him back.

BUCKEYES RISE TO MEET PENN'S EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Scoonie Penn's October utterance is rehashed in coming months
and years, no doubt it will take its place somewhere a notch below
Babe Ruth's called home run or Joe Namath's Super Bowl prediction.
</P>
<P>
   No, Penn did not actually predict before the season that Ohio
State would be in the Final Four and contemplating a semifinal
matchup against Connecticut. He merely suggested that this team's
goal should be higher than the stated mark set by coach Jim O'Brien
_ which was just to have a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had five consecutive losing seasons,'' O'Brien told the
media the day before practice began. ``I think realistically before
you start talking about postseason play and the NCAA Tournament,
you have to establish that you're going to win more than you
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Not good enough, said Penn, who sat out an 8-22 season in
O'Brien's first year in Columbus, Ohio, after, in effect, following
him from Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the NCAA Tournament,'' Penn boldly stated.
``That's realistic to me and the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates took more the line of their coach. But as March
has revealed, O'Brien has been forced to admit that James
``Scoonie'' Penn's foresight was 20/20.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he made that comment,'' O'Brien said, ``I was one who
thought he was crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, my whole feeling was that I just wanted us to be
better than we were a year ago. Scoonie's mentality was that he had
played in two NCAA Tournaments at Boston College, and he felt that
when March comes around, you play in the tournament. He obviously
knew more about what was going on than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State not only landed a tournament berth for the first time
since the Jim Jackson era (1990-92), but finds itself in the Final
Four for the first time since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes finished second in the Big Ten to Michigan State,
forging a 12-4 record after winning only one conference game the
previous season. Their turnabout was the program's best ever. Penn
became the Big Ten player of the year. O'Brien was the popular
choice as coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have surprised even their 5-foot-9 junior point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't put us in the Sweet 16,'' Penn said. ``I was just
hoping we would make the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn said his belief that his team was better than modest
preseason hopes was validated in December by victories against
Alabama-Birmingham, North Carolina State and Mississippi to win the
Puerto Rico Holiday Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a turning point for us,'' he said. ``We won
three tough games in a row, and the guys became confident we could
do some things. We came together and started the season off
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have two big-time tournament players in their guard
combination of Penn and Michael Redd, who many believed was
deserving of more than second-team Big Ten honors. But they also
have a freshman guard, Brian Brown, who plays like a winner, and
two very good role players _ forward Jason Singleton and center Ken
Johnson, who was MVP of the South Regional championship victory
against St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   They are all very athletic and appear capable of matching
semifinal opponent Connecticut in that department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strength is the way they play together,'' St. John's
coach Mike Jarvis said. ``All five of their players are really good
at defensive help. They cover very well, use their athletic
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very deceptive team. We may have underestimated
their physical ability. They get to loose balls very quickly, they
have good hands, they all jump well. They're strong. And I don't
know if we've played a better backcourt all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn is the catalyst, the newcomer. Redd is the established
go-to player, and there has nothing but compatibility between the
two, a key to this team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoonie brought a different attitude to this program,'' Redd
said. ``He's been a winner all his life. He brought us another
scoring weapon and a lot of leadership. This has been a dream
season for us, a total turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn is not making any Final Four predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often you get opportunities like this,'' he said.
``We've got to take full advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens Saturday in St. Petersburg, Fla.,
O'Brien says this will remain a season he'll not forget. And that
some might say the fourth-seeded Buckeyes don't belong in a Final
Four with three No. 1 seeds doesn't phase him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I am thankful for is for the opportunity to get to
Ohio State, but more importantly, to coach this group of kids,'' he
said. ``They're respectful and they've done everything we've asked
them all year long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're party crashers at the Final Four or not.
We'll just have to see what happens. Nothing that happens now can
change the way I feel about this season. But the thing I've talked
to the team about is, let's don't settle for what we've
accomplished. Maybe we can get a little more.''

AILING, DEPLETED NETS ROLL TO VICTORY

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jayson Williams smiled as he watched
Stephon Marbury skidding around the court, hitting an assortment of
shots from inconceivable angles in the fourth quarter, putting the
finishing touches on one of the New Jersey Nets' few happy nights
this season.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to get excited about the team's future as Marbury
had 31 points and 12 assists to lead the Nets over the Toronto
Raptors, 106-87, at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But for Williams, who is trying to live up to his $100 million
contract, every rebound he grabbed (15) and every shot he blocked
(four) meant a clenched jaw and a wince of pain.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams left the floor in the third quarter with his
fourth foul, he was greeted by teammates who celebrated his fourth
blocked shot. But he carefully extended only his right hand, trying
to salvage the ligament damage in his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Williams sat at his locker with his left hand
encased in protective padding. He said he would not give up on a
lost season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it can be turned around,'' Williams said. ``Just
as easy as we lost so many, we can win with the homestretch going
on. I've got to say glass is half full because I think we're going
to turn this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Don Casey, with little else to turn to, is hoping that
Williams is able to play through the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will get to that point,'' Casey said. ``If
the team is involved and competing, it's important for the
franchise to finish strong, to still compete to set the tone for
the future. Unless it's threatening to his future, to pump some
life into this, I expect him to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wasn't the only Nets player hurting. Scott Burrell
chipped a bone in his right foot in Sunday's loss at Cleveland and
will be out about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rony Seikaly, after playing Sunday with inflammation of the
plantar fascia of his right foot, was on the sideline again Monday
night. And Jim McIlvaine was placed on the injured list Monday with
torn cartilage in his left shoulder, and will undergo arthroscopic
surgery on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Chris Carr scored 24 points and Jamie Feick, a
free agent signed earlier in the day, played a solid inside game.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carr _ who played just eight minutes in his first four
games with the team but who has become a regular part of the
rotation in the last two games as well as the team's most dangerous
scorer _ Feick stepped into a Nets uniform and found himself on the
floor for 27 minutes and he grabbed eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With the 6-foot-8-inch, 255-pound Feick the team's lone big man
off the bench with only eight players dressed tonight, Williams
knows that he is being counted on. But he said that he would meet
with a hand specialist, Dr. Charles Melone, this week to assure
himself that he is not risking further damage by playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to a point where I can't even get a good night's
sleep anymore,'' Williams said. ``I've been here since about 1:30
this afternoon. This is the most pain I've ever played in. I don't
want to ever do this again. I'm going to meet with Charlie one day
again this week, make sure I'm not doing any further damage because
now it even hurts when I run, the vibration. It's not getting any
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there is pressure on me, you know, not to lie. When you
are the highest-paid player, you get all the blame. But that's part
of the job, so I've got to keep playing. People don't understand.
You get out here and it's, whew.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under orders not to let Serbia delay NATO
action while Kosovo burns, an American diplomat struggled early
Tuesday to negotiate at least a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The American negotiator, Richard Holbrooke, met with President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia for more than three hours in a
last-ditch effort to resolve the Kosovo crisis and forestall NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke then returned to the American Embassy for nearly three
hours of consultations with Washington and NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke met reporters at a Belgrade hotel in the middle of the
night, and said, ``I would be misleading you if I suggested that
today's talks resulted in any substantial significant change in the
situation.'' He added that the heightened military activities in
Kosovo ``make it extremely difficult to pursue peace.'' He said he
would assess the situation later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is engaged in a large offensive against the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, and Washington and the West say NATO will
bomb Serbian military targets if Milosevic does not agree to a
NATO-led force to monitor a peace settlement in the province. The
NATO plan calls in effect for self-rule in Kosovo, but the province
would remain a sovereign part of Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia, for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have already destroyed three of the Kosovo
Liberation Army's seven regional headquarters, a senior NATO
official said on Monday, adding urgency to the Holbrooke mission.
Milosevic has been told by his generals, the official said, that
Yugoslav troops could complete their sweep by Friday, destroying
the rebels' command and control. The Serbs also burned villages and
drove civilians from their homes in the province, whose population
is predominantly ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission ``is a last-ditch effort, and it's got to be
quick,'' the NATO official said. ``We want a quick determination
from Holbrooke about whether we're at the end of the process or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the talks break down, Washington and NATO have promised
severe military punishment for Milosevic. The Yugoslav leader,
while sounding tough, typically waits until the last moment to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton warned that military
action could be imminent. ``If President Milosevic continues to
choose aggression over peace, then NATO's military plans must go
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said 30,000 more ethnic Albanians have been displaced
from their homes in the last few days. ``We cannot allow President
Milosevic to continue the aggression with impunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO official said that without at least a verifiable
cease-fire in Kosovo, there was little point in further talking.
``The last thing we want is to have Milosevic tie up Holbrooke with
fake negotiations while the Serbs clear up in Kosovo,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized the comment by NATO's supreme commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, that air strikes could occur ``within hours,'' and
said, ``Some allies feel strongly that every day is a lost day.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air strikes would be intended to destroy Yugoslavia's
integrated air defense system and then to send fighters and bombers
to hit Serbian military targets.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO would thus be acting as the Kosovo Liberation
Army's air force, which Western officials had said was not their
goal, the official said: ``The KLA, whatever else they've done,
have signed the peace agreement. So we have a bit of a moral
obligation to the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian offensive followed the sudden withdrawal on Saturday
of the 1,400 unarmed verifiers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Asked if their rapid removal from the
province was not an invitation to Milosevic to attack, the official
said many NATO members had been pressing for air strikes to begin
immediately, with no final Holbrooke mission.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns within NATO, especially from the Italians,
combined with criticism from the American Congress, argued for
longer consultations and a last chance for Milosevic to change his
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian military campaign of the last few days has served to
harden solidarity in NATO about the need for air strikes, and has
allowed the Americans to push for a more intensive set of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington argued that initial cruise missile strikes intended
to destroy Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defense should be
followed _ without pause _ by intensive fighter and bomber attacks
on Serbian military positions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, if there was a pause, the Americans said, Milosevic
would succeed in his aims to damage the rebels seriously while NATO
could appear to be standing by. That new discussion in NATO
required further time, the officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was only on Monday that NATO nations gave the alliance's
secretary- general, Javier Solana, the authority to order expanded
air strikes on ``a much more diverse target list, a much more
intensive pace of operations and an expanded geographical zone,'' a
NATO official told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said NATO was urging the Kosovo guerrillas to
refrain from ``murder and bombing'' _ like the ambush of four
Serbian policemen in downtown Pristina on Sunday night _ that would
justify further Serbian attacks. There were two more bomb attacks
on Monday night on bars in Pristina, with at least one dead and
eight wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Before Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Yugoslav
president met with the three chairmen of the suspended peace talks:
Christopher Hill of the United States, Wolfgang Petritsch of the
European Union and Boris Mayorsky of Russia. The meeting, which was
limited to a discussion of the political side of the Kosovo
agreement, did not go well, said officials at the meeting, which
lasted 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was emotional and lively,'' said Petritsch. They wanted to
give Milosevic an accurate account of the political arrangements,
fearing that he had misinformation. When Milosevic called the
ethnic Albanians ``terrorists and separatists,'' Petritsch said,
``Well, after they signed the agreement, you can only call them
Albanian autonomists.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke concentrated on the damage NATO was about to do to
Milosevic's army and government if Belgrade's position did not
change and the offensive stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Milosevic, Holbrooke made a direct appeal to
Yugoslavia's people to accept foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers ``would protect both the Albanian and Serb
communities from the kinds of violence, indiscriminate and
unnecessary violence, which has been taking place,'' Holbrooke told
an independent television production company, Anem. ``This force
would be for the benefit of all people in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Monday in Brussels, after talks with NATO leaders and
the British, French and German foreign ministers, Holbrooke said,
``We are not _ and I cannot stress this too highly _ going to get
into a talk-while-fighting-intensifies situation in Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO was ``on the brink'' of military action. ``It is
not too late to avoid it, but the window is narrowing,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said, ``We think that this is the moment of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO is being careful not to claim that the goal of any
bombing is to force Milosevic back to the bargaining table.
Instead, NATO officials are insisting that the only goal of air
strikes is to ``degrade'' Serbia's military ability to inflict harm
on the Kosovo Liberation Army and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is the human tragedy that provides NATO its legal
justification to bomb a sovereign country, especially in the
absence of any U.S. Security Council resolution authorizing
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials kept up a defensive, wounded tone, and called
in Western ambassadors to the Foreign Ministry to protest the
possibility of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian president, said Serbs were ready
to defend themselves if the West tried to impose a solution in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want war,'' he told the Greek newspaper Ethnos. ``We
are seeking a peaceful resolution. But if someone attacks us, or if
someone imposes, then of course we will fight for our homeland.''

A BIG BLUE STOP SIGN ON SPARTANS' TITLE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news conference featuring Michigan State's Tom Izzo had
frittered down to its final question on Sunday night. Izzo was
almost out of his chair, eager to return to the Spartans' delirious
locker room at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis. But then that
daunting four-letter word was uttered. Duke. Coach, what about
playing Duke?
</P>
<P>
   Izzo laughed, claiming that he had hoped to escape without
discussing Duke and instead revel in the draining 73-66 victory
over Kentucky for at least one day. Even one hour. Realistically,
Izzo was only teasing about avoiding the most obvious of questions.
He knew the Duke question was going to come one minute after
Michigan State prevailed, and he knows the queries will hound the
underdog Spartans until the teams tangle on Saturday at the Final
Four in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   After snatching the Midwest Regional championship, the Spartans
got to cut the nets and go to bed dreaming about Duke. Were
blindfolds included? Now that the Spartans fulfilled a Final Four
dream that had not happened in East Lansing, Mich., since Magic
Johnson's team won the national title 20 years ago, they must
figure out how to choreograph what would be a monumental upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Duke is as good a team as there's
probably been in the NCAA tournament in a lot of years,'' Izzo
said. ``But I'm not going to throw in the towel. We're going to try
to do the things we do and show up next Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Spartans talked about the impromptu midnight workouts
that bonded them this season, about the rugged style that they have
utilized and about the faraway hopes of a championship that they
all harbored, their party was interrupted with mentions of Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils stifled Michigan State, 73-67, on Dec. 2 in
Chicago, in a game Duke led by as many as 21 points. Mateen Cleaves
was asked if he had been itching for a rematch. The muscular point
guard shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a shot at them,'' Cleaves stressed. ``You don't
want to play Duke, but we'll play them. They're a tough team.
They're hard to scout because they got a team filled with
all-Americans. They all do something. They play together, and they
have good chemistry. It's hard to beat teams like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, echoing his coach almost verbatim, Cleaves said, ``We're
going to show up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It will be blue collar against Blue Devils. It will be sturdy
versus smooth. It will be the No. 1-seeded team from the Midwest
against the No. 1-seeded team from the East. It will be the
Spartans (33-4), who have won 22 straight, trying to shock the Blue
Devils (36-1), who have won 31 in a row and taken games by an
average of more than 25 points. Do the Spartans have to be perfect
to advance to Monday's title game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to play a real good game to beat them,''
Andre Hutson said. ``You can't make too many mistakes. Duke
capitalizes on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson realizes that Duke's prowess makes magical Michigan State
a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why a lot of people don't expect us to win,'' he
said. ``We're not filled with all-Americans and players you've
heard of, and we don't have a great history of winning every year.
It's expected for the doubters to be doubting us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Blue Devils throttled Michigan State more than three
months ago, they made 24 of 41 shots from the field (58.5 percent),
while the Spartans made just 27 of 70 (38.6 percent). Cleaves was
the main culprit in the brick session with a 3-for-17 effort, which
cannot happen again if the Big Ten school is to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, a round-faced junior with a hop in his step and Johnson
as a mentor, is the undisputed leader of the Spartans. Befitting
the Spartans, he has the sort of ugly jump shot that belongs in a
YMCA, but Cleaves is tough on defense, unselfish and clever on
offense and a player whose decent statistics do not tell the tale
of his value.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing 7-of-11 shots against Kentucky, Cleaves was
involved in three of the game's most crucial plays. He nailed a
3-pointer two seconds before halftime to give the Spartans
momentum, he hoisted a football pass to Hutson put them ahead to
stay with 7 minutes 30 seconds remaining and he boosted the lead
with another 3. If the Spartans somehow stun the Blue Devils,
Cleaves will surely guide them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got confidence in my team,'' said Cleaves, embracing the
notion of playing Duke. ``It's great for people not to believe in
us because we believe in ourselves. That's what we have to keep
doing.''

PURDUE PULLS RANK AGAINST RUTGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ZACH BURGESS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAL, Ill. _ It was one of those times when all the right
things had been done. Great defense, clutch shooting. Rutgers Coach
C. Vivian Stringer could not have asked for more from her team.
</P>
<P>
   But the rumblings of a great team in the making would have to
wait another year. For the second consecutive year in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, Rutgers ran into the
No. 1 team in the nation. For the second consecutive year Rutgers
came home short of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite long stretches of flawless basketball, Rutgers managed
to self-destruct while Purdue found its game. The result was a
75-62 victory for the Boilermakers before a rousing crowd of 8,844.
The victory advanced Purdue to the Final Four, where it will play
the winner of the West Regional final between UCLA and Louisiana
Tech, which was being played later Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers was leading by 53-49 with 6 minutes 26 seconds to play
in the game, but Purdue put on a late surge behind Ukari Figgs and
Stephanie White-McCarty. They scored all of Purdue's points in an
11-0 run to put the Boilermakers in command, 60-53. White-McCarty
finished with 22 points and was named the regional's outstanding
player. Figgs scored 18 points, 13 in the final 6:33 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers was led by Shawnetta Stewart, who kept the Knights in
the game with 9-for-22 shooting and finished with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to win,'' Stringer said. ``We had
balance inside and outside. But we said before the game if Cooper
scores a lot, it's going to put more pressure on us. We felt Cooper
could not show up. They, Purdue, did what they had to do. They went
to the basket and got to the foul line, but we shot ourselves in
the foot. That's basically it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to Purdue's Camille Cooper, the inside threat
who made 8-of-9 attempts and finished with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had momentum for the whole game, but let it get away in the
last three minutes,'' Stewart said. ``We turned the ball over. We
let it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Stringer can take pride in taking her team to the final
eight in four short years. And she can boast that she is building a
solid program.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Stringer took over the Rutgers basketball team,
she made her goals for the program known. Rutgers was not going to
be another Big East school laboring in the shadows of Connecticut.
And even though she will have to wait another year before she can
possibly get Rutgers here again, she can start to see her vision
coming true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not claiming that we're altogether there now,'' Stringer
said. ``But what I am saying is that we certainly have grown. We're
not the same freshman team that we were. I think that Purdue ...
being No. 1 ... we live in shock. The babies have grown up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early on, Rutgers did what had got it here in the first place
and it looked as if Purdue's 29-game winning streak would come to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights played a defense so suffocating, so stingy
and so frustrating that the best team in the nation looked as if it
would self destruct under the relentless pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Rutgers match-up zone was too much to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue was held below its season average in the first half,
shooting 34.8 percent from the field, while Rutgers was a
remarkable 53.6 from the field in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers began the game by pounding the ball inside. But Purdue
made a run to go up 14-8 with 10:26 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers came back to tie the score at 14-14, went on a run to
take a lead of 34-26.
</P>
<P>
   But Purdue opened the second half with a 7-0 run to close within
33-34 on Cooper's 3-point play at 17:21.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cooper added another layup at the 15:18 mark, which closed
Purdue's deficit to 35-37. At that point, Cooper had scored the
last seven Purdue points.

FIGHTING TO FORCE A GIANT TO SHARE ITS VITAL LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CABLE-MERGER, CABLE-MERGER-IMPACT) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ As two giant cable television companies were
justifying their merger as key to competing in the high-speed
Internet access business, executives of Internet companies
attending a computer conference here were sparring over how open to
competition cable modem services and other so-called broadband
products should be.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the debate was the insistence by a coalition of
Internet service providers that AT&AMP;T open up the broadband cable
network the long-distance giant acquired with its recent purchase
of Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With telephone and cable companies eager to grab a portion of
each other's business and establish a solid foothold in the
high-speed data, or broadband, business, companies like America
Online and Mindspring Inc., which were built on offering consumers
dial-up access to the Internet, have expressed concern that their
businesses could be damaged if they are cut off from the chance to
offer their own high-speed services over other companies' cables.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the coalition members has been calling on both the Federal
Communications Commission and Congress to force AT&AMP;T to give them
equal access to customers of these services.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's cable network is standardizing on the At Home cable modem
service, of which AT&AMP;T is the largest stockholder. At Home provides
not only the technology for very high-speed access but an Internet
portal, the World Wide Web page that the vast majority of At Home's
customers see first when they fire up their browsers. Thus
customers who might now log on through America Online or Mindspring
or might have their home pages set to Yahoo or MSN or some other
portal service will automatically see At Home's pages when they
have a cable modem installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a choice,'' said Charles Brewer, the chief executive
of Mindspring. ``We can choose whether we want to have a
competitive telecommunications market or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Comcast and Mediaone announced Monday was in large
part prompted by the need to compete for Internet customers with
telephone companies that have begun offering advanced high-speed
services known as digital subscriber lines, or DSL. America Online
has already announced several deals with phone companies to offer
its own high-speed access in some regions.
</P>
<P>
   But Brewer insisted that competition between cable companies and
phone companies was not sufficient to guarantee genuine consumer
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the FCC, William Kennard, told conference
attendees Monday that his agency was going to act cautiously in
assessing the need to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nascent business,'' Kennard said. `We have to have a
healthy dose of humility before we waltz into the marketplace and
start imposing regulatory solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Several participants said Monday that cable and phone companies
would soon face competition from broadband technologies now on the
drawing board, including two-way satellite access, fixed-point
wireless networks and mobile wireless access in the form of
third-generation digital cellular devices.
</P>
<P>
   David Nagel, chief technology officer for AT&AMP;T, said high-speed
digital cellular would be ``one of those things that may come
faster than people currently think.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sparks flew Monday when Nagel suggested that the
Internet service providers' demands for access were an attempt by
narrowband companies to get a ``free ride'' on AT&AMP;T's multibillion
dollar investment in a high-speed digital cable network. In
addition to the $55 billion that AT&AMP;T paid for Tele-Communications
Inc., it has said that it will have to invest billions more in the
cable network to ready it for cable modems and local phone
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's such a load of smelly stuff,'' responded Brewer. ``No
one is proposing that we get a free ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanette Symons, the chief technology officer of Ascend
Communications, a maker of networking gear that in January merged
into Lucent Technologies, said that nationwide broadband service
was still more than five years away.
</P>
<P>
   And she added that insufficient attention had until now been
given to issues like privacy.

CLIPPERS NOTEBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darrick Martin sounded like the slacker edition of the village
watchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consistent minutes are important,'' the Clipper point guard
said one day after being on the clock for 47 minutes (and change)
in his team's semi-startling 100-85 victory at Minnesota. ``When
any player can play and relax, he's going to have a better chance
to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin produced 22 points and seven assists against the
Timberwolves, but his longevity had more to do with necessity than
performance. Sherman Douglas, who has shared the point-guard role
with Martin, was scratched from Sunday's game after straining his
left quadriceps in Friday's loss at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' injury - which may be linked to overcompensating for a
lingering groin pull - could keep him on the pine for a few more
days. Whither Pooh Richardson? Well, that third point-guard option
remains on the injured list. ep For reinforcements, Elgin Baylor,
the team's vice president of basketball operations, is using the
promise of a 10-day contract to beat the bushes for a playmaker.
His best bet figures to be the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers hope to have someone signed and in uniform for
Wednesday's Sports Arena date with Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   __ `Kandi Man' can ... rebound: Rookie center Michael Olowokandi
pulled down a career-high 16 rebounds against the Timberwolves, and
he credits a healthy memory with this backboard tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi had a vivid recollection of how the T'wolves
dominated the inside during last month's visit to the Sports Arena,
and vowed to preempt an encore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't match their intensity the first time,'' he said,
``but I tried to make sure it didn't happen again. I just hope this
will be something we can keep building on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of purpose has to be there; it has to become a
habit.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Horror show: Clippers coach Chris Ford thinks his team may
have been frightened into Sunday's lively performance during a
screening of footage taken from the loss in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed them the Toronto film,'' Ford said, ``and I think it
stressed the importance of being physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with increased aggression in rebounding and on defense,
the Clipper offense had enough flow to make it go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were practically flawless as far as moving the ball goes,''
said Ford, who had three subs - Lamond Murray (19), Rodney Rogers
(14) and Lorenzen Wright (14) - combine for 46 points.

HUNDREDS BRAVE LINE, RISK SHAME OF BEING SEEN WAITING FOR LEWINSKY
</HEADLINE>
 (EDITORS: note language in 12th graf) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After partying with Madonna and other glitterati
at a post-Oscars party, Monica Lewinsky ended her homecoming tour
by signing books for hundreds who wanted a autographed piece of
history _ for $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   More that 400 people clutching copies of ``Monica's Story''
waited up to eight hours Monday outside Brentano's bookstore in the
tony Century City district west of downtown, where Ronald Reagan
keeps an office just a block away &UR; . &LR;  The curious and the mercenary,
the supportive and the cynical all hoped to get an autograph and
exchange a few words with the former Beverly Hills High School
student who carried on an 18-month affair with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a circus, but I'm proud to be a member of this
circus,'' said Adolfo Ramirez, 22, skipping classes for the day
from Santa Monica City College _ another Lewinsky alma mater.
``It's not every day you get to meet someone who almost brings down
a president. I'm just curious to see what she looks like in
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Lewinsky was the toast of the Vanity Fair
post-Oscar party, chatting with star after star _ the famous lining
up to meet the infamous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her if she met Matt Damon,'' said Lynn Harrington, 19,
a California State University, Chico, student who came to the book
signing after visiting a friend in town. ``She said she met Ben
Affleck. She said he's very cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't tell if she was hung over from the weekend,'' said
Chuck Noyes, 44, of Malibu, who had five copies signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was vibrant and wonderful,'' added Harrington's friend,
Angela Davies, 19, a student at California State University,
Northridge. ``She actually seemed like she was willing to converse
more than the security was letting. And she was made up to a T.''
</P>
<P>
   The first person in line arrived at 5:20 a.m. Mark Carpowich, a
political science graduate student at the University of Southern
California, said he thought he should get a head start for the
12:30 p.m. signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a big crush on her for about a year, so I wanted to
meet her in person,'' he said. ``I wish I would've shaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky arrived late, however, and didn't start signing until
about 1:20 p.m. Then, after patrons had been told she would sign
every book for every person in line, that was cut to 400 copies
total.
</P>
<P>
   That was good news for those early in the line, like a pair of
autograph dealers who flew in from New York to have Lewinsky sign
50 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got very mad,'' said Elaine Brophy, 29. ``She was bitching
about it: Oh, my hand hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Mike Wehrmann, 32, said they paid $900 total for
the five boxes of books, but hope to get up to $600 apiece for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The first customers got Lewinsky's full name in curvy, looping
letters that flattened out as the afternoon wore on. Pretty soon
she was signing only ``Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like she's Madonna or something,'' Brophy said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Kelly, 29, of Santa Monica applauded Lewinsky for
admitting she made a mistake and for baring her soul in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell her I admire her and I wish her every
success,'' she said. ``I think she single-handedly changed the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders will now have to be more circumspect, since
Lewinsky showed people what goes on behind the scenes, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody was thrilled to see the circus had come to town,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Berardis of West Hollywood was trying to fight through
the crowd to get to the theater next door, to see the film ``Baby
Geniuses'' with her 7-year-old grandson and his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a movie, not her,'' said Berardis, 57. ``She's
a public nuisance, as far as I'm concerned. She's cost a lot of
taxpayer money _ I don't see the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore officials said Monday they didn't know how many copies
they sold. But the line of patrons snaked outside the store, along
the Yin Yang cafe next door, downstairs through the parking garage,
back outside around Houston's restaurant, along Santa Monica
Boulevard and around the corner to Century Park West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the biggest loser in the world,'' said Travis
Ruff, anchoring the end of the line. ``It's Monica Lewinsky and I'm
standing here for hours. I just feel like an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Loyola Marymount student said he feared someone
he knew would drive by and see him. He never got inside, but bought
an autographed copy from a woman who had an extra, for only $5 over
the retail price.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's more interested in the souvenir than in its
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care. I don't like her. I don't like any of it,'' Ruff
said. ``But there's nothing more fun than a sex scandal.'' &QL;

DUCHESNE COULD BE TRADED TO PHILADELPHIA
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With the NHL trading deadline rapidly
approaching, the Philadelphia Flyers emerged Monday night as the
primary suitor for the services of Los Angeles Kings defenseman
Steve Duchesne.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings waived the disappointing Duchesne last week,
Flyers general manager Bob Clarke indicated he probably would not
be interested in picking him up. But Sunday, Flyers defenseman Eric
Desjardins suffered a knee injury that is expected to sideline him
for several weeks. This might have opened the door for a deal in
which the Kings would unload Duchesne while agreeing to pay a large
portion of his salary. The NHL trading deadline is noon today.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings signed Duchesne last summer to a three-year,
$11.25-million contract, with a player's option for a fourth year
at $3.75 million. In a deal sending Duchesne to Philadelphia, the
Kings would get little if anything in return. But they would rid
themselves of a player whose addition they came to regard as a
mistake over the course of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne has a no-trade clause in his contract, but it is
believed Philadelphia is a team he'd be willing to join. The
33-year-old Duchesne played for the Flyers in 1991-92, scoring 18
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Duchesne deal might not be the only one the Kings make
today. General manager Dave Taylor, who did not comment on the
Duchesne matter, spent much of Monday on the telephone looking to
make one or more deals to improve the team for the long haul. With
playoff hopes declining, any trades the Kings make will be with an
eye to the future.

BRIERE BACK IN MINORS, STILL IN COYOTES' FU TURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes were piling on the team bus after their
game in St. Louis on Thursday when the word spread that rookie
center Daniel Briere was getting sent back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the players noticed the 5-foot-9 Briere digging for
his baggage and they stepped off, one by one, to console and
comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a touching moment at a trying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got there a little late and saw him standing there and,
yeah, it was pretty emotional,'' left wing Greg Adams said. ``We
all feel for him. We all like Danny, he's a great kid. He's going
to be a good hockey player, no question, but he needs some time and
something like this can build character.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere can only hope. Especially after the Coyotes' further
clouded his future on Saturday by acquiring an elite center in
Robert Reichel from the New York Islanders for Brad Isbister and a
swap of draft picks. It was a move made for immediate help, a trade
that could put Phoenix back into contention to challenge for the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Briere, who made a surprise visit Monday to the Coyotes'
Scottsdale practice facility before returning to Springfield today,
wishes a trade wouldn't have become necessary. When the team traded
Cliff Ronning to Nashville, it was to give Briere the opportunity
to center the second line. But the 21-year-old eventually failed to
produce as hoped, mostly due to inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Briere initially didn't want to discuss his demotion, but after
a moment, he relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win here like everybody else,'' he said. ``They
made a move to win right away and in a sense, I'm happy for the
guys. I was here all year, I still feel like I'm a part of the
team. But now I'm going to Springfield for I don't know how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I have to worry about is to play well. You
never know what might happen. If somebody gets hurt, I might be
able to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still the matter of today's NHL trading deadline, too.
Rumors have been rampant that Briere might be involved in a
last-minute trade, possibly with the Montreal Canadiens, but
General Manager Bobby Smith quashed those reports on Monday. He
said Briere, the organization's most skilled prospect, isn't going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, however, apparently have interest in fourth-year
pro Jason Doig, a 6-foot-3, 220-pound defenseman, who has agreed to
remain in the minors on a ``conditioning assignment.'' Montreal
recently had as many as five scouts in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, which hosts Dallas tonight at 7, can afford to move
Doig, in part because Smith has stockpiled blueliners in the past
two years. The Coyotes, in fact, will be overstocked when Jyrki
Lumme, J.J. Daigneault and Gerald Diduck return from injuries.
Lumme and Daigneault could be back this week. Diduck should be
ready for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Throw them back into the mix with Teppo Numminen, Keith Carney
and Oleg Tverdovsky and the Coyotes will have some interesting
decisions to make regarding the likes of Deron Quint, newly
acquired Jamie Huscroft and minor-league call-up Brad Tiley, all of
whom have been playing well.
</P>
<P>
   Quint's name has been mentioned in trade rumors a few times this
season, but Coach Jim Schoenfeld said he was the team's best
defensemen in Sunday's 4-1 victory over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way I've been playing,'' Quint said. ``I
think I've proved a lot of things to a lot of people, and a lot of
people doubted whether I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is doubting whether Briere can play. He averaged 57 goals
and 139 points in three seasons at juniors before turning pro last
season, then was named the AHL's rookie of the year after scoring
32 goals and 96 points at Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   But with Jeremy Roenick and now Reichel entrenched as the
Coyotes' top two centers, what's to become of Briere? He clearly
isn't a third- or fourth-line player, yet Smith said he envisions
Briere playing all season in Phoenix next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Bobby didn't say that to me,'' Briere said. ``I just
know I have to work hard to earn my place again next year. I
learned a lot being around here all year, and I understand what's
going on. I'm not bitter or disappointed, but I definitely want to
get my confidence back and play a lot.''
