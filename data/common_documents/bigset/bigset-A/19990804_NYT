PRIME-TIME GOLF GETS ITS FAIR SHARE

   LOS ANGELES _ Tiger Woods liked it and so did David Duval. So
too did a reasonably large television audience, which tuned in to
Monday night's inaugural television coverage of live prime-time
golf _ the match-play ``Showdown at Sherwood'' between No.1-ranked
Woods and No.2 Duval.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-beamed exhibition, shown from 8-11 p.m. on the East
Coast, posted a 12 share and a 6.9 national rating _ higher than
the final rounds in this year's British Open (4.8) and U.S. Open
(6.8).
</P>
<P>
   The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United
States tuned to a program, each point representing 994,000 homes.
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in
use at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.9 looked good to network executives wondering how this
first-time try would play out: ``I'd say we'd be happy with a five
(rating),'' Mark Mandel, ABC Sports director of public relations
said late Monday night at Sherwood, after Woods closed out a 2 and
1 win under the lights with a conceded par on the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mandel's opinion of the ratings was similar to
prevailing pre-match speculation: One time couldn't prove anything,
but it was intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare this to anything, since it hasn't been done
before,'' Mandel told the Associated Press. ``What it means for the
future, we still don't know. We're very happy with our telecast.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the future for Monday Night Golf?
</P>
<P>
   The vote here is for more. Not a lot more, but an annual
head-to-head meeting of 1 vs. 2 has some appeal, especially in a
prime-time format.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods demonstrated that match play between two of the
world's top players can be intriguing _ not to mention informative
for viewers used to the traditional medal-play format used in PGA
Tour competition.
</P>
<P>
   The rap the event got was that it was an artificial showdown,
determining nothing in another made-for-television, get-rich
opportunity similar to many events played during golf's post-tour
``silly season'' from November through January.
</P>
<P>
   So what? Who cares if it's made for TV? Does that make the
competition less real? Not likely, considering the winner earned
$1.1 million of a $1.5 million pot. It wasn't that long ago that $1
million !ital!seasons!off! were the stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   The match didn't seem too silly to the 2,000 or so fans who
shelled out from $200 to $500 a ticket to watch Woods and Duval
shoot it out at Sherwood. The crowd was seriously into it, and the
unexpected level of the fans' enthusiasm fired up both golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty exciting atmosphere,'' Woods said Monday. ``I
didn't think the crowd would be as boisterous as it was. There were
no gray areas. There were only two players and (the fans) were
either for one guy or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods wished he had played better around the greens. Duval would
have liked to have played better, period, after hitting five
bunkers, two hazards and having to take a momentum-halting
unplayable lie on the next-to-last hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can play better against him than I did,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   A rematch? Or some other 1 vs. 2 showdown in the prime-time
future?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically up to the ratings,'' Woods said Monday night.
``How high the ratings are will determine how successful it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, for one, didn't need to wait for the overnights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. &QL;

BLUE JAYS DEFEAT YANKEES, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The images that dominated Yankee Stadium 17 days ago
were of David Cone chasing perfection with an assortment of nasty
pitches, finally achieving that perfect game and then kneeling in
front of the mound before tumbling into Joe Girardi's arms. The
images were priceless because Cone was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The images were much different on Tuesday night. They were of
Cone mumbling or cursing to himself, waving his arms after one
frustrating pitch and chasing respectability on a night when his
repertory was not so perfect.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone trudged forward, continuing to float sliders on the
corners and pump fastballs in and out of the strike zone. He never
gives in. Even in those games when Cone does not have his crispest
pitches, he keeps experimenting and often winds up snatching
control. That almost happened again, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Cone finally slipped off the figurative fence that he was
straddling when the Blue Jays nicked him for a run in the seventh
inning to swipe a &QC; 3-1 victory over the Yankees. After Tony Batista
reached across the plate to smack a single and break a 1-1 tie,
Cone tilted his cap back and stared into the dark sky. They were
more revealing images of Cone, but not enough perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd made a good pitch,'' said Cone, his face still
red an hour after he had left the game. ``It was a splitter down
and away and he poked it the other way. That was my night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cone's raw statistics were solid _ he allowed two
earned runs and struck out seven in six and two-thirds innings _ he
is 0-2 with a 3.86 earned run average in three starts since
retiring 27 straight batters against the Expos on July18.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Girardi's first homer in 13 months, the ordinary Joey
Hamilton (6.66 era) and three relievers silenced the Yankees in
steering the Jays to their first triumph in eight outings with
them. The second-place Jays needed to show the Yankees they are no
mirage, and they now trail New York by five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a chance to even the score off John Frascatore
in the eighth inning after Scott Brosius doubled and raced to third
on Girardi's sacrifice bunt. But Chuck Knoblauch popped out to
shallow center and Brosius faked down the line before retreating
because Derek Jeter was up. Jeter, who won Monday's game with a
two-run homer off David Wells in the eighth, struck out and is now
1 for his last 22 to lower his average from .372 to .355.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he's in a slump,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``He was
hitting .380. You can't have it all year.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the seventh inning, Homer Bush blooped a ball
into right field. and churned hard toward first as he always does.
Bush never hesitated as he rounded the base and turned the 200-foot
hit into a double once Paul O'Neill failed to scoop the ball up
cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Cone got Shannon Stewart to ground out to third, but Batista,
who had struck out in his first three at-bats, singled between
first and second. Bush had a terrific jump, so O'Neill had no
chance to throw him out and Cone had no chance to save himself,
leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Batista also singled in the third run off Jason Grimsley in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone endured an exasperating second inning in which he unleashed
26 pitches and was fortunate that the Jays scored only once. David
Segui opened the inning by ripping a 1-2 slider that spun below his
knees over the right field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The homer aggravated Cone. He glanced toward right, pursed his
lips and admonished himself. Cone's theatrics continued after he
plunked Tony Fernandez on a 2-2 pitch and proceeded to throw his
arms in the air, shake his head and pick at the grass. When Girardi
tossed a new baseball to Cone, the pitcher snapped at it with his
glove and the ball dropped in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little shaky at that point,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone needed 88 pitches to navigate the first five innings. It
took him only 88 to pitch a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other than Segui's homer, Cone kept the Jays scoreless
until the seventh. But Cone's resiliency disappeared with Batista's
single, and the Yankees disappeared soon after that, losing for the
fifth time in seven games.

MIXING ANTI-OXIDANT SUPPLEMENTS WITH CHEMO IS RISKY, SAY TWO
RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vitamins, minerals and herbs touted as natural
cancer-fighting ``anti-oxidants'' may actually hurt cancer patients
by undermining many chemotherapy drugs, two Seattle researchers
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen patients die who shouldn't have died because it
appeared the drug did not do as well as expected,'' said Dr. Dan
Labriola, a Seattle naturopathic physician who specializes in
cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of the journal Oncology, Labriola and Dr.
Robert Livingston, chief of oncology at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said many cancer patients are taking
anti-oxidant supplements that could diminish the power of their
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those patients don't tell their doctors they are
using non-conventional therapies, exacerbating the risk to their
health.
</P>
<P>
   The most common anti-oxidants include vitamins A
(beta-carotene), B-6, C and E; minerals such as zinc and selenium;
and most herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of anti-oxidant supplements stems from evidence
that cancer can be caused by a chemical imbalance in the cell
during a process known as oxidation.
</P>
<P>
   During that process, an oxygen or other molecule releases an
electron and creates a highly reactive ``free radical.'' Free
radicals cause chemical destruction within cells that can lead to
cancer, scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-oxidants work by capturing free radicals before they become
destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But many chemotherapy drugs work against cancer by capitalizing
on free radicals and turning their destructive force against
tumors. Labriola and Livingston said anti-oxidants thwart this
therapeutic effect.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer patient who takes anti-oxidant supplements may feel
better during chemotherapy, but Labriola and Livingston said this
is probably because the supplement is reducing the power of the
chemotherapy drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this is that the patients who (take
anti-oxidants) will do better, and feel better, in the short
term,'' Labriola said. ``But in the long term, they leave
themselves more vulnerable to recurrence of the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no human studies have been done to directly evaluate the
effect of anti-oxidants on chemotherapy drugs, the Seattle
researchers note that the biochemistry of many anti-oxidants and of
most chemotherapy agents is well enough understood to predict when
one might interact dangerously with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Labriola and Livingston said the increasing use of vitamins,
minerals and herbal therapies by cancer patients prompted them to
compile evidence from other studies and reports that indicated the
use of anti-oxidants could undermine chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both aware that there were potentially harmful
interactions,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW cancer clinic has worked for many years with Labriola's
clinic because of patient interest in non-conventional therapies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kara Kelly, a pediatric oncologist at Columbia University in
New York, noted in an editorial accompanying Labriola and
Livingston's study that experts recommend diets high in the natural
anti-oxidants found in many fruits and vegetables, ``but not
anti-oxidant supplementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said there is not enough information to support the value
of anti-oxidant supplements for preventing cancer and, as Labriola
and Livingston have now shown, there may be harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have argued that anti-oxidants don't affect
chemotherapy, but that's just a crock,'' said Labriola, primary
author of the Oncology report and director of the Northwest Natural
Health Specialty Care Clinic in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While the level of anti-oxidants found in food may be safe for
chemotherapy patients, he said there is good evidence to suggest
artificially boosting anti-oxidant levels while on chemotherapy is
ill advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using a natural substance that at any other time, or
if used carefully and in the right combination, might have a
positive benefit,'' Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, chemotherapy patients should steer clear of
using supplementary anti-oxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Labriola has worked with cancer specialists at the UW and
Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for many years,
coordinating the care of patients who seek alternative therapies in
addition to standard cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   While Labriola and Livingston both urge that chemotherapy
patients avoid anti-oxidants, they also described methods for
identifying safe combinations in the Oncology article.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they wrote, if the chemotherapy drug does not
depend upon ``free radical'' chemistry, it may be safe for the
patient to use anti-oxidant supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Timing such supplementation so that it does not conflict with
the course of chemotherapy is also sometimes possible, the doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat patients in our clinic every day using these same
substances but in a way so they won't interfere with each other,''
Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most cancer specialists in Washington state know which
chemotherapy agents cannot be used in combination with
anti-oxidants because alternative medicine is popular in the
Northwest and oncologists here frequently work with naturopaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known about this risk at our clinic for at least 15
years,'' Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of the country, he said, many cancer patients
and physicians are not as knowledgeable about the risk of mixing
alternative therapy with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer patients determined to take the risk of using
non-conventional therapies, Labriola and Livingston suggest their
oncologist work with someone knowledgeable in the pharmacology of
the alternative therapies to identify potentially harmful
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know how big a problem this is,'' Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   And given the evidence of risk from combining anti-oxidant
supplements with chemotherapy, he said it's unlikely to ever be
studied in a clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of their report in Oncology, Labriola and Livingston
said, is primarily to alert cancer specialists to the potential
risk and, perhaps, to prompt further research into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Common anti-oxidant dietary supplements:
</P>
<P>
   _Vitamins A (including beta-carotene), B-6, C, E.
</P>
<P>
   _Minerals such as zinc and selenium.
</P>
<P>
   _Bioflavonoids; superoxide dismutase glutathione.
</P>
<P>
   _Most herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Harmful chemotherapy interaction likely if drug...
</P>
<P>
   _depends upon reactive oxygen chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   _still has unknown pharmacology.

NETHERCUTT MAY FACE CHALLENGE, FROM MAN WHO SUPPORTED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A conservative Spokane radio talk show host whose relentless
attacks on Tom Foley helped propel George Nethercutt into Congress
now plans to run against Nethercutt because of his flip-flop on
term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally hurt,'' Richard Clear recently told listeners.
``I feel George Nethercutt let me down as one of his biggest
supporters. And I had a personal relationship with George. I
traveled to Washington (D.C.) to do my show there for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear is upset at Nethercutt's announcement that he will run for
a fourth term in 2000, after pledging in his 1994 race against
Foley, a Democrat, that he would serve only three terms and come
home to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   If Clear challenges Nethercutt in the Republican primary, it
would set up a nationally watched voter test on term limits, a
cause which Washington state helped give birth to in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Clear said he will make a final decision on the race within a
week or two. If he runs against Nethercutt in next year's
Republican primary, Clear would have to give up his talk show on
KGA radio in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Clear was sounding like a candidate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign would be based on what George originally ran on,
to be a citizen legislator who would go back, do a job and then
return home to his profession,'' Clear said.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt relentlessly used the term limits issue in defeating
Foley, who had served in Congress for 30 years. Foley was the first
House speaker since 1860 to lose his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Foley had agreed to be a plaintiff in a federal court suit
against the term limits provisions for members of Congress
contained in an initiative narrowly passed by Washington voters in
1992. The Supreme Court later threw out limits on service in
Congress in this and several other states.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to his third term last November, Nethercutt does not
want to leave the nation's capital. He is taking heat on the home
front for the decision to break his 1994 pledge.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C.-based group called U.S. Term Limits has run
TV and radio ads criticizing the congressman. Local term limits
supporters have run ads on buses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday for his reaction to Clear's challenge, Nethercutt
replied: ``No reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My critics certainly will seize upon this, but most people are
understanding of my decision and are supportive of it,'' Nethercutt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been angrier at Nethercutt's change of mind than
Clear, 51, who has been a fixture on KXLY and KGA radio in Spokane
for most of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clear made headlines during an on-air interview by
asking Foley if he was a homosexual. An angry Foley replied that he
had been married for 23 years. Clear celebrated Nethercutt's
victory by interviewing the congressman-elect on the morning after
he beat Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Clear now believes Nethercutt has put down roots and gone native
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I hear is that even if George loses this race, he
will stay back there. And these were the knocks against Tom Foley
in '94, that he had become a Washington, D.C., beltway insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about charges he has gone native in Washington, D.C.,
Nethercutt responded Tuesday: ``Most people understand that what is
paramount in my mind, at all times, is doing right for the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a GOP primary battle has brightened Democratic
prospects of regaining the Spokane-based 5th Congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around comes around. George was able to dish it out,
and now we'll see if he is able to take it,'' said Paul Berendt,
Democratic state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   House minority leader Dick Gephardt has already talked to state
Rep. Jeff Gombosky, D-Spokane, about running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've received quite a bit of encouragement, and I'm looking at
this seriously,'' Gombosky said Tuesday. ``The general sense I get
is that, on this side of the state, the economy is not in the place
that it should be. We need direction.
</P>
<P>
   Former Spokane Mayor Jack Geraghty is giving a preliminary look
to running as a Democrat for Nethercutt's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is a very nice man, so that isn't any kind of an
issue,'' said Geraghty. ``But people here were used to Foley being
a player in major issues of the day, even before he was House
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foley was deeply involved in agricultural legislation and in
getting Boeing to build a plant over here. I don't think people see
that level of involvement with Nethercutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is likely to be a formidable foe in both primary and
general elections. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee,
which controls Congress' purse strings. He has twice raised more
than $1 million for his races to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest filing with the Federal Election Commission,
Nethercutt reported that he had $138,735 on hand as of June 30,
while already spending $83,684.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits has done three polls, each of 300 voters, which
coincided with its media campaign criticizing Nethercutt. The
surveys, by Diversified Research, showed Nethercutt's approval
rating at 41 percent in late June, down from 54 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that we will continue a sizable voter
education effort in this district through next year,'' said Jason
Miller, executive director of U.S. Term Limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Nethercutt says voters he talks with on trips home to
Eastern Washington ``understand the reasons why I had a change of
heart.''

RANGERS WIN, PASS YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Ballpark in Arlington produced last
night's man-bites-dog headline for the local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers passed their nemesis _ the defending World Series
champion New York Yankees _ in the American League standings with
their 9-5 victory against the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the potential ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Tom Hicks established home-field advantage for the
Division Series as a reasonable goal for the Rangers to strive
toward in the season's remaining two months.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would fulfill Hicks' expectation if postseason play
began today. The Rangers would begin their best-of-five series with
the Yankees at The Ballpark, and the Central Division-leading
Cleveland Indians would draw the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six games, though, remain to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just means that we're playing well, but it doesn't
guarantee you anything,'' said manager Johnny Oates, whose Rangers
moved 22 games above .500 and are 16-3 since the All-Star break.
``It's what we do from now until the end that will guarantee us
something. Now, I'd rather be where we are than some of the teams
in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved one-half game in front of the Yankees and are
a game behind the Indians after force-feeding the Twins a steady
diet of first-and-third situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers chased Twins starter Benj Sampson (3-2) before the
24-year-old could record his fourth out, and they did so without an
extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   After Roberto Kelly reached on an error, the Rangers' Nos. 2-6
hitters _ Ivan Rodriguez, Rusty Greer, Juan Gonzalez, Rafael
Palmeiro and Todd Zeile _ hit first-inning singles to build a 4-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases in the second before Sampson
departed. Reliever Dan Perkins promptly surrendered a two-run
single to Gonzalez that gave the Rangers a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, though, kept the Twins in striking distance by allowing
only one run, on Ruben Mateo's third-inning homer, in 3 2/3
innings. Meanwhile, Rangers right-hander Mike Morgan struggled to
preserve the lead. Morgan pitched the necessary five innings to
improve to 12-6, but the 39-year-old surrendered five runs on 10
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight wasn't very pretty,'' Oates said. ``Six runs early
helped. It was a battle for Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen, though, never allowed the Twins to pull closer.
Left-handers Mike Munoz and Mike Venafro and right-handers Danny
Patterson and Tim Crabtree combined for four scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers the opportunity to discuss the greater
meaning of last night's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the goal is to win as many games as possible,''
said left fielder Rusty Greer, who went 2-for-4 with two runs
batted in. ``It would be nice to get home field, but the main
objective is to be in the playoffs. Everybody likes home-field
advantage, but you can't go farther if you don't get in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't appear to be a problem for the Rangers, who entered
last night's game with an eight-game advantage on the second-place
Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to keep playing well and not worry about the
Yankees or other teams,'' said Palmeiro, who went 1-for-3 and drove
in the Rangers' third run. ``We need to take care of ourselves.
When it gets close to the end, then we'll see how we stack up
against them.''

SUICIDE RACE AT OMAK STAMPEDE IS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Organizers of the Omak Stampede have canceled this year's
Suicide Race, citing a boycott by the Native American riders who
typically dominate the race, rumored disturbances by tribal
protesters and a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Suicide Race, where horses barrel down a steep
embankment and swim across the Okanogan River, has faced
controversies and protests over the past several years from animal
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversies, though, the race had always gone
forward, drawing thousands of viewers who admired the skill of the
riders.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be only the second without a Suicide Race since
the event began in 1935, said Stampede Vice President Jack Miller.
The other was a World War II-era race where only one participant
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation ``has been one of the hardest things in my
life,'' said Miller, who's been involved with the Stampede for 21
years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Stampede events, including a rodeo and a carnival, will
proceed as scheduled Aug. 12-15. The Stampede, the largest annual
event in Okanogan County in north-central Washington state,
typically draws more than 30,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Animal Welfare Society, which has campaigned
against the race for 16 years, welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   But the group urged people to attend the remaining Stampede
events to show organizers the race isn't necessary for the
Stampede's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the Suicide Race first surfaced last month, when
members of the Colville Confederated Tribes announced a boycott of
the race, citing concerns over restricted parking at a Native
American encampment and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede organizers canceled the encampment at the tribes'
request. But organizers turned down a request to cancel the Suicide
Race, saying it would be too disappointing to ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The board reversed its decision during an emergency board
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Stampede board dated Monday, the tribal
council said it would be ``unjust and insulting'' for the race to
go forward without the tribal members who make up the majority of
the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the race has been open to all, it was initiated by
the Colville Tribes and carried on as part of our cultural
heritage,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede President Fred Winningham said there had been ``a 90
percent chance'' that dangerously high water levels in the river
alone would have forced the race's cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   But board members decided to cancel the race because of other
potential confrontations and ugliness that are ``not what Omak
Stampede is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members heard reports of a planned boycott of area
businesses by tribal members, of a verbal confrontation between
tribal riders and non-tribal racers who had driven from Bellingham
to attempt a swimming test for the race last week, intimidating
phone calls and a report from police of a rumored rally involving
hundreds of tribal members who would try to disrupt any attempt at
a race, Stampede officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Cawston, chairwoman for the tribes, said tribal members
were pleased the race was canceled but dismissed the other reports
as ``more rumor than fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Cawston said a boycott against the businesses was discussed but
ruled against. ``You don't boycott your friends,'' she said.

HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS REACH AGREEMENT ON TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout; this story leads The New York Times
front page in later editions)  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders completed work Tuesday night on
a revised tax-cut proposal, adopting a new approach to cutting
income taxes as they prepared for a showdown with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After a marathon negotiating session in private, leaders from
the House and Senate said they had settled on a common plan that
draws from the tax bills passed in both chambers over the last two
weeks but that adds some new twists.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is a reduction of one percentage point in all
income tax rates. Under the plan, the current 15 percent income tax
bracket, which is the lowest, would be reduced gradually to 14
percent starting in 2001. The current 28 percent bracket would
gradually be reduced to 27 percent, and the top rate of 39.6
percent would decline to 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan also includes a reduction in the top rate on
capital gains to 18 percent from 20 percent. It would provide a tax
break for many married couples, and would phase out the inheritance
tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the plan would cut taxes by $792 billion over the next
decade. Republicans said they were intent on pushing the measure
through both chambers by the end of the week, giving the party a
chance to send a clear message about its priorities as the nation
debates how best to take advantage of projected federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy day for the American taxpayer,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Archer announced the deal along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, after nearly 36
hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto the bill, because he says the
Republican plan would risk a return of federal budget deficits,
disproportionately favor the wealthy and leave too little money for
Medicare, the military, education and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress, who were excluded from the negotiations,
said the tax plan was nothing more than a plank in the Republican
campaign platform for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, said Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the
senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, were primarily
interested in ``writing their talking points for why the president
is a Scrooge for vetoing this Christmas-in-July package of tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The package is likely to win strong support from conservative
Republicans in both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the provisions, particularly the
one-percentage-point reduction in all income tax rates, alienated
some moderate Republicans in the Senate, raising questions about
whether the party would have enough votes to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't looking very good from our perspective, and our
understanding is that other moderates are having similar
problems,'' said Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for Sen. John H.
Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who has said he
favors a smaller tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to several of the four Democrats who had voted for the
Republican bill in the Senate said they would also have trouble
with any new plan that reduced all income tax rates because such an
approach would give a bigger tax cut to those in upper income
brackets than to those in lower brackets.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with objections from moderate Republicans in the House
who said the plan risked the nation's fiscal health, the new plan
makes the full reduction in the income tax rates contingent on
there being no increase in interest payments on the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   As under the Senate plan, the tax cuts would phase out after 10
years, a limitation imposed by a procedural rule that Republicans
could not sidestep.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that they can pass the final bill this week, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, plan to sit on the legislation until after
Congress returns from its summer vacation in September and then
send it Clinton for the promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican leaders are under some pressure from their
own members to adopt a less confrontational strategy and to seek
negotiations with the White House before forcing a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that forcing the issue now would probably ``lead to a
hardening of positions that could imperil any possible negotiated
agreement later in the fall,'' Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine, urged Lott on Tuesday in a letter to seek a
cooling-off period over the next month followed by talks with the
White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans released only the broad outlines of their deal on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Archer said the proposed reduction in the top capital
gains tax rate to 18 percent would apply to all transactions
starting with Jan. 1 of this year. They said the plan would also
eventually allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation,
meaning that increases in the price of a stock or another asset
would be subject to capital gains only to the degree that they
exceeded the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the income tax reduction would account for about
$320 billion of the total $792 billion in tax cuts. That is less
than under the original House plan, which called for a reduction of
10 percent in all income tax rates, but more than the original
Senate plan, which called for a one-percentage-point reduction only
in the current 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the new plan would allocate about $100 billion over
10 years to addressing the so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in
the tax code that leaves many two-income couples paying more in
taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the standard deduction for married couples
filing jointly would increase to twice the standard deduction for
single filers, and the amount of income subject to the 15 percent
income tax rate for couples would increase to twice the amount for
single people.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also included one of Roth's main priorities, an
increase in the maximum allowable contribution to Individual
Retirement Accounts to $5,000 from $2,000.

RULING MAY AFFECT 200 OTHER PROPOSED TIMBER SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge's ruling barring nine federal timber sales on
environmental grounds could stop more than 200 other sales and halt
logging on more than 10,000 acres in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   If those predictions come true, as much as one-fifth of the
timber cut in Oregon and Washington state would be eliminated, a
timber industry official estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In blocking the nine sales Monday, U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer castigated the federal government for rushing a series of
timber sales to evade a requirement to conduct detailed forest
surveys for protected plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of that ruling will come in the weeks ahead as
government lawyers scrutinize the 200 other proposed timber sales.
They want to know whether agency scientists looked hard enough for
protected plants and animals before taking bids on the timber.
</P>
<P>
   Chris West of the Northwest Forestry Association, an industry
group, estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 acres of federal timberland
could potentially be affected _ enough lumber to build more than
90,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on
legislation by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would effectively
undercut the judge's ruling. Gorton's proposal would make it easier
for the government to decide not to look for protected plants and
animals before allowing a timber harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to see land management policies crafted by the
scientists at the departments of Agriculture and Interior as
opposed to a federal judge,'' said Cynthia Bergman, a spokeswoman
for Gorton. ``It basically gives them flexibility and authority.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration analysis of Gorton's proposal calls it
``broad, unnecessary and ambiguous,'' says it would reduce public
accountability and predicts increased costs and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton attached the legislation to an appropriations bill
earlier this summer, but Sens. Chuck Robb, D-Va., and Max Cleland,
D-Ga., are sponsoring an amendment to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's Monday ruling, praised by environmentalists as a
``blockbuster,'' said the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management broke the law in awarding the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that by failing to conduct diligent
investigations about where protected plants and animals live, the
agencies risked driving some to extinction. He characterized the
government's conduct as ``far from being minor or technical
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The case traces back to the spotted owl controversy of the early
and mid-1990s. The Clinton administration's Northwest Forest Plan
of 1994 was hammered out to end environmentalists' lawsuits over
cutting stands of old-growth timber where the endangered owls live.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Forest Plan was broadened to protect much more
than the spotted owl. Of the 1,080 plant and animal types in
forests west of the Cascades, 404 were to receive some form of
protection. For 77 species called ``markedly at risk,'' the plan
promised government scientists would survey stands of old-growth
trees likely to hold the protected species before any harvest after
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year delay in the restrictions was to allow scientists
to figure out where protected animals and plants were likely to
live, and how to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, just before the wildlife survey rules kicked
in, the Forest Service approved a series of timber sales without
doing surveys.
</P>
<P>
   No dice, Judge Dwyer said. The surveys, he said, have to be done
if the cutting occurs after September 1998, regardless of the date
the sale was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions by the federal defendants are arbitrary and
contrary to the plain language of the (Northwest Forest Plan),''
Dwyer ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by a coalition of environmental groups in
Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other timber sales that already had been
sold that are just as illegal as these were,'' said Doug Heiken of
the Oregon Natural Resources Council, the lead plaintiff. ``They're
trying to seriously undermine the Northwest Forest Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But West, of the Northwest Forestry Association, attacked
Dwyer's ruling as having ``no basis in what's on the ground and in
the science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He found (federal agencies) in violation of a procedural
interpretation of when the surveys needed to be done based on his
interpretation rather than their interpretation,'' West said. ``We
think it's totally unfortunate that a federal district judge would
be interpreting an agency plan developed by forestry
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   West said about 6 billion to 7 billion board-feet of lumber are
expected to be cut in Washington and Oregon this year. He said his
group estimates that perhaps 1.4 billion board-feet could be
affected by Dwyer's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   West said the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management can't
be expected to survey all the land in question, particularly since
the species are obscure and are protected by the Northwest Forest
Plan, not the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about snails and slugs and lichens and
salamanders,'' West said. ``The way they have to survey for most of
them is on their hands and knees, and the costs for this are just
prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Forest Service and the BLM said agency
lawyers and foresters are poring over Dwyer's ruling and their
records to see how much forest is likely to be affected. The
agencies spent $2 million last year setting up survey techniques
and training foresters to use them, plus $6 million on surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The government admits it has not started surveys for 32 of the
protected species deemed ``markedly at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of species and some require extensive surveys,
so yes, it does take time and money,'' said Rex Holloway, a Forest
Service spokesman.

LAKERS RE-SIGN FISHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It took a little haggling, but the Lakers got the
coveted free-agent point guard they wanted Tuesday. And Derek
Fisher doesn't even need to get fitted for a jersey or relocate
from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway, the Magic malcontent with All-Star credentials,
might have drawn the Lakers' intrigue, but in three years here,
Fisher has rightly earned management's respect and its confidence.
And now, a few extra dollars as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime today, Fisher will sign a multiyear contract, which
sources said would be for seven years and just under $25 million.
All seven years are guaranteed, and Fisher has an opt-out clause
after the fifth year. He'll earn about $3 million in the upcoming
season.
</P>
<P>
   The contract will be Fisher's first free-agent deal, following
the rookie contract the Lakers gave him as a first-round pick in
1996. He has since grown from a little-known, hard-working
understudy to Nick Van Exel to the Lakers' full-time starter.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he has been the heart and conscience of the locker
room, the most upstanding of citizens and, by the way, a tough
defender and improving offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   He also is an unselfish player, a sure commodity in new coach
Phil Jackson's teamwork-reliant system.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers believe his still-untapped potential merits a
long-term investment. He averaged 5.9 points and 3.9 assists this
season as a part-time starter, then upped his averages to 9.8
points and 4.9 assists as the full-time starter in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy that, even though we don't know how good he's
going to be, we've been around him long enough to know what he
brings,'' general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``Work ethic, his
leadership ability, his professionalism, his approach to the game _
I could just continue to list the facets of Derek Fisher that we
know. He's a classy person.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, he's gotten better every year he's been with
us. And knowing what the market is for a player like him, that it
takes a substantial commitment, for us it all adds up. Why wouldn't
we do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Why not, indeed. Though Hardaway is clearly the class of this
free-agent market among guards, Fisher generated his own buzz among
GMs impressed with his drive and hustle. Miami, San Antonio,
Indiana and Toronto were among the teams that pursued him, and it
is believed the Raptors made a substantial offer that exceeded, on
a per-year basis, that of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how good he's going to be yet,'' Kupchak said.
``Admittedly, he doesn't know either. There's a cost to finding the
answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher wasn't after a big payday, just a show of faith from
his present employer. And he was ready to return as soon as he saw
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salary I made my first three years (a combined $2.1
million) is more than I could have ever dreamed about,'' Fisher
said in a phone interview from Little Rock. ``It's not always about
the money, it's about feeling respect for what you do and what
you're about.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fisher, who turns 25 on Monday, that respect came with a
seven-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for me to know that, when I step out on
that floor 82 games a season and am pouring my heart out and diving
on the floor for loose balls and playing with an injured ankle or a
separated shoulder . . . if I'm making that type of commitment, I
have to know the team is willing to make that commitment in
return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Fisher made those comments shortly after a
morning workout and just before an afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, in a bit of overexuberance, he and his agent
committed a small NBA faux pas, announcing his new deal to his
hometown before the Lakers had a chance to make it official. The
unsigned contract was sent by overnight mail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time for myself and my family,'' Fisher enthused.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I'm not really satisfied with where I am right now as a
player. I know there's vast room for improvement, and I'm willing
to put in the time and work that it takes to become a better
player.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fisher on board, the Lakers return four-fifths of last
season's starting lineup, including Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal
and Glen Rice. While the Lakers continue an all-out courtship of
forward Charles Oakley, they don't figure to make any other big
splashes in the free-agent market or through trades.
</P>
<P>
   Once sixth man Rick Fox is signed, probably within a day or so,
the Lakers will have 11 players under contract, not counting their
two rookie draftees.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: O'Neal and Bryant joined Lakers execs in an all-day
wooing of Oakley on Tuesday. Oakley will weigh the Lakers' offer of
$2 million per year against several similar offers, including one
from his old team the Knicks, and the Raptors' $5.5
million-per-year offer. He'll contemplate it all while vacationing
in the Bahamas this weekend and could make a decision by the middle
of next week.

<P>
   At 7:05 Tuesday night, Pedro Martinez threw his first pitch that
counted in 16 days. Plate umpire Bill Welke called it a strike.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:06, Martinez had his first whiff, Cleveland shortstop Omar
Vizquel going down on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   From the bodegas in Jamaica Plain to the beach houses on Goose
Neck Beach _ not to mention in the booth occupied by Dan Duquette
high above Yawkey Way _ the reaction was essentially the same, even
if the language in which it was expressed varied.
</P>
<P>
   Gracias a Dios.
</P>
<P>
   But while this started out as thanksgiving day for Red Sox
Nation, heralding the return of the ace, it didn't end that way.
When Jimy Williams was forced to turn to the bullpen for salvation,
he came away empty in a 5-4 loss to the Indians, who rallied to
beat the Sox in the ninth inning for the second time in two nights,
this time on Vizquel's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Four outs away from evening the series at a game apiece, Sox
closer Tim Wakefield instead was staring at his second blown save
of the summer after issuing a two-out walk to Manny Ramirez and
giving up a screen shot to Jim Thome. The home run was Thome's 20th
of the season, second of the night, and third in the series, and
tied the score at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the ninth, Wakefield was pinned with the loss as he
walked David Justice and Einar Diaz and gave up Vizquel's line
single to left. The Red Sox are now 1 1/2 games behind Toronto in
the wild-card race, and the charging A's were just two games back
of Boston going into their game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``August is always a time when you hope your team is playing
well, because if not, it's the dog days, a situation where you have
to dig a little deeper and try to turn it around,'' said third
baseman John Valentin, whose bloop single off Indians starter Jaret
Wright in the third was not only the 1,000th hit of his career but
also began a two-out, three-run rally. The inning also featured an
RBI single by Nomar Garciaparra and a gift two-run double for Troy
O'Leary when left fielder Richie Sexson lost his fly ball in the
twilight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians are a good team,'' Valentin said. ``We knew coming
in it wasn't going to be easy. I think we've had pretty good
success against Thome in the past, but tonight he hit two shots.''
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez limited to five innings and 78 pitches because of
his time spent on the disabled list with a tender shoulder,
Williams looked to his bullpen to take the Sox home before a crowd
of 33,650. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd come back out one more time,'' said Martinez,
who was surprised that he'd already reached his limit during a
seven-strikeout, three-hit outing in which he was hurt only by
Thome's home run on a 3-and-0 pitch in the second. ``I was a little
bit shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Bryce Florie, making his Sox debut, impressed by
bailing out Rich Garces in the sixth with a double-play ball and a
strikeout, but took the shine off that moment by walking the bases
loaded in the seventh before Rheal Cormier came to the rescue,
retiring Vizquel on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who gave up two runs in the eighth inning Sunday
against the Yankees but held on for a gritty save, got an early
summons again Tuesday night because of the unavailability of setup
man Derek Lowe, who has been up throwing six times in the last
three days, including his last game action Saturday against the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating I had to miss a game when I haven't even been
in a game the last couple of days,'' said Lowe, ``but I've thrown a
lot of pitches in the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield had saved seven games in a row since his last blown
save, June 27, so his frustration level had to be at least as high
as Lowe's. But unlike Mark Guthrie, Monday night's late-inning
loser, Wakefield elected to do his suffering in private. He made
just a cameo appearance in the clubhouse before retreating to the
safety of the trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see some red flags in the bullpen,'' said
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, pointing to the fact that only Bret
Saberhagen has been able to go more than five innings in the first
five games of this homestand, which ends Wednesday. ``We've got to
be careful. We're putting a lot on these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need just one seven-inning game from somebody, and we'll be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored all of their runs with two out _ Mike Stanley
drawing a bases-loaded walk off Paul Shuey to force home a run in
the seventh _ but failed to fully capitalize on 10 free passes
issued by Indians pitchers. That included the first inning, when
Wright walked the first three batters he faced but didn't give up a
run, as Jose Offerman was caught stealing before Valentin and Brian
Daubach walked.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the playoffs last October, the Indians have succeeded
in shutting down the bottom of the Sox order. The Nos. 5-9 hitters
in the Sox order _ everyone after cleanup man Garciaparra _ are a
combined 3 for 35. All three hits belong to O'Leary, including
Tuesday night's double into the twilight zone, but even O'Leary has
been a mixed bag. He has left nine runners on base the last two
nights, hitting into a two-on, no-out double play in the seventh
inning Monday and striking out with the bases loaded in the seventh
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times,'' Valentin said, ``when it seems you should
have scored more runs and you didn't. But pitching is the game, and
when you don't pitch well, you lose.''
</P>

HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS REACH AGREEMENT ON TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct coding) 
(Subs for rewriting throughout; this story leads The New York Times
front page in later editions)  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders completed work Tuesday night on
a revised tax-cut proposal, adopting a new approach to cutting
income taxes as they prepared for a showdown with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After a marathon negotiating session in private, leaders from
the House and Senate said they had settled on a common plan that
draws from the tax bills passed in both chambers over the last two
weeks but that adds some new twists.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart is a reduction of one percentage point in all
income tax rates. Under the plan, the current 15 percent income tax
bracket, which is the lowest, would be reduced gradually to 14
percent starting in 2001. The current 28 percent bracket would
gradually be reduced to 27 percent, and the top rate of 39.6
percent would decline to 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan also includes a reduction in the top rate on
capital gains to 18 percent from 20 percent. It would provide a tax
break for many married couples, and would phase out the inheritance
tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the plan would cut taxes by $792 billion over the next
decade. Republicans said they were intent on pushing the measure
through both chambers by the end of the week, giving the party a
chance to send a clear message about its priorities as the nation
debates how best to take advantage of projected federal budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy day for the American taxpayer,'' said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Archer announced the deal along with Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., who is chairman of the Finance Committee, after nearly 36
hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has promised to veto the bill, because he says the
Republican plan would risk a return of federal budget deficits,
disproportionately favor the wealthy and leave too little money for
Medicare, the military, education and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress, who were excluded from the negotiations,
said the tax plan was nothing more than a plank in the Republican
campaign platform for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, said Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the
senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, were primarily
interested in ``writing their talking points for why the president
is a Scrooge for vetoing this Christmas-in-July package of tax
cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The package is likely to win strong support from conservative
Republicans in both the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the provisions, particularly the
one-percentage-point reduction in all income tax rates, alienated
some moderate Republicans in the Senate, raising questions about
whether the party would have enough votes to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't looking very good from our perspective, and our
understanding is that other moderates are having similar
problems,'' said Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for Sen. John H.
Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who has said he
favors a smaller tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to several of the four Democrats who had voted for the
Republican bill in the Senate said they would also have trouble
with any new plan that reduced all income tax rates because such an
approach would give a bigger tax cut to those in upper income
brackets than to those in lower brackets.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with objections from moderate Republicans in the House
who said the plan risked the nation's fiscal health, the new plan
makes the full reduction in the income tax rates contingent on
there being no increase in interest payments on the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   As under the Senate plan, the tax cuts would phase out after 10
years, a limitation imposed by a procedural rule that Republicans
could not sidestep.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that they can pass the final bill this week, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, plan to sit on the legislation until after
Congress returns from its summer vacation in September and then
send it Clinton for the promised veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican leaders are under some pressure from their
own members to adopt a less confrontational strategy and to seek
negotiations with the White House before forcing a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that forcing the issue now would probably ``lead to a
hardening of positions that could imperil any possible negotiated
agreement later in the fall,'' Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine, urged Lott on Tuesday in a letter to seek a
cooling-off period over the next month followed by talks with the
White House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Republicans released only the broad outlines of their deal on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Archer said the proposed reduction in the top capital
gains tax rate to 18 percent would apply to all transactions
starting with Jan. 1 of this year. They said the plan would also
eventually allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation,
meaning that increases in the price of a stock or another asset
would be subject to capital gains only to the degree that they
exceeded the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the income tax reduction would account for about
$320 billion of the total $792 billion in tax cuts. That is less
than under the original House plan, which called for a reduction of
10 percent in all income tax rates, but more than the original
Senate plan, which called for a one-percentage-point reduction only
in the current 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the new plan would allocate about $100 billion over
10 years to addressing the so-called marriage penalty, the quirk in
the tax code that leaves many two-income couples paying more in
taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the standard deduction for married couples
filing jointly would increase to twice the standard deduction for
single filers, and the amount of income subject to the 15 percent
income tax rate for couples would increase to twice the amount for
single people.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also included one of Roth's main priorities, an
increase in the maximum allowable contribution to Individual
Retirement Accounts to $5,000 from $2,000.

WRIGHT AT FOCUS OF CLIPPERS' TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It only (begin ital)seems(end ital) seamless.
</P>
<P>
   But as the NBA's relatively new sign-and-trade business relates
to the Clippers, there's a Wright way and a right way.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers need a top-drawer shooting guard, someone who can
balance what figures to be a frontcourt-heavy offense while making
a representative effort on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Hawks now have two such players, Jimmy Jackson and
J.R. Rider, who were acquired from Portland on Monday in a trade
for Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks need reserve help at center and a power forward. The
Clippers sort of have one of those available in free-agent Lorenzen
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have discussed a sign-and-trade involving Wright and
Jackson. The Hawks have about $4.5 million to spend, thanks to last
season's loss of free agent Christian Laettner. That would seem to
be generous compensation for the 6-foot-11 Wright, who has averaged
double-digit points and single-digit rebounds in his three seasons
after the Clippers drafted him with the seventh pick in the 1997
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's another player involved.
</P>
<P>
   He's Robert Fayne, Wright's agent. All Fayne wants is for the
Hawks or any other team interested in his only client to pay Wright
$8 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   But the most Wright has been offered is the $5 million per
season the Clippers put on the table before the trading deadline
last March.
</P>
<P>
   Fayne has said his client will never play another minute for the
Clippers, who are fond of Wright and his capacity to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   Is their offer still on the table?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say the table may not even be there,'' said one NBA
source.
</P>
<P>
   What would Jackson bring to L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   A contract worth ``only'' $4 million spread over the next two
seasons. Acquiring Jackson, who averaged 25 points per game for
Dallas during the 1994-'95 season, also would remove the Clippers
from Penny Hardaway's shrinking leverage list and leave the Clips
with miles of cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Pooh cornered: After swinging and missing on every attempt to
trade him as requested, the Clippers have offered to ``buy out''
veteran point guard Pooh Richardson. Under this plan, Richardson,
who is scheduled to be paid $3.4 million this season, would be
removed from the Clippers roster and would receive full-contract
compensation over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who didn't figure in the team's plans last season
and appears doomed to that status again, has not accepted the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Strange days for `Brew': Ex-Clippers assistant coach Jim Brewer
has declined comment on why his contract was not renewed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the decision was (sit down for this) financial.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who was one of three finalists for the vacant
head-coaching job given to Chris Ford, had worked for the team for
five seasons. After four years with previous head coach Bill Fitch,
the team thought enough of Brewer to retain him as an assistant
under Ford. According to Brewer, he enjoyed working with Ford and
had expected to return.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Brewer interviewed with the Detroit Pistons for an
assistant coaching job made available when John Hammond, another
ex-Clips assistant, left the Pistons to work with Quin Snyder at
the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, Snyder is another former Clippers assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Exit ramp: Other than Wright, Clippers free agents with the most
interest from other teams were expendable small forwards Rodney
Rogers and Lamond Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers signed with Phoenix for a $2 million exception Monday.
Murray is being courted by the NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, who
lost Sean Elliott and are waiting to see how much of his $5.3
million salary the league allows them to spend. Darrick Martin is
another Clips free agent who hasn't been given an offer to stay. On
Sunday, Martin told the Sacramento Bee he's close to signing with
the Kings. And with each departure, the Clippers welcome more room
under their cap.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Forget about Bulldog; something along the line of ``Brinks'' might
best capture the essence of Mike Hampton's mound work.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides, it seems fitting in light of this week's visit by the
``take-the-money-and-run'' Dodgers, who watched Hampton sock away
an early lead for safekeeping in the Astros' 7-2 victory Tuesday
night at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored five runs in the third inning, giving Hampton
a four-run lead that needed no insurance. It was in the good hands
of the major leagues' third 15-game winner; Boston's Pedro Martinez
and St. Louis' Kent Bottenfield were the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's consistently had excellent stuff,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said of Hampton, who tied a career high for victories.
``It's been that way start after start.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't bode well for the Dodgers, especially after they dug
such a deep hole for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who hasn't lost a lead of any size since May 30 at
Pittsburgh, wasn't about to give up a four spot. He held the
Dodgers to a run on three hits in seven innings, lowering his ERA
to 2.97.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell pitched a scoreless eighth, and Doug Henry served up
a solo home run to Adrian Beltre before closing out the Dodgers in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who have been locked in last place in the National
League West for most of the past five weeks, lost for the 11th time
in their last 14 games. Meanwhile, the Astros have won 17 of their
last 22, and they maintained a 2{-game lead over Cincinnati in the
NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Although pitching has been the Astros' trademark during their
latest stretch of hot play, the offense has more than done its
part. Tuesday marked the seventh time the Astros reached double
figures in hits in the last 10 games, and they're hitting .331 as a
team during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, Bill Spiers and Lance Berkman each had two hits
Tuesday, and Spiers and Paul Bako drove in a pair of runs apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching has been carrying us for quite some time,'' Bako
said. ``I was happy to see us put together some two-out hits. We
had a lot of different guys contributing. Obviously, (Craig) Biggio
and (Jeff) Bagwell have been getting it done forever. It's almost
unfair what we expect from them every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is moving into that level of expectation on an
every-fifth-day basis. The only hits he allowed were a solo home
run by Devon White and a pair of harmless singles by Gary Sheffield
and Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old lefthander's only other 15-win season came in
1997, but he's clearly a more polished pitcher than he was then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't put a finger on it,'' Hampton said. ``I think
I've always had the pitches. It's just been a matter of being
consistent and the guys playing great behind me. The thing I've
learned is how to change speeds on my fastball, which makes it
become more than one pitch. That's probably the biggest
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As for moving one step closer to 20 wins, Hampton said: ``It's a
team thing. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for my teammates. It
(20 wins) would be a great milestone, but my goals are
team-oriented. I want to make the World Series and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   White's laser into Lefty's Pub gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in
the second inning, but it was short-lived as the Astros scored five
runs in the third _ all after two were out. Spiers, Bell and
Berkman each had RBI hits in the inning, and Bako contributed a
two-run single to the rally, which was aided by a pair of fielding
miscues.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the only error in the inning was charged to
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, who booted a grounder from Richard
Hidalgo. The official scorer initially gave Beltre a break when he
dropped Bagwell's soft liner, which would have been the third out
of the inning. The ruling was changed from a hit to an error after
the game, giving Beltre two errors on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them five, six, seven outs,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``You can't do that with them. They're a hell of a
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Gandhi would have had a difficult time persevering through all
the misfortune, let alone Dodgers starter Darren Dreifort, who
threw 66 pitches through the first three innings, including 34 in
the third, when his fielders abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark of a good club is that it's opportunistic,'' Dierker
said. ``They helped us out, but we got the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (8-11) also surrendered an RBI single to Spiers in the
sixth, and late-inning defensive replacement Glen Barker applied
the finishing touches with a run-scoring single in the eighth off
Matt Herges, who was making his major-league debut.

TWO GROUPS SET TO STUDY JUMP IN GANG-RELATED CRIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' state news file.) 
By DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoping to understand better what is behind an
upswing in gang-related crime in the San Fernando Valley, the Los
Angeles County supervisors called Tuesday for two law enforcement
groups to study the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Crime attributed to gangs was up 3.65 percent in the Valley in
the first six months of 1999 even while overall serious crime
dropped 10 percent, LAPD statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officials and community activists
have said a 1993 peace treaty among 1,000 Northeast Valley gang
members no longer appears to be working, partly because young gang
members weren't part of it and aren't respecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said law enforcement officials
believe the truce reduced the number of gang-related killings in
the Valley. The people who helped make it work need to be
encouraged to continue their efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had an impact,'' Yaroslavsky said at the
supervisors' meeting. ``We don't want to jump to a conclusion it's
all fallen apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The board approved a motion by Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich
and amended by Yaroslavsky that calls for two studies:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Countywide Criminal Justice Coordination Committee's
Inter-Agency Gang Task Force was asked to conduct a law enforcement
assessment of the recent gang problems in the Valley and report
back to the board with an analysis and recommendations in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chief Probation Officer Richard Shumsky, as chairman of the
county's Juvenile Justice Coordination Committee, was asked to seek
input and recommendations from county-funded Northeast Valley
community-based organizations working with gangs. He, too, must
report back in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   The first group, the gang task force, includes members of the
Los Angeles Police Department, Sheriff's Department, offices of the
City Attorney and District Attorney, the county Probation
Department and school police.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the task force, Richard Saenz, chief of the
Probation Department's Juvenile Special Services Bureau, said it's
unclear who the major forces were behind the 1993 truce and what
their motives were.
</P>
<P>
   The gang truce came at a time when the Mexican Mafia was trying
to control the local drug trade and needed peace for the
trafficking to flourish, Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   A truce among gangs in the Venice area of Los Angeles' Oakwood
neighborhood also had drug-trade motives behind it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in gang-related violence seen in the Valley until
recently may have been a result of several factors, Saenz said,
including increased law enforcement focus on gangs, the Mexican
Mafia's desire to control drug trafficking in the area and the
efforts of people like William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez, who works to
keep the peace among gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really having an impact (against gang violence)? We're
going to take a good look at that,'' Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the task force will do its best to look at how effective
peace treaties are and whether they have side effects, such as
increased drug trafficking, that harm communities in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways to reduce gang-related crime is to offer at-risk
children alternatives to gangs, said Ed Viramontes, president of
suburban Van Nuys-based New Directions for Youth, a nonprofit
organization that works with juvenile probationers and other
at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep the kids busy'' building their educational,
athletic and leadership skills in after-school programs, he said.
Some of these can involve their parents as well, such as a computer
education class his organization is starting up.
</P>
<P>
   Grouping community nonprofit organizations serving youth and
putting their programs into neighborhood parks could turn gang
hangouts into safe havens again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Daily News analysis of LAPD crime statistics found
gang-related crimes were up 31 percent over last year in the
Foothill Division and up 64 percent over last year in the
Devonshire Division. Homicides were down from 10 in Devonshire last
year to one this year but up to 15 in Foothill compared to 10 last
year.

DODGERS JOBS `IN JEOPARDY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Four months of losing has ruffled Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson to the point where he's no longer willing to let
players rest on what they've accomplished in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won't spend the next two months playing out the
string. They'll spend the next two months auditioning for jobs for
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what your contract says, people are fighting for
jobs,'' Johnson said. ``They talk about makeup and the makeup of
this club. I can't say this club is any more self-centered than any
of the other clubs I've had, selfish, or whatever, but I will say
from what they're showing me, there's some jobs in jeopardy for
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Dodgers continued their free fall with a 7-2 loss
to Houston in the first of 10 straight road games Tuesday at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to have to be some changes,'' Johnson said.
``These last two months are as important as the first four, if not
more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong, take-no-guff attitude Johnson is famous for
surfaced, beginning with a poignant message sent after Sunday's
game when the Dodgers demoted backup catcher Angel Pena.
</P>
<P>
   Pena was called the team's catcher of the future in the spring,
but even with evaluations taking place the rest of the way, the
Dodgers elected to send him to Triple-A Albuquerque instead of
giving him more big-league experience.
</P>
<P>
   Pena threw out 11 of 36 would-be base stealers with the Dodgers,
but he allowed four passed balls and made three errors. He also
fell into a habit of throwing from his knees, a sign of laziness.
The breaking point came Saturday when he barely flinched at a wild
pitch in the ninth inning of a one-run game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing balls get by him and I saw him dropping balls,''
Johnson said. ``I said, `I have a higher set of standards for you.'
I said, `Go out, come back and be the kind of catcher you can be.
You showed signs you can do things up here, but you also showed
signs you're not ready to be one of the most valuable players on
the field. . . . It looked like you didn't want it that bad.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him to think that was an acceptable standard to
be a No. 1 catcher. If I thought all he could be was a backup
catcher, I'd let him sit over there (on the bench) and rot.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early in the season, Johnson's frustrations have mounted,
ranging from the lack of left-handed power hitter to flexibility in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Large contracts also play a part. Eric Young, Raul Mondesi,
Devon White, Gary Sheffield and Carlos Perez each have at least two
years remaining on large contracts. Sheffield is the only one
playing well. Young and Perez are owed a combined $21.5 million
next season, but both lost their starting positions recently. Young
is on the disabled list and Perez is at Triple-A Albuquerque.
Without question, their contracts bought them more starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to agree that the next couple of months are going to
be important as to the future of the team,'' said Dodgers first
baseman Eric Karros, who was asked to compare the situation to the
99-loss `92 Dodgers. ``I don't know if we were playing for jobs,
but a lot of young guys were trying to prove we could play in the
big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposed changes could be contingent on how much
money the Dodgers are willing to absorb in possible trades. It's
unlikely another team would trade for Young and pay the rest of his
contract, so the Dodgers might have to pay some of it if they opt
to move him. The same could apply for White and Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has also felt handcuffed by the lack of depth in the
organization and the lack of minor-league options for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be concerned about your contract, I'm going
to be concerned about what you earn, if you can earn the right to
be on this ballclub,'' Johnson said. ``There's some guys that are
going to have to open my eyes, show me what they're capable of
doing, otherwise there's going to be some trades.''

TEEN-AGE SUSPECT CLEARED OF BEATING CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Charges were dismissed against the Glendale
teen-ager wrongly accused of beating kittens, but he still spent
most of a sixth day in jail because of paperwork gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   After inquiries from the Los Angeles Daily News on Monday,
police acknowledged that Eric Lopez, 18, could not have been the
youth who clubbed a box of 7-week-old kittens on July 15, and had
been mistakenly identified in a photo lineup. Lopez was in Los
Angeles County Jail from July 13 to July 20 on three charges of
vandalism, jail officials said.
</P>
<P>
   So a hearing was held Tuesday at the request of police and the
District Attorney's Office to dismiss the single felony count of
animal cruelty against Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   But he was still behind bars until 9:49 p.m. Tuesday because of
paperwork _ to the outrage of his family and civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``After an order from the judge dismissing the charge, the jail
should be able to verify pretty quickly whether they have any
reason to hold him,'' said Mary Broderick, executive director of
the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is nothing else, he should be released immediately,''
she said. ``There's no excuse to hold someone without additional
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lopez nor his court-appointed attorney attended the
afternoon proceeding, when Deputy District Attorney Lonnie Felker
told the court Lopez had been misidentified. Felker dropped the
charge and Court Commissioner Daniel Calabro signed Lopez's release
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identifying a suspect from pictures can be a problem,'' Felker
said outside court. ``The witness made a mistake. The case will be
refiled if the right guy is picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misidentification, it is very clear a crime
occurred, Felker said.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old witness told Glendale police she was walking to
her summer school class about 10 a.m. July 15, when she heard a
scream, a police report says. She saw three teen-age boys, two of
them laughing and beating a box of four kittens as a little girl
screamed, ``Stop killing my kitties!.''
</P>
<P>
   As the teens continued pounding the box with a 4-foot-long
stick, the box split and an apparently dead kitten fell to the
ground, the witness told police. The child scooped up the animal
and ran down the street crying, the 15-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers ran off and the witness took the kittens to
Glendale High School where she recounted the events for school
resource officer Sue Shine.
</P>
<P>
   Shine went to the scene and found a rope tied to the tree and
blood on the ground, Sgt. Rick Young said Tuesday. It does not
appear the witness fabricated or embellished her story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shaken. Officer Shine saw the kittens and said they
appeared traumatized. The witness's description of events was
succinct,'' Young said. ``You do enough interviews and you can tell
when someone's making things up. It doesn't appear the witness made
this up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Young, the girl looked at possible suspect pictures
July 22. Lopez and a 17-year-old boy were arrested July 29. It is
unclear whether charges have been filed against the minor, but
Young said the witness recognized his tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Police have stepped up their investigation in light of the
mix-up, Young said, adding that they must find the child and
the &UR;  &LR; teens who ran away. There was also an adult who screamed at
the teens to stop, he said, according to the 15-year-old witness.
Officers would like to question the adult, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking all those `why' questions right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'' is also a question Lopez's mother and father are asking.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday at his Chestnut Street home, Domingo Lopez
readied for work and wondered when his son would be released. A
maintenance worker at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Lopez said he
believes police picked up his son because he's been involved with a
gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they treated him is not right,'' Domingo Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, who is on probation, has been arrested several times for
graffiti, Lopez said, but his son still deserves to be treated with
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the best I can to get him out of here. I want for
him to have a chance, for him to have a normal life,'' he said,
adding he has tried to persuade his son to hang with a different
group.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that Young said baffled investigators is why
neither Eric nor his parents told officials earlier that Eric was
in jail on July 15. Silvia Lopez, Eric's mother, said she assumed
the attorney would tell police. Domingo said Glendale police are
familiar enough with his son _ from frequent arrests _ that they
would have known he wasn't in Glendale on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the mistake happened, Domingo Lopez said
someone needs to explain to him why his son was still in jail all
day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's court-appointed private attorney, Madeline Chang, called
the judicial system slow.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Elsa Avila, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, said it takes a little while for the jail to
update information. Often inmates who have been released are held
because of other pending cases. When she checked on Lopez's case,
she was told it was necessary to wait until the computers were
updated.

TWO SEATTLE TRAVEL FIRMS PART OF VACATION-SCAM CRACKDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MAGGIE LEUNG  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dream vacations that became vacation nightmares
prompted state and federal authorities to take legal action
Tuesday, and warn consumers nationwide against travel fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five travel businesses across the country were accused of
charges ranging from sending college students on nightmare spring
break vacations to charging individuals thousands of dollars for
fraudulent discount travel memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers told investigators of nights spent in hotel rooms
flooded with water from toilets, being stranded for 22 hours at
Sea-Tac Airport and paying more then $4,000 for air fare and
condo-rental discounts that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seattle area, two travel firms were targeted by the state
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The state filed for a court order to stop Ultima Systems of
Bothell for allegedly continuing to mislead consumers by offering
``prizes'' to attend high-pressure sales presentations. In most
cases, consumers had to pay to use the prizes, the Attorney
General's office said. The company in 1997 had agreed to stop the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   And Vacation Marketing Inc. of Lynnwood ``appears to have
stepped right in and picked up where Ultima left off,'' according
to a statement from the Attorney General's Office, which filed a
civil suit against Vacation Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Ultima Systems did not return calls for comment
Tuesday, and officials at Vacation Marketing _ which sells resort
time shares _ declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a lot of promises they couldn't fulfill,'' said Dr.
Michael Eshleman of Seattle, who paid Ultima Systems $4,400 for
travel discounts he never received.
</P>
<P>
   After repeatedly pursuing Vacation Marketing and ultimately
filing in small claims court, Eshleman reached a $2,500 settlement
with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Crow of Bothell, then a student at the University of
Washington, told of paying College Tours of Arizona $600 for what
she thought would be seven days of fun and sun in Mazatlan, Mexico.
She got more than she bargained for, spending 22 hours stranded at
Sea-Tac with 170 other college students from the Seattle area
before flying to Mexico. ``They kept saying, `Come back in four
hours,''' Crow said of student-chaperones from College Tours.
</P>
<P>
   When Crow and her party finally arrived in Mazatlan, all six of
them were crammed into one flooded hotel room even though they had
paid for two rooms. And though they had paid for 21 meals over
seven days, many of their meal coupons were useless. In all, Crow
had to spend $300 extra on her trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was naive, but I don't want it to happen to other people,''
she said. ``...They didn't have to take advantage of college
students to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel fraud costs U.S. consumers $12 billion every year, said
spokesman Mitchell Katz of the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 consumers nationwide have filed complaints with
various states' attorneys generals and the FTC in the past year.
But that number is deceptive, because many travelers are
embarrassed to report fraud or simply don't take time to complain,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crow agreed, saying that none of the other 170 college students
on her Mexico trip complained.
</P>
<P>
   Some students' parents originally balked at the idea of sending
their children to party in Mexico. ``They don't want to go home and
tell their parents they were right,'' said Crow, who has since
graduated and now works in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Enough people complain about travel fraud to make it the No.
6-ranking consumer complaint for the FTC, Katz said. In Washington
state, travel fraud netted the Attorney General's Office the
fifth-most complaints in 1998, said Assistant Attorney General
Regina Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   Crow got nowhere with College Tours when she complained upon
returning. She told of calling the company and being stonewalled.
She finally got its attention by going to authorities. ``(College
Tours) called me up and yelled at me for a half-hour. They called
me stupid and offered me $25 to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Crow went on the war path. Tuesday, she talked to news
media throughout the day, delivering her consumer warning.
</P>
<P>
   Crow's message _ which included using a reputable travel agency
and avoiding deals that sound too good to be true _ was echoed by
Ester Holmes of the American Express Travel Agency in Seattle. ``Of
course they can offer anything they want (pricewise), because
they're just pocketing the money,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Other consumer warnings, shared by Assistant Attorney General
Cullen: Beware of entering drawings for prizes or signing up for
discount memberships. Do so ``only if you can withstand the
pitches,'' she said. Because companies sell your information, often
to telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Ultima Systems contacted Eshleman, who didn't receive
his travel discounts. Said Eshleman, now ``I don't even let
(telemarketers) talk to me on the phone.''

their home country. Now they have become the key element in the
cease-fire plan to end the war, but an unpredictable one that
represents the biggest threat to peace. And the guerrillas may be
even more potent now than they were a year ago because the
president of Congo, Laurent Kabila, recruited thousands of Hutu
guerrillas against the rebels fighting him, giving them arms and
military training. By Ian Fisher.

   BRITAIN-FOOD (London) _ In a country synonymous with
eccentricity, nothing could be more eccentric than Britain's food
culture. Notoriously indifferent to good food, the English
nevertheless feast on some of the best television cooking shows
anywhere in the world. Traditionally resistant to eating out, they
lavish love and attention on their favorite chefs. When Delia Smith
made omelets on her television show a few months ago, egg sales in
Britain rose by the millions. Perhaps most surprising is the fact
that London is now one of the world's most exciting restaurant
cities. And it is largely on the strength of home-grown chefs, many
of them dedicated to reworking and reinventing a native culinary
vocabulary that many people had given up for dead. It's all very
odd. Some of the best French food in London is not being cooked by
French chefs. And some of the best food, period, is English. By

many chefs seem determined to apply it to just about anything on
their menus. By Amanda Hesser.

DON'T BET ON RECORD SNOW MELTING BY SUMMER'S END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ There's this bet made by the year-round employees at
the Mount Baker ski area.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the ski area set a world's record for snowfall _
as it just did _ will it all melt by summer's end?
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Howat, the ski lodge's general manager, Tuesday said no
way. His daughter, Gwyn, agreed, as did Ted Buehner, a National
Weather Service forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bet with long odds.
</P>
<P>
   There's just too much snow, all agree.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain received 95 feet of new snow this year. That's
enough snow to cover a nine-story building, with feet to spare.
</P>
<P>
   The National Climate Extremes Committee said the 1998-99
snowfall at Mount Baker totaled 1,140 inches.
</P>
<P>
   That topped the previous record of 1,122 inches set at Mount
Rainier in the winter of 1971-1972, the center reported.
</P>
<P>
   The figure of 1,140 inches was accepted after study by the
Extremes Committee, which included representatives of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the American Association of
State Climatologists and a regional expert from the Western
Regional Climate Center.
</P>
<P>
   If one cares about such things, La Nina caused the heavy
snowfall, bringing an unusually high number of wet, cold storms to
the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, we'll take 3-1 odds that next year's
snowpack includes some of this year's record.

MIXING ANTI-OXIDANT SUPPLEMENTS WITH CHEMO IS RISKY, SAY TWO
RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vitamins, minerals and herbs touted as natural
cancer-fighting ``anti-oxidants'' may actually hurt cancer patients
by undermining many chemotherapy drugs, two Seattle researchers
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen patients die who shouldn't have died because it
appeared the drug did not do as well as expected,'' said Dr. Dan
Labriola, a Seattle naturopathic physician who specializes in
cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of the journal Oncology, Labriola and Dr.
Robert Livingston, chief of oncology at the University of
Washington in Seattle, said many cancer patients are taking
anti-oxidant supplements that could diminish the power of their
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   And many of those patients don't tell their doctors they are
using non-conventional therapies, exacerbating the risk to their
health.
</P>
<P>
   The most common anti-oxidants include vitamins A
(beta-carotene), B-6, C and E; minerals such as zinc and selenium;
and most herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of anti-oxidant supplements stems from evidence
that cancer can be caused by a chemical imbalance in the cell
during a process known as oxidation.
</P>
<P>
   During that process, an oxygen or other molecule releases an
electron and creates a highly reactive ``free radical.'' Free
radicals cause chemical destruction within cells that can lead to
cancer, scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-oxidants work by capturing free radicals before they become
destructive.
</P>
<P>
   But many chemotherapy drugs work against cancer by capitalizing
on free radicals and turning their destructive force against
tumors. Labriola and Livingston said anti-oxidants thwart this
therapeutic effect.
</P>
<P>
   A cancer patient who takes anti-oxidant supplements may feel
better during chemotherapy, but Labriola and Livingston said this
is probably because the supplement is reducing the power of the
chemotherapy drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this is that the patients who (take
anti-oxidants) will do better, and feel better, in the short
term,'' Labriola said. ``But in the long term, they leave
themselves more vulnerable to recurrence of the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no human studies have been done to directly evaluate the
effect of anti-oxidants on chemotherapy drugs, the Seattle
researchers note that the biochemistry of many anti-oxidants and of
most chemotherapy agents is well enough understood to predict when
one might interact dangerously with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Labriola and Livingston said the increasing use of vitamins,
minerals and herbal therapies by cancer patients prompted them to
compile evidence from other studies and reports that indicated the
use of anti-oxidants could undermine chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both aware that there were potentially harmful
interactions,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW cancer clinic has worked for many years with Labriola's
clinic because of patient interest in non-conventional therapies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kara Kelly, a pediatric oncologist at Columbia University in
New York, noted in an editorial accompanying Labriola and
Livingston's study that experts recommend diets high in the natural
anti-oxidants found in many fruits and vegetables, ``but not
anti-oxidant supplementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said there is not enough information to support the value
of anti-oxidant supplements for preventing cancer and, as Labriola
and Livingston have now shown, there may be harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have argued that anti-oxidants don't affect
chemotherapy, but that's just a crock,'' said Labriola, primary
author of the Oncology report and director of the Northwest Natural
Health Specialty Care Clinic in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While the level of anti-oxidants found in food may be safe for
chemotherapy patients, he said there is good evidence to suggest
artificially boosting anti-oxidant levels while on chemotherapy is
ill advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using a natural substance that at any other time, or
if used carefully and in the right combination, might have a
positive benefit,'' Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, chemotherapy patients should steer clear of
using supplementary anti-oxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Labriola has worked with cancer specialists at the UW and
Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for many years,
coordinating the care of patients who seek alternative therapies in
addition to standard cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   While Labriola and Livingston both urge that chemotherapy
patients avoid anti-oxidants, they also described methods for
identifying safe combinations in the Oncology article.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they wrote, if the chemotherapy drug does not
depend upon ``free radical'' chemistry, it may be safe for the
patient to use anti-oxidant supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Timing such supplementation so that it does not conflict with
the course of chemotherapy is also sometimes possible, the doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat patients in our clinic every day using these same
substances but in a way so they won't interfere with each other,''
Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   He said most cancer specialists in Washington state know which
chemotherapy agents cannot be used in combination with
anti-oxidants because alternative medicine is popular in the
Northwest and oncologists here frequently work with naturopaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known about this risk at our clinic for at least 15
years,'' Labriola said.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of the country, he said, many cancer patients
and physicians are not as knowledgeable about the risk of mixing
alternative therapy with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer patients determined to take the risk of using
non-conventional therapies, Labriola and Livingston suggest their
oncologist work with someone knowledgeable in the pharmacology of
the alternative therapies to identify potentially harmful
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know how big a problem this is,'' Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   And given the evidence of risk from combining anti-oxidant
supplements with chemotherapy, he said it's unlikely to ever be
studied in a clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of their report in Oncology, Labriola and Livingston
said, is primarily to alert cancer specialists to the potential
risk and, perhaps, to prompt further research into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Common anti-oxidant dietary supplements:
</P>
<P>
   _Vitamins A (including beta-carotene), B-6, C, E.
</P>
<P>
   _Minerals such as zinc and selenium.
</P>
<P>
   _Bioflavonoids; superoxide dismutase glutathione.
</P>
<P>
   _Most herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Harmful chemotherapy interaction likely if drug...
</P>
<P>
   _depends upon reactive oxygen chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   _still has unknown pharmacology.

RULING MAY AFFECT 200 OTHER PROPOSED TIMBER SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge's ruling barring nine federal timber sales on
environmental grounds could stop more than 200 other sales and halt
logging on more than 10,000 acres in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   If those predictions come true, as much as one-fifth of the
timber cut in Oregon and Washington state would be eliminated, a
timber industry official estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In blocking the nine sales Monday, U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer castigated the federal government for rushing a series of
timber sales to evade a requirement to conduct detailed forest
surveys for protected plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of that ruling will come in the weeks ahead as
government lawyers scrutinize the 200 other proposed timber sales.
They want to know whether agency scientists looked hard enough for
protected plants and animals before taking bids on the timber.
</P>
<P>
   Chris West of the Northwest Forestry Association, an industry
group, estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 acres of federal timberland
could potentially be affected _ enough lumber to build more than
90,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate could vote as early as Wednesday on
legislation by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would effectively
undercut the judge's ruling. Gorton's proposal would make it easier
for the government to decide not to look for protected plants and
animals before allowing a timber harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to see land management policies crafted by the
scientists at the departments of Agriculture and Interior as
opposed to a federal judge,'' said Cynthia Bergman, a spokeswoman
for Gorton. ``It basically gives them flexibility and authority.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration analysis of Gorton's proposal calls it
``broad, unnecessary and ambiguous,'' says it would reduce public
accountability and predicts increased costs and delays.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton attached the legislation to an appropriations bill
earlier this summer, but Sens. Chuck Robb, D-Va., and Max Cleland,
D-Ga., are sponsoring an amendment to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's Monday ruling, praised by environmentalists as a
``blockbuster,'' said the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of
Land Management broke the law in awarding the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that by failing to conduct diligent
investigations about where protected plants and animals live, the
agencies risked driving some to extinction. He characterized the
government's conduct as ``far from being minor or technical
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The case traces back to the spotted owl controversy of the early
and mid-1990s. The Clinton administration's Northwest Forest Plan
of 1994 was hammered out to end environmentalists' lawsuits over
cutting stands of old-growth timber where the endangered owls live.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Forest Plan was broadened to protect much more
than the spotted owl. Of the 1,080 plant and animal types in
forests west of the Cascades, 404 were to receive some form of
protection. For 77 species called ``markedly at risk,'' the plan
promised government scientists would survey stands of old-growth
trees likely to hold the protected species before any harvest after
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year delay in the restrictions was to allow scientists
to figure out where protected animals and plants were likely to
live, and how to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, just before the wildlife survey rules kicked
in, the Forest Service approved a series of timber sales without
doing surveys.
</P>
<P>
   No dice, Judge Dwyer said. The surveys, he said, have to be done
if the cutting occurs after September 1998, regardless of the date
the sale was approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions by the federal defendants are arbitrary and
contrary to the plain language of the (Northwest Forest Plan),''
Dwyer ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by a coalition of environmental groups in
Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other timber sales that already had been
sold that are just as illegal as these were,'' said Doug Heiken of
the Oregon Natural Resources Council, the lead plaintiff. ``They're
trying to seriously undermine the Northwest Forest Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But West, of the Northwest Forestry Association, attacked
Dwyer's ruling as having ``no basis in what's on the ground and in
the science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He found (federal agencies) in violation of a procedural
interpretation of when the surveys needed to be done based on his
interpretation rather than their interpretation,'' West said. ``We
think it's totally unfortunate that a federal district judge would
be interpreting an agency plan developed by forestry
professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   West said about 6 billion to 7 billion board-feet of lumber are
expected to be cut in Washington and Oregon this year. He said his
group estimates that perhaps 1.4 billion board-feet could be
affected by Dwyer's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   West said the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management can't
be expected to survey all the land in question, particularly since
the species are obscure and are protected by the Northwest Forest
Plan, not the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about snails and slugs and lichens and
salamanders,'' West said. ``The way they have to survey for most of
them is on their hands and knees, and the costs for this are just
prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Forest Service and the BLM said agency
lawyers and foresters are poring over Dwyer's ruling and their
records to see how much forest is likely to be affected. The
agencies spent $2 million last year setting up survey techniques
and training foresters to use them, plus $6 million on surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The government admits it has not started surveys for 32 of the
protected species deemed ``markedly at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of species and some require extensive surveys,
so yes, it does take time and money,'' said Rex Holloway, a Forest
Service spokesman.

SUICIDE RACE AT OMAK STAMPEDE IS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Organizers of the Omak Stampede have canceled this year's
Suicide Race, citing a boycott by the Native American riders who
typically dominate the race, rumored disturbances by tribal
protesters and a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   The popular Suicide Race, where horses barrel down a steep
embankment and swim across the Okanogan River, has faced
controversies and protests over the past several years from animal
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversies, though, the race had always gone
forward, drawing thousands of viewers who admired the skill of the
riders.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be only the second without a Suicide Race since
the event began in 1935, said Stampede Vice President Jack Miller.
The other was a World War II-era race where only one participant
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation ``has been one of the hardest things in my
life,'' said Miller, who's been involved with the Stampede for 21
years.
</P>
<P>
   Other Stampede events, including a rodeo and a carnival, will
proceed as scheduled Aug. 12-15. The Stampede, the largest annual
event in Okanogan County in north-central Washington state,
typically draws more than 30,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Animal Welfare Society, which has campaigned
against the race for 16 years, welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   But the group urged people to attend the remaining Stampede
events to show organizers the race isn't necessary for the
Stampede's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the Suicide Race first surfaced last month, when
members of the Colville Confederated Tribes announced a boycott of
the race, citing concerns over restricted parking at a Native
American encampment and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede organizers canceled the encampment at the tribes'
request. But organizers turned down a request to cancel the Suicide
Race, saying it would be too disappointing to ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   The board reversed its decision during an emergency board
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Stampede board dated Monday, the tribal
council said it would be ``unjust and insulting'' for the race to
go forward without the tribal members who make up the majority of
the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the race has been open to all, it was initiated by
the Colville Tribes and carried on as part of our cultural
heritage,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede President Fred Winningham said there had been ``a 90
percent chance'' that dangerously high water levels in the river
alone would have forced the race's cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   But board members decided to cancel the race because of other
potential confrontations and ugliness that are ``not what Omak
Stampede is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Board members heard reports of a planned boycott of area
businesses by tribal members, of a verbal confrontation between
tribal riders and non-tribal racers who had driven from Bellingham
to attempt a swimming test for the race last week, intimidating
phone calls and a report from police of a rumored rally involving
hundreds of tribal members who would try to disrupt any attempt at
a race, Stampede officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Cawston, chairwoman for the tribes, said tribal members
were pleased the race was canceled but dismissed the other reports
as ``more rumor than fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Cawston said a boycott against the businesses was discussed but
ruled against. ``You don't boycott your friends,'' she said.

NETHERCUTT MAY FACE CHALLENGE, FROM MAN WHO SUPPORTED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A conservative Spokane radio talk show host whose relentless
attacks on Tom Foley helped propel George Nethercutt into Congress
now plans to run against Nethercutt because of his flip-flop on
term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally hurt,'' Richard Clear recently told listeners.
``I feel George Nethercutt let me down as one of his biggest
supporters. And I had a personal relationship with George. I
traveled to Washington (D.C.) to do my show there for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear is upset at Nethercutt's announcement that he will run for
a fourth term in 2000, after pledging in his 1994 race against
Foley, a Democrat, that he would serve only three terms and come
home to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   If Clear challenges Nethercutt in the Republican primary, it
would set up a nationally watched voter test on term limits, a
cause which Washington state helped give birth to in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Clear said he will make a final decision on the race within a
week or two. If he runs against Nethercutt in next year's
Republican primary, Clear would have to give up his talk show on
KGA radio in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   Clear was sounding like a candidate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign would be based on what George originally ran on,
to be a citizen legislator who would go back, do a job and then
return home to his profession,'' Clear said.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt relentlessly used the term limits issue in defeating
Foley, who had served in Congress for 30 years. Foley was the first
House speaker since 1860 to lose his bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Foley had agreed to be a plaintiff in a federal court suit
against the term limits provisions for members of Congress
contained in an initiative narrowly passed by Washington voters in
1992. The Supreme Court later threw out limits on service in
Congress in this and several other states.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to his third term last November, Nethercutt does not
want to leave the nation's capital. He is taking heat on the home
front for the decision to break his 1994 pledge.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C.-based group called U.S. Term Limits has run
TV and radio ads criticizing the congressman. Local term limits
supporters have run ads on buses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday for his reaction to Clear's challenge, Nethercutt
replied: ``No reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My critics certainly will seize upon this, but most people are
understanding of my decision and are supportive of it,'' Nethercutt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has been angrier at Nethercutt's change of mind than
Clear, 51, who has been a fixture on KXLY and KGA radio in Spokane
for most of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clear made headlines during an on-air interview by
asking Foley if he was a homosexual. An angry Foley replied that he
had been married for 23 years. Clear celebrated Nethercutt's
victory by interviewing the congressman-elect on the morning after
he beat Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Clear now believes Nethercutt has put down roots and gone native
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word I hear is that even if George loses this race, he
will stay back there. And these were the knocks against Tom Foley
in '94, that he had become a Washington, D.C., beltway insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about charges he has gone native in Washington, D.C.,
Nethercutt responded Tuesday: ``Most people understand that what is
paramount in my mind, at all times, is doing right for the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a GOP primary battle has brightened Democratic
prospects of regaining the Spokane-based 5th Congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes around comes around. George was able to dish it out,
and now we'll see if he is able to take it,'' said Paul Berendt,
Democratic state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   House minority leader Dick Gephardt has already talked to state
Rep. Jeff Gombosky, D-Spokane, about running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've received quite a bit of encouragement, and I'm looking at
this seriously,'' Gombosky said Tuesday. ``The general sense I get
is that, on this side of the state, the economy is not in the place
that it should be. We need direction.
</P>
<P>
   Former Spokane Mayor Jack Geraghty is giving a preliminary look
to running as a Democrat for Nethercutt's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is a very nice man, so that isn't any kind of an
issue,'' said Geraghty. ``But people here were used to Foley being
a player in major issues of the day, even before he was House
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foley was deeply involved in agricultural legislation and in
getting Boeing to build a plant over here. I don't think people see
that level of involvement with Nethercutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is likely to be a formidable foe in both primary and
general elections. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee,
which controls Congress' purse strings. He has twice raised more
than $1 million for his races to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest filing with the Federal Election Commission,
Nethercutt reported that he had $138,735 on hand as of June 30,
while already spending $83,684.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits has done three polls, each of 300 voters, which
coincided with its media campaign criticizing Nethercutt. The
surveys, by Diversified Research, showed Nethercutt's approval
rating at 41 percent in late June, down from 54 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no secret that we will continue a sizable voter
education effort in this district through next year,'' said Jason
Miller, executive director of U.S. Term Limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Nethercutt says voters he talks with on trips home to
Eastern Washington ``understand the reasons why I had a change of
heart.''

NEW USES HAVE INCREASED DEMAND FOR TELEPHONE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years I remembered a book I read in elementary school about
two kids who skipped out of school and lived in a cave. It was
called ``Hunter's Hideout.'' I loved that book, and kept an eye out
for it in used-book stores.
</P>
<P>
   I probably never would have found it without the Internet.
Monday it showed up on Bibliofind.com at a bookstore in Stony
Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Voila!
</P>
<P>
   This is not an amazing story. It is a common story to anyone who
has gone Net-shopping for the obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Another story: In Finland, the home of Nokia Corp. and the
world's No. 1 user of cell phones, the latest fad is sending
messages by using letters on the keypad. It is a kind of instant
e-mail, costing about 18 cents. Students have been caught using
cell phones to e-mail the answers during classroom tests.
</P>
<P>
   What the two stories have in common is the telephone. From
e-mail to cell phones to debit cards to the Net, new uses have
increased the demand for telephone time.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, US West handles 1.25 billion phone calls
per month. That's nearly double the number of calls handled three
years ago. The peak calling hour nationwide used to be 2 p.m., when
people were at work; it is now 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., when folks are at
home, online.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that every household had one phone line. By 1996,
11 percent of US West subscribers here had more than one. That's
now 20 percent, and would be higher except for the digital
subscriber line, which uses a connector to squeeze voice and data
onto one wire.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is also in business lines. Five years ago, says
forecast manager Chuck Hanson, GTE Northwest put in three business
voice lines for every data line. Those proportions are now
reversed. Data lines are now 25 percent of the installed base.
</P>
<P>
   Last year GTE Northwest, which serves much of the high-tech
suburbs of Seattle and Portland, Ore., expanded its overall
capacity by 13 percent, nearly double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks may wonder if we need all this capacity. I didn't
think I needed the cell phone I recently got. I don't use it much.
But the thing creeps up on you. Get one, and you will be calling
from the supermarket aisle: ``How about salmon tonight?'' With two
cell phones you'll be calling a lost partner at Seattle Mariner
games. The thing starts as a toy and becomes an essential tool of
teenager management.
</P>
<P>
   Control is offered by other technologies. For a century, the
phone rang, and you did not know who it was. In the 1970s I knew
folks that so hated unwanted calls that they told their friends to
let it ring once, hang up and call again. Then came the answering
machine. Now comes caller ID. In Washington state, 31 percent of US
West customers have caller ID, and can see the caller's name and
number before they answer.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this, some 12 percent of US West customers _ and
most telephone solicitors _ subscribe to ``line blocking.'' Caller
ID can't read the number of a blocked line. In response, most
Caller ID systems shunt such callers to a recording. Unblock your
line by hitting (star sign) 82, it says, or forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Line blocking is the digital equivalent of the unlisted number.
Some 28 percent of US West customers have unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes are happening to a technology that's been
around since the 1880s. But what a difference. Transatlantic calls
have been ``around'' since American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph opened
service to London in 1927, at $75 in gold dollars (about $750 in
today's money) for the first three minutes. That cost is now 36
cents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 AT&AMP;T's transatlantic line could handle one call at a
time and had to be booked in advance. In 1956 the company laid a
cable and triumphantly announced that its London circuit could
handle 36 calls at once. Now AT&AMP;T and its competitors can handle
millions.
</P>
<P>
   And all this change has not stopped. The telephone companies are
scrambling to update their webs of copper wire for the 21st
century. The cable companies are hoping to supplant them. The
wireless companies envision a future in which we ditch wires
entirely, and call each other via satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, AirTouch Cellular announced that it was offering
Internet service for cellular users.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what I'd need that for. But my great-grandparents
probably weren't sure what they needed a telephone for, either. It
took them a while to figure it out. Maybe they never figured it
out.
</P>
<P>
   But their kids did.

HOME LOAN RATES RISE TO 8.07 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Potential home buyers who have dillydallied in the
last few months might be caught off guard this week by some of the
highest mortgage rates in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The national average for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages on
conforming loans has risen past 8 percent this week, the highest
level since May 1997, according to HSH Associates, a financial
publisher in Butler, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's am important psychological threshold,'' said Keith
Gumbinger, HSH vice president. Many will say, ``Gee, what happened?
I missed my chance,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed
mortgage stood at 8.07 percent nationally. It has been a fast climb
since April, when rates hovered around 7 percent. Rates reached a
two-year low of 6.85 percent last September.
</P>
<P>
   California's average rates have risen along with the nation's,
but stayed slightly lower. On Friday, the average rate in
California stood at 7.84 percent compared with 7.93 percent for the
nation. This week's statewide average hasn't been calculated yet,
Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates hit potential home buyers right on their bottom
line. A $100,000 mortgage loan at 7.5 percent would cost a borrower
$699 a month, according to Philip Lipp, president of North
Hollywood mortgage broker Allwest Mortgage. That same loan would
cost $734 a month at 8 percent, or an extra $420 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 loan costs $1,398 a month at at 7.5 percent but
$1,467 monthly at 8 percent, or $828 more each year.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly higher rates are expected to cool down what has
been a white-hot housing market. In June, sales of single-family
homes jumped 10.6 percent to a record 5.5 million homes nationwide.
Gumbinger speculated that many of those sales were from
fence-sitters, people who felt pushed into buying before rates rose
still higher.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Carey, regional economist at the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America in Washington, predicted home sales will
slow down as rates go up. He said that for every 1 percent increase
in rates, sales usually decline by about 450,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates already have killed off the refinancing business.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancing business has declined by 50 percent at
Calabasas-based Countrywide Home Loans, the nation's largest
independent mortgage lender, said spokesman Stephen Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Lipp said refinancing activity at his North Hollywood brokerage
has dropped off completely in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refinancings have suffered,'' Lipp said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there also has been a move toward adjustable rate
mortgages. Gumbinger said 22 percent of all mortgages in June
incorporate some form of adjustable rates. In March, the figure was
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt, senior vice president for consumer markets at
Countrywide, said customers have been increasingly asking and
applying for hybrid products that blend fixed and adjustable rates.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Countrywide and Allwest haven't noticed a slowdown
in home sales, however. Lipp doesn't expect the 8 percent rate to
hurt the housing market considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will still buy, whether it's 7.25, 7.5 or 7.75,'' he
said. ``If the (rising rate) trend continues, it will slow sales,
but it won't stop sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many see the 8 percent rate as reasonable in the context
of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The average 30-year fixed rate for the past five years has
ranged from 6.5 percent to 9 percent, Carey said. And in the past
decade, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was
9.2 percent, according to Norwest Mortgage, a unit of Wells Fargo &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Carey believes 8 percent is a reasonable interest rate, even
though it's higher than recently completed loans. A rate of 7
percent or less tends to spur home sales while 9 percent or more
puts a dent in them, and 8 percent affects some potential home
sales but not many.
</P>
<P>
   Why are rates increasing? Long-term mortgage rates generally
reflect the movement of the 10-year Treasury note, Carey said. They
track each other's movements because they compete in the same
investment market. Investors looking for a safe yield generally buy
either Treasury notes or mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   But threats of higher inflation _ most notably last week's
higher-than-expected showing of the Employment Cost Index _ have
prompted fears the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates.
That, in turn, has driven up the price of Treasury notes.

NEW YORK LEGISLATURE STARTS TO PASS BUDGET PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Four months overdue, the Legislature began
passing Tuesday night a $73.3 billion state budget that was
incubated in partisan anger and hatched in weary compromise. It
provides large increases in aid to schools and child care for the
poor, and makes none of the cuts originally sought by Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly and the Senate passed the first of the 11 huge
spending bills making up the budget Tuesday evening. The Senate
completed its work by midnight, but the Assembly was still at work
on Wednesday morning. That meant that the Legislature tied the
record for tardiness in passing a budget, set two years ago. As of
Wednesday morning, the budget was 126 days late, tying the record.
State law requires approval of the budget before April 1, the start
of the fiscal year, but New York has violated that law 15 years in
a row, a record not approached by any other state.
</P>
<P>
   The budget mostly split the difference between the proposals
made early this year by Pataki, a Republican, and the Assembly
speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the final product
resembled the middle ground taken by the Republican majority leader
of the Senate, Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders also agreed Tuesday to allow financially
troubled Nassau County to impose a 1 percent tax on real estate
sales over the next 18 months, as Democrats dropped their demand
that the county's finances be overseen by a state control board. In
an unrelated matter that had been linked to the Nassau deal in
negotiations, lawmakers also agreed to renew a property tax break
that will save the owners of 280,000 New York City co-ops and
condominiums an average of $580 a year, a provision that expired a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year's state budget process was conducted in the long
shadow cast last year, when the Legislature passed a budget with
little input from the governor only to see him veto $1.6 billion in
spending items, most of them sought by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Silver insisted that the governor promise not to
veto items this year, while Pataki refused to get involved in the
budget negotiations. Real progress began only in mid-June, when the
governor joined the talks, and he eventually agreed not to make
broad use of vetoes, in return for limits on the overall size of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The brittle relationship between Silver and Pataki helped drag
out the process. Between calling each other names and accusing each
other of leading the state to ruin, each man and his aides
contended that the other could not be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help matters that under a new law that raised
legislators' salaries, their paychecks were withheld for as long as
the budget was late. In the end, everyone involved expressed
something closer to grim satisfaction than elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to negotiate in good faith,'' Bruno said. ``You have
to have the will to do a budget, and in my mind, the will hasn't
been there until these last several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Tuesday: ``My conference gave me a mandate on this
budget: no wholesale vetoes, restore pre-K, reduce class size,
eliminate the governor's health care cuts and eliminate the cuts to
the tuition assistance program. I'm happy to report that we're
doing a budget tonight that accomplishes those goals.'' But he
conceded that he was forced to retreat on spending for schools,
colleges, hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strong economy has made it possible, for the third year in a
row, for the state to raise spending significantly, even while
cutting taxes. But this year's spending plan is more cautious than
the last two, which were approved as Pataki ran for re-election.
State lawmakers are being less aggressive this year than in the
last two years on both spending and tax cuts, in part because the
state is still absorbing the commitments made in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki achieved one of his major goals for the year, an
agreement not to spend the $1.8 billion surplus accumulated in the
last fiscal year, which will be saved to help the state pay for tax
cuts to take effect next year. New York, which had just a few
hundred million dollars' cash reserve at the beginning of 1998, now
has nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor clearly did not reach his other main objective,
to keep the rise in spending within the rate of inflation, now
under 2 percent. Overall spending is projected to grow by 3.8
percent, though the true number may be smaller because lawmakers
routinely overestimate costs of programs.
</P>
<P>
   The state's general fund, the part generated by state taxes and
fees that is most closely watched by independent fiscal analysts,
is projected to grow by 2.4 percent, to $37.4 billion, and it would
be higher if not for some accounting maneuvers that moved some
spending out of the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also gave up on the deep cuts that he proposed for
Medicaid, tuition aid for low-income college students, and the
year-old effort to bolster education for the youngest children.
</P>
<P>
   That education program, the product of the 1997 budget deal,
included making prekindergarten and full-day kindergarten classes
available in every community and reducing class sizes in
kindergarten through the third grade. Silver was furious at the
governor for going back on that agreement, and made adhering to it
his highest priority this year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Pataki backed away from his proposed cuts to Medicaid _
at $28 billion, the largest segment of the budget _ Silver dropped
his attempts to reverse cuts that were made in 1995 and 1996. In
the end, Medicaid was barely changed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes from last year are in child care and in
education, which in recent years has supplanted health care as the
fastest-growing part of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   At Pataki's initiative, the budget will nearly double the amount
that the state spends to subsidize child care for low-income
working parents, to $839 million this year from $460 million last
year. That will provide 100,000 or more new day care slots, mostly
through vouchers to the parents, who can spend them with any day
care provider registered with the state. Like advocates for the
poor, the governor has asserted that providing child care is a
crucial component of moving people from welfare into jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers raised operating aid to school districts by 7.7
percent, to $12.7 billion. Of the $913 million increase, the
largest ever in raw dollars, $140 million is for expansion of
prekindergarten and related programs. The overall increase is far
more than the governor called for, less than what the Assembly
sought, and roughly equal to the Senate proposal. Adjusted for
inflation and the number of children in public schools, school aid
is now at an all-time high, exceeding the previous peak set in
1990, just before the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also provided $1.3billion for school construction and
renovation, $430 million more than last year's record sum.
</P>
<P>
   The budget includes $378 million a year in new tax cuts, to be
phased in over the next two years. The largest are $150 million in
cuts for the insurance and banking industries, and a $125 million
expansion of a tax credit for 1.1 million low-wage workers, most of
them with children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are also postponing elimination of the sales tax on
clothing, up to $110 per item, from the Dec. 1 date decided on last
year to March 1 next year, but they provided for two tax-free weeks
in the meantime, in September and February.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater impact on the state's finances comes from more
than $1 billion in tax cuts enacted in the last two years but only
taking effect this year. The largest is a property tax reduction
for homeowners outside New York City, which is being phased in over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   In mental health, the budget provides $50 million for
construction of group homes and other community-based housing for
900 mentally ill people, an initiative by the Assembly Democrats,
and $25 million for similar housing for 980 mentally retarded
people, a measure sought by the governor. Both resulted from news
reports that prompted calls for state action: two incidents of
people being pushed in front of subway trains by mentally ill
people, and reports of mentally retarded adults living in homeless
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats, after resisting for more than a year,
also agreed to approve the money to finish a partially constructed,
750-bed state prison in western New York.

DREIFORT'S FUTURE AS STARTER UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Arizona inquired about Dodgers right-hander
Darren Dreifort before the trading deadline, the Diamondbacks did
so with the idea of using Dreifort as a setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts agree that Dreifort is better suited to relieve, but the
problem is Dreifort's reconstructed right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort is in his second year as a starter. Whether he makes it
to a third year could depend on his August and September
development.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's 7-2 loss to Houston, Dreifort breezed through the
order the first time before four hits and two errors led to five
runs (all with two outs) in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sold yet on the idea he's just a reliever. I don't buy
that yet,'' Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``I'm not
convinced. I think (the next two months) will go a long way (in
deciding his future).''
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he would
use Dreifort out of the pen and Dave Mlicki as a starter, but team
doctors advised against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to go back to the pen, I don't want to go to
the pen, I don't like being in the pen,'' said Dreifort, who spent
his first two seasons with the Dodgers pitching in relief. ``I like
starting. It's all learning how to pitch, learning to go through
the lineup more than one time. As a starter, you have to take
notice of what's working or not each time through the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's pitching history leans toward relief, and he
acknowledges much of that stems simply from pitching in that
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Tuesday night's game, opponents are hitting .224
against him in the first inning, .266 overall. In the first 30
pitches of the game, opponents are hitting .201 against him. Last
year, opponents hit .209 against him in during his first 30
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Alan Mills, the Dodgers' leading setup man,
averages 17.6 pitches per outing and opponents are hitting .262
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Dreifort) still has that one inning where he gets a little
out of sync,'' Johnson said. ``He's a power guy, (using offspeed
occasionally), but he's usually going to be all hard. That's why he
gives up so many hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Young to rehab? The Dodgers are hoping to send second baseman
Eric Young out on a rehab assignment by the weekend, but they don't
expect him to join the club at any point during the season-long
10-game road trip. Young, on the disabled list with a left ankle
sprain, remained in Los Angeles with reliever Robinson Checo for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Bullpen coach Rick Dempsey returned after sitting
out 19 games stemming from his role in the July 11 fight against
Seattle. . . . Lefty Carlos Perez made his first start at Triple-A
Albuquerque and pitched six innings in a 2-1 win at Colorado
Springs (Rockies). In six innings, he allowed three hits and one
earned run while throwing 63 pitches. . . . When Mark Grudzielanek
grounded into a double play in the fifth inning, it tied him for
the team lead at 10 with Eric Karros. However, it was his first
time since June 1 at Pittsburgh. After that play, Grudzielanek
punched a cement wall and missed 28 games. . . . Matt Herges made
his major-league debut in relief of Dreifort in the seventh inning.
He allowed one unearned run in 12/3 innings.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN this season of Lance Armstrong's dogged determination in the
Tour de France and the unexpected appearance of Brandi Chastain's
black bra at the Rose Bowl, it remains the most uplifting sports
story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In these summer days when it is hot enough to melt asphalt and
even a pawnbroker's heart, it is a tale that makes you still feel
just a little bit warmer inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are in last place.
</P>
<P>
   Everything money can't buy. And less.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there isn't always justice from the baseball gods. Just a
quirky sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind fighting over the paltry federal budget surplus. If
the Republicans and Democrats would just disband the Dodgers and
put their exorbitant payroll to better use, they could save Social
Security and Medicare, cut taxes across the board and probably have
enough left over to buy us all some nice patio furniture.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Dodgers are the equivalent of one of those $80
million hammers that turn up in the toolbox of the Defense
Department and aren't good enough to hit anything except their own
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the Dodgers did manage to hit two pitches over
the left-field wall in the second and ninth innings. But that pair
of solo homers by Devon White and Adrian Beltre came wrapped around
seven runs in the middle by the Astros that demonstrated why one of
these teams is at the top of its division standings looking down
and the other has to look up to see the curb.
</P>
<P>
   If Spike Lee were directing a movie about these Dodgers, it
would be Summer of Sham.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell they're from Hollywood. Their defense has more
things that go bump in the night than The Blair Witch Project, and
some of their infielders seem to play with Eyes Wide Shut.
</P>
<P>
   Take Beltre. Please. He dropped a routine line drive off the bat
of Jeff Bagwell that allowed a two-out uprising in the third inning
to grow into a mushroom cloud over the head of LA starting pitcher
Darren Dreifort. He also bungled a grounder by Tim Bogar in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros merely did what they are supposed to do, what they
had to do, what they have been doing all season long in order to
pile up the highest win total in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Astros are the anti-Dodgers. Their $53
million payroll is easily the lowest among baseball's six division
leaders. And while not quite living on skid row, they might as well
be an order of Chicken McNuggets at the drive-thru window compared
to LA's $80 million haute cuisine menu.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton went seven innings, at times showing a lively
fastball, at times showing good location with less velocity, at
times getting a little wild. But he surrendered just three hits and
one run on White's homer with five walks and never was threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took firm control of this one in the third when Craig
Biggio started a two-out rally with a double into the
right-center-field gap, then Bill Spiers followed with a single.
Next came Bagwell's ball that maybe Beltre would have caught if he
only were blessed with opposable thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that really makes a good club is being
opportunistic,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker. ``They helped
us out. They had a chance to make a couple of plays to get out of
that inning, but they couldn't do it. And our guys do go after
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers just continue to go over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once you create an image for yourself, you tend to
live up to it,'' Dierker said. ``You perpetuate your success. But I
know it can work the same way on the other side, too. You can
become well ''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone gave Kevin Brown a sultan's riches,
hired manager Davey Johnson for another fortune and practically
guaranteed a World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Now maybe he can watch the highlights on Fox, which owns the
Dodgers, which is owned by Aussie Rupert Murdoch, who should be put
on a slow boat to Down Under and fed to the dingoes because he's
flamboyant and obscene with money and symptomatic of everything
that is wrong with sports at the end of the millennium. A lot more
money than sense.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have hired Rick Welts, one of the promotional wizards
who turned the NBA into a jiggling jukebox, to clean up this train
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Can you even imagine Bagwell or Biggio as Hollywood Dodgers?
Tougher still, can you even imagine the Dodgers in second place,
let alone first?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from LA, so maybe it's a little bit of a jealousy thing,''
Dierker said. ``But it's always felt just a little bit better to
beat the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially these Dodgers. It makes even a summer day seem
sunnier.

 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New York, we have quite a baseball season going.
By definition, there cannot be a dull day from now into October.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball waited patiently while the Knicks hunkered down longer
than expected, and even the Women's World Cup of soccer
commandeered attention into early July. Now everything else is just
going to have to watch as the soap operas unfold in the Bronx and
in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may or may not have a taut division race, but their
lead is down to a modest, by 1998 standards, five games after a
relatively sedate 3-1 loss to Toronto on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a race, the Yankees have something just as
compelling _ a certified Darryl Watch, of which New York has had
its share over the past two decades. The man is going to Columbus
to resume the spring training that he personally interrupted with
his foolish drive on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry loomed over Tuesday night's proceedings at the
Stadium, as David Cone, who pitched a perfect game only 16 days
earlier, took the loss for the Yankees. Cone, like Strawberry, has
seen fire and rain on both sides of the Triborough Bridge, and now
both New York franchises are throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, by thumping Milwaukee, 10-3, on Tuesday night, have
now lurched a full game ahead of the Braves. The Mets are also 22
games above .500, which is one game better than the defending world
champions.
</P>
<P>
   It has already been a strange year in Flushing, with the
inherent dysfunction in the Doubleday-Wilpon ownership finally
seeping to the surface, producing one of the cheesier New York
baseball moves of recent memory, the scuttling of three Mets
coaches, just to scare everybody else. Totally independent of that
panic move, the Mets found their form, encouraging management to
make some trades that announced the club would not settle for a
mere wild-card position.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are quite likely to hang in there until they play the
Braves six times in the last two weeks of the season, which will be
the ultimate opportunity as well as the ultimate challenge for the
increasingly Ahab-like manager, Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine became the only man in North America and the entire
Caribbean to resent the ebullient Sammy Sosa, grumping when his own
organization honored Senor Sunshine one night in front of thousands
of extra Dominican fans. He should only hope the Mets don't have
something planned for Mark McGwire in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't have to recognize visiting superstars. They
regularly make history in their own ball park, what with perfect
games now arriving at a rate of one per season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year they won 125 games, but Joe Torre, the convalescent
manager, suggested on Tuesday night that they should add
substantially to their record of two world championships and two
other playoff appearances in four years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not totally by coincidence that Strawberry was present
during all four of those seasons. He is part of this season, too,
in absentia. On Wednesday there will be a Straw-size press
conference in Columbus, as a sizable press corps follows him on yet
another comeback trail. Only the Straw Man can keep himself from
appearing at Yankee Stadium by the end of this month, the deadline
for fixing rosters for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of Darryl in the dugout forces opposing
managers to rearrange their late-inning pitching choices _ or maybe
even their roster moves. The Mets probably brought in Chuck McElroy
on trading deadline just to pitch to Darryl deep in October.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we are ``kind of jumping the gun a bit,'' as Chili
Davis suggested on Tuesday night after watching first Ricky Ledee
and then Shane Spencer take questions about the inevitable return
of Darryl to the left-field land rush. Then somebody asked Davis if
he anticipated Strawberry taking any designated hitter swings from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was highly supportive of Strawberry in his brush with
colon cancer and then his slip-up this spring, said: ``The one
thing nobody says about Darryl is that he has to take this in
stride. He's got the opportunity to come back, but he's got to
remember that not everybody gets the chances he has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Darryl understands how he is blessed,'' Davis added.
``George has been on his side. He's had the strength to come back
from cancer. And he is overcoming his other problems. Guys are
proud of the way he's coming back, but he's got to take his time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Darryl has almost four weeks. Then it will be
September, baseball-race time in New York. The Jets and the Giants
should learn their plays. Their time will come. Right now we have a
baseball season in New York. &QL;

BASEBALL, HISTORY MEET IN ST. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Here at the intersection of Baseball Avenue and
History Street, the folks have come to expect momentous things like
3,000 hits and 500 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Mark McGwire hit his 62nd and 70th home runs
last year. It was here that Rogers Hornsby hit a single-season
record .424 in 1924. It was here that Stan Musial got a majority of
his 475 career home runs and 3,630 hits, and every one of them in a
Cardinals uniform.
</P>
<P>
   So the thought of Tony Gwynn notching his 3,000th career hit
here has some appeal from a historical and personal point of view,
especially with the added dynamic of the Cardinals' McGwire closing
in on his 500th career home run.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball lore, those two milestones have never been reached
in the same game. Indeed, it's happened in the same year only three
times. There are, after all, only 21 members of the 3,000 hit club
and only 15 in the 500 homer club. Along celestial lines, it would
be a double eclipse, or harmonic convergence.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen Tuesday. The Cardinals smothered the Padres,
6-0, and Gwynn went 0-for-4, leaving him sitting at 2,995 hits.
McGwire, two homers shy of 500, had a single in four plate
appearances. The two meet again tonight and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who has Ph.D. in baseball history, obviously would have
preferred to reach his milestone before the home fans in San Diego.
But Gwynn started considering his options early in the year, and
St. Louis was a very viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to do it at home,'' said Gwynn. ``I could
see myself doing it in L.A., because that's where I grew up. But as
long as I can do it someplace where there's good baseball history,
like here, I'll be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This park has a lot of history and a great atmosphere.
Regardless of whether the Cardinals are in a pennant race or not,
the fans are supportive and very respectful. They love the game of
baseball and know it inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   The way they treat Gwynn is a perfect example. He is cheered
when he takes batting practice, when his name is announced, and
when he comes to the plate. Monday, a small group of fans who snuck
into Busch Stadium early gave Gwynn a round of applause while he
was taking practice fly balls off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   But then St. Louis has always been every bit the baseball town
as Chicago or New York. The Cardinals won their first World Series
in 1926, one of their nine World Series crowns in 15 World Series
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis gave baseball the Gas House Gang in the '30s,
featuring fellas named Dizzy (Dean), Ducky (Medwick) and Pepper
(Martin), and Bob Gibson and Lou Brock in the '60s, plus that
fellow named Curt Flood who paved the road gold for all current
players.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Smith will cartwheel into the Hall of Fame soon, giving
the club 16 Hall of Famers who spent all or a significant part of
their careers in St. Louis. Statues of Musial, Bob Gibson, Jack
Buck and Enos Slaughter stand outside Busch, to be joined later
this year by Brock and Red Schoendienst, and undoubtedly by Ozzie
and McGwire next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the buzz,'' said Padres manager Bruce Bochy about
the fans' attention on the slugger and hitter. ``There should be.
It's great for the game to have two guys going for
once-in-a-lifetime milestones like this. This is great for
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few respects, there would be synergy in Gwynn getting his
3,000th in St. Louis. Several years ago, Gwynn and Cardinals legend
Musial became fast friends while doing a series for The Sporting
News on the art of hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1958, when Musial was closing in on 3,000, the Cardinals
tried to make sure he notched his milestone at home. They sat him
out of the last game of a road trip, but the game went extra
innings and Musial was called to pinch hit and he drove in the
game-winning run with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's 3,000 in St. Louis would serve as some kind of
41-year-old karma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan is very special to me,'' said Gwynn. ``He always makes
you feel comfortable. When we sat down and talked a few years ago,
that's the thing I was taken with, what a complete gentleman he is,
and how much we both love baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when Gwynn gets his 3,000th, he will be the first National
Leaguer to do so since ex-Cardinal Brock, 20 years ago in this
park, and the seventh player to get his first 3,000 with one team,
a group which includes Musial.
</P>
<P>
   Tony La Russa has managed Paul Bunyan-esque players like McGwire
and Jose Canseco for much of his career, and he knows as well as
anyone that the home run has become baseball's favorite currency.
But he said guys like Gwynn are the ones who keep the game
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is still built around the single, not the home run,''
La Russa said. ``A base hit starts the big rally, sustains the
rally, and finishes the rally. A home run can actually end a rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Gwynn is he doesn't have a weakness. He has
the perfect stroke, and he'll adjust when he has to get a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has to adjust to doing it in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it's not a bad place to be.

MAYOR JOINS IN FREE-STYLE SWIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Taking a dip to beat the San Fernando Valley heat
with dozens of children, Mayor Richard Riordan celebrated the surge
in swimming since the city opened up its pools for free this summer
to youths and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan managed a few crawl strokes, but mostly enjoyed jostling
with boys and girls making the most of colorful inner tube floats
usually reserved for special activities. The mayor even dived in a
second time for more fun in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program's a great success and these kids are having a
ball,'' Riordan said Tuesday before joining ``I Scream Cafe''
workers to pack ice cream cones and talk with the children.
``Swimming is a wonderful thing for kids. Swimming is a way to get
to know each other, a way to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   One parent shook hands with Riordan and thanked him for the
city's decision to lift the $1.25 fee when all 53 city pools opened
for the summer in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if we would come as much if it wasn't free,'' said
Marila Chapelle.
</P>
<P>
   A part-time yoga instructor, the resident of North Hollywood, 10
miles north of Los Angeles, brings her son, Robert, 7, and
daughter, Marisa, 9, to the pool several days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to cool off. It's very safe, and they meet
friends here from the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor picked a good day for a swim in the cool waters of the
North Hollywood Park Pool. High temperatures ranged from 99 degrees
in suburban Woodland Hills to 87 downtown. More hot, sunny weather
was forecast for later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Free swimming gives more children a chance to stay cool in city
pools and plenty of children across Los Angeles have taken
advantage, contributing significantly to the 62 percent increase in
attendance during the first four weeks of summer compared with the
same period a year ago. In the San Fernando Valley, pool attendance
is up more than 68 percent, according to city aquatics officials.
</P>
<P>
   The $800,000 in revenue the city Recreation and Parks Department
loses by not charging youths, seniors and the disabled is a ``great
investment in the community,'' said John Vowels, the city's chief
lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Vowels also said some children always are inspired to become
lifeguards, helping fill the ranks of seasonal and full-time
lifeguards. He noted that nearly 70 percent of the 1,500 city pool
employees, which includes 500 lifeguards, learned to swim at Los
Angeles city pools.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Ana Chalmers, though, was impressed with the
mayor's swimming. ``He's better at the strokes than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another North Hollywood youth said he could match the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do every stroke except the butterfly,'' said 10-year-old
Albert Tsatryan. ``(But) he was a pretty good swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessons aren't free, but are reasonable at $15 for 10 over two
weeks, said Stella Rollins, who has her two daughters enrolled at
the North Hollywood pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cheap, but for some people that's too expensive. So for
them, having the pool free is a great deal,'' she said. ``It's very
important to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Pools are more crowded and have reached capacity, forcing people
to wait in line until others leave. But year-round schools and
flexible work schedules for parents help stagger the crush, Vowels
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're busy basically throughout the day. It's amazing how
the public figures out how to make it work,'' he said.
</P>

SUPPAN SHUTS OUT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Angels put another check mark in the loss column
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   This time they found themselves on the wrong end of a 7-0
complete game shutout tossed by Kansas City Royal starter Jeff
Suppan. It was Suppan's first ever complete game shutout and the
second time in four games the Angels were shutout by an opposing
team.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie got the loss and dropped to 0-3 for the season
before 18,454.
</P>
<P>
   Cold bats weren't the Angels' only problem. The team committed
two fielding errors at crucial points in the game. The first came
in the seventh when Troy Glaus mishandled an easy grounder at
third. The next was in the ninth when Gary DiSarcina mishandled a
grounder at short in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is that we're doing things that we don't do,''
said Angel manager Terry Collins. ``We don't make mistakes
defensively and we're making them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss the Angels fell to 44-61. The team is 19 1/2 games
behind the first place Texas Rangers. Since the All-Star break the
team is 3-16 and shows no signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Royals wrap up their three-game series tonight at
Edison International Field. Game time is 7:35 p.m. A win would save
face for the Angels who dropped their second straight to the
younger, less experienced Royals squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take anything away from the other team, they
come to compete also,'' Collins said. ``But we haven't even put
good swings on a lot of pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting beat by fast balls, and we're getting beat deep
in hitter's counts,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and his coaches are trying to find a combination that
will fire up the team's bats. Unfortunately, that's eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried pretty much everything,'' Collins said. ``We've
messed around with the line ups; we've tried extra (batting
practice), we've tried days off; we've tried extended (batting
practice); we've changed the routine in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched films, we've talked, we've discussed it,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the Royals scored in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon got off on the right foot and beat out an infield
hit. He was sacrificed to second by Carlos Febles and scored on
Carlos Beltran's grounder to Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were hitless in the first two innings. They began to
show signs of life at the plate in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, batting first, got things started with a single.
Unfortunately the next batter, Jeff Huson, grounded into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck reached on a single, but the inning ended when Jim
Edmonds struck out for the second time in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals got on the board again in the fourth. Jermaine Dye
hit a double to right center that Tim Salmom couldn't handle.
Jeremy Giambi singled him home with a shot to dead right to make
the score 2-0 in favor of the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they connected with the ball, the Angels tended to
come up short Tuesday. In the fourth inning, DiSarcina cracked the
ball to the outer edge of the infield only to have Febles make a
diving backhanded stab and throw him out. Two other nice defensive
plays in the inning resulted in outs and sent the Angels back to
the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Mark Petkovsek came in to relieve Fyhrie. The
first batter he faced, Tim Spehr, reached on Glaus' error at third.
Spehr scored with two out on a Febles double.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek then had to work himself out of a jam. He hit Beltran,
then threw a wild pitch to put Febles and Beltran in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later he bobbled a comebacker and made a poor throw
to Vaughn at first. Still, Vaughn was able to get back to the bag
in time to make the third out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels were mediocre for the first innings, they were
awful in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Petkovsek gave up a lead off home run to Spehr, which made the
score 5-0. Damon and Beltran both scored on a two-out Mike Sweeny
double. Sweeny extended his hitting streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's error allowed Jermaine Dye to reach first. Sweeny
scored on a Joe Randa double to give the Royals a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Magnate finished the inning for the Angels by giving up a
walk to Giambi that loaded the bases before striking out Spehr to
end it.

EX-BLUE JAY DAVEY HAPPY TO PERCH IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There must have been something about the small house
at 615 N. Karle St. in Westland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain it? Tom Davey lived there with his family
until he was 11 years old. Then the Daveys sold the house to the
Scheffers, whose son Aaron was a 9-year-old Little Leaguer at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, both Tom and Aaron would sign professional
baseball contracts. They became major leaguers this season. Now
they're both with the Mariners organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody joked around once me and Aaron signed,'' said Davey,
who came to the M's from the Toronto Blue Jays last week in a trade
for David Segui. ``They'd say, `What's in the water in that house?
We should move in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davey, now 25, was best friends with Lawrence Scheffer, the
older brother of Aaron, who pitched four games for Seattle this
June. Davey had yet to make his M's debut heading into Tuesday
night's game with Tampa Bay, but he figures to get plenty of work
in a setup relief role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm most effective in the short relief role,''
Davey said. ``My game's pretty much the power game. I pitch with my
fastball for the most part, then my curveball and forkball.''
</P>
<P>
   Davey was struggling with his forkball and two-seam fastball
early this season, so the Blue Jays removed those pitches from his
repertoire. That left Davey with just the curveball and four-seam
fastball, and, he said, ``I was getting hit around pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   In 29 games, he had a 1-1 record and a 4.70 earned run average.
Not bad for a rookie, but the Blue Jays traded for veteran
right-hander John Frascatore in June. Combined with the presence of
two other right-handers, Paul Quantrill and Billy Koch, Davey had
little opportunity in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard rumors that Toronto was interested in Segui, and
was hoping to be included in a deal. Seattle, Davey believed,
sounded ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the arms that were there (in Toronto),'' Davey said.
``And it's not that I didn't think I was as good as them, but they
had the opportunities, and if they did a good job, I didn't see
myself in any real role there. ... It seemed like a great situation
here. They needed some help in the pen and still had a shot at the
wild card, plus they had a great new stadium. Everything fit in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Davey said he was glad to be traded with a teammate, fellow
reliever Steve Sinclair, and if Scheffer returns to the M's, he'll
feel even more at home. There's one more Westland, Mich., native in
the organization _ Ryan Anderson, the 6-foot-11 left-hander at
Class AA New Haven. Davey knows of Anderson, but the two have never
met.
</P>
<P>
   Until Anderson's debut, anyway, Davey is the fourth-tallest
pitcher in Mariners history. Only 6-foot-10 Randy Johnson and
6-foot-8 Lee Guetterman and Jeff Nelson have ever stood taller on
an M's mound than Davey, who is 6-foot-7.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLIN': As thunderstorms rolled through the area Tuesday, the
Mariners took batting practice with the roof closed at Safeco
Field, but by 6:45 the skies had cleared and the roof rolled back.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first close call yet at Safeco Field, said head
groundskeeper Steve Peeler. Peeler was checking the forecast,
because even though the roof opens quietly, the Mariners want to
keep the same conditions throughout each game. They have yet to
play one with the roof open and closed in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it moves fast enough to distract anybody, but we
really don't know,'' Peeler said. ``And if the sun is out, it would
create a big-time shadow and it would be hard to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: With little fanfare, the Mariners signed UW
right-hander Jeff Heaverlo last week. Heaverlo, whose father Dave
pitched for the M's in 1980, was picked by the club between the
first and second rounds of the June draft. He has reported to Class
A Everett but has not pitched for a while, and has yet to make his
debut. ... Jay Buhner will get his first start at first base
Saturday, when the Mariners face New York Yankees left-hander Andy
Pettitte. ``We've given him the playbook, and he's taken it home,''
manager Lou Piniella said. Ozzie Timmons will start in right field
that day. ... Left fielder Brian Hunter has been off the disabled
list for a week, but still doesn't feel he's regained all his
speed. This is the time when his preparation is paying off, Hunter
said. ``It's important to get an even better jump to make up for
the speed I'm going to lose on my second and third step,'' Hunter
said. ``Instincts really come into play now.'' ... The Mariners
again have a left-handed batting practice pitcher. Bryan Price, the
club's minor league pitching coordinator, will be with the club
through the homestand, if not longer. All of the Mariners' regular
coaches are right-handed throwers.

HEART OF THE DEFENSE; HAWKS PRESS ON WITHOUT SHURMUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ After six high-intensity, hitting-heavy
practices, the players have reached the point where their
overloaded minds are spinning and their throbbing bodies are
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   It is the stage in training camp where a diversion is not only
needed but welcomed. It is the juncture where Fritz Shurmur was at
his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times in training camp where it gets long and
drudgery sets in, and Fritz was always there yelling and screaming,
`OK, let's pick it up,' '' defensive end Matt LaBounty said
Tuesday. ``Just seeing his enthusiasm made you feel more
comfortable being out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, for the first time in 25 years, Shurmur is not out
there.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks are practicing twice a day in the draining
heat at Eastern Washington University, the longtime defensive
coordinator is at his home outside Green Bay continuing his battle
with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When Shurmur was diagnosed with the life-threatening disease in
late May, it caught everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   One week he didn't feel well. The next week we was diagnosed. A
few days later he was on his way back to Green Bay to begin
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, and shockingly, new coach Mike Holmgren was without
one of his greatest assets, a friend and confidant whom he
considers a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike a football game: You get knocked down and
you're hurt,'' Holmgren said. ``You can either lay there, or you
get up and play. You really don't have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   After the initial jolt had been absorbed, Holmgren set about
replacing a man who has one of the most innovative defensive minds
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers coach Jim Lind assumed the duties of defensive
coordinator. Bob Zeman was hired to coach the linebackers, freeing
Lind to concentrate on the entire unit. Dick Roach was added to
help replace the experience that was lost and assist Ken Flajole in
coaching the defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Each move was made with Shurmur's input and blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Fritz about this in Green Bay. He had tubes in his
nose and he was hurting,'' Holmgren said. ``I told him about hiring
Dick and Bob and Jim assuming the coordinating position. Fritz
said, `That's exactly the right moves.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zeman and Roach bring a combined 27 years of NFL experience to a
staff that suddenly needs it. More importantly, between them they
have coached in six Super Bowls _ four by Roach while with the
Buffalo Bills; two by Zeman, one each with the Oakland Raiders and
San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   But just because Lind, Flajole and defensive line coach Larry
Brooks have not coached in the league for very long and have yet to
become recognizable names to most fans, it doesn't mean they can't
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren knows. When Bill Walsh was replaced by George Seifert
as head coach of the 49ers in 1989, the offense was left in the
hands of Holmgren, Dennis Green and Sherm Lewis. Each is now among
the most respected coaches in the league. But then they were as
uncelebrated as Lind, Brooks and Flajole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Jim, this is not the way I wanted this to
happen,'' Holmgren said of Lind's stepping in for Shurmur. ``It was
going to happen eventually. Everyone has to start somewhere calling
the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Lind was on track to become a defensive coordinator, since the
67-year-old Shurmur was expected to coach only another season or
two. Later came sooner than expected when Shurmur was forced to
leave the team only four months after following Holmgren from Green
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It has required quite an adjustment for Lind. During the team's
first three minicamps, he went all but unnoticed during practices
while quietly working with the linebackers. Now he has had to
become vocal and animated, not to mention overseeing the entire
defense rather than focusing only on the linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we broke for the start of the first practice and Bob
said, `Linebackers over here,' all of a sudden I had nowhere to
go,'' Lind said. ``But I'm glad we got Bob. What I'm going to do is
help him until he says, `Get lost.'''
</P>
<P>
   The defense Lind inherits is an intriguing mix. The players are
talented but haven't always played up to expectations. Last year,
they produced a glut of big plays (a league-best 10 defensive TDs
and an AFC-high 53 sacks) but still ranked only 27th.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had four Pro Bowl players _ linebacker Chad Brown,
end Michael Sinclair, cornerback Shawn Springs and tackle Cortez
Kennedy _ but allowed the opposition to convert 39 percent of its
third-down situations, which ranked 20th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The trick this season will be maintaining the edge that produced
the big plays while eliminating the breakdowns and inconsistencies
that translated into allowing big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style of play is just a little bit different,'' Holmgren
said. ``They blitzed a lot last year, and we are not going to do it
that much. It does give you the opportunity to make big plays,
which they got. ... I just want to get off the field on third down,
which is another area they weren't good at last year. The things
that hurt them last year are the things we are trying to change.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have to do it without their defensive leader. Or, to
be more precise, with a new defensive leader.
</P>
<P>
   Not a day or a practice passes when Holmgren, Lind, Roach, Zeman
and the other coaches don't think of Shurmur, who is out of the
hospital and has a hospice in his home. They all know him, respect
him and are hoping only the best for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a tough thing for all of us who have worked with
Fritz,'' Lind said. ``Our prayers are with him daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players never got to develop a relationship with
Shurmur. The (BEGIN ITAL) real (END ITAL) Shurmur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for a lot of these guys, they didn't get to know
Fritz,'' said LaBounty, who played for Shurmur in Green Bay before
being traded to the Seahawks in 1996. ``They never saw Fritz's true
side _ his game-day demeanor, his game preparation, his yelling at
Matt LaBounty for messing up on a walk-through.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not like it when it's happening,'' he added, ``but
those are the things I find myself missing most about Fritz.''

HOLMGREN MAKES MARK WITH BITE AND BARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Maybe you've already heard. If the wind is
blowing right, you probably have.
</P>
<P>
   The hills are alive with the sound of curse words.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Holmgren is off to a bellicose start and, hey, if the new
master of the Seahawks universe has to use a few ``bad words'' (his
words) to get across his point, that's the way it's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, there's too much walking around going on,'' Holmgren
barked Tuesday during the Hawks' morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, get the ball up. You want to (bleepin') play? Play right.
This is too (bleepin') slow. C'mon now. Move!''
</P>
<P>
   And Holmgren was only talking to the water boy.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Seahawks training camp is not a bad summer assignment.
A few hot, lazy days under the baking sun of Eastern Washington,
testing out various brands of sunblock. And while you're at it, you
watch big, sweaty football players pretend all this excruciating
preseason work is worth the big money they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's different. This time, my drive across the
mountains was a white-knuckler.
</P>
<P>
   I had four hours to think about this whole Camp Holmgren thing,
how he demands that no shirt go untucked; how no bandanas or tank
tops will be worn in mess hall; how every screw-up will be met with
a fierce wind emanating from the iron lungs of one of the NFL's
biggest-name coaches. I was pretty fried.
</P>
<P>
   In this new Seahawks era of accountability and taking care of
the little things, no one is safe from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what if I missed a belt loop?
</P>
<P>
   What if my sandal strap came unfastened?
</P>
<P>
   What if the back of my shirt (the one with a collar I neatly
pressed to impress Coach H.) wiggled out from the back of my shorts
and there I was, standing in front of The Big Kahuna who was
unabashedly ripping me for my slovenly practice-field appearance?
</P>
<P>
   By the time I hit Moses Lake, I almost turned around and begged
my editors to let me write more columns about the Mariners (playing
great, aren't they?) or the Sonics (tell Vin Baker that for $87
million, I'd drop down to Calista Flockhart proportions.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I drove on. There was an investigation to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, while the mood at Camp Holmgren was certainly crisp and
professional, it was not exactly the venture into Holmgren's
Inferno, as had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my initial foray into the mood and mind-set of Camp
Holmgren revealed a few signs that the new coach is equal parts
bark and bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches yell because they want to make sure everyone knows
they're in charge,'' cornerback Mark Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year NFL veteran with two Super Bowl rings, Collins has
seen his share of top-notch coaching. Collins played for Bill
Parcells and Marty Schottenheimer, and for a brief time in 1997
under Holmgren in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Collins can tell you when a coach's demands and demeanor are
making an impression on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill (Parcells) yells at certain people. I think when Mike
(Holmgren) yells, Mike wants to let you know he's expecting more,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Mike, you're getting the whole kit and caboodle. You
keep your shirt tucked in, keep your chin strap buckled. That's the
way it is and if everyone believes in the system, the sky's the
limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $32 million contract that made him king of the
Seahawks and prompted him to purchase a waterfront home on Mercer
Island _ one that is just a convenient hop, skip and a jump away
from his billionaire boss, Paul Allen _ Holmgren has brushed off
any speculation that softness has set in with his new, lofty and
all-consuming station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the other way around. This (coaching stuff) is
what I've always done. What I've had to do is put on a tie and
learn to be nice around the office,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   But Holmgren the Coach can't help but carry his corporate-cool
vice president/general manager bearing with him onto the playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Holmgren was wearing blue shorts, a T-shirt and
sneakers _ looking the part. But on his wrist was strapped a wildly
elegant gold-rimmed watch with a fine alligator band. I think there
was a diamond in it _ not exactly the sort of timepiece most
coaches would wear to training camp in a sleepy burg like Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his big-gun aura, there is evidence of a lot of
teaching going on during training sessions. Holmgren takes time
between drills to instruct his team about what he wants and expects
during the upcoming set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches, you know, we're all a little Pavlovian in our
thinking, I think,'' Holmgren said about his requirement that the
team practice with whistles, simulating live game action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow the whistle. Stop the play. You've got to play by the
rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rules to which strict attention must be paid. Or else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not B.S.,'' tackle Sam Adams said, heading out early
to afternoon practice. ``I mean, you better take him at his word
because otherwise, you'll be out of here. He tells you that every
day. Drop a pass, get hurt, don't pay attention, you'll find
yourself on your way out of town.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Adams excused himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to go. Don't want to get fined. Or worse,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he was entirely joking.

FIFTH-INNING POWER JOLT LIFTS M'S TO SIXTH STRAIGHT WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There was a hush over the Mariners clubhouse only a
week ago. The team was losing games and veteran players, and
sinking in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as bad of a slide as we've had in a long time, with
everything injected into it,'' said shortstop Alex Rodriguez.
``Guys were getting traded, it was an emotional roller coaster. At
the trading deadline, a lot of us didn't know if we'd still be
around. Now that's come and gone, a lot of guys are relaxing and
they know they'll have `Mariners' across their chests. It's a lot
of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's won their sixth game in a row Tuesday night, beating the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-2 and returning to .500 for the first time
since July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella said he wasn't too concerned when his team
dropped four of its first five on the last road trip, because the
Mariners were close in almost every game but couldn't hold leads.
Credit Safeco Field with the save.
</P>
<P>
   In the five games of this homestand, Seattle pitchers have a
1.60 earned run average. Mariner starters have gone at least six
innings while allowing no more than three earned runs 10 times in
13 games here. And the Mariner bullpen has not been scored on in 18
innings, the past 101/3 at Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more fair field and the pitchers are pitching with
confidence,'' said pitching coach Stan Williams. ``Everything's
kind of falling in line, and I think this ballpark has the most to
do with it. Guys are finding the ball doesn't jump out of here as
easily, the infield isn't as fast and as a result, they're starting
to pitch with more confidence. Confidence and competence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was John Halama's turn. And while Halama was
successful before the move from the Kingdome, even he said he's
pitching more aggressively, letting opponents hit his sinker into
the ground and taking his chances with the improving Mariners
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Halama wasn't sharp _ he walked four for the first time since
May _ and said he's fighting mechanical problems with his lead
shoulder. But he allowed just two runs in 62/3 innings to win his
ninth consecutive decision, tying a club mark shared by Scott
Bankhead (1989) and Dave Fleming (1992).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to tell me (before the season) I would win nine
straight, I'd have probably said you're crazy,'' Halama said. ``I'm
just going out there and trying to battle.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's always better battling when you have Ken Griffey Jr.
and Rodriguez on your side.
</P>
<P>
   Through the early innings Tuesday, the 37,180 fans were
entertained mostly by the electrical showers jolting the Northwest.
It was a tough show for the Mariners to top in this era of
open-roof ball, but they used power resources of their own to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Rodriguez belted back-to-back first-pitch home runs
to right field in the fifth inning, erasing the Devil Rays' 2-1
lead. With one out and no baserunners, Griffey pulled Ryan Rupe's
pitch into the second row of bleachers to tie the game. It was
Griffey's American League-leading 35th home run, and Rodriguez
followed by lifting one into the first row of stands one pitch
later. That was Rodriguez's 25th blast of the year, and put the M's
ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth time Griffey and Rodriguez have hit
back-to-back home runs in their careers, and the second time this
season two Mariners have homered on consecutive pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle increased its lead to 4-2 when Devil Rays left fielder
Bubba Trammell seemed to lose John Mabry's two-out fly ball in the
lights. It dropped and went for a double, scoring Edgar Martinez
from first.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run inning overcame Tampa Bay's 2-1 lead, which was
built off Halama on a first-inning double by Tony Graffanino and a
fifth-inning single by Terrell Lowery. Both runners who scored had
reached on walks _ uncharacteristic for Halama, who had not walked
more than three in any start since his first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott got Halama out of trouble by striking out Dave
Martinez with the bases loaded in the seventh, and he followed with
another scoreless inning. Jose Mesa loaded the bases with singles
in the ninth, but saved his 23rd game in 26 chances and brought his
earned run average below 6.00 for the first time this year. Mesa
has not allowed a run in nine innings since the opener at Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   That was back before this park became the Mariners' biggest
savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, this ballpark is going to be the best thing
for us,'' Rodriguez said, ``because it's going to make us a better
team.''

MUNI BUS MAKES AN UNSCHEDULED STOP
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is Bigfoot roaming the city by night, ripping
pay phones from their concrete moorings?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the two phone units uprooted and left for
dead at the corner of Market and Third early Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Bigfoot speculation is dashed by an actual
eyewitness: cab driver Harley Sorensen.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and his trusty taxi were behind a Muni electric bus (No.
5007) at Third and Market. The bus was in the right lane, which is
temporarily squeezed narrower by a construction project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the Muni driver) decides he needs more room, so he takes
to the sidewalk,'' says Sorensen. ``There are two pay telephones.
He whacks 'em both, realizes he's hit something and stops. After a
second or two, he starts up again and uproots both phones. Then
drives away. The construction workers marvel, then go back to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in his shift Sorensen flagged down a passing cop car and
sicced the police person on a young man who had just paid Harley
with a counterfeit $20 bill. Cops found three more phonies on the
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon to your multiplex: Clint Eastwood is crime-busting
cabbie ``Dirty Harley.''
</P>
<P>
   MONICA ROLLED her Ford Explorer, and police recognized her
because of the bumper sticker: ``Honk if you're horny and the

</P>
<P>
   Reader Nick says the press should be roasting Lewinsky for
depleting our natural resources by driving a gas-guzzling SUV. A
good point, but I'm not sure Monica's going to fit into a Mazda
Miata.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm surprised she wasn't driving a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   GONE EURO-CHIC on us, the Bank of America has. In a full-page
Chronicle ad, it's Bank of America  &UR; and  &LR; Banc of America.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that BofA developed a sophistication complex in
moving its headquarters from S.F. to Mayberry RFD? (Hold the
letters. We kid y'all because we love y'all.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually the Banc is a securities company that is a subsidiary
of the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bank should consider going Banc, pronounced Bonk. It
adds an Austin Powers-like aura of international intrigue, n'est-ce
pas?
</P>
<P>
   THE VOICE of the Giants, P.A. announcer Sherry Davis, is quietly
riding BART into the city.
</P>
<P>
   The train lurches to a halt between stations. The operator
announces that there's a small fire on the tracks and he has to
jump out and extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking: This is where Butch and Sundance
leap aboard and rob everyone. Sorry, nothing that cool.
</P>
<P>
   While the passengers wait in dead silence, a man sitting in
front of Sherry whips out his cell phone, calls his office and
kicks some verbal butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My executives are getting concerned!'' he cell-shouts sternly,
and Sherry and her fellow passengers stifle the urge to play the
part of the man's concerned execs by yelling, ``Yeah! Damn right!''
in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Train operator douses fire, climbs back onto the train, train
moves ahead. End of vignette.
</P>

   But in the movie version, cell man blurts out secret info

   THE MARK HOPKINS was red-faced when the stage in its Peacock
Room proved inaccessible to wheelchairs on the eve of a BAORP

</P>
<P>
   So what do the Mark folks do? They provide proper facilities,
and they pick up the entire $25,000 banquet tab.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, ``handicapped,'' for general usage, is not a
cool term. It comes from ``cap in hand.'' It's about dignity, and
if that's too P.C. for you, here's hoping you never have your mind
changed the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   STROLLING in Manhattan, Mark Adamsbaum had two ``Never in San

</P>
<P>
   One, he saw a pair of stretch SUVs. Two, Mark was crossing a
street and was almost flattened by a mountain-bike rider (zooming
down from Mount Trump, no doubt) who stopped, looked at Mark and
said, ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE CROWDED lobby of the Central Tower on Market, Richard
Kales runs into a former client. Her company manufactures the
cameras that take pictures of people driving through red lights in
San Francisco, thus nailing the drivers and leading (one hopes) to
their prolonged incarceration on Devil's Island.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Hi, how are things going?''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Great. I just bought a new company.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Does that mean you're not in the red-light business
anymore?''

 HOUSE VOTES TO RESTRICT WINE SALES  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A tiny band of representatives from California's
wine-growing regions battled in vain for more than three hours
Tuesday before the House overwhelmingly passed a bill to grant
states broad new power to enforce their alcohol regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st Amendment Enforcement Act passed 310 to 112, dealing a
major setback to winemakers who seek to expand direct sales to
consumers over the Internet. A similar version has already passed
the Senate; the White House has taken no position on the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Florida Republican Joe Scarborough, the measure
would permit state attorneys general to prosecute in federal court
anyone from out of state who sells alcoholic beverages directly to
consumers in violation of state liquor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Small wineries contend that states have allowed wholesalers to
monopolize the industry, hindering vintners from getting their
labels into liquor stores. They see the Internet as a boon to help
them reach millions of consumers who have been unable to buy their
wines.
</P>
<P>
   Loath to be seen as backing anything that would restrict
electronic commerce, the measure's supporters accepted an amendment
that would grant immunity to Internet service providers, search
engines or other telecommunications companies that serve as
conduits for online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the beginning of a slippery slope in which new
laws can be written to regulate and tax the Internet under the
guise of regulating alcoholic beverage transportation,'' said Rep.
Chris Cox, R-Calif., who wrote the amendment and co-authored the
Internet Freedom Act, which put a three-year moratorium on new
Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cox voted against the underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute, which represents
California vintners, called the amendment a ``decided improvement''
that helps mitigate the bill's effect on electronic commerce. ``We
did a lot better than we had expected,'' De Luca said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., argued that the amendment,
part of which was cobbled together during the debate on sheets of
yellow legal paper, could just create a loophole for Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean Yahoo can go online and do direct (wine)
sales'' without fear of prosecution from state attorneys general,
Thompson asked. ``These are the sorts of problems you create when
you write a bill on the floor during debate without any public
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the bill was needed to help states enforce their
liquor laws, arguing that they currently have no power to prosecute
out-of-state sellers. They also said it would help prevent
teenagers from buying alcohol over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents derided the underage argument as a cover for a bill
aimed at protecting state liquor wholesale monopolies. Rep. Kenny
Hulshof, R-Mo., scoffed at the idea that ``massive numbers of
underage drinkers are searching the Internet for basement bargains
of bottles of Bordeaux to binge with their friends on their
parents' next night out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers lobbied the bill intensely, saying Internet wine
sales posed a threat to state laws that require all alcoholic
beverages to be sold only through state-licensed distributors.
Southern Wine and Spirits, the nation's largest liquor wholesaler,
is headquartered in Scarborough's home state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is about wholesalers and distributors that don't
want small wineries to move in on their turf,'' said Rep. Lynn
Woolsey, D-Calif. Woolsey called the bill ``a power grab involving
a 65-year-old regulatory scheme that grew out of Prohibition and
stands on three legs: politics, policy and profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey said winemakers are forced to sell to state-licensed
distributors who have the sole legal authority to sell to
restaurants, bars, liquor stores and other retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guess what,'' she said. ``This distribution system does
not work for consumers who want access to hard-to-find wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., attempted to insert a ``poison
pill'' amendment that would allow states to prosecute violations of
state gun laws in federal court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that if we are going to give attorneys general the
ability to go to federal court to protect citizens from $20 bottles
of cabernet, we ought to give attorneys general the ability to
protect state citizens from TEC-9s, AK-47s and other weapons of
mass destruction,'' Lofgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren's amendment was ruled out of order.
</P>
<P>
   Direct alcohol sales to consumers are limited or prohibited in
39 states; in five, including Florida, such sales are a felony.
Direct sales have long been legal inside California, allowing state
consumers to buy California-produced wines, along with wines from
11 other states that have reciprocity agreements with California.

 &HT;    Our dancing would make Travolta cry
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a performance art dream.
</P>
<P>
   If 100 women can get the Congress Avenue bridge in Austin closed
for four hours to put on a spoken word and dance artwork, why can't
100 guys do the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, I watched 100 women dressed in white clothing
perform a goofy show on the bridge. It was called The Bridge. The
women, sitting in rows of folding chairs, rose out of their chairs
and made gnarly faces, like they were chapped about something. They
hopped around and made hooting noises. They recited poetry in
unison, such as, ``I believe. We are believing. Light. Light.
Light.''
</P>
<P>
   I envision a tasteful yet understated male counterpoint to the
women's extravaganza. My performance art show would involve 100 men
reclining in Barcaloungers (La-Z-Boys,whatever, the chair of your
choice) in rows on the same bridge, watching football on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of The Bridge, our performance would be called The
Remote. Like the babes, we would have the dance. Every so often, we
dudes would rise from our chairs and give each other high fives.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, we'd have poetry, too. Instead of, ``We are believing.
Light. Light. Light,'' we men would say, ``I believe I'll have
another beer. Bud Light.'' And if we got lost on the way to the
show, we would not stop to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   The women's show featured a small ensemble called the Walter
Thompson Orchestra playing dissonant music that would wake up road
kill. For our show, I'm hoping we can get Hank Williams Jr. to come
and sing the phrase, ``Are -- ou -- eady for -- ome -- ootball?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't laugh. I want equal time. If the chicks can shut down
Congress Avenue on a Saturday night to make their feminist
statement, why can't we guys shut it down to knock back a few cold
ones and scratch our butts? Fair is fair. I have even spoken to my
wife, Sally, about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not taking that chair out of this house,'' she said.
OK, so I'll go to a used furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   This will require some work on my part _ and yours, too, if you
share my dream. Guys, if you want to make this happen, please
e-mail me at the address listed at the bottom of this column. Much
work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   I have gone to the City of Austin and picked up the form we need
to get the bridge closed for an event.
</P>
<P>
   To close an arterial or collector street for an event, you have
to pay a $250 application fee. If applicable, you have to pay a $33
sound permit fee. There's a $76 safety inspection fee. (Is somebody
from the city going to check our Barcaloungers to see if they are
street-ready?) There is a $100 per block permit fee and a
refundable $2,000 security deposit. Maybe we can get some wealthy
corporation such as Dell to fund this, or perhaps we can score a
federal arts grant.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, this really is art. One hundred guys camped in easy
chairs, with remote controls, talking to their inner child while
taking part in synchronized channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my male buddies are excited about this, because there is
much angst among us guys, too, that needs to be addressed. ``One
time I had to get my own beer,'' a friend of mine lamented. Oh, my
God.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Next week, David Ponitz heads to Malaysia,
serving as keynote speaker for a conference that will be attended
by ministers of education and educators from nearly a dozen
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dayton Board of Education is offering James
Williams a $225,000 lump-sum payment to terminate his contract,
while not taking up Ponitz' offer to work with them _ for free.
</P>
<P>
   While educators all over the world are seeking the counsel of
the former Sinclair Community College president, the Dayton school
board, apparently, isn't interested, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting informally with a couple of board members, Ponitz
came away discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a different agenda, and did not want to look at
issues I thought should be looked at,'' Ponitz said. ``Their
response was that they wanted to hire an interim superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponitz didn't take it personally. ``It doesn't bother me in
terms of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ponitz said he hoped to work with the school board in key areas:
working together; setting goals; identifying the qualities desired
in a superintendent; evaluating ways the community could help and
how to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole community is ready to be helpful,'' Ponitz said,
``but the board has to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has seen little sign of that. Ponitz sees the board's
failure to reach out to the business community for help as a sign
of business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``And business as usual doesn't help the children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other communities have created successful partnerships between
business and schools, he noted, when the issues are carefully
defined. ``If you define the questions that need to be resolved,
there are a lot of practical people in this community who want to
help,'' Ponitz said.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Clayton Luckie said he's disappointed Ponitz
wasn't interested in being interim superintendent, but is
determined to bring him on board once that position has been
filled. ``If we, as a board, are smart, we wouldn't pass up the
opportunity,'' Luckie said. ``We are very interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is understandable, given the current crisis, that
Ponitz came away with a different impression, or that some board
members seemed unaware of Ponitz's offer. ``This is the first I've
heard of it,'' said Ricky Boyd. ``I think Dr. Ponitz has a lot to
offer. There needs to be a partnership between the business
community and the school board.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponitz called the board's settlement offer to Williams
``appropriate in today's terms,'' adding, ``we ought to move on to
deal with the real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us unaccustomed to the corporate stratosphere choke on
the notion of the settlement being fair or ``appropriate.'' Come on
_ $19,243 for Williams' annual expense account? And $6,719 for a
district-owned car? Why the heck should the district be paying for
such expenses for a superintendent no longer in its employ?
</P>
<P>
   The question rankles, but Ponitz makes a good point. A prolonged
legal battle won't do anyone any good, least of all students.
Although it seems outrageous for Williams to walk away with that
much cash, the board may be taking the most prudent, pragmatic
course.
</P>
<P>
   If the board can swallow that bitter pill, why can't it take
advantage of people like Ponitz, an educator with a national
reputation and a proven track record?
</P>
<P>
   The board has sent James William packing, along with $225,000 he
doesn't have to earn. Let's hope it now learns to reach out to
leaders in our community willing to work for no better reward than
the education of our children.

 &HT;    Can't be money luring people to day-care jobs
 &HT;    By Emily C. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jerene Metzger knows why she works in
day care. She loves the kids. ``Some of these kids, this is the
best care they get all day,'' she says. And finally, finally, she's
got herself a decent job in a decent place working with decent
people.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this.
</P>
<P>
   Before a new owner bought the West Palm Beach center that
Metzger runs, turnover was ridiculous. ``It was unbelievable,'' she
says. ``Somebody would work a month and quit. Some people worked a
day.'' There was no health insurance, no paid days off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Metzger's in a situation that's pretty rare in the
day-care industry. She can give her workers benefits and bonuses.
People who work 10 days without missing get an extra $80 in their
paychecks. It is a significant success story in our nation's horrid
day-care situation.
</P>
<P>
   A new study released over the weekend by a Virginia financial
firm said America's day-care workers are the
second-to-the-lowest-paid professionals in our country. Only
housekeepers at $9,000 a year earn less. And pardon me while I
release my feminist sarcasm and wonder out loud if it's any
coincidence that this country's two lowest-paid jobs have long been
considered women's work: keeping house and raising our children.
</P>
<P>
   The average day-care teacher makes $13,000 a year, which means
she _ yes, she _ brings home around $11,000 a year after taxes.
That figures out to about $212 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred dollars a week. Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   That's for your rent and your light bill and your phone bill
and, oh yeah, your day care. I can spend $200 a week on just
groceries if we have company staying with us.
</P>
<P>
   The average day-care worker _ the person who cares for our
children for the better part of their waking hours _ usually
doesn't get paid vacation or health insurance. She's with our kids
when they're learning to walk and talk and make new friends. She's
with them when they're adorable. She's with them when they're
exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   She's with them more than we are.
</P>
<P>
   That $13,000 a year might appall you and me, but it's lost its
shock value on Helen Blank. Blank is director of child care for the
Children's Defense Fund in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions to good child care are complicated for a lot of
reasons, she says, including America's ``deep schizophrenia about
women working.'' A lot of policy-setters aren't about to make it
easier for women to leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   Blank has seen and heard it all up there in Washington. She
knows that child care ``already costs more than a public college
tuition.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows child care gets ``a lot of lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   And she knows the conservative political argument: ``Parents are
responsible for their own children.'' Absolutely true. Blank won't
argue with that. It's just that, how can parents be responsible for
their children _ how can they work and put food on the table and
pay for doctor's visits and buy clothes _ if they can't even afford
the child care?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is government subsidies. Everyone knows
that. Everyone also knows that subsidies have, as Blank puts it,
``big political complications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at college, 23 percent is picked up by parents,''
Blank says. ``In child care, it's 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer? Blank, a woman who's been doing this for 20 years, a
woman who can recite disturbing figures off the top of her head, a
woman who is weary at 8:30 in the morning from her fight on the
Hill the day before, puts it like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a greater awareness about the importance of the early
years of life.''
</P>
<P>
   A greater awareness about the importance of the early years of
life.
</P>
<P>
   That seems so obvious. Obvious to Helen Blank and obvious to me
and obvious to people like Jerene Metzger. Obvious to the poor
working mother and obvious to the wealthier and still-rising female
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious. Obvious. Obvious. If only it were obvious to our men in
Washington.

 &HT;    Hillary resorts to psychobabble to get Bill off the hook _ again
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Sure, President Clinton lies, cheats and chases
skirts. These are sins, and in some cases crimes, but they are not
his fault. His mama made him do it.
</P>
<P>
   Not just his mama, mind you. But his mama and his na-na combined
to deeply scar the Arkansas boy to the point that the abused child
grew up to be a serial philanderer and an irrepressible liar.
</P>
<P>
   This is the First Lady's latest excuse for her husband's
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't have to keep making up all these silly excuses. She
could just keep her lips zipped about her husband's troubles. The
First Couple apparently shares a zipper dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,''
Mrs. Clinton is quoted in the initial publication of ``Talk'', a
glossy new magazine edited by former ``New Yorker'' editor Tina
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The women in young Clinton's early life deeply scarred the youth
and launched him on a career of womanizing. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse,''
said the First Lady. ``There was a terrible conflict between his
mother and grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Abuse-excuse psychobabble that blames women for the boorish
behavior of men would be considered outrageously sexist had it not
come from the First Lady.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Hillary Clinton blamed her husband's troubles on
an anti-Arkansas prejudice by the Eastern establishment. This is an
interesting excuse now that the First Lady wants to be elected to
represent this bias epicenter as a U.S. senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Next she blamed the president's problems on a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she blames her husband's reckless infidelity and lies on his
mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. Judge Susan Webber Wright had only known that Clinton
had been abused by ``tension'' between his mother and grandmother,
surely she would not have found him guilty of contempt of court for
lying under oath in the sexual harassment suit brought against him
by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Had Paula Jones only known that the Arkansas governor suffered
deep scars from an abused childhood, surely she never would have
complained about his behavior in a hotel room and would have
willingly forgone the $850,000 he paid her to settle the lawsuit
that led to his ``undermining the integrity of the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary had spoken out earlier so members of the House of
Representatives could understand that Clinton had a ``weakness''
caused by a ``conflict between two women,'' no doubt the fact that
the president lied to them, the American people and under oath to a
federal grand jury would have been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton informs the world in ``Talk'' that the president
``has been working on himself very hard in the past year'' and that
he ``has become more aware of his past and what was causing this
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also pointed out that the president's affair with
the intern happened after the deaths of her father, his mother and
their friend Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   If any of this goofy-sounding blame shifting is even remotely
close to being the reason that the president of the United States
lied to the American people, lied under oath and had sex with a
White House intern, then all future presidential candidates should
be screened to determine if some unresolved childhood tension will
cause them to behave in a similar manner.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the president is ``comfortable'' with his wife's
observations in the magazine article. Of course, he is. The sax man
is off the hook again.

 &HT;    The ring around Saturns
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When my editor asked me to join last
week's caravan of Saturn owners to the company's second
``Homecoming'' at the plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., I balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturn owners are pod people,'' I objected. ``When you step
into the showroom, they shove brain-sucking parasites into your ear
that destroy your will and make you buy the deluxe wheel covers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a myth,'' my boss frowned, though with
uncertainty. ``We want you to drive to Tennessee with Saturn
enthusiasts, get to know them, and explode the myth of a Saturn
cult.''
</P>
<P>
   I brightened to recall that the Saturn homecoming included a
Hootie and the Blowfish concert, games, a barbecue and a plant
tour. Partying with 30,000 Saturn owners might be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``On second thought,'' my editor said, sensing my glee,
``Gainesville is far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for five caravans starting at various places in the
country to pick up members along the way and converge at the plant
in Spring Hill. I was to join the Miami group, link with motorists
waiting in Orlando and on to Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   One problem. Nobody came up from Miami. And the anticipated West
Palm Beach group of about five cars were also no-shows. As the
Saturn managers explained, their voices only slightly shrill from
hysteria, there were still plenty of South Florida Saturn owners
headed for the Saturn spawning grounds in Tennessee. They simply
declined to convoy.
</P>
<P>
   I found this non-joiner mentality reassuring. Saturn owners were
not secretly planning to gather long enough to toast one another
with spiked Kool-Aid and bid a mass adieu.
</P>
<P>
   And yet if there is nothing of the cult in Saturn enthusiasts,
why is there even such a thing as a Saturn club? Why would tens of
thousands of owners bother to sojourn for fellowship with other
small car owners?
</P>
<P>
   Miatas, Mustangs and even 1953 Studebakers I can understand.
</P>
<P>
   But my Taurus? Never. Would you drive a thousand miles to party
with fellow Buick owners?
</P>
<P>
   Assured that there would be plenty of Saturn owners in Orlando
and Gainesville, I left with a dealer group of three Saturns,
including the newly introduced LS mid-size. I drove them, too, and
found them to be solid, nimble, zippy, in short, very appealing
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   But so are VW bugs, Mazda Proteges and Dodge Neons.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be something more to Saturn mania.
</P>
<P>
   What was the magic that since 1991 has put 2 million Americans
into Saturns who might otherwise have chosen Japanese cars?
</P>
<P>
   Part of it, I decided, is subliminal _ the Saturn snout is
suggestive of a mini-Corvette. (Note to Corvette owners: I am not
in the book, and I will be out of town for several months.)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning found me at the Osceola-Kissimmee Saturn
dealership breakfasting with _ sure enough _ two dozen Saturn
enthusiasts on hand to launch the convoy that would pick up dozens
of cars en route to Spring Hill. A quick eyeball survey failed to
detect anybody under 35. Most came two to a car: an owner, almost
invariably a woman, and a guest, either a spouse, relative or
friend.
</P>
<P>
   I needed a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Coral Clark, 41, a wastewater treatment operator, was teamed
with her dad, Victor Clark, 72. ``The trip sounded like fun. I've
wanted a Saturn ever since they came out, and I bought it because
it is the only car that can be towed behind an RV without rolling
up mileage.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula James, 56, a Walt Disney World employee, was accompanied
by Sal Parillo, 64. She bought a car only to learn that she had
joined a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dealer sent me a brochure about the Homecoming in
Spring Hill, I knew I would enjoy it because of the way I'm treated
by the dealer, like a guest or family member.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark T. Sullivan of Orlando was traveling with his mother,
Myrel, and figures he owes himself the trip after missing the first
Homecoming hosted by Saturn in 1994. ``I have 147,000 on my 1994
wagon, and I'm proud to own a reliable car that's American made.''
</P>
<P>
   When I met Sylvia Kirkendoll, a supervisor for an Orlando title
insurance company, I knew I had found my ride to Gainesville and my
Saturn True Believer, a Saturn loyalist who could explain the
mystique. I knew it the second that Kirkendoll, 42, said that one
month after buying her golden Saturn sedan two years ago, she drove
up to Spring Hill for a tour of the plant, and later signed up for
a seminar on the Saturn marketing philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my Saturn at the suggestion of my boss, who is a
woman,'' said Kirkendoll. ``My boss said, `Every woman should own a
Saturn.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the organizers asked the caravaners to go to
their cars and queue up. Once we had gotten on Florida's Turnpike,
I got Kirkendoll expounding on her favorite subjects, the erosion
of service in the U.S. and particularly, the cloak of invisibility
women seem to don in the showroom _ unless they are accompanied by
a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into a showroom with a man, the salesperson will
talk right past you. If you go in alone, when they finally see you,
they talk to you as if you are brain dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkendoll is decidedly not brain dead. She supervises 10 people
at work. She belongs to a flying club where she is the ground
school instructor. ``I know something about engines, and it is
really galling to be talked down to by somebody who might not know
as much as you do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saturn fixed all that?
</P>
<P>
   ``When my boss said that every woman should own a Saturn, she
meant that they don't treat you as stupid. When I went in two years
ago, they focused on what I wanted, not what they wanted to sell
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkendoll likes to drive. She's put 36,000 miles on her car and
driven through the Southwest and twice to Spring Hill. She does not
belong to the local Saturn Club, ``but I would join in a minute if
I wasn't already in my flying club.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does a week go by that somebody doesn't stop and ask her
how she likes her Saturn. ``That never happened with my Dodge
Shadow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If she was not a Saturn loyalist at point of purchase, she was
five minutes after the sale. She's taken part in the free car
clinics, watches her mail for Saturn sponsored events, and checks
www.saturn.com for announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know,'' Kirkendoll asked me, ``that a few years ago
somebody put the wrong kind of engine coolant in some of the cars,
and Saturn called the cars back and gave the customers brand new
cars?''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what they did with the old cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scrapped them,'' Kirkendoll replied.
</P>
<P>
   Sounded like a myth to me, like the story of the rich guy whose
out-of-warranty Rolls-Royce breaks an axle on a boulder. The
factory flies in a mechanic with a new axle, makes repairs and
doesn't bill the millionaire. Later, when the Rolls owner calls the
company to find out why he hasn't been billed, a spokesman frostily
informs him: ``Sir, Rolls-Royces do not break axles.''
</P>
<P>
   We drove up to the Gainesville rendezvous point where a dozen
Saturns awaited us. I looked at rows of shiny Saturns _ their
eager, sloping noses pointed bravely towards Tennessee _ and
decided there are reasons for myths and even cult followings, and
that I could see myself trading for the new Saturn mid-size.
</P>
<P>
   Well, first, they would have to make that nose even more
Corvette-like. And despite Saturn's adamant ``one price'' policy,
I'll bet I could get them to throw in a bag of jelly doughnuts.
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take one of two takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>

   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The so-called patients' bill of rights is much in the news.
Can you review the health perks U.S. senators and representatives
get, including what they pay in monthly premiums? What about
Cabinet officers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like any nonmilitary employee of the federal government,
members of Congress participate in the government-financed Federal
Employees Health Benefit Program. Pete Sepp of the National
Taxpayers Union said members of the Senate and House have a number
of options for coverage, based on such things as the number of
family members, and pay premiums of $100-$300 a month. For an
additional annual fee _ $290 for House members, $520 for senators _
they also have unlimited visits and treatment through the Capitol's
office of the attending physician. And they also can obtain free
medical treatment at either Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members also participate in the Federal Employees Health
Benefit Program and get the free use of services at Bethesda or
Walter Reed, Sepp said. But they don't have the use of the
attending physician at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg read a passage
from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' at the memorial Mass for her
brother, John F. Kennedy Jr. Do you know what it was? I have a copy
of the work and would like to find it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's in Act IV, Scene 1, starting with Line 156, which begins
``Leave not a rack behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage Schlossberg read begins with these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are such stuff
</P>
<P>
   As dreams are made on, and our little life
</P>
<P>
   Is rounded with a sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the early history of the song ``Dixie.''
Who wrote it, and when was it first performed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources aren't in full agreement, but in general ``I Wish I
Was in Dixie,'' or ``Dixieland,'' is attributed to Daniel Decatur
Emmett (1815-1904) of Mount Vernon, Ohio. A member of a minstrel
troupe, Emmett made the song a hit when he and the troupe Dan
Bryant's Minstrels performed it in 1859 at Mechanics' Hall in New
York. It was a ``walk-around,'' a finale involving the entire
company of the performance that closed the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources say Emmett himself was black, while others say he
used makeup to darken his face in the then-current minstrel style.
Whether Emmett was the originator of ``Dixie'' also is in question.
Some sources say he may have learned it from a black family, the
Snowdens, who settled in Knox County, Ohio, in the early 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Although it became a battle hymn for Confederate troops, World
Book Encyclopedia reports that versions of ``Dixie'' were played
and sung by both Union and Confederate troops at the beginning of
the Civil War. After the Confederate Army surrendered in 1865,
President Abraham Lincoln asked a band at the White House to play
``Dixie,'' reclaiming it as a song for the entire nation. Even so,
it continues to be a symbol of Southern identity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that a credit report from Equifax costs $8. I thought
people in certain states could get it for free. Can you clarify,
and do you have a phone number to obtain the report?
</P>
<P>
   A: Resident of six states (Georgia, Colorado, Massachusetts,
Vermont, Maryland and New Jersey) can get two free personal credit
reports a year at no charge from all three major credit bureaus.
The $8 charge applies to residents of states where legislation
doesn't require free reports, said Dave Mooney of Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   To receive the reports, call these numbers: Equifax,
1-800-685-1111; Experian, 1-888-397-3742; and TransUnion Corp.,
1-800-916-8800.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In World War II, soldiers who came home from Europe were
given something called ``the ruptured duck.'' Can you tell me
something about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to a small lapel pin which had an eagle on
it with its wings extending beyond the pin on each side. The
returning World War II veterans dubbed it ``ruptured duck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military has alternative
explanations, saying the term ``ruptured duck'' was slang for the
honorable discharge certificate and was so named because of the
flattened, two-dimensional eagle in the U.S. coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary's second explanation calls ruptured duck a
nickname for the basic insignia of an Army specialist or the rating
badge of the Navy's enlisted personnel, both of which incorporate a
flattened, two-dimensional spread-eagle design.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that the war over Kosovo had ended, will the Pentagon
finally reveal how that downed U.S. Stealth fighter pilot was shot
down over Yugoslavia, and his identity?
</P>
<P>
   A: As a matter of policy, the pilot will not be identified,
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Begines told Q&AMP;A. And the Pentagon
is continuing to investigate the reason for the loss in late March
of the F-117.
</P>
<P>
   Begines cited comments made in April by Air Force Brig. Gen.
Bruce Carlson at a Pentagon briefing in which he said the F-117
investigation is in its ``ongoing'' second phase. ``We have
eliminated an act of God and loss of consciousness by the pilot,''
Carlson told reporters, ``but we haven't determined the cause of
that loss.'' He also said mechanical failures had not been ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hasn't issued any later updates, Begines said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Friday, the dog that supposedly went
everywhere with John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy? If it was on the plane, was its body recovered?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friday wasn't on the plane. Neither was the couple's cat,
Rudy. They already were on Martha's Vineyard when the fatal crash
occurred. One report said the caretaker of Kennedy's 500-acre
estate there has been watching out for them since the fatal crash.
Another says they have been taken to Massachusetts and are being
cared for by the couple's relatives. There's talk, according to the
New York Daily News, that the pets will be taken in by Kennedy's
sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and her children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV program about Johnny Cash included the old song
by his brother, Tommy, ``Six White Horses Come to Take You Home.''
I've never heard anything about him since. Can you give me an
update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tommy Cash continues to ``work the road and stay in the
limelight,'' in the words of booking agent Lynn Gray. He appeared
most recently in a salute to brother Johnny June 4-5 at the Ski
World Country Time Music Hall near Nashville, Ind. He also is
working on two projects, Gray said, a book about being the brother
of Johnny Cash and another album being produced in Europe. In
addition to ``Six White Horses'' _ his No. 1 single, in 1970 _
Tommy Cash had a string of Top 20 hits, including ``So This Is
Love.'' He and his band, the Tomcats, also made several albums,
including ``Tommy Cash Country'' in 1971, ``American Way of Life''
in 1972 and ``The 25th Anniversary Album'' in 1992. That was
followed by ``Tribute to a Princess'' after the death of Princess
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Cash has made numerous TV appearances, and he
often competes in pro-celebrity golf tournaments. He also has made
numerous personal appearances throughout Europe, as well as in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maurice Tempelsman, friend of the late Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, was scarcely mentioned in news coverage of the deaths of
John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette.
What's up with him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The diamond merchant and longtime companion of Jackie O. was
glimpsed at the memorial Mass in New York for the victims of the
JFK Jr. airplane crash, but other than that, he avoids publicity.
He did, however, show up at a black-tie bash in February when
President Clinton hosted British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the
White House. Tempelsman escorted Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian-born businessman made headlines internationally last
year in connection with archaeological treasures that Italian
authorities said had been stolen from a site in Sicily. Although a
judge in Italy said the objects had been taken illegally,
Tempelsman wasn't implicated in any criminal offense. The leader of
a gang of tomb robbers is in prison for looting the items.
</P>
<P>
   Tempelsman reportedly had paid a London art dealer $1 million in
1980 for the objects, which included two marble heads, three feet
and three hands from statues believed to have been created in 525
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Tempelsman is said to be resisting demands to return the works,
despite diplomatic contacts and appeals by the Italian government.
``It's as if an Italian collector had in his hands important
documents that belonged to George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson's
manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence,'' said Judge
Silvio Raffiotta in the Sicilian city of Enna.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the deepest known sea depth?
</P>
<P>
   A: A point in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific near
Guam holds the distinction. But sources disagree on its depth.
World Book Encyclopedia says 36,198 feet, while World Almanac says
35,840 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Jimmy Carter travels the world to monitor elections,
does the federal government pay his expenses? Also, does he take
anyone with him at government expense?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal government doesn't pay any travel expenses for
Carter or any members of the Carter Center staff, said Carrie
Harmon, center spokeswoman. As a former U.S. president, he is
accompanied by Secret Service agents, whose salaries and travel
expenses obviously are paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Carter monitors elections in countries moving toward democracy
as a representative of the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta. He
is the center's chairman, but takes no salary, Harmon said. The
center is supported through gifts from individuals, foundations and
corporations and receives no taxpayer dollars or government funds,
with the exception of U.S. Agency for International Development
grants. The center sometimes applies for such grants to support
work in developing countries, but they constitute a ``very small
part'' of the center's overall budget, Harmon added.
</P>
<P>
   As a point of interest, the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum
complex, adjacent to the Carter Center, is owned and operated by
the National Archives, like all other presidential libraries.
Carter personally raised the $28 million to build the library and
museum, Harmon said. He then donated the complex to the federal
government, which now operates it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles have mentioned the Sons of Confederate
Veterans. Since one of my ancestors fought for the Confederacy, I'd
like to join. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or call: International Headquarters, Sons of
Confederate Veterans, P.O. Box 59, Columbia, TN 38402-0059
(1-800-697-6884 or 1-800-693-4943). Online: www.scv.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Ted Kennedy's former wife, Joan? I saw no
mention of her in all the recent JFK Jr. coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A: While she generally stays out of the public eye, Joan Bennett
Kennedy was among those attending the July 23 memorial Mass for
John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and her sister at New York's
Church of St. Thomas More. Her appearance attracted little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mass, the ex-wife of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) _
they divorced in 1982 after 24 years of marriage _ had last been in
the news when she suffered a slight heart attack May 7. The episode
left no coronary damage, said her cardiologist, Dr. Marc Semigran,
but required six weeks of recuperation. Her son, Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.), has assured The Boston Globe that his mother was
``in perfect health.''

 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's a class-action suit against Providian
Financial for late-payment overcharges. How can interested parties
join the suit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The suit is being handled by San Francisco attorneys Girard &AMP;
Green. Call 415-981-4800 and ask to listen to a recorded message
about the suit. The message will ask callers to provide information
that will determine if they are class members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a recall notice from the manufacturer of my new
vehicle. When I experienced an unrelated problem, the dealer's
service technician told me a ``service alert notice'' had been
issued, and it would be corrected and covered under the warranty
when the recall work was done. How can the public gain access to
such ``service alert notices''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no central source, because service alerts and
voluntary recalls don't have the same urgency as
government-mandated recalls. In general, they're communicated to
dealers from manufacturers and are designed so that when the owner
of an affected vehicle comes in for any kind of service, that work
can be done at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Your best source for keeping up with mandated recalls, assuming
you don't own an affected vehicle (in which case you'll be notified
by the manufacturer), is online at this address _
www.consumerreports.org _ the Web site for Consumer Reports. Recall
information is organized by vehicle name and year, which makes for
easy checking. Another site _ www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ _ is maintained by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You enter into
a search engine the name, model and year of the vehicle you're
interested in, and if there's a recall, the information will be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you refresh my memory about the major points in
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' will?
</P>
<P>
   A: In court documents released in late 1996, the former first
lady's executors valued her estate at $43.7 million. That amount
fell well short of the estimates of $100 million or more in many
news reports after her death in 1994, according to the New York
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Onassis' will left her two children, the late John F. Kennedy
Jr. and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, valuable properties ranging
from a Martha's Vineyard retreat to stocks. It also gave them the
option of letting some or all of these properties pass to a
charitable trust, essentially a way for them to allow some of
Onassis' assets to pass to her grandchildren without paying estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The will also specified that Onassis' two children would get the
proceeds from an estate sale of her possessions, which was held in
April 1996. The auction added up to a four-day total of $34.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the estate went to charity. Previously published
reports said less than $500,000, for example, went to the John F.
Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has it been announced when Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' will
be out in paperback? I want to read it before NBC airs its
four-hour TV miniseries, but I don't want to haul around that big
hardback.
</P>
<P>
   A: The paperback version is due out in October. You'll have
plenty of time to tackle it, since the miniseries isn't scheduled
until perhaps November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: From 1996 to 1999, what increases were given each year to
Social Security beneficiaries?
</P>
<P>
   A: Social Security benefits are adjusted annually based on
inflation. Social Security Administration spokeswoman Cindy Husson
said the cost-of-living increase in 1996 was 2.9 percent; in 1997,
2.1 percent; and in 1998, 1.3 percent. Cost-of-living statistics
are released each December, so those for 1999 aren't yet available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite summer drink has been a Big K (Kroger brand) kiwi
strawberry cooler. Both the diet and regular versions include
glycerol ester of wood rosin among the ingredients. In fact,
there's more of that than kiwi and strawberry juice concentrate.
What is wood rosin, and why is a derivative in a soft drink? Should
I limit my intake?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ester of wood rosin, also known as ester gum, has been deemed
safe by the Food and Drug Administration, said Chris Rosenbloom,
professor at Georgia State University's nutrition department and a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. It's a food
additive used primarily in orange, lemon and other citrus soft
drinks to control the citrus oil so it won't rise to the top or
settle to the bottom. It also is used in chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   While ester of wood rosin is on the FDA's GRAS (generally
recognized as safe) list of food additives, Rosenbloom suggests
that you choose other soft drinks if you're concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a congressional committee is investigating
sweepstakes. Who is the committee chairman, and what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Sen. Susan
Collins (R-Maine) is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the panel heard witnesses give what was
called ``horror-tale'' testimony from people who believed they had
been misled by mailings about multimillion-dollar sweepstakes
prizes. Legislation proposed by Collins and Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) would require companies running sweepstakes to print
qualifying language offers in type as large as the offer itself;
permit Postal Service inspectors to impose nationwide bans on
bulk-mailing companies found to be involved in fraudulent
activities; and permit civil fines of up to $2 million for
companies involved in rip-offs.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact the committee at this address: Sen. Susan M.
Collins, 172 Russell Building, Washington, DC 20510; the phone
number is 202-224-2523.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it known what vitamins or mineral supplements Lance
Armstrong has been taking since his cancer surgery and chemotherapy
treatments?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winner of the Tour de France says he takes only vitamin C
and multi-vitamins. When asked to comment about reports in the
French press about ``deception with drugs,'' the American cyclist
told Sam Abt, a veteran reporter of 23 Tours and the author of
seven books on the race, that he was ``absolutely, emphatically not
doping.'' The bottom line, he added, is work: ``Sweat is the secret
of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had been treated with chemotherapy after surgery in
late 1996 for testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're having a dispute about the controversial Willie Horton
political ads back in 1988. Was it George Bush who brought up the
issue in his campaign against Michael Dukakis, or was it Al Gore in
his Democratic primary race against Dukakis?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue of prisoner furloughs first was used by Gore in the
Democratic primaries, several months before Dukakis' battle against
Bush. But the Willie Horton ads were especially linked to the
Bush's campaign against Dukakis. Bush had taken the offensive
immediately after the August Republican convention and hit Dukakis
as a liberal out of touch with American values. The Horton campaign
spot _ which told of a prisoner raping a woman while out on a
weekend release program that had been supported by Dukakis when he
was governor of Massachusetts _ was especially effective.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were financed by a political action committee
independent of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A listing of the Kennedy cousins in Time mentioned a Kym
Maria Smith. I've never read anything about her before. Who is she?
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith, 26, is the adopted Vietnamese-American daughter of
Jean Kennedy Smith, a younger sister of President Kennedy. In 1995,
Kym Maria Smith married Alfred Tucker, a pub and club manager in
Dublin, Ireland, whom she met during her frequent visits to her
mother when Jean Kennedy Smith was U.S. ambassador to Ireland. The
Dublin wedding made the news on both sides of the Atlantic, with a
cadre of the Kennedy clan attending, including Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who escorted the bride down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kym Maria Smith and her mother visited
Vietnam as tourists. The former ambassador said she wanted to go to
Vietnam to witness changes made in the country since reform
policies were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent mass murders around the country bring to mind the
Alday family murders in Georgia. What's the status of the four men
convicted in that case? Is Carl Isaacs still on death row?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Carl Isaacs remains on death row, said B.J. Blair of the
Georgia Department of Corrections. Four people were convicted in
the killings of six members of the Ned Alday family in Seminole
County near the Florida state line in May 1973. The Alday family
members had interrupted three Maryland prison escapees and a
juvenile who were burglarizing a mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four co-defendants, one was Billy Carroll Isaacs, brother
of Carl Isaacs. Billy Isaacs received a 40-year sentence for armed
robbery and burglary, of which he served 20 years. He was released
Feb. 18, 1993, and is believed to have moved to Maryland. He
received a ``lesser sentence'' because he testified against
everyone else, Blair said. He was 15 at the time of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The other two, Wayne Carl Coleman and George Dungee, are serving
life sentences at Georgia State Prison in Reidsville.

<P>
   Q: The so-called patients' bill of rights is much in the news.
Can you review the health perks U.S. senators and representatives
get, including what they pay in monthly premiums? What about
Cabinet officers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like any nonmilitary employee of the federal government,
members of Congress participate in the government-financed Federal
Employees Health Benefit Program. Pete Sepp of the National
Taxpayers Union said members of the Senate and House have a number
of options for coverage, based on such things as the number of
family members, and pay premiums of $100-$300 a month. For an
additional annual fee _ $290 for House members, $520 for senators _
they also have unlimited visits and treatment through the Capitol's
office of the attending physician. And they also can obtain free
medical treatment at either Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland or
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members also participate in the Federal Employees Health
Benefit Program and get the free use of services at Bethesda or
Walter Reed, Sepp said. But they don't have the use of the
attending physician at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg read a passage
from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' at the memorial Mass for her
brother, John F. Kennedy Jr. Do you know what it was? I have a copy
of the work and would like to find it.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's in Act IV, Scene 1, starting with Line 156, which begins
``Leave not a rack behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage Schlossberg read begins with these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are such stuff
</P>
<P>
   As dreams are made on, and our little life
</P>
<P>
   Is rounded with a sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the early history of the song ``Dixie.''
Who wrote it, and when was it first performed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources aren't in full agreement, but in general ``I Wish I
Was in Dixie,'' or ``Dixieland,'' is attributed to Daniel Decatur
Emmett (1815-1904) of Mount Vernon, Ohio. A member of a minstrel
troupe, Emmett made the song a hit when he and the troupe Dan
Bryant's Minstrels performed it in 1859 at Mechanics' Hall in New
York. It was a ``walk-around,'' a finale involving the entire
company of the performance that closed the show.
</P>
<P>
   Some sources say Emmett himself was black, while others say he
used makeup to darken his face in the then-current minstrel style.
Whether Emmett was the originator of ``Dixie'' also is in question.
Some sources say he may have learned it from a black family, the
Snowdens, who settled in Knox County, Ohio, in the early 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Although it became a battle hymn for Confederate troops, World
Book Encyclopedia reports that versions of ``Dixie'' were played
and sung by both Union and Confederate troops at the beginning of
the Civil War. After the Confederate Army surrendered in 1865,
President Abraham Lincoln asked a band at the White House to play
``Dixie,'' reclaiming it as a song for the entire nation. Even so,
it continues to be a symbol of Southern identity.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that a credit report from Equifax costs $8. I thought
people in certain states could get it for free. Can you clarify,
and do you have a phone number to obtain the report?
</P>
<P>
   A: Resident of six states (Georgia, Colorado, Massachusetts,
Vermont, Maryland and New Jersey) can get two free personal credit
reports a year at no charge from all three major credit bureaus.
The $8 charge applies to residents of states where legislation
doesn't require free reports, said Dave Mooney of Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   To receive the reports, call these numbers: Equifax,
1-800-685-1111; Experian, 1-888-397-3742; and TransUnion Corp.,
1-800-916-8800.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In World War II, soldiers who came home from Europe were
given something called ``the ruptured duck.'' Can you tell me
something about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to a small lapel pin which had an eagle on
it with its wings extending beyond the pin on each side. The
returning World War II veterans dubbed it ``ruptured duck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military has alternative
explanations, saying the term ``ruptured duck'' was slang for the
honorable discharge certificate and was so named because of the
flattened, two-dimensional eagle in the U.S. coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary's second explanation calls ruptured duck a
nickname for the basic insignia of an Army specialist or the rating
badge of the Navy's enlisted personnel, both of which incorporate a
flattened, two-dimensional spread-eagle design.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that the war over Kosovo had ended, will the Pentagon
finally reveal how that downed U.S. Stealth fighter pilot was shot
down over Yugoslavia, and his identity?
</P>
<P>
   A: As a matter of policy, the pilot will not be identified,
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Begines told Q&AMP;A. And the Pentagon
is continuing to investigate the reason for the loss in late March
of the F-117.
</P>
<P>
   Begines cited comments made in April by Air Force Brig. Gen.
Bruce Carlson at a Pentagon briefing in which he said the F-117
investigation is in its ``ongoing'' second phase. ``We have
eliminated an act of God and loss of consciousness by the pilot,''
Carlson told reporters, ``but we haven't determined the cause of
that loss.'' He also said mechanical failures had not been ruled
out.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hasn't issued any later updates, Begines said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to Friday, the dog that supposedly went
everywhere with John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy? If it was on the plane, was its body recovered?
</P>
<P>
   A: Friday wasn't on the plane. Neither was the couple's cat,
Rudy. They already were on Martha's Vineyard when the fatal crash
occurred. One report said the caretaker of Kennedy's 500-acre
estate there has been watching out for them since the fatal crash.
Another says they have been taken to Massachusetts and are being
cared for by the couple's relatives. There's talk, according to the
New York Daily News, that the pets will be taken in by Kennedy's
sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and her children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent TV program about Johnny Cash included the old song
by his brother, Tommy, ``Six White Horses Come to Take You Home.''
I've never heard anything about him since. Can you give me an
update?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tommy Cash continues to ``work the road and stay in the
limelight,'' in the words of booking agent Lynn Gray. He appeared
most recently in a salute to brother Johnny June 4-5 at the Ski
World Country Time Music Hall near Nashville, Ind. He also is
working on two projects, Gray said, a book about being the brother
of Johnny Cash and another album being produced in Europe. In
addition to ``Six White Horses'' _ his No. 1 single, in 1970 _
Tommy Cash had a string of Top 20 hits, including ``So This Is
Love.'' He and his band, the Tomcats, also made several albums,
including ``Tommy Cash Country'' in 1971, ``American Way of Life''
in 1972 and ``The 25th Anniversary Album'' in 1992. That was
followed by ``Tribute to a Princess'' after the death of Princess
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Cash has made numerous TV appearances, and he
often competes in pro-celebrity golf tournaments. He also has made
numerous personal appearances throughout Europe, as well as in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Maurice Tempelsman, friend of the late Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, was scarcely mentioned in news coverage of the deaths of
John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette.
What's up with him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The diamond merchant and longtime companion of Jackie O. was
glimpsed at the memorial Mass in New York for the victims of the
JFK Jr. airplane crash, but other than that, he avoids publicity.
He did, however, show up at a black-tie bash in February when
President Clinton hosted British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the
White House. Tempelsman escorted Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian-born businessman made headlines internationally last
year in connection with archaeological treasures that Italian
authorities said had been stolen from a site in Sicily. Although a
judge in Italy said the objects had been taken illegally,
Tempelsman wasn't implicated in any criminal offense. The leader of
a gang of tomb robbers is in prison for looting the items.
</P>
<P>
   Tempelsman reportedly had paid a London art dealer $1 million in
1980 for the objects, which included two marble heads, three feet
and three hands from statues believed to have been created in 525
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Tempelsman is said to be resisting demands to return the works,
despite diplomatic contacts and appeals by the Italian government.
``It's as if an Italian collector had in his hands important
documents that belonged to George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson's
manuscript copy of the Declaration of Independence,'' said Judge
Silvio Raffiotta in the Sicilian city of Enna.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the deepest known sea depth?
</P>
<P>
   A: A point in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific near
Guam holds the distinction. But sources disagree on its depth.
World Book Encyclopedia says 36,198 feet, while World Almanac says
35,840 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Jimmy Carter travels the world to monitor elections,
does the federal government pay his expenses? Also, does he take
anyone with him at government expense?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal government doesn't pay any travel expenses for
Carter or any members of the Carter Center staff, said Carrie
Harmon, center spokeswoman. As a former U.S. president, he is
accompanied by Secret Service agents, whose salaries and travel
expenses obviously are paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Carter monitors elections in countries moving toward democracy
as a representative of the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta. He
is the center's chairman, but takes no salary, Harmon said. The
center is supported through gifts from individuals, foundations and
corporations and receives no taxpayer dollars or government funds,
with the exception of U.S. Agency for International Development
grants. The center sometimes applies for such grants to support
work in developing countries, but they constitute a ``very small
part'' of the center's overall budget, Harmon added.
</P>
<P>
   As a point of interest, the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum
complex, adjacent to the Carter Center, is owned and operated by
the National Archives, like all other presidential libraries.
Carter personally raised the $28 million to build the library and
museum, Harmon said. He then donated the complex to the federal
government, which now operates it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent articles have mentioned the Sons of Confederate
Veterans. Since one of my ancestors fought for the Confederacy, I'd
like to join. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write or call: International Headquarters, Sons of
Confederate Veterans, P.O. Box 59, Columbia, TN 38402-0059
(1-800-697-6884 or 1-800-693-4943). Online: www.scv.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Ted Kennedy's former wife, Joan? I saw no
mention of her in all the recent JFK Jr. coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A: While she generally stays out of the public eye, Joan Bennett
Kennedy was among those attending the July 23 memorial Mass for
John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and her sister at New York's
Church of St. Thomas More. Her appearance attracted little
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mass, the ex-wife of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) _
they divorced in 1982 after 24 years of marriage _ had last been in
the news when she suffered a slight heart attack May 7. The episode
left no coronary damage, said her cardiologist, Dr. Marc Semigran,
but required six weeks of recuperation. Her son, Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.), has assured The Boston Globe that his mother was
``in perfect health.''

<P>
   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>

   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

   Suppose you could reset the inner clocks that run your life _
programming yourself to wake up fresh and alert at 5:30 a.m. if you
had to make a crucial breakfast meeting, or shutting off the hunger
that drives you to scarf a bag of tortilla chips every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the prospect of controlling your body's chronometers seems a
pleasing luxury, consider the case of Jason K., a New Jersey
attorney. Jason suffers from a debilitating malfunction of his
biological clock called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. It may
seem a remote or even a fanciful ailment, especially during the
summer, when its effects ebb, but it can throw a person's life into
terrible turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came up on me gradually,'' Jason says. As the days got
darker going into fall and then winter, ``My mood got darker. By
winter it took dramatically more effort to get anything done. And I
developed an excessive craving for sweets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hits, it's not just a matter of mood,'' says Michael
Terman, a clinical psychologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical
Center's New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City, and
a leading SAD researcher. ``It can be truly disabling for five
months of the year, and it can cause an active social withdrawal _
mothers who can't mother, a loss of interest in work, a total loss
of libido.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the syndrome is only one among a constellation of sleep
disorders and related ills caused by biological clocks run amok.
Indeed, inner clocks can sometimes cause trouble even when they're
ticking away smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The bleary-eyed miseries of jet lag are a familiar example of
what can happen when you're hurled across time zones and your
personal clock jolts out of sync with the pace of the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Folklore and common sense have been telling us for centuries
that we depend on inner clocks, but what and where they are and how
they work has long remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to a series of recent laboratory coups, the
once-baffling components of our biological clocks have become
clearer. For the first time, scientists have a diagram that shows
where in our brains the chronometer is, how it uses the machinery
in our cells as clockwork, and how it can be slowed down, speeded
up or reset.
</P>
<P>
   In the brain, a recently discovered cluster of nerve cells
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN, appears to be at the
heart of timekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The SCN is actually a pair of structures, like most parts of the
brain. One half sits in the left hemisphere and one in the right,
just behind and a bit below the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each is made up of about 10,000 densely packed neurons,''
explains Steven Reppert, the Harvard neurobiologist whose
laboratory has been a key player in recent discoveries. ``The SCNs
are located just above where your optic nerves come together at the
base of the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no accident: the SCN depends on light for what
circadian-clock mavens call entrainment _ synchronizing the inner
clock with the cycles of light and darkness in the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research, on mice, suggests that mammals have
a set of special photoreceptors in their eyes, which pick up light
signals and carry them directly to the SCN.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of light striking the right photoreceptors at the right
time does just what the knobs on the back of that vintage Baby Ben
do: reset the hands of the clock.
</P>
<P>
   A burst of light in the morning sets the clock ahead; a burst in
the evening puts it backward. If, like Jason, you're a northerner,
your inner clock may run slow in winter, falling behind without
early-morning light that would normally nudge it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has the problem. Most people aren't vulnerable to a
lack of morning light, which helps keep the inner clock in tune
with the external environment. Every morning, the light of dawn
makes its way to the SCN and advances the inner clock, allowing it
to catch up with local time, rousing and easing us into daytime
activity in blissful synchrony with local time.
</P>
<P>
   And because the nerve pathway from the eyes into the SCN
bypasses those parts of the brain that register conscious sight,
the inner clock can react to ambient light even when we're sound
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The light of dawn penetrates the eyelids, registers on the
retina and relays a silent signal into the SCN. If the internal
clock has a tendency to run slow, morning light automatically
shifts it ahead, putting it back in step with the world outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's beautifully simple _ unless you live far enough above the
equator so that in winter you're up, breakfasted and at work before
dawn. In fact, SAD seems to be more common in northern latitudes.
When natural light is scarce, the best way to reset the inner clock
is with a burst of artificial light.
</P>
<P>
   Although we're still uncertain how a malfunctioning biological
clock affects behavior, or how it can lead to debilitating cycles
of gloom and anguish, Reppert's team has just published a paper
suggesting an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They established a connection between the individual nerve cells
whose microscopic inner machinery drives the SCN mechanism, and the
manufacture of hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The same proteins that operate over a 24-hour cycle to run the
circadian clock directly cause an oscillation in the release of a
hormone _ vasopressin _ that can regulate how animals act.
</P>
<P>
   That is only a beginning. Vasopressin is just one of a vast
range of substances that regulate behavior. Cellular clocks haven't
yet been directly linked to the cycling of familiar behavior- and
mood-modulating substances like serotonin and melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take another decade to work out a connection
between Reppert's work and therapeutics,'' Terman predicts. But it
isn't hard to foresee how visionary circadian-clock therapies might
work.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, a couple are already in place. Jet lag, for
example, might respond favorably to melatonin, at least for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also an effective treatment for SAD. In 1980, Alfred
Lewy, at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Sleep and Mood
Disorders Laboratory, successfully relieved a man who suffered from
recurrent winter depression simply by exposing him to bright light
over several days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, standard therapy for SAD patients involves exposure to
artificial light for 30 minutes each morning at an intensity of
10,000 lux (which approximates the strength of natural light about
40 minutes after sunrise).
</P>
<P>
   Terman's group has been working on refining the treatment: a
computerized light system for the bedroom, imitating the gradual,
naturally intensifying light of dawn. Jason tried it and it worked
beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a couple of hours it simulates the sun coming up,'' he
says. ``Somehow you're aware of it even when you're asleep: The
light coming through your eyelids is a luxurious feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Jason's depression dissipated, his sleep habits
returned to normal, and the sweet tooth cravings became somewhat
less pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities raised by the discoveries on the workings of
the biological clock go beyond moodiness and depression. For
example, is there a way to control weight by spacing out the timing
of hunger pangs? For the first time, science knows where and how to
look for the answer to such a question.

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of
the scalpel, he opened an 8-inch incision. He nipped away bone
until the pale, tough, glistening sheath around the spinal cord
could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the wedge of bone can be dangerous. If the bone-cutting
instrument strayed too close to the spinal cord, it might damage
nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of chipping and probing, Feingold decided that
enough bone had been removed. He grasped the halo and firmly tipped
Leonard's head upright. A slight cracking sound and a muffled
murmur of protest were heard from under the drape.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon held the halo firmly while the anesthesiologist
asked Leonard to move his hands and feet. We sewed up the incision,
dressed the wound and removed the drapes. The orthopedic technician
then slipped a pink plastic vest over Leonard's shoulders and
attached the halo to it with bars and clamps.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Feingold checked the patient's grip, foot and
ankle movement, and sensation over face, neck and limbs. All
appeared to be in order.
</P>
<P>
   After rounds the team dispersed. I was at the nurses' station,
when one of the nurses came up to me. ``Mr. Leonard says there's
been something wrong with his eyes since surgery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was resting when I entered the room. He opened his eyes
and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your nurse tells me you're having trouble seeing things. Is
your vision blurred?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Follow my finger with your eyes,'' I instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your what?'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   The hair on my scalp nearly stood on end.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, an ophthalmologist, a neurosurgeon and
a neuroophthalmologist answered my call and examined Leonard. The
problem wasn't in his eyes. Instead, the part of the brain that
processes input from the eyes had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard could see, but he couldn't understand or recognize what
he was seeing. He had suffered a stroke in the visual cortex, which
lies close to the base of the brain. But what happened?
</P>
<P>
   My consultants agreed that it was important to examine brain
circulation. If there was a blockage, it needed to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's arteriogram, which traced blood flow in the brain,
showed a normal pattern. There was no hint of lumpy plaques on the
vessel walls, so a clot was unlikely. An artery had probably
squeezed shut briefly, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and
nutrients long enough to do damage. But how much damage?
</P>
<P>
   Dead neurons cannot be revived, but injured neurons surrounding
a patch of dead ones can sometimes recover. Increasing the supply
of oxygen and nutrients, decreasing metabolism and suppressing
inflammation with strong medications may have a role in the early
treatment of brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital across town had a hyperbaric chamber, which provides
higher-than-atmospheric pressures and is typically used to treat
decompression illness in divers. The chief of surgery there
directed research testing its effectiveness for other conditions,
including stroke and brain injury. Our neurosurgeon recommended
that we send Leonard over by ambulance and ``dive'' him on 100
percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after Leonard's second 60-minute hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, he became less confused about what he was seeing. His
vision rapidly returned to its previous level. When he was
discharged a few days later, his vision was normal.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve weeks later, X-rays showed that Leonard's bone had healed
nicely. Feingold said it was time to remove the halo.
</P>
<P>
   That day Leonard left wearing a plastic neck brace for added
support, but within a few weeks his healed bone needed no further
protection. Later, I heard he had resumed all his former
activities. His spine was now in a better position than before the
accident.

<P>
   When Mr. Leonard was admitted to the hospital, his spine was
curved so far forward that when he sat, all I could see was the top
of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ankylosing spondylitis, the condition that had brought him to
this state, sometimes leaves its victims unable to eat or speak
normally. In these patients, the stiffly flexed spine pins the chin
and lower jaw firmly against the breastbone. The condition, a kind
of arthritis that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, starts
in young adulthood. But when the inflammation has passed, the
joints stiffen permanently, and the ligaments calcify and turn to
bone. The spine becomes a single bone from skull to pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   If the condition is diagnosed early, the patient can do
exercises to keep the spine upright. Exercises can't keep the
joints from stiffening, but they can keep the spine from curving
forward severely.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's stoop was diagnosed in his mid-40s, when an internist
spotted the segmented ``bamboo'' spine typical of ankylosing
spondylitis on a chest X-ray. It was too late, however, to alter
the deformity with exercises or bracing. Still, Leonard was doing
well. He was married, worked as a draftsman and hiked on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   A rear-end collision a year ago changed all that. The impact
thrust his brittle spine forward, fracturing several vertebrae and
making the forward curve in his spine much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was admitted to the spine center at the University of
Minnesota Hospital where I was doing my residency in orthopedic
surgery. My professor, John Feingold, planned to cut into bone at
the base of his neck. By removing a wedge of spinal bone, we could
swing Leonard's neck and head into an upright position. To heal
solidly, his spine would have to be held securely in this position
for two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   I examined Leonard and prepared him for his operation the next
morning. I needed to apply the halo that would hold his head in
place after the operation. This device, a metal ring encircling the
head just above the eyebrows, is fastened to the skull with pins.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Leonard was seated at the operating table, his
forehead and halo resting comfortably on pillows. He was sedated
but alert enough to tell us if we hit a nerve.

   Feingold injected a local anesthetic. With a single stroke of

nerve tissue or injure arteries that run to the brain.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's a class-action suit against Providian
Financial for late-payment overcharges. How can interested parties
join the suit?
</P>
<P>
   A: The suit is being handled by San Francisco attorneys Girard &AMP;
Green. Call 415-981-4800 and ask to listen to a recorded message
about the suit. The message will ask callers to provide information
that will determine if they are class members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a recall notice from the manufacturer of my new
vehicle. When I experienced an unrelated problem, the dealer's
service technician told me a ``service alert notice'' had been
issued, and it would be corrected and covered under the warranty
when the recall work was done. How can the public gain access to
such ``service alert notices''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no central source, because service alerts and
voluntary recalls don't have the same urgency as
government-mandated recalls. In general, they're communicated to
dealers from manufacturers and are designed so that when the owner
of an affected vehicle comes in for any kind of service, that work
can be done at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Your best source for keeping up with mandated recalls, assuming
you don't own an affected vehicle (in which case you'll be notified
by the manufacturer), is online at this address _
www.consumerreports.org _ the Web site for Consumer Reports. Recall
information is organized by vehicle name and year, which makes for
easy checking. Another site _ www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ _ is maintained by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. You enter into
a search engine the name, model and year of the vehicle you're
interested in, and if there's a recall, the information will be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you refresh my memory about the major points in
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' will?
</P>
<P>
   A: In court documents released in late 1996, the former first
lady's executors valued her estate at $43.7 million. That amount
fell well short of the estimates of $100 million or more in many
news reports after her death in 1994, according to the New York
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Onassis' will left her two children, the late John F. Kennedy
Jr. and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, valuable properties ranging
from a Martha's Vineyard retreat to stocks. It also gave them the
option of letting some or all of these properties pass to a
charitable trust, essentially a way for them to allow some of
Onassis' assets to pass to her grandchildren without paying estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The will also specified that Onassis' two children would get the
proceeds from an estate sale of her possessions, which was held in
April 1996. The auction added up to a four-day total of $34.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the estate went to charity. Previously published
reports said less than $500,000, for example, went to the John F.
Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has it been announced when Tom Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'' will
be out in paperback? I want to read it before NBC airs its
four-hour TV miniseries, but I don't want to haul around that big
hardback.
</P>
<P>
   A: The paperback version is due out in October. You'll have
plenty of time to tackle it, since the miniseries isn't scheduled
until perhaps November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: From 1996 to 1999, what increases were given each year to
Social Security beneficiaries?
</P>
<P>
   A: Social Security benefits are adjusted annually based on
inflation. Social Security Administration spokeswoman Cindy Husson
said the cost-of-living increase in 1996 was 2.9 percent; in 1997,
2.1 percent; and in 1998, 1.3 percent. Cost-of-living statistics
are released each December, so those for 1999 aren't yet available.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My favorite summer drink has been a Big K (Kroger brand) kiwi
strawberry cooler. Both the diet and regular versions include
glycerol ester of wood rosin among the ingredients. In fact,
there's more of that than kiwi and strawberry juice concentrate.
What is wood rosin, and why is a derivative in a soft drink? Should
I limit my intake?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ester of wood rosin, also known as ester gum, has been deemed
safe by the Food and Drug Administration, said Chris Rosenbloom,
professor at Georgia State University's nutrition department and a
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. It's a food
additive used primarily in orange, lemon and other citrus soft
drinks to control the citrus oil so it won't rise to the top or
settle to the bottom. It also is used in chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   While ester of wood rosin is on the FDA's GRAS (generally
recognized as safe) list of food additives, Rosenbloom suggests
that you choose other soft drinks if you're concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a congressional committee is investigating
sweepstakes. Who is the committee chairman, and what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Sen. Susan
Collins (R-Maine) is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the panel heard witnesses give what was
called ``horror-tale'' testimony from people who believed they had
been misled by mailings about multimillion-dollar sweepstakes
prizes. Legislation proposed by Collins and Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.) would require companies running sweepstakes to print
qualifying language offers in type as large as the offer itself;
permit Postal Service inspectors to impose nationwide bans on
bulk-mailing companies found to be involved in fraudulent
activities; and permit civil fines of up to $2 million for
companies involved in rip-offs.
</P>
<P>
   You can contact the committee at this address: Sen. Susan M.
Collins, 172 Russell Building, Washington, DC 20510; the phone
number is 202-224-2523.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it known what vitamins or mineral supplements Lance
Armstrong has been taking since his cancer surgery and chemotherapy
treatments?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winner of the Tour de France says he takes only vitamin C
and multi-vitamins. When asked to comment about reports in the
French press about ``deception with drugs,'' the American cyclist
told Sam Abt, a veteran reporter of 23 Tours and the author of
seven books on the race, that he was ``absolutely, emphatically not
doping.'' The bottom line, he added, is work: ``Sweat is the secret
of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had been treated with chemotherapy after surgery in
late 1996 for testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're having a dispute about the controversial Willie Horton
political ads back in 1988. Was it George Bush who brought up the
issue in his campaign against Michael Dukakis, or was it Al Gore in
his Democratic primary race against Dukakis?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue of prisoner furloughs first was used by Gore in the
Democratic primaries, several months before Dukakis' battle against
Bush. But the Willie Horton ads were especially linked to the
Bush's campaign against Dukakis. Bush had taken the offensive
immediately after the August Republican convention and hit Dukakis
as a liberal out of touch with American values. The Horton campaign
spot _ which told of a prisoner raping a woman while out on a
weekend release program that had been supported by Dukakis when he
was governor of Massachusetts _ was especially effective.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were financed by a political action committee
independent of Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A listing of the Kennedy cousins in Time mentioned a Kym
Maria Smith. I've never read anything about her before. Who is she?
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith, 26, is the adopted Vietnamese-American daughter of
Jean Kennedy Smith, a younger sister of President Kennedy. In 1995,
Kym Maria Smith married Alfred Tucker, a pub and club manager in
Dublin, Ireland, whom she met during her frequent visits to her
mother when Jean Kennedy Smith was U.S. ambassador to Ireland. The
Dublin wedding made the news on both sides of the Atlantic, with a
cadre of the Kennedy clan attending, including Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who escorted the bride down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kym Maria Smith and her mother visited
Vietnam as tourists. The former ambassador said she wanted to go to
Vietnam to witness changes made in the country since reform
policies were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recent mass murders around the country bring to mind the
Alday family murders in Georgia. What's the status of the four men
convicted in that case? Is Carl Isaacs still on death row?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Carl Isaacs remains on death row, said B.J. Blair of the
Georgia Department of Corrections. Four people were convicted in
the killings of six members of the Ned Alday family in Seminole
County near the Florida state line in May 1973. The Alday family
members had interrupted three Maryland prison escapees and a
juvenile who were burglarizing a mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four co-defendants, one was Billy Carroll Isaacs, brother
of Carl Isaacs. Billy Isaacs received a 40-year sentence for armed
robbery and burglary, of which he served 20 years. He was released
Feb. 18, 1993, and is believed to have moved to Maryland. He
received a ``lesser sentence'' because he testified against
everyone else, Blair said. He was 15 at the time of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The other two, Wayne Carl Coleman and George Dungee, are serving
life sentences at Georgia State Prison in Reidsville.

 &HT;    Experts say to create a food stash, come a Y2K crisis or not
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some people are building shelter in rural
hideaways. Closer to home, some are hoarding silver dollars. Others
are stocking basement shelves with bottled water. A few are
building up a monthlong supply of food, much the way people who
built bomb shelters did in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   What if the doomsayers are right, that we will wake up Jan. 1
and find that thanks to the ultimate computer glitch there's no
heat or light, no gas for the stove, maybe no water to run in the
sink, or some variation of all of the above? What should you be
storing, and how?
</P>
<P>
   Without suggesting that any of these things will happen, or that
you should be stockpiling anything, consider preparation for
possible millennium crises this way:
</P>
<P>
   It's an opportunity to do what you should have done all along _
create and maintain an emergency survival kit, a cache of
essentials that might be necessary when a bad storm hits. Turn a
shelf in the basement or laundry room into a little stash of
necessities that will make staying at home easier when storms bring
down trees and wires. Then you won't have to run to the store each
time the television weathermen sound their alarms.
</P>
<P>
   That is the current advice from such agencies as the American
Red Cross and the Ohio State University Extension, which are both
fielding calls about Y2K preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of an emergency kit they recommend won't get the family
through Armageddon, but it might help survive the more temporary
disasters, such as earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   That means flashlights and a transistor radio and extra
batteries, of course. Maybe a kerosene heater and fuel. And of
course some food and water.
</P>
<P>
   But what and how much? That probably depends on how pessimistic
you are. Emergency experts _ who tend to focus on natural disasters
such as tornadoes and hurricanes _ suggest keeping a reserve of
food and water that would last three to seven days, depending on
whom you talk to. Some even say two weeks' worth.
</P>
<P>
   Water is at the top of their list of essentials. Store one
gallon per person per day for drinking, food preparation and
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Macias, spokesman for the Dayton chapter of the Red Cross,
says he'll buy a case of gallon jugs of water _ to have on hand
``just in case.'' But you don't have to buy water; tap water can
also be stored in thoroughly washed 2-liter plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the food list consists of nonperishable items that
can be eaten as is or minimally heated, purchased in small
quantities that won't produce leftovers that have to be stored. A
supply of sterno _ canned fuel _ allows food to be heated in
old-fashioned chafing dishes and fondue pots, or over a simple
fold-up camp stove. Those who are really bent on cooking can buy
propane or gas-fired camp stoves, priced around $40, but they must
be used outside.
</P>
<P>
   Purchases can be staggered over the next five months, and it's
not a bad idea to take advantage of sales. Store the accumulation
away from the kitchen, lest you tap into the stash on rainy, lazy
days.
</P>
<P>
   First make a shopping list, using our checklist as a guide. High
on every list is America's favorite fish _ canned tuna.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to stock only foods that you might be happy to eat in
the year 2000 _ just in case you wake up New Year's day and find
the new century breezing right along, without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case the scenario is a little more bleak, don't
forget the cat food _ unless you want to share the tuna.
</P>

 &HT;    'Good Bounces' great reading
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I can say without fear of being rebuked that
there was no great call for a book by a television golf announcer.
I can also say, having just finished Ben Wright's book, ``Good
Bounces &AMP; Bad Lies,'' that there should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to hit the shelves next week, ``Good Bounces'' is a
retrospective on Wright's long career as a golf writer and
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let that fool you. For the thousands out there who
think golf is the dullest sport ever created, be advised that
announcing golf isn't, at least announcing as it was practiced at
CBS under the heavy hand of legendary director Frank Chirkinian,
aka ``The Ayatollah.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright pulls up the curtain on CBS' announcing crew _ in the
booth, in the bar and in the bedroom. ``Good Bounces'' is Ball Four
with balata instead of horsehide.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, an Englishman, is probably best known for losing his job
over a series of comments in 1995 about the LPGA Tour and,
ultimately, the female writer who quoted him. That episode garners
only 12 pages late in the book. When I asked him about both the
length and placement of it in an interview last week, he had the
perfect answer: ``That's all it was worth. It's been blown out of
all proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree. As I wrote at the time, Wright's remarks on the LPGA
were undeniable. Asked why the women's tour doesn't get as many TV
dates as the men's tour, Wright said, ``. . .some corporate
sponsors shy away from the LPGA because of the lesbian element,
which makes them uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. media, which often reacts to sexual references as if we
were all 12-year-olds, quickly turned this factual comment into a
litmus test for political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Wright repeated some thoughtless gossip about the
writer, and CBS, which had mishandled the affair from the start,
fired him. We are the poorer for it, as Wright was one of the more
literate of golf's burgeoning brigade of whisperers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the book reads like a John Jakes' novel as Wright
travels through the last half-century, happening across Ernest
Hemingway, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Bing Crosby, Margaret
Thatcher, George Bush, and, eventually, the Betty Ford Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His stories are never dull, from when he and his younger sister
were trapped in the basement of a three-floor townhouse reduced to
rubble by a German bombing raid in World War II through all the
great golfers as the game came of age in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
   His memories of the nightly parties that went on after
broadcasts _ ``silly stories,'' he calls them _ will leave you with
new perspectives on Pat Summerall, Jack Whitaker and the rest of
the many men who have tramped through CBS' booths.
</P>
<P>
   He fillets Vin Scully, Steve Melnyk and Brent Musburger, among
others, and has a priceless story on Rick Barry's ill-fated attempt
to enter the field. The chapter on his arch-nemesis, Gary McCord,
is the stuff of celebrity roasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``this is very much tamer than the
original. I started full of bitterness. But it suddenly dawned on
me one day that I'd had a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he used his 93-year-old mother as a measuring stick of
what to leave in and what to exise. If she wouldn't be embarrassed,
it stayed. Some other mothers might be embarrassed, however. Some
other men, too _ Tom Weiskopf immediately pops into my head.
</P>
<P>
   If you have time to read only one sports book this year, ``Good
Bounces'' is the one.

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When my editor asked me
to join last week's caravan of Saturn owners to the company's
second ``Homecoming'' at the plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., I balked.
``Saturn owners are pod people,'' I objected. ``When you step into
the showroom, they shove brain-sucking parasites into your ear that
destroy your will and make you buy the deluxe wheel covers.''
``That's just a myth,'' my boss frowned. ``We want you to drive to
Tennessee with Saturn enthusiasts and explode the myth of a Saturn
cult.'' I brightened to recall that the Saturn homecoming included
a Hootie and the Blowfish concert, games, a barbecue and a plant
tour. ``On second thought,'' my editor said, ``Gainesville is far
enough.'' (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Next week, David Ponitz heads to
Malaysia, serving as keynote speaker for a conference that will be
attended by ministers of education and educators from nearly a
dozen countries. Meanwhile, the Dayton Board of Education is
offering James Williams a $225,000 lump-sum payment to terminate
his contract, while not taking up Ponitz' offer to work with them _
for free. While educators all over the world are seeking the
counsel of the former Sinclair Community College president, the
Dayton school board, apparently, isn't interested, at least for the
time being. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION: Ohio editors.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Sure, President Clinton lies,
cheats and chases skirts. These are sins, and in some cases crimes,
but they are not his fault. His mama made him do it. Not just his
mama, mind you. But his mama and his na-na combined to deeply scar
the Arkansas boy to the point that the abused child grew up to be a
serial philanderer and an irrepressible liar. This is the First
Lady's latest excuse for her husband's misconduct. (Nethaway, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ On Saturday night, I watched 100
women dressed in white clothing perform a goofy show on a bridge in
Austin. The women rose out of their chairs and made gnarly faces,
like they were chapped about something. They hopped around and made
hooting noises. They recited poetry in unison, such as, ``I
believe. We are believing. Light. Light. Light.'' I envision a
tasteful yet understated male counterpoint to the women's
extravaganza. If the chicks can shut down Congress Avenue on a
Saturday night to make their feminist statement, why can't we guys
shut it down to knock back a few cold ones and scratch our butts?
Fair is fair. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jerene Metzger knows why
she works in day care. She loves the kids. Before a new owner
bought the center that Metzger runs, turnover was ridiculous.
``Somebody would work a month and quit. Some people worked a day.''
There was no health insurance, no paid days off. Now, though,
Metzger's in a situation that's pretty rare in the day-care
industry. She can give her workers benefits and bonuses. People who
work 10 days without missing get an extra $80 in their paychecks.
It is a significant success story in our nation's horrid day-care
situation. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ I have a performance art dream.
</P>
<P>
   If 100 women can get the Congress Avenue bridge in Austin closed
for four hours to put on a spoken word and dance artwork, why can't
100 guys do the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, I watched 100 women dressed in white clothing
perform a goofy show on the bridge. It was called The Bridge. The
women, sitting in rows of folding chairs, rose out of their chairs
and made gnarly faces, like they were chapped about something. They
hopped around and made hooting noises. They recited poetry in
unison, such as, ``I believe. We are believing. Light. Light.
Light.''
</P>
<P>
   I envision a tasteful yet understated male counterpoint to the
women's extravaganza. My performance art show would involve 100 men
reclining in Barcaloungers (La-Z-Boys,whatever, the chair of your
choice) in rows on the same bridge, watching football on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of The Bridge, our performance would be called The
Remote. Like the babes, we would have the dance. Every so often, we
dudes would rise from our chairs and give each other high fives.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, we'd have poetry, too. Instead of, ``We are believing.
Light. Light. Light,'' we men would say, ``I believe I'll have
another beer. Bud Light.'' And if we got lost on the way to the
show, we would not stop to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
   The women's show featured a small ensemble called the Walter
Thompson Orchestra playing dissonant music that would wake up road
kill. For our show, I'm hoping we can get Hank Williams Jr. to come
and sing the phrase, ``Are -- ou -- eady for -- ome -- ootball?''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, don't laugh. I want equal time. If the chicks can shut down
Congress Avenue on a Saturday night to make their feminist
statement, why can't we guys shut it down to knock back a few cold
ones and scratch our butts? Fair is fair. I have even spoken to my
wife, Sally, about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not taking that chair out of this house,'' she said.
OK, so I'll go to a used furniture store.
</P>
<P>
   This will require some work on my part _ and yours, too, if you
share my dream. Guys, if you want to make this happen, please
e-mail me at the address listed at the bottom of this column. Much
work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   I have gone to the City of Austin and picked up the form we need
to get the bridge closed for an event.
</P>
<P>
   To close an arterial or collector street for an event, you have
to pay a $250 application fee. If applicable, you have to pay a $33
sound permit fee. There's a $76 safety inspection fee. (Is somebody
from the city going to check our Barcaloungers to see if they are
street-ready?) There is a $100 per block permit fee and a
refundable $2,000 security deposit. Maybe we can get some wealthy
corporation such as Dell to fund this, or perhaps we can score a
federal arts grant.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, this really is art. One hundred guys camped in easy
chairs, with remote controls, talking to their inner child while
taking part in synchronized channel surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my male buddies are excited about this, because there is
much angst among us guys, too, that needs to be addressed. ``One
time I had to get my own beer,'' a friend of mine lamented. Oh, my
God.

   WARSAW _ Under communism, the people of Poland had their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Out from under communism, the people still have problems.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is ... well, everything's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago it was a very clear situation,'' said Krzysztof
Varga, 31, a political editor at Warsaw's prestigious newspaper,
Gazeta. ``We were good, they were bad. It was very simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course now it is more complex. Now we have capitalism, and
you must think about money. Under communism, it was not
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the reality of life in present-day Poland. It's what
Varga uses for his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, he has cranked out three novels and a novella writing
about ``young people getting older, having to think about a job and
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill'' comes to Warsaw, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write about people I know, about my friends,'' said Varga, a
sandy blond with the pleasant countenance of a Robert Downey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight or nine years ago, we were a group of friends, 10 of us,
and now some of them have good jobs, but now they have no time.
They have a wife, and they are thinking about a new car and a new
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some of us have no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we can spend time together drinking beer, there
is border between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the New Polish People, they are the yuppies. This is
a new culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Varga hasn't made a lot of money. He says his books earn ``some
money, but not big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no car. I have a bike. But it is a very good bike.''
</P>
<P>
   What he dreams of is having a nice apartment of his own. Single,
he is living in a friend's place while his friend is living with a
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need money. I need money to live. I need money in the future
to buy an apartment,'' Varga said. ``But, no, it's not the most
important thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What is important to him is ``to live life.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, he says, his life is being taken up by his job as a
political editor.
</P>
<P>
   It was politics his friends used to be concerned with. Now they
worry about getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He was never interested in politics. Now he has to be. Now it's
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Varga, as a university student majoring in Polish literature and
culture, was always into music and books. It was what got him into
trouble with the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a member of the anti-Communist student
organizations. But yes, I was arrested when I was 19. It was
because I was a punk rocker. They held me only a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading books and listening to music are still what he cares
most about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need more time. Now I have no time _ time for reading, time
for journeys, time for skiing and biking, and time for writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I write only on Saturdays. I have a few hours sometimes on
Saturdays. The rest of the week I have to be at my job in front of
a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, he likes his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to stay here. I like the newspaper. I like working
here. I can't imagine myself, for example, at a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and then added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine myself being a yuppie.''
</P>
<P>
   Just give him time.

OBSCENE INTERNET ADDRESSES GRAB CONGRESS' ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Congressional hearing called to examine
intellectual-property and trademark issues on the Internet became
sidetracked Wednesday by questions about who was responsible for a
new flurry of obscene Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing by the House Commerce Committee's intellectual
property subcommittee brought together officials from the Commerce
Department and Network Solutions, a private government contractor
in Herndon, Va., that for years has held a monopoly on registering
Internet addresses, known as domain names, ending in .com, .net and
.org.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has a long-standing policy against
objectionable or vulgar names. But this spring, the Commerce
Department authorized five other companies to begin competing in
the registration process. And Network Solutions, which continues to
administer the system, decided not to impose its rules on the new
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has resulted in a rush of new domain name
registrations using obscene words.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, said the episode raised concerns
about the Commerce Department's ability ``to oversee how this
process should go forward and how well it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions said its decision was made after conversations
with the Commerce Department, which it said was aware of the
implications.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said it had discussed the matter with
the company only after Network Solutions asked if it would object
to the company's position of not censoring the new registrars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had, that would have raised serious First Amendment
questions,'' said Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department official
who is overseeing transition of administration of the Internet from
government contractors to a new, international group, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer that there not be dirty words on the
Internet,'' Burr said after the hearing. ``But for the U.S.
government to be involved in that decision would raise serious
constitutional questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Burr was clearly frustrated by the repeated focus on the issue
during the hearing, which was called to explore questions like
``cybersquatting,'' in which company names or other valuable words
are registered as Internet addresses and then resold for vast sums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we have bigger fish to fry,'' she said in reference
to a protracted stalemate with Network Solutions on the terms for
opening its business to full-scale competition.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock, on key issues like the rights to the vast database
the company has compiled on the ownership of more than 5 million
Internet addresses, has delayed plans for introducing competition.

XEROX DUSTS OFF ITS USED COPIERS  
 THE NAME GAME AT HEWLETT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp. is not satisfied with just being the world's biggest
seller of new copiers. Now it is using warehouse sales and Internet
auctions to attack the $1 billion-plus market for used copiers, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   More is at stake than added revenue. While Xerox dominates the
corporate market, it has never had more than a toehold among small
businesses, the prime customers for used machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want that segment of the market to see that Xerox has
affordable options for them,'' said Andrei Hall, vice president for
Xerox's nine-month-old Certified Pre-Owned Business Unit.
</P>
<P>
   More important, it wants those companies to think of Xerox when
they can afford more. Xerox's research shows that one of every four
small businesses buying a used copier is buying its first copier.
If that copier is a Xerox, its next purchase might be an expensive
Xerox digital copier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more small businesses out there than large
corporations, and they are the ones that are growing and hiring,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's group has already trucked refurbished copiers to 40
cities, where it held two-day sales in rented hotel or showroom
spaces. He insists he has not trucked unsold equipment away, and
plans to hold at least 60 more such sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Xerox began selling used equipment on www.xerox.com,
its Web site. In July, its lower-priced used equipment began
appearing on two auction sites, www.ubid.com and www.onsale.com.
Today, Xerox and Ubid Inc. will formally announce their alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warehouse sales just hit a few cities, but the Internet
can help us reach people all over the U.S.,'' Hall said.

   Spinoff Is Christened With Care by Hewlett
</P>
<P>
   What takes four months of secretive work and requires the brain
power of dozens of highly paid professionals? The answer: coining
the word ``Agilent,'' the name adopted last week by a
Hewlett-Packard corporate spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Barnholt, chief executive of the new company, announced
the name at a news briefing after a meeting with several hundred
employees and a live video feed to the roughly 43,000 others who
will be joining Agilent. Employees, Barnholt said, gave the new
name a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because they were expecting something else, such
as any of the several dozen possible names that Hewlett officials
had sought trademarks for with the help of Landor Associates, a San
Francisco-based corporate-naming division of Young &AMP; Rubicam that
Hewlett hired in March. Among those names were Tessant, an amalgam
of ``test'' and ``measurement,'' the company's primary activities
as a maker of test and measurement equipment. Or perhaps they were
just happy to have a name, having toiled for four months as
``Newco.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming up with Agilent Technologies, Hewlett and Landor
followed what appears to be a time-worn practice in high technology
of combining an adjective, or part of one, with the letters
``ent.'' David Redhill, an executive director at Landor, insists
there was no connection between the naming of Agilent (pronounced
agile-ent) and that of Lucent, which Landor helped coin for AT&AMP;T's
celebrated spinoff. The ``nt'' simply adds weight to the end of the
word, Redhill said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with the name, and the several dozen others the
company considered, involved more than 40 naming specialists at
Landor, half a dozen committee members at Hewlett and a few
thousand employees who chimed in with their opinions via a company
Web site set up for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the work has to do with the story you want to tell
about the brand,'' Barnholt said. And that story? To Barnholt and
others who selected it, the word signifies speed, focus,
accountability and, of course, agility.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently Hewlett and Landor weren't quite agile enough:
The Web address www.agilent.com was grabbed several years ago by
Agile Enterprises, a publishing-software maker in Nashua, N.H. So
Agilent can be found at www.agilent-tech.com.

DECLINE IN WEB SHOPPING, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The percentage of people with Internet access who are making
purchases from Web sites declined slightly in the second quarter of
1999 after four sequential quarters of spectacular growth,
according to Greenfield Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Greenfield, a Westport, Conn., Internet marketing
research firm, hints at the limits of market penetration of the
medium as a shopping platform _ suggesting a ceiling that has been
unknown until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first indication of the size of the population
that will use the Internet to shop,'' Rudy Nadilo, Greenfield's
president and chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooming e-commerce sales _ and visions of geometric growth
into the future _ have fueled the recent boom of Internet stock
valuations. Greenfield's study does not necessarily indicate that
sales on the World Wide Web have stalled, since the total number of
people with Web access continues to grow rapidly. And the finding
that 71 percent of people online bought at least once in the last
three months is respectable, even if it stays at that level.
</P>
<P>
   From the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of this
year, the percentage of people with online access who said they had
bought something through a Web site rose to 74 percent from 47
percent, Greenfield said. But in the latest quarter, Greenfield
found that the percentage had slipped to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on 2,598 respondents selected randomly
from Greenfield's national pool of more than 1 million individuals
who have volunteered to participate in online research.

HEWLETT-PACKARD SEES ITS FUTURE AS AN E-COMMERCE REVOLUTIONARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ In the computer industry, power comes not
from the barrel of a gun but from the interface of a protocol.
</P>
<P>
   And no one may be more aware of that right now than Rajiv Gupta,
a 36-year-old Hewlett-Packard computer designer, who for years has
seen how the Microsoft Corp.'s control of a series of software
protocols, or technical formats, has made Microsoft the dominant
force in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta is now leading an ambitious Hewlett-Packard effort to
establish a comparable edge in Internet-commerce technology with a
set of programming protocols called E-Speak. The E-Speak initiative
is perhaps the most crucial part of a sweeping makeover by Hewlett,
which is intent on transforming itself from a stodgy maker of
computers, printers and test equipment into a 21st-century Internet
services company.
</P>
<P>
   So intent is the company that it is jettisoning its 60-year-old
test-and-measurement equipment business and has just gone outside
the computer industry to hire a new chief executive, Carleton S.
Fiorina, from the telecommunications equipment company Lucent
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   E-Speak, which Hewlett introduced last month, is a
network-oriented programming language designed to let companies and
individuals quickly put new Internet business ideas into action by
easily translating them into software code. It is a measure of the
company's commitment that it has put Gupta, one of its top hardware
designers, in charge of this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will open a whole new service economy,'' he said. ``You
will have a business ecosystem that is created.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if this effort sounds conceptually similar to the
Java software initiative that Hewlett's chief rival, Sun
Microsystems, began mounting several years ago, Gupta does not
necessarily rebut the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against the idea of standing on the shoulders
of giants,'' he said, before adding whimsically, ``or on the toes
of dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, E-Speak is the technical foundation for Hewlett's new
E-Services business as it tries to catch up not only with Sun but
with IBM; both rivals have used Java effectively to develop
E-commerce offerings for corporate customers. And E-Speak is
compatible with Java, as well as Jini, Sun's newest attempt to
develop a networking system to automatically link together all
kinds of computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Hewlett business vision is a radical one, even by
Internet standards: The company contends that E-Speak and
E-Services will help usher in an information service economy that
goes a step beyond that made possible by the first generation of
Web protocols, known as HTML and HTTP. Those first protocols made
possible electronic directories like Yahoo and E-commerce Web sites
like Amazon.com. But HTML and HTTP alone are unable to support
electronic bazaars that can allow for transactions between
thousands of independent buyers and sellers, who may have had no
prior contact and want to do business on a single, one-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the example of a person who speaks French and English
and wants to set up a home business translating business letters in
French into idiomatic English.
</P>
<P>
   In the E-Services model, all that our translator would need is a
personal computer connected to the Internet. The E-Speak software
would act as a broker for the translation service, matching buyer
and seller in cyberspace and handling all of the underlying
financial details of the service.
</P>
<P>
   If the E-Services model works, the boundaries of such a new
electronic economy are extensive. Gupta concedes that there are
already hundreds of different E-commerce business models based on
the concept of acting as a broker between buyer and seller. But he
insists that Hewlett's E-Services approach, based on E-Speak
technology, will win because it offers a complete computing system
intended to easily link different components of a business venture,
rather than forcing the businesses to worry about the underlying
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Internet messiahs want to create commerce
brokerages,'' he said. ``Our vision starts where other visions
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question, of course, is whether the market will see what
Gupta sees. This is not the first time Hewlett has tried to create
a new computing paradigm. In 1990, the company rolled out NewWave,
a system that worked on top of Microsoft's Windows and was intended
to automate many of the basic tasks of using a personal computer.
NewWave, though, was largely ignored in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   And this time around, Hewlett is facing a variety of competing
technologies, each with a head start on E-Speak and each meant to
bring similar capabilities to the Internet. One of them is
Microsoft's BizTalk version of the XML extension of the HTML Web
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   XML is an Internet protocol that is intended to make it easier
to interconnect different kinds of business computing systems. Sun
Microsystems has already incorporated XML into its Jini technology,
which is still feeling its way in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts, like E-Speak, are meant to make it easier to
incorporate new business models into computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can E-Speak whip Jini?'' said Paul Saffo, a computer industry
consultant at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.
``It will be interesting to watch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Gupta, at least, has no doubts about the world-altering
potential of his system, which began as a so-called skunkworks, or
secret, research project by three engineers at Hewlett-Packard
Laboratories in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in a family of small-scale industrialists in
Northern India, Gupta, arrived in the United States in 1984 to
attend graduate school at the California Institute of Technology,
in Pasadena. He recalls being more surprised by the similarities
between Indian and American cultures than by the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something of an anticlimax,'' he said. Though it was
his first time outside of India, Gupta found it easy to adapt to
life in California. ``Unlike the books and movies, people were
quite normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, who is married and has two children, lives in Los Altos
Hills, near Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, even by Silicon Valley standards Gupta will have
proven to be something of a wunderkind. He came to Hewlett-Packard
at age 28 in 1991, fresh out of graduate school as an expert in
processor design and software compilers _ software that translates
the programmer's instructions into machine code. Until three years
ago, his principal role was as the technical lead designer for the
joint Intel-Hewlett IA-64 microprocessor project _ the chip that
became the Merced, on which the Intel Corp. is banking its
post-Pentium future. The E-Speak software project was still only a
sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   But when the IA-64 chip design left the lab to be turned over to
a development team, Gupta shifted his full attention to pursuit of
his E-Speak vision.
</P>
<P>
   And now, even if the IA-64 chip design ultimately becomes
Intel's technical standard-bearer, Gupta contends that E-Speak has
the potential to make a bigger impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly moving Internet economy Hewlett-Packard is
staking its future on a huge gamble _ a vision of the business
world transformed by Internet software, which is the same strategy
being pursued by some formidable competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Gupta contends that when E-Speak technology finds its way
into the world it will have an impact that extends beyond business,
helping recreate the genuine human communities that are so far
largely missing on the Internet. Beyond today's chat rooms and
E-mail lists, he looks to build the Internet into every aspect of
life through a software system that will interconnect computers,
cell phones, pagers and whatever other digital gadgets may come
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very passionate about this,'' he said. ``This will
fundamentally change our lives.''

A SHOWDOWN ON MESSAGING MAY UNITE WEB USERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a week, the Microsoft Corp. and America Online
Inc. have engaged in a public spat over open access to the
instant-message systems that have become increasingly popular on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their rhetoric, though, neither company has much of a
track record for making it easy for competitors to gain access to
the markets that America Online and Microsoft hold dear.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, stands accused by the Justice Department
of unfairly using its control of the Windows operating system to
stifle the market for Internet browser software from Netscape
Communications _ a company that America Online now owns. And much
of the appeal of America Online's service lies in its offering both
content and features, like instant messages, that are not available
to other Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The current showdown between the two companies concerns America
Online's refusal to let Microsoft, among others, link its online
users to America Online's instant-messaging system _ a form of
electronic mail that lets two people conduct a real-time
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Jealously as each may guard its advantages, both Microsoft and
America Online are quick to call for openness in any market in
which they are behind.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, America Online has initiated a vast lobbying campaign
calling for open access to offer Internet service through cable
television systems, largely because it has been shut out by the
AT&AMP;T Corp. and other operators.
</P>
<P>
   And it is no accident that Microsoft is taking the lead in
talking about open standards in instant messaging, a service in
which America Online has 80 million users. Until very recently
Microsoft had no instant-messaging subscribers on its MSN online
service.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike E-mail, which can be exchanged by all Internet users
regardless of the service they subscribe to, instant-message
systems so far have been proprietary. Thus, users of Microsoft's
new instant message system can communicate only with each other and
not with the far larger number of instant messengers on America
Online's networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has found a backdoor to America Online's main
instant-message system, setting off a heated debate that embroiled
much of the Internet industry last week.
</P>
<P>
   And during the last two weeks, the two companies have played at
least six rounds of hide and seek, as America Online blocked access
to Microsoft, and Microsoft quickly found another way in.
</P>
<P>
   By last Friday, many observers were fed up with both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unseemly for Microsoft to hijack their way into AOL's
system,'' said Eric Schmitt, an analyst with Forrester Research.
``But America Online should open the thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The history, culture and underlying technology of the Internet
has pressed most proprietary systems to give way to open technical
standards. And America Online acknowledges that it cannot fight
these forces forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL realizes in the end this will all be open,'' said Paul W.
Noglows, an analyst with the investment firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``They just want to control how it becomes open.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online's reluctance to embrace an open standard is
certainly understandable, considering how much its instant-message
system _ and the related ``buddy list'' technology that lets
friends quickly determine if each other is online _ have
contributed to its rise as the most powerful company on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important reason you pay your $21.95 for AOL each
month,'' Noglows said.
</P>
<P>
   But even three years ago, America Online acknowledged that it
could not keep instant messages limited to its proprietary online
service. So the company introduced AOL Instant Messenger, a program
that anyone with an Internet account could download and use free to
send instant messages to both America Online members and any other
AOL Instant Messenger user.
</P>
<P>
   Instant Messenger enables America Online subscribers who use
instant messages at home to also use them at work, even if their
office computers do not use the America Online subscription
service. But the product also allows people to drop the American
Online subscription service entirely and still keep chatting with
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dropouts, America Online can theoretically still
make money from Instant Messenger users, because the software has
space for advertisements. But since people rarely click on those
ads, the revenue is slim. Still, the company believes it will
ultimately find ways to make money from a program that millions of
people use for hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was so enamored with instant messages that last
year it bought Mirabilis, an Israeli company that makes ICQ, the
second most popular instant-message system. ICQ is the classic Web
business: It has grown purely by word of mouth to an audience of
some 38 million users, but it still has no visible source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So far, America Online has not linked the two instant-message
systems, largely because the hip, college-age ICQ audience does not
care to associate with American Online users, who are mainly
high-school students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, America Online has been wary of doing anything that
would open up instant-message systems too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now that other companies _ not only Microsoft, but even more
notably, Yahoo Inc. _ have created their own instant-message
systems, there has been increasing demand to link all the systems
together. In fact, an industry task force has been formed to
develop a standard for such interconnection.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has long said that it would support such a
standard, once it was developed. But it has done nothing to hasten
the development of a consensus _ though, in hindsight, the company
planted the seeds for its current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   First, America Online did nothing to prevent someone from
mimicking its software, as Microsoft has. Microsoft's own message
program, by contrast, encrypts messages, so that no one can create
backdoor links to its system, as it has done to America Online's.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also published on its own Web page a method that
people could use to write their own programs to exchange instant
messages with users of the Instant Messenger system and to see
which of their America Online buddies were online.
</P>
<P>
   The company now says that this recipe was meant only for
computer hobbyists and users of the Unix operating system. But on
the Web page, America Online did not note any restrictions on the
use of the system. And so several companies, including Yahoo and
Prodigy, used the information to create instant-message programs
that linked to America Online's system.
</P>
<P>
   The systems from Yahoo, Prodigy Communications and Microsoft
came to light the week before last, and America Online blocked them
all _ attracting the glare of publicity. Suddenly, the company's
go-slow strategy no longer seemed feasible.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's well-oiled crisis-handling machine, led by the
public-relations firm Robinson, Lerer &AMP; Montgomery, declared that
the company would put the development of an instant-messaging
standard ``on a fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   The company promised to work actively with the existing industry
task force, and it convened its own parallel committee of top
industry executives to help shape an instant-messaging standard.
</P>
<P>
   These moves, though, did little to appease Microsoft and the
other companies. American Online's parallel committee, for example,
represents companies like Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer and Real
Networks, that are more notable for their longstanding grudges
against Microsoft than their involvement in instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight other companies, led by Microsoft and Prodigy,
wrote a letter to America Online's chairman, Stephen M. Case,
arguing that the best thing he could do to further instant-message
standards was to stop blocking their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for a real gesture from AOL,'' said Brad
Chase, one of the executives in charge of Microsoft's consumer and
Internet division. ``They should stop blocking users now.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Prodigy say they will convene their own group to
forge a standard at a meeting in New York in September.
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention, an industrywide instant-messaging format
is likely to be developed this year. And unless there is
significant disagreement about how the standard operates, all the
major players _ including America Online _ have now committed to
linking their systems to it.
</P>
<P>
   That should mean that, ultimately, that people will choose their
instant message systems as they do E-mail programs: on the basis of
marketing, distribution and product features.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is what will happen until a standard is adopted. Last
week, America Online made overtures to several companies, including
Prodigy, to begin discussions about linking to their message
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the bad blood, such deals may be hard to negotiate
now, especially with Microsoft still intent on cracking America
Online's system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, however extreme Microsoft's approach _ and however unlikely
an advocate of open systems the company may be _ the walls that
divided instant-message users are tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's tactic worked,'' Schmitt said. ``It was the
fastest way to get AOL to move toward standards.''

<P>
   While most of his readers are still asleep, James Romenesko is
up at 5 a.m. each weekday, furiously surfing the Web. He reads
newspaper sites, magazine sites, gossip sites and alternative sites
in search of stories that are appropriate for the two digests of
Web links he publishes.
</P>
<P>
   For Mediagossip.com, Romenesko seeks news and criticism about
the media and those who work in it. For The Obscure Store and
Reading Room (www.obscurestore.com), he scours for stories that are
more offbeat, like a recent piece about a batboy attacking a
baseball team's mascot and another about the struggles of a Pee-Wee
Herman impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is absolutely the best for finding goofy stories,'' said
Steve Knopper, himself a practitioner of the emerging specialty of
Net scavenging. Knopper writes Yahoo Internet Life's Daily Net Buzz
column (www.zdnet.com/yil/content/depts/netbuzz), which also
provides links to articles from a variety of news sources.
</P>
<P>
   Summaries of news predate the Internet, of course. But in the
digital era, when virtually anyone with Net access can operate an
electronic clipping service, the genre has spawned thousands of
news hounds _ not to mention the news links on big portal sites
like Yahoo and Excite. Yet, largely through grass-roots,
word-of-mouse popularity, sites like Romenesko's are catching on
with a discerning crowd _ including reporters and editors of many
news organizations, who rely on the sites to help filter the welter
of information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Such digests, whether compiled as a collection of links on a Web
site or distributed by electronic mail, sift the online content of
established media organizations like ABC News (abcnews.go.com),
MSNBC (msnbc.com) and The New York Times on the Web (nytimes.com),
as well as alternative outlets like New York Press
(newyorkpress.com) and The Smoking Gun (thesmokinggun.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of Net digests, with their own growing audiences,
include Media Grok and Davenetics (www.davenetics.com).
</P>
<P>
   Many digests do not link to news sites like The Wall Street
Journal Interactive Edition or TheStreet.com that charge readers a
fee. And Romenesko even declines to include free sites that require
readers to register, like The New York Times Web site _ though he
will sometimes cite some of the articles that appear on the Times'
affiliated city guide, New York Today (nytoday.com), which can be
read without registering.
</P>
<P>
   A gatekeeper for gatekeepers, Romenesko said that, according to
the traffic logs for his two sites, his ``many thousands'' of daily
readers included regular visitors from National Public Radio, CNBC,
Conde Nast, Hearst and numerous other media organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of the other more popular Web news sifters, Romenesko
is himself a professional journalist. But it is not until after
updating both his sites with new links and images by about 8:30
a.m. each weekday that he heads off for work at The St. Paul
Pioneer Press, where he covers the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He receives no pay for the time he devotes to his own Web sites,
though he does use them to link to items he is auctioning on Ebay,
like old issues of Spy magazine. And recently he began running paid
banner ads on the sites. Mainly, though, he operates the sites
``for personal pleasure and not for great financial gain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in DIY _ do it yourself _
movements and projects,'' Romenesko said. ``And I see my work as an
online DIY venture. While other sites brag about growth and
expanding employee payrolls, I talk about staying a one-person
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another soloist is Knopper, who writes Daily Net Buzz from his
home in Chicago. Daily Net Buzz includes breaking news,
entertainment, sports, technology and quirky stories. ``I'm always
looking for stories that have a twist,'' Knopper said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other news digests focus on a specific industry or
niche. Some readers say these compilations are changing the way
people consume news in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Erik Rydholm, chief operating officer and a
founding partner of the Motley Fool financial site, said he was
much less informed before he began reading Media Grok, a daily
online newsletter published on the Web site of a technology
magazine, The Industry Standard
(www.thestandard.com/articles/mediagrok). Media Grok provides
summaries of and links to media coverage of the Internet and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this thing came out, I actually didn't keep up with the
industry, because it was too much of a pain to go from site to
site,'' Rydholm said. ``Now I can do my competitive research, and
it only takes me about 15 minutes a day.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an industry where value is often measured by page views
and unique users, the most popular digests play an important
promotional role for the World Wide Web sites that they send
readers to. In fact, many journalists now pitch their stories for
inclusion in Mediagossip, Media Grok or other digests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly getting e-mail from people at media
outlets,'' said Mark Glaser, one of four writers who compile Media
Grok. ``And we appreciate it. If people are pointing us to things,
it makes our job easier.'' By the same token, Glaser said he had
received e-mail from reporters asking why their articles were
neglected in favor of competitors'.
</P>
<P>
   James Poniewozik, the television critic for Time magazine, a
former media critic for Salon and a regular reader of Romenesko's
sites, noted that online journalism provided more immediate
feedback than print journalism. ``Online,'' he said, ``you are, at
least theoretically, constantly aware of the number of hits you're
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsletters and Web sites that link to technology news are among
the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find especially in the coverage of technology is that
there is such a scrum of journalism today,'' said Scott Rosenberg,
managing editor of Salon and a longtime technology reporter.
``There is such a pile-on. It's almost impossible for a single
human being to monitor it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg relies on about a dozen digests of links to technology
coverage. These sites include Scripting News (www.scripting.com),
which is published by Dave Winer, a software developer who has
written for Hotwired.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Pell, managing director of Arba Seed Investment Group in
San Francisco, publishes a free e-mail newsletter called
Davenetics. Each day, Pell summarizes and links to the latest
technology stories, putting his own spin on the news through the
headlines and summaries he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Pell started Davenetics in February with about 50 subscribers,
after realizing that he often e-mailed his business associates
several times a day about news stories he had found. Davenetics now
has more than 1,500 subscribers, and Pell says most of his readers
work for or invest in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Pell, who has invested in companies including the online
magazine Feed and the product information site Productopia, calls
himself a ``total content fanatic.'' And he says he is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the growth of e-commerce, it still doesn't come
close to the people who are looking for information,'' Pell said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to independent newsletters like Davenetics, digests
published by media outlets like The San Jose Mercury News or The
Industry Standard publish links to their own stories as well as
articles from their competitors. In that respect, the digests can
serve as supplements to the originating publication _ or as
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Media Grok's Glaser, for example, says that readers have told
him that they read his site's news summaries instead of the actual
articles he links to. Glaser, though, says he reads about 25
stories and skims another 10 or 15 each evening that he works on
Media Grok, which he does from home. The Industry Standard says
Media Grok, which is available by e-mail and on the magazine's Web
site, is read by about 100,000 people each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who are reading it who are business
people that are using it as a service to keep up with the news,''
Glaser said. ``I didn't realize we would become a substitute for
the news.''
</P>

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INSTANT MESSAGING AND OTHER `STICKY' ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The keening outrage in the national news media last week over
America Online's proprietary behavior toward its Instant Messaging
customers strikes many veterans of the computer industry as just
plain goofy.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether America Online has the right
to enforce _ and by what means _ the network barriers that separate
its 80 million Instant Messaging customers from (a) the clutches of
its grasping competitors and (b) the rest of the instant-messaging
world.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, this is just business as usual. Examine the
practices of any market leader and its products in the last 20 or
30 years _ IBM, Digital Equipment, Lotus Development, Microsoft _
and it is clear that America Online is simply acting out one of the
most enduring concepts in the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today's buzzword for the concept is ``stickiness,'' a rather
glib term for how a company gets and keeps customers in the
notoriously slippery world of the Internet, where a Web site can be
come-and-gone at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sticky'' has also long been the goal of vendors and service
providers. Many have built their biggest successes upon enticing
customers with sweet-smelling technical solutions that, once
installed, make it extremely painful to switch to a competitor's
product.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the dominant, albeit unheralded, business model of
the computer and software industry since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days of ``big iron'' mainframe computers and
workstations, companies like IBM Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.
were the biggest flypaper vendors in town, selling the computers,
the operating systems and often the software, too.
</P>
<P>
   Their hegemony was broken by the personal computer _ and then
stickiness between Windows and its applications catapulted
Microsoft to its monopoly in the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once buyers commit their customer databases,
corporate documents and financial data to an operating system and
brand of application software, they are basically stuck. Anyone who
has tried even to switch from one company's word processor to
another's can imagine the exponential agony of trying to move an
entire corporation from, say, Unix to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a classic sticky application, one that effectively
``persuades'' customers to stick around. First they are enticed by
how convenient it is to use the product. Then they stay because it
becomes so terribly inconvenient to leave.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, stickiness has more to do with collecting
valuable personal information about consumers and holding their
attention than with storing their data bits. Finding a way to
create consumer stickiness is a high priority most particularly for
portal sites _ Yahoo, At Home's Excite, Lycos, America Online,
Microsoft's MSN _ and retailers like Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, these vendors hang a few more strips of
flypaper: free e-mail, custom news services, address books and
directories, calendars and event planners, gift services, personal
Web sites. Customers sign up and stick around, plugging in more and
more personal and family and financial information as they return
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like America Online and Microsoft are planning
``digital wallet'' services that will enable users to consolidate
all their sign-in names and passwords. The sales pitch is
convenience _ ostensibly consumers would not need to keep
re-entering the same personal information over and over as they
travel and shop the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously such wallets are also powerful flypaper
applications that, if successful, will tie up consumers' data with
a single vendor who will process all their Internet purchases and
activities.
</P>
<P>
   This type of ``service'' raises the collective eyebrow of those
who remember the enormous power shift in the technology industry
when the Internet's open protocols and the Web's freely available
programming language, HTML, first loosened the hold that the
flypaper vendors had on their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the goal of the free market economy is to whup all
your competitors and become the de facto flypaper standard.
</P>
<P>
   And that is fine as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the technology food chain has lengthened to include
hundreds of millions of consumers, the concept of ``sticky'' versus
``stuck'' has taken on new cultural and economic portent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, America Online's competitors _ particularly
Microsoft _ are acting purely in their own commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the great imposer of unilateral standards, provided
the industry with a Fellini-esque moment last week when an
executive was quoted as saying, ``We should all just speak the same
language,'' adding, ``It shouldn't matter what software or phone
you are using.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaining access to America Online's Instant Message system, thus
its customer database, puts a crimp in the online giant's growing
domination of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But you can bet that if America Online's competitors succeed,
they will scramble for a way to alter any new standard to their own
ends, just as Microsoft unilaterally rewrote two key open Internet
languages, Sun Microsystems' Java and Netscape's Javascript.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, an open standard for instant-message
applications has the potential to unstick consumers and reconnect
them to the rest of the Internet. Which is why today, battles for
dominance of the Internet are of great public interest. Everyone is
watching, and millions more people have a stake in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   As one entrepreneur said last week, ``It's the users who are
going to decide if they prefer to stay in a segregated community or
talk to other communities.'' And that is the kind of sticky
situation the industry may not have a strategy for.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS SET TO INTRODUCE NEW MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN FOR 
POST-PC ERA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems has disclosed the first details
of a new microprocessor design the company hopes could become a
standard for computing in the post-PC era.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be formally introduced at an industry technical
conference to be held at Stanford University later this month, the
new chip design _ known as Microprocessor Architecture for Java
Computing, or MAJC _ is intended to be used in computing
applications beyond the standard desktop personal computer market
that is dominated by the Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, based in the Mountain View, Calif., has made a number of
attempts to develop processor standards that are independent of
both Intel and Sun's rival, the Microsoft Corp. Neither of those
designs _ Sparc and Pico Java _ have gained broad market acceptance
beyond Sun's products.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer industry is widely believed to now be at a
crossroads because the Internet has opened the possibility of
extending computing to many new applications, including everything
from television set-top boxes to navigational systems for cars.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of new chip designs are now on the horizon, ranging
from Sony's Emotion Engine for the Playstation II to a variety of
specialized chips for a new generation of hybrid cellular telephone
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives expect such consumer computing
applications to require alternative processor designs than those
that have been standard for the computing industry until now. That
belief has touched off a race toward new types of processors that
have features known as very long instruction word, or VLIW, and
digital signal processing, or DSP. Such chips might be better
suited than today's to handling so-called multimedia information,
such as video, voice and animation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sun MAJC chip is also intended to run modern programming
languages more quickly than today's microprocessors and as such
will be viewed as a competitor with Intel and Hewlett-Packard's new
IA64 chip design, which is initially aimed at the market for
high-end corporate computing.
</P>
<P>
   If Sun is to be successful this time it will be because of the
most significant features of the chip are what computer designer's
refer to as ``scaleable'' _ able to be expanded and created in a
modular fashion to permit it to be used across a range of computing
applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an architecture that is designed to allow you to make
good use of all the transistors that will be available in the
future,'' said Tom Halfhill, a computer analyst at Microprocessor
Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's new design project was started four years ago by a group
led by William Joy, a software designer who is one of the company's
four founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to take a clean sheet of paper and start over,''
said Marge Breya, vice president of marketing and business at the
company's microelectronics division.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The company is thriving, the shareholders are rich and its name
is synonymous with high technology and success. But is the
Microsoft Corp.'s sterling image losing some of its luster?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question posed, at least, by the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide telephone survey two weeks ago, 60 percent of
the people who use a computer at work or at home said that they had
a favorable opinion of Microsoft. Most companies would envy such an
approval rating. But Microsoft is no ordinary company.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, 67 percent of computer users had a favorable
opinion of the company in a Times/CBS poll. And when the same
question, word for word, was asked in a Gallup poll in October
1997, 73 percent of computer users held a favorable view of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is troubling, even though Microsoft's
favorable-rating level remains very high,'' said Nicholas
Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm in San
Francisco that studies consumers' views on technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says that its own market research _ using a somewhat
different methodology than the Times/CBS and Gallup polls _ finds
no erosion in its public image. The big software maker says its
favorable ratings have long held steady at 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll did find some good news for Microsoft on
other fronts. People, according to the survey, are less convinced
than a year ago that the government is doing the right thing with
its major antitrust suit against the company. And the Times/CBS
survey found that people, especially computer users, are far more
likely to agree with Microsoft that its practices are good for
consumers instead of harmful to them, as the government contends.
</P>
<P>
   Yet marketing experts say Microsoft should be watchful for any
hint of declining support for the company in general, as suggested
by the recent Times/CBS poll. Susan Fournier, an associate
professor at the Harvard Business School, says Microsoft could be
particularly vulnerable because of the relationship that consumers
tend to have with the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fournier applies ``relationship theory'' to consumer-brand
research. Based on surveys of adults, she has characterized the
primary relationship consumers have with products they are familiar
with. For example, Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle brand with a
fanatic following, is ``best friend.'' The ``mother-child''
relationship tends to be how consumers regard Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
AT&AMP;T, while McDonald's and Kraft Foods' Jello dessert brand fall
into the category of ``childhood buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft relationship, according to Ms. Fournier, is
``master-slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other kinds of brands, she says, fit into the master-slave
grouping: monopolies like the local cable television supplier or
the local telephone company, and products that are addictive like
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, Ms. Fournier points out, have double-edged feelings
about technology in general _ that it both frees and enslaves,
saves time and consumes time, assimilates and isolates. Still, she
notes that some Microsoft rivals like Apple Computer Inc. evoke
more ``positive socio-emotional responses'' from consumers. Apple,
her research suggests, is seen as a ``close friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fournier warns that if genuine alternatives to Microsoft
products develop _ say, the Linux operating system for Internet
server computers or a newly resurgent Apple in the consumer market
_ the slaves may quickly side with the competition. ``Microsoft
should see this as a huge red flag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft should be particularly concerned about its image among
information technology professionals, according to Techtel Inc. The
market research firm, based in Emeryville, Calif., conducts
quarterly opinion surveys of about 900 information technology
professionals, who work with and buy business computer products.
</P>
<P>
   Techtel found that Microsoft's ``net positive rating'' _ the
percentage of those with a positive opinion of the company minus
the percentage with a negative opinion of it _ peaked in the second
quarter of 1997 at 60 percent and has since declined to 44 percent
in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's net positive rating within the nontechnical business
community and among households _ two other groups that Techtel
surveys quarterly _ has also declined, but not as much as among
information technology experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are the most forgiving, but the most knowledgeable
people have come down the most in their opinion of Microsoft,''
said Michael F. Kelly, president of Techtel. ``This is a building
and significant problem for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Times/CBS poll shows that opinions about Microsoft _
as a corporate symbol of wealth and technology _ can be complex and
ambivalent, and still generally positive. The Times/CBS poll,
conducted July 17-19, surveyed 1,178 adults. Seventy-three percent
of them said they used a computer at home or at work.
</P>
<P>
   One finding that intrigues polling experts is that while
Microsoft's favorable ratings fell, so did the percentage of people
who have an unfavorable opinion of the company _ to 11 percent
among computer users last month, down from 17 percent in the fall
of 1997. With both the favorable and unfavorable percentages
dropping over time, the various categories of uncertainty _
including ``neutral/neither,'' ``mixed'' and ``don't know'' _ have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   To Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup poll, the
growing pool of undecided respondents suggests an increasing public
ambivalence about Microsoft. He compares it to the phenomenon that
in political polling is termed ``hiding out,'' as people become
less enamored with an incumbent or front-runner but have not yet
decided to side with anyone else.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll also has comforting news for Microsoft about
public opinion concerning its long-running antitrust battle with
the Justice Department and 19 states. The government's suit and its
courtroom attacks on Microsoft may have tarnished the company's
reputation. Still, there is less support for the government's
position than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Times/CBS poll were less likely than a year ago to
agree that the government did the right thing by suing Microsoft.
And people were more inclined than a year ago to agree with
Microsoft that its practices are good for consumers _ 52 percent of
computer users agreed with Microsoft versus the 25 percent who
agreed with the Justice Department that the company's practices
harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer at Microsoft,
said two weeks ago that the company's own polls found that most
people viewed the antitrust case as consumers. ``The American
public looks at this from the standpoint of what's in it relative
to the capabilities of the personal consumer and what they can do
for us, and are we being harmed,'' Herbold told a gathering of
securities analysts in Seattle. ``The general answer, as you can
see, obviously is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as obviously, though, the outcome of the Microsoft
antitrust case will be determined in the federal courts _ not in
the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the polling data and market research on Microsoft
are combined, people still have an overwhelmingly favorable opinion
of the company, even if they describe their relationship with
Windows or Microsoft Office as master-slave. What does that make
Microsoft? A benevolent dictator, perhaps?

Unplug computer, but stay in touch while on vacation 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, when you go on vacation, make sure your computer has
a good time, too.
</P>
<P>
   I'll let you worry about boarding the dog and the cat, leaving a
light on to discourage burglars and making sure that someone picks
up the mail and newspapers. But maybe I can help with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the most important computer-related
chore. Make sure you unplug that sucker. This is the time of the
year when there are violent thunderstorms. Even though your
computer is turned off and plugged into a surge protector (you'll
notice they call those gadgets ``surge protectors,'' not
``lightning protectors''), it can be turned into a crispy critter
by a close lightning strike on a power or phone line. So unplug
both the phone and the electrical lines to it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will think this is overkill. And the odds are
against a lightning strike. But it does happen. A lightning strike
at my brother's house was so severe that his clock radio literally
exploded, embedding pieces of plastic in the sheetrock of his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Next, if e-mail is important to you, and if you plan to travel
with a laptop or to a place where you'll have access to computers,
make sure you know the local access numbers for your Internet
provider. Or, if it doesn't have local access numbers where you are
traveling, check out one of the Web-based free e-mail services.
Outfits such as Hot Mail and Yahoo! offer a way to get your mail
from anywhere you can reach the Web, so no local access numbers are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of my friends use an auto-responder while they are away.
That's a ``canned'' message automatically sent to people who e-mail
you while you are away. The message explains that you are on
vacation and will respond when you return. Some Internet providers,
including MindSpring, offer this service. (Various e-mail programs
have this ability, too, but to use it with your e-mail program,
unless you get all your mail at work, you'd have to leave your
computer turned on while you are gone. That's a terrible idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Personally I think that using an auto-responder is a bad idea
anyway. Telling everyone who e-mails you that you are away from
home for an extended period is like hanging a banner on your front
door saying ``Attention, burglars _ the house is vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far better to e-mail or tell the people you know that
you'll be away, or to simply log on remotely and get your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There's a less-obvious thing for some of us _ mostly people who
have been around the Internet for a long time _ to remember. It's
very much akin to remembering to stop delivery of your newspaper. I
belong to various mailing lists, special interest groups that send
me e-mail on topics of personal interest several times a day. I
usually send a message asking to be taken off the mailing list
before going on vacation. What with the incredible amount of junk
mail that we all get, the added e-mails make coming home and
logging onto my e-mail for the first time after a week away into an
unpleasant prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't belong to a mailing list, you may want to send
notes to any friends you correspond with regularly and ask them to
hold off on e-mail until your return. Since so many people send
e-mail attachments these days _ including photos _ you could easily
spend an hour downloading everything the first time you log on
after vacation.
</P>
<P>
   OK, have a good time on your vacation. I promise not to write to
you while you are gone.

Daycare surveillance: Big mother is watching 
By Marcus Franklin  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Karen Bramwell periodically likes to drop in on
her two young sons at daycare, but those personal visits aren't
always possible with her bustling work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Proctor &AMP; Gamble logistics manager logs onto the
Internet to see her 3-year-old Robbie and 18-month-old Kyle at Kids
R Kids, a Mason, Ohio childcare center equipped with surveillance
cameras. With a log-in and password provided by the center,
Bramwell and other parents can access the camera's images via the
Internet to see what the little ones are up to. The timed and dated
photos can be updated with the click of a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that I can take a glance at my children
throughout the day just to see what's going on,'' Bramwell, 38,
said. ``I can look in and check on them without disrupting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance cameras, primarily the domain of airports and other
high-traffic areas, are popping up in daycare centers _ partly in
hopes of curbing potential abuse and neglect, but also for reducing
separation anxiety levels between parents and their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has a record of at least one licensed child-care center _
Kids R Kids _ with the camera-Internet feature and officials at
another center are seeking a license to open a second facility in
Harrison Twp. with surveillance cameras, said John Allen with the
Ohio Department of Human Services, which regulates child care
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison Twp. facility is a client of Washington-based
WatchMeGrow.com, a company that provides the service for 50
childcare centers throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto
Rico. Richard Suplee, spokesman for the company, said business has
``quadrupled in size and speed over the last year.'' The company,
one of a handful that offers the service, began in November 1996,
he said. Suplee guessed that as many as 200 to 250 centers use the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say the feature merely capitalizes on parents'
``guilt and paranoia.'' Others predict that Internet-accessible
cameras will become as popular in daycare centers as cribs and
playpens. National child-care advocates second-guess the
prediction, saying the feature is unlikely to significantly reduce
child abuse in daycare facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the DayMetro Community Family Association, a
not-for-profit Dayton organization, plan to open the
6,200-square-foot DayMetro Childcare Center this month. DayMetro,
which runs a center for 28 toddlers in Trotwood, expects to win its
state license soon. Camera-Internet service at DayMetro will be
provided by Atlanta-based ParentNet.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional $20 a month, parents can use the service and
even e-mail their school-age children at the center, which takes
youngsters up to 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it hasn't opened, the center has already filled half
of its 100 slots _ primarily because parents are drawn to the
camera-Internet feature, claims Yvette Haber, DayMetro's childcare
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a parent,'' Haber said hypothetically. ``I don't to want
to go 10, 12 hours a day without seeing my children. You're worried
sick, especially if you're a new mother. This way, the camera
speaks for the child and eliminates all of the worry.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tomi Emmerick, 32, pays a surprise lunch visit to her son's
current daycare center in Fairborn, the boy thinks it's time to go
home. When Emmerick leaves the facility _ without 2-year-old
Nicholas at her side _ he gets upset and cries, the heartbroken
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to leave him when he gets like that, but I
have no choice because I have to get back to work,'' said Emmerick,
who plans to enroll Nicholas in DayMetro when it opens. The
surveillance-Internet feature is prompting the change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to watch him from time to time during the day
and he won't be expecting us to take him home. We won't disturb his
day,'' Emmerick said of herself and her firefighter husband,
Ronald. ``Plus I miss him so much during the day and I just want to
see what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmericks believe camera surveillance may improve the
quality of Nicholas's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't trust the caregivers, but knowing that
somebody is most likely watching them, they're more likely to pay
attention to how they're dealing with the children,'' Tomi Emmerick
said. ``It's nice that they don't know who's watching them and how
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kirkpatrick of Prevent Child Abuse America, a
Chicago-based not-for-profit child advocacy group, said cases of
abuse and neglect are unlikely to plummet because of surveillance
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 80 percent of child abuse is committed by parents or
by parent substitutes such as foster parents,'' he said. ``Parents
are assuming that abuse will be going on within camera range. It's
certainly not a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chace of the Alexandria, Va.-based Security Industry
Association suspects that surveillance cameras in childcare centers
will probably ``become the norm over the next 10 years.'' Only an
inevitable court battle will curtail usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get a daycare employee who may raise the
question of why they're constantly under surveillance or parents
may sue because of something they thought they saw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The not-for-profit association represents 350 electronic
security manufacturers and distributors. Chace said the trend ``can
be equated to a knee-jerk reaction to reports of mistreatment at
daycare centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It satisfies the paranoia and it plays upon parents' guilt and
there's a market for that. Security is a psychological tool.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bramwell and her family relocated to Dayton two months ago,
she didn't seek a childcare center with surveillance cameras even
though her kids' old facility in New Jersey had them. Instead,
Bramwell placed greater emphasis on curriculum, philosophy, and
interaction between students and teachers. It didn't matter that 70
percent to 80 percent of the parents at Kids R Kids use the
service, according to owner and director Doris Moore.
</P>
<P>
   She said while the surveillance does give her confidence that
nothing bad is happening, it's ``just a nice perk'' which allows
her children's New England grandparents to see the children a
couple of times a week via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting snapshot photos every day in the mail,''
Bramwell said. ``It's an extra bonus it wasn't a deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it comes down to the care. If I can't
feel comfortable when I'm not watching them, then I've got a
problem.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Electronic banking doesn't have to be miserable 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the past 15 years, my household has gone through
every evolution of the computer money-management programs until
finally, gasping for breath and lucky to be alive, we washed up on
the shores of electronic banking.
</P>
<P>
   My accountant is also my wife, and I don't suppose anything has
brought us closer to domestic violence than some of the financial
programs we've used.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Managing Your Money on the Apple IIe. Like
most unpleasant memories, my experiences with MYM on that platform
have faded to the point where recalling them produces only soft,
fuzzy scenes and a dull ache in one molar.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the IBM XT, and true chaos. As I recall, there was one
version of MYM that came on about 10 disks. Installation was not a
mere matter of feeding it one disk after another. Halfway through
Disk 2, it called for Disk 9. Then it wanted to see Disk 6. Then
back to Disk 2, etc., ad nauseam, until I lost track and fed it the
wrong disk, and it abandoned the entire procedure with a gleeful
cackle.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier versions would not let you close the program until
you had balanced the checkbook. My wife, I suppose you could say,
is a shade-tree accountant. If her checkbook and the bank's
statement were in the same ZIP code, that was close enough. It
wasn't close enough for MYM, however. It demanded that you account
for every last penny, and there was no way to fudge it. I recall
one afternoon it took us about four hours to find 57 cents, and we
were nearly in tears when it was finally done. In fact, I may have
been sobbing a bit. My wife is made of sterner stuff.
</P>
<P>
   MYM was a very powerful program. The problem was its publisher
couldn't leave well enough alone. Every year a new version would
come out with innumerable pointless changes in commands and methods
of operation. However, we stuck with it for quite a while, even
printing out our checks on a dot-matrix printer. Finally we gave up
on MYM and went to Quicken, which had always been billed as the
simpler, quicker, friendlier program. It was, but pretty soon the
barnacles began collecting on its hull, too.
</P>
<P>
   When electronic banking first came along, it was handled by a
third party, i.e., neither you nor your bank, but some outfit set
up to be a middleman. It cost around $10 a month for a certain
number of checks, generally all you'd need for basic bills. But my
accountant wouldn't trust it.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, we've gone over to electronic banking
handled directly by the bank. Lo and behold, what are we using now
for our main accoount? Managing Your Money.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the MYM we remember, but it's certainly convenient and
it works well. You set up your accounts _ including proper name,
account number, address and your own designation (e.g., electricity
for Georgia Power). And then you click on send, fill in the amount
and, presto, your regular bills are paid. You're supposed to allow
six business days for the transaction to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   It has, of course, its pitfalls for the unwary, or the
unconscious, as the case may be. My accountant has on occasion
managed to pay the same bills twice, which makes the going a little
tough for a month or so, and of course that wouldn't be likely to
happen if you're using the paper bill to return with your payment.
</P>
<P>
   I have a little account with the Federal Employees Credit Union,
and I switched over to electronic banking on that. The program in
use here is somewhat short of MYM _ Making You Miserable would be
more like it _ but since I pay just one credit card bill with it
it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about this is that you can look at your account
every day, know instantly which checks have cleared and which are
still out. I get paid on Friday _ electronically _ and the bank
doesn't compute the deposit until later in the weekend. My
accountant advises that this is a ``minuscule caveat.'' I just love
to hear educated people talk.

TECH BRIEFS: Start your day off right with a computerized wake-up
call 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tired of waking to smarmy drive-time banter on your clock radio?
Miss the convenience of the hotel wake-up call? A new Web site
blends the two. And for now at least, it does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   Type your phone number and rise time into the form at
www.mrwakeup.com, and a computer dials your home phone and delivers
a prerecorded wake-up call. The call tells you what time it is and
what the outside temperature is. You can also get a dose of daily
news or your horoscope or a motivational message along with your
wake-up call. You can choose from a handful of such choices when
you set it up.
</P>
<P>
   The service is mostly free, but you'll have to listen to a short
advertisement. Recent advertisers include Yahoo! and Starbucks. The
company that runs the service, New York-based iPing, might
eventually start charging a fee for the wake-up call. But if so,
the advertising would more than likely be limited or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Registered users can record a 4- or 10-second greeting to be
played back with the wake-up call. They also can type a message of
up to 125 characters to be read back by a computer-generated voice
that sounds about like what you would expect a machine to sound
like.
</P>
<P>
   The site and service are still in the testing phase, but are
available to anyone with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Messaging made easy
</P>
<P>
   The home office of the typical remote employee can get pretty
cluttered and pretty costly: a telephone, voice mail, a PC, a
monitor, a printer and a fax machine. What if you trim all that
convenience by a few machines?
</P>
<P>
   A new Web site offers a free service that lets you receive voice
mail and faxes in your e-mail in box.
</P>
<P>
   To get the service, go to www.messageclick.com. Once you
register, you will be issued a New York-based phone number you can
give to people who want to send faxes or leave voice mail. There is
no limit to the number of faxed pages the system can hold. Voice
messages are limited to two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the service is free. The company that runs the site,
Comfax.com, might start offering services for which it will charge,
but they will be optional. Messageclick.com also plans to start
offering a toll-free number later this year, but that will cost
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for receiving a fax are included on the
messageclick.com site. You will need an audio program to hear voice
mail through e-mail messages. The messageclick.com site has links
to sites from which you can download free copies of audio software
as well as imaging software so you can view the faxes. Both the fax
and the voice mail come in the form of a file attached to your
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself site
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, America's largest home improvement warehouse, has
built up its Web site, adding advice and tips on building, fixing,
growing, decorating and installing things.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.homedepot.com, divides its pointers into five
categories: fix it, build it, grow it, decorate it and install it.
Since most computers are not portable, the tips are presented in
such a way that makes them easy to print.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes calculators that help you decide, based
on the size of the room, how much wallpaper and paint you will need
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages of speed
</P>
<P>
   People are willing to wait an average of eight seconds for a Web
page to download, according to a study by Zona Research. Anything
more, and people are likely to head off to another site.
</P>
<P>
   The study is mentioned in the July 12 edition of Info World
magazine. According to Zona, companies might be losing as much as
$4.3 billion to attention-span-challenged people on the Web. The
study found that a significant number of the estimated 44.1 million
people online in the United States use slower, 14.4k bps modems.
The potentially lost sales amount to about $73 million a month.

Two sites puncture the hype of celebrity 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The endless national obsession with fame and the famous has hit
another high over the past few weeks. From the pious mourners, to
Life magazine showing off photos of John F. Kennedy Jr., to the
bottom feeders from the cable news channels, there's enough grist
to keep the Kennedy rumor mill turning _ until the next celebrity
episode makes it onto the newswires and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have nearly had it with the daily celebrity deluge
of politicians, movie stars, Internet millionaires and people
famous just for being famous, the Web is about the last place you
want to go. Here, thousands of populist journalists are building
Web pages to honor their favorite stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that ordinary Joes and Janes are fascinated
by celebrity, but the gushing tone of many Web sites devoted to
celebrities is really only for the most deeply devoted of fans.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say celebrity-watching isn't fun. It's a lot of
fun if you don't take it too seriously, as the satirists at
``Saturday Night Live'' and Mad magazine have shown for years.
</P>
<P>
   So, just when you thought the world had gone haywire
overestimating the importance of Gwyneth Paltrow's latest Gucci
ensemble and accompanying boyfriend or Madonna's latest religious
beliefs and accompanying hairstyle, two Web sites, FameTracker
(www.fametracker.com) and Hissyfit (www.hissyfit.com), are more
than ready to shoot a well-aimed dart at helium-filled celebrity
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   FameTracker, which bills itself as ``the Farmer's Almanac of
celebrity worth'' is a must read for anyone who likes a healthy
dose of celebrity gossip followed by a serious reality check. It's
a Web site for smart people who take celebrity for exactly what it
is _ a pretty interesting spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   FameTracker doesn't let anyone or anything off the hook. In an
intense discussion of the recent Kennedy tragedy, many
message-posters were dismayed that all the media could find to say
about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was that she was pretty and stylish.
``Is that how they would have described a man?'' wrote one
``seasoned ranter.'' (FameTracker gives its message-posters
rankings such as ``seasoned ranter'' or ``rug rant.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the Kennedy dialogue didn't go on very long. The site, which
has taken Entertainment Weekly and twentysomething
celebrity-fashion magazine Jane to task for overhype and overkill,
has been careful to avoid what it deplores in others. The site's
motto seems to be never to let any topic, whether it's the U.S.
women's soccer team or dumb blonde jokes, outlive its trendiness.
If only some of those cable news channels would follow suit ....
</P>
<P>
   The Hissyfit forums have some of the best sources of smart-aleck
pop culture discussions anywhere on the Web. Unlike so many message
boards scattered across the Web, the comments here are intelligent
and often as clever as anything you'll read on the newsstand. Most
of the time, they're better.
</P>
<P>
   Hissyfit offers its own hilarious ``Horror Movie Survival
Tips,'' including such timeless ones as ``If the alligator is over
8 feet long, call the Coast Guard. It's just something you do,''
and ``If a place is rumored to be haunted, it is. You are going to
die. Stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a ``Fame Audit'' of those celebs it feels
are quickly approaching minute 14 of their 15 minutes of fame. Most
recently taken to task was teen queen Clare Danes.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's impossible to do a fame audit of the folks behind
either FameTracker or Hissyfit, who all seem to be anonymous. All
that can be told is that both sites are part of the ``ChickClick''
network of sites, whose motto is ``sites that don't fake it.''
</P>
<P>
   All ChickClick (www.chickclick.com) will reveal is that it was
founded in February 1998 as a way for ``hip, progressive women to
establish themselves as a unified advertising and editorial
force.'' Others are less charitable. Entertainment Weekly described
ChickClick as ``the standard girl aesthetic: barbed wire and bubble
gum.''
</P>
<P>
   To this we say: Yeah, so what, you got a problem with that? It's
hip, it's timely and it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's the
perfect attitude for anybody who looks at pop culture and
celebrities, that is, through a glass darkly.

Home networking makes families well-connected 
By Gerry Yandel  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A network computer crash is never a pretty thing.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on Richard Bodor's network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My users cry, kick and hold their breath when the network is
down,'' he says. ``They say, `I don't like Daddy. He's not getting
a Father's Day present.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bodor has been networking the computers in his home for seven
years. That network gets extensive use by the five computer-adept
Bodors. Wife Kim uses it for real estate searches and tracking
stocks; Denise, 13, uses America Online Instant Messenger to keep
up with friends; Richard, 11, is the gamer; and Amy, 8, is into
``activityware'' like ``Mr. Potatohead'' and ``Spiderman
Animator.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his job at Rockwell Automation outside Atlanta, where
Bodor is up to his elbows in hardware, he has been able to indulge
in what he calls a hobby. His five-machine home network consists of
some 448 megabytes of RAM and 18 gigabytes of hard drive space
running on Pentiums of all flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Bodor says that when he connected his home network to the
Internet, his kids' interest in computers increased tenfold. Since
then, the network has become an integral part of the Bodors' home
life.
</P>
<P>
   While he admits it might appear odd to walk into his house and
find the whole family logged in at machines in different rooms,
Bodor says the family still does things offline together, like go
to movies. And the home network has opened a new avenue of family
communication, especially between father and adolescent daughter:
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I could bring up things in an e-mail, like about her
friends or about boys, that I could never say face to face,'' he
says. ``When she tells me she's getting married, it'll be in an
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bodors' situation may be unique in that their network
has been around since 1992, they are an example of a market that
has the computer industry salivating. The home networking boom,
which began to build industry buzz only last year, is about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is just developing and starting to take off,''
said Thomas L. Funk, manager of strategic marketing for Compaq, but
speaking on behalf of the HomePNA. The Home Phoneline Networking
Association is a consortium of industry heavyweights formed last
summer to help develop standards for the technology allowing people
to use their existing telephone lines as a home network
infrastructure. Besides Compaq, other founding companies include
Microsoft, 3Com, Intel, AT&AMP;T, Lucent, AMD and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, generally there are about 15 to 20 million homes in
the United States that have multiple PCs,'' Funk said. ``Any home
that has multiple devices or is considering buying another computer
is a candidate for home networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with shrinking margins from PC sales, the computer
manufacturers see a way to recoup some of those losses: marketing
home networks so people will buy more than one computer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a home network becomes more enticing as telecoms,
cable companies and Internet service providers merge and morph into
one-stop shops providing phone service, TV signals and Internet
access through a single big, fat data pipe into your home.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Mike Wolf, networking industry analyst for the
high-tech market research firm Cahner's In-Stat Group, is that the
2 million home networks in the United States today will explode
into 13.8 million networked households by 2003, with end-use
revenues projected to be $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and Funk point to plummeting PC prices and access to
high-speed broadband technology as the main forces helping to drive
this new trend. Besides the wholehearted endorsement of the
computer industry, there are other factors at play as well _ like
the way people have so readily adapted to high technology and the
Internet and its staggering growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands what the Net is, and the concept of a
network isn't as foreign as it used to be,'' says Wolf.
``Manufacturers have masked the difficulty of the technology.
They've softened and candy-coated it with install wizards and
things like that to make it easier, so the end user won't have to
really understand how a TCP stack works.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting up a home network is not that difficult. The network
doesn't need to be anything more than some machines using Windows
95 or better and each equipped with a network interface card and
some cable connecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people want to use a home network to share a single
Internet connection _ which can be done easily whether you use a
cable modem, ADSL or even a 56k dial-up modem _ some server
software is needed. (It acts as a traffic cop, making sure that the
different requests from each user's machine for access to the Net
don't collide and crash the whole shooting match.)
</P>
<P>
   If there will be more than two machines on the network, hardware
like a hub or router acts as a distribution point to the computers
on the LAN.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most difficult aspect of installing a network is
running the cable.
</P>
<P>
   Bodor ran wire through closets, across the basement, around
baseboards and out of ceilings when he retrofitted his home for a
network.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues also arise, like where, exactly, is that line
between dad and system operator drawn?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the gateway out to the Internet. But I respect their
privacy, I don't look at their e-mail,'' says Bodor, defining the
gray area between dad and netmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a user calling me about network trouble after 9 p.m.,
I got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   STEPS TO NETWORKING
</P>
<P>
   1. The first thing to do is decide where your computers will be
placed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Once you've laid out the network on paper, figure out which
type of network technology is best for you.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you are going to retrofit your house with a wired network,
Cat5 cable is your best bet. (Cat5 terminates with a plastic
connector called RJ-45 that looks like what's on a phone line,
except larger.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Each computer will have to have a network card. Most people
recommend using a PCI card because it has a faster bus speed.
However, if you have older-model computers, you might need to get
an ISA network card to use in a slot occupied by your modem.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you are accessing the Net by cable modem, the machine you
designate as a server will need a second networking card, so you
need a network card and a modem.
</P>
<P>
   6. If you are networking more than two computers, you will want
to use a hub, which can be located anywhere that fits your wiring
needs.
</P>
<P>
   7. Here is the basic configuration of a ``structured wiring''
network connected to a cable modem:
</P>
<P>
   8. A cable modem is installed at one of your cable jacks by your
cable provider. Cat5 wire from the cable modem plugs into a
networking card in your server machine. Cat5 wire runs out of your
server machine and into your hub. A separate Cat5 wire runs out of
your hub to each machine on the network.
</P>

Jobs again does unexpected 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to him. No one can play the media like
Apple interim Chief Executive Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the recent MacWorld industry trade show in New
York, Jobs let dribble out a tantalizing piece of news. His company
would at last announce an inexpensive laptop computer for home and
school users.
</P>
<P>
   That lured the media in droves to MacWorld, which recorded a
huge turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The media were not disappointed. As expected, Jobs announced the
iBook laptop computer. Then he hit everyone with the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,599 iBook will include several new technologies, the most
impressive of which is something called AirPort. AirPort is a
wireless communications system that, from one communications port,
lets up to 10 iBooks connect to the Internet. The iBooks can be up
to 150 feet away from the port.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was developed in cooperation with Lucent
Technologies, the leading builder of communications networking
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort is important to Apple. The company has long dominated
the education market, although inexpensive PCs have been making
serious inroads.
</P>
<P>
   To protect its lead in education, Apple needs new and compelling
technology that distinguishes the Mac from inexpensive but
run-of-the-mill PCs.
</P>
<P>
   AirPort does just that. It can quickly wire a school or college.
Students with iBooks can connect to the Internet from their desks _
or the student union or dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   While it sounds great, AirPort has yet to undergo a reality
test. New computer technologies are notoriously flaky in their
first versions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, AirPort is expensive. It requires a $99
communications card in each iBook and a $299 base station port.
That's not an insignificant cost for many schools.
</P>
<P>
   That said, prices for AirPort will surely fall if it catches on.
And Apple will probably work out the inevitable kinks in the
technology over time.
</P>
<P>
   In short, AirPort looks like it could be a big winner for Apple.

Reference books get a new, slim look 
By James Cummings  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the good old days when dictionaries were books? Today's
students are more likely to push buttons to look up a definition.
</P>
<P>
   A leader in portable electronic reference devices is Franklin
Electronic Publishers of Burlington, N.J., and central to their
line is the Merriam-Webster Speaking Dictionary and Thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The unit measures 6 inches wide and weighs 6 ounces and is
designed to sit on a desktop. Type a word into the device, and it
displays the definition and speaks it aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The Speaking Dictionary sells for about $100 and holds
definitions for 120,000 words. It also has a thesaurus, a grammar
guide, five learning exercises, 10 word games and a calculator that
does metric and currency conversions.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary has a slot for Franklin ``Bookman'' cards.
Bookman cards are about the size of a domino and cost about $10 to
$30. By plugging a card into the slot, you can call up the text of
the Bible, a cookbook, a bilingual translator or other reference
book.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Speaking Dictionary, Franklin publishes a
pocket version of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary that weighs only 4
ounces. The $50 device holds definitions for 100,000 words but
doesn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories in the Franklin line include pocket organizers,
medical terminology reference books and crossword puzzle solvers.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to find Franklin products where books are
sold or you can order anything the company sells by logging on to
its Web site at www.franklin.com.

Sites with IQ, psychology tests are fun 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd have to be crazy to spend as much time as most of us do
online.
</P>
<P>
   Or are you?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe you'd better find out. The Web is loaded with online
psychology tests. The best of the sites will warn you that, while
these tests are interesting, they are no substitute for a
professional. But, with that warning in mind, taking online tests
can be fun and _ occasionally _ enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop today is a site that promises to rate your IQ
after an 18-minute test. While it's hard to know just how accurate
the test is, it provided scores reasonably close to known scores
when several acquaintances tried the test. You'll have to judge the
results for yourself and _ if you're smart _ you'll keep a low
score to yourself and brag about a high one. The site can be found
at www.iqtest.com/welcometest.html. Make sure that you have 18
uninterrupted minutes available, since it is a timed test.
</P>
<P>
   If the results of that test upset you, you can get a quick
(really quick _ taking this next test should take about 30 seconds)
reading on whether you are chronically depressed. Just go to
www.onlinepsych.com/public/MindGames/depscreen.htm
</P>
<P>
   and answer the questions. Again, be sure to understand that this
is a screening test. It won't tell you if you have a psychological
problem; it'll just advise you about whether you need to see a
professional to find out if you do.
</P>
<P>
   That test is part of a battery of psychological tests you can
find at www.onlinepsych.com/public/MindGames/.
</P>
<P>
   On this site you will find tests for personality type, IQ,
career burnout, assertiveness, healthy relationships in your love
life, sexuality, jealousy, parenting, overeating _ you name the
issue and likely there's a test for it on this site.
</P>
<P>
   The tests run from the predictable to the really far out. For
instance, there's a test to see if you have a multiple personality
disorder. It asks questions such as: ``Do you have the experience
of finding yourself in a place and having no idea how you got
there?'' or ``Are you told that you sometimes do not recognize
friends or family members?''
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting site is run by the University of Indiana's
psychology department. At this site you'll not only be able to test
your memory, you can compare your results with others who have
taken it. It's at
www.psych.indiana.edu/(tilde)msteyver/exp/experiments.html.
</P>
<P>
   Another test that you may enjoy evaluates your personality. It's
the Keirsey Temperament Sorter and is located at
www.keirsey.com/cgi-bin/keirsey/newkts.cgi.
</P>
<P>
   A warning with this one: You'll find out if you are patient by
nature before completing this test. There are lots of questions
here, so be prepared to do a lot of mouse-clicking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you believe that life and success in life are gauged
by more than pure intelligence, you may want to take a test that
measures a trait called the Emotional Intelligence Quotient at
www.utne.com/azEQ.tmpl.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of the owner of this site, ``Having great
intellectual abilities may make you a superb fiscal analyst or
legal scholar, but a highly developed emotional intelligence will
make you a candidate for CEO or a brilliant lawyer.''

THE INTERNET CHANGES DICTATORSHIP'S RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be easier to spot the telltale signs of a revolution
in the making. There were the Molotov cocktails, the
placard-bearing protesters, the fiery speeches, the subversive
tapes made by shadowy underground leaders with ski hoods and
thrilling stage names. If and when they succeeded, revolutionaries
often tightened their grip on power through the mass media: the
heroic movies, stirring music raining down from communal
loudspeakers, television news cut and tailored to suit the regime.
</P>
<P>
   But now China, home of the very visible Long March and the
agit-prop film, followed by the big-character poster and the
Goddess of Democracy, has been caught off guard by a vast, silent,
virtually invisible movement (if not exactly a revolution) that
came together not on the streets but on the Internet. Its
distinguishing activity is collective deep-breathing. Its ideology,
if it can be called that, includes the notion that Buddhist-style
concentration can cultivate ``supernormal'' powers. Its leader, Li
Hongzhi, is a former office clerk who now lives in New York. Its
tens of millions of members appear to dress like the white-collar
middle class people they are.
</P>
<P>
   The panicked reaction by the Chinese government _ which in
recent weeks banned the movement known as Falun Gong and sent 1,200
state employees who were members to that Asian communist
mind-cleanser, re-education, is perhaps even more startling than
the movement itself. It demonstrates in a flash of instant history
that totalitarians, already flummoxed by the fax machine and the
cellular phone, may be facing the biggest high-tech challenge of
all in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time that the Internet's been used in
China in a way that's been threatening to the government,'' noted
Elizabeth Economy, senior fellow for China at the Council on
Foreign Relations. She said that the China Democracy Party, whose
leaders were arrested last year, was found to have used the
Internet to organize across the country. ``The thing that was so
threatening was certainly not the number of people, but rather that
this was inter-provincial, that in over two-thirds of Chinese
provinces, the China Democracy Party was able to establish
branches. And this was explicitly political in the way that Falun
Gong is not. The China Democracy Party still exists. It's still
there, and it can emerge at any time because of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's power to change behavior, from consumer buying
habits to self-education, self-diagnosis and new directions in
leisure activity, is well understood in the West. Its networking
power has been used extremely effectively by low-budget civic and
political organizations in fields as diverse as environmental
protection and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   But it has often been assumed in industrial countries that
access to computers and the Internet was limited to such small
elite groups in the developing nations that there would be little
public impact in the near future. Experts have focused on just the
opposite trend: that developmental gaps between the people of rich
and poor nations, whatever their political systems, would only
widen catastrophically in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the China Democracy Party and, now, the much
bigger Falun Gong with tens of millions of members; they prove that
all it takes is an elite that can motivate the masses to give the
one-party state a scare. It is worse still for totalitarians when
those citizens with access to computers draw on old traditions and
religions to broaden the appeal of troublesome sects or cults.
</P>
<P>
   In societies accustomed to sharing a still-rare technological
tool, one computer (like one village television receiver or a
communal phone) can serve many people, especially if they are
hungry for the information being provided. And to a totalitarian
state, the Internet is a double fright because it can be
simultaneously intensely private and endlessly public, a terror
because it operates unseen at both levels. Had 10,000 Falun Gong
supporters not suddenly appeared as if by magic in April outside
the private residence compound of the Chinese leadership in
Beijing, where they proceeded to conduct their peaceful meditative
exercises, who would have known the breadth of the movement's
reach?
</P>
<P>
   This is a profoundly disturbing discovery for China or any
country where there are still unsettled and potentially dangerous
political questions about the pace and direction of modernization.
Most governments are aware of the need to liberalize the flow of
information in order to attract international business and to
secure a place in the global economy. International lending
organizations are demanding data once withheld by secretive
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has made the decision that it wants to
continue to advance information technology,'' said Ms. Economy.
``They recognize the challenges that it is going to pose for them,
but they think that it is too important to their economic
modernization to stop. What they are trying to do obviously is to
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   But to counter the threat, the government is still falling back
on old techniques. For the Chinese Communist Party to compete in
the open marketplace of ideas is still anathema. Furthermore, what
if independent trade unions or other groups start to organize
through the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Re-education, a Maoist method of mind control also recently
resurrected widely in Tibet, is now as out of date as the doctored
newsreel or the propagandistic ``documentary'' used by fascists and
communists alike to drum up pride in the state and its ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Few countries can opt out of the technological revolution,
though even the United States sees a need to police it in order to
protect national security. Only a regime like Saddam Hussein's in
Iraq, which really wants only to sell oil, not establish a modern
business environment, can enforce a ban on Internet use under a
pervasive reign of terror. In any case, international sanctions
have reduced Iraq's telephone service to a ludicrous level, cutting
off until very recently those who might have tried to evade
restrictions in their hunger for information from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, clinging to a communist political-control mindset, has
been ambivalent on the issue of technology without borders. India,
a democracy and a software exporter, tried at first to monopolize
Internet connections but gave up under public pressure for better
services.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Singapore, where one party has dominated
politics ruthlessly, but where educated people are recognized as
the nation's most valuable natural resource (and foreign companies
are welcomed), Internet access has been made simple.
</P>
<P>
   When historians look back on the latter part of the 20th
century, they may be tempted in the short term to see it as an era
that rendered Orwell passe, an age when exploding technology ended
the possibility of totalitarian thought control _ at least until
dictators or new mind-closing movements devise new methods of
isolating people. There are already fears that racist hate groups
or new age religious cults with authoritarian or apocalyptic
tendencies are getting ahead of the deprogramming organizations
that try to rescue members trapped in mind-altering sects. But on
balance, many experts would bet on more opening of minds through
interconnectedness.
</P>
<P>
   In the Muslim world, the use of mass communications _ including
the Internet as well as a new generation of smuggled tapes and the
open discussion encouraged by Qatar's pioneering Al-Jazira
satellite television network _ is aiding a significant if still
disparate movement for re-examination of the basic precepts and
writings of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is a collapse of earlier, hierarchical notions of
religious authority based on claims to the mastery of fixed bodies
of religious texts,'' said Dartmouth anthropology professor Dale
Eickelman in June in the 1999 Templeton Lecture on Religion and
World Affairs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia. ``Quite simply, in country after country, government
officials, traditional religious scholars and officially sanctioned
preachers are finding it very hard to monopolize the tools of
literate culture. The days have gone when governments and religious
authorities can control what their people know, and what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is probably worth remembering that the
early totalitarians based a lot of their strategy on mastering what
was then cutting-edge communications technology. Manipulating film
images and broadcasting propaganda were essential to their efforts
to imprison rather than liberate people's imaginations. So their
heirs in China may be right to have a special fear of a new, barely
understood medium like the Internet _ and of any organization
clever enough to master this newest technology.
</P>
<P>
   And for the West, the extraordinary success that the Falun Gong
has had with cyberspace challenges any optimism that the Internet
will promote only rational, enlightened, open-minded patterns of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Accessible communications, Eickelman and others say, foster the
growth of civil society and strengthen dissent in places like Iran
or Egypt. But in Muslim nations, as almost everywhere in the world
at the century's end, there is still a race on between the forces
of liberalizing change and those of reactionary fundamentalism,
between those who would expand tolerance and those who preach hate,
between the agents of mind control and advocates of a free exchange
of political ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that the Internet can serve
government's purposes, too,'' said Ms. Economy. ``It's not always
going to be a force for positive change from our perspective.''

NEW PROGRAMS HELP TAME YOUR WEB SURFARI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HENRY NORR   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you're interested in the music of Bali or the price of
bicycles, locating the information you need is only the first
challenge when you're using the Web for research.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the problem of saving, organizing and perhaps
printing what you found so that you won't have to repeat the search
when you want to refer back to it or share it with colleagues,
family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Internet Explorer nor Netscape Navigator helps much with
such chores. Fortunately, there now are nearly a dozen Windows
utilities that provide new ways to preserve and present information
from the Web. I've checked out quite a few, and from those, I've
picked three that I found particularly valuable. They're all either
free or inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three utilities, SurfSaver, is designed primarily for
users who simply want a digital filing cabinet _ a quick and easy
way to store, search and retrieve valuable pages on their own PCs.
</P>
<P>
   The second program, KeeBoo, is aimed at those who want to
assemble pages they have collected (and non-Web files, too) into
attractive ``electronic books'' that can be shared easily with
other computer users.
</P>
<P>
   The third utility is a new version of Web PrintSmart, a program
from Hewlett-Packard Co. that originally appeared last year. As the
name suggests, this program focuses on providing more and better
ways to turn Web information into hard copy.
</P>
<P>
   SURFSAVER 1.5
</P>
<P>
   This program is easy to install. Once set up, it's completely
unobtrusive _ so much so that I had to read the electronic
documentation even to find it. The secret, in Internet Explorer, is
to click anywhere on a Web page with the right-hand mouse button;
in Navigator, you click on the Bookmark pop-up or a SurfSaver
button that's added to your personal toolbar.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you'll find new SurfSaver Save and SurfSaver Search
options. When you're saving, you can add keywords or notes to be
stored with the file and choose whether or not to have graphics
saved. By default, everything you save goes into one ``Archive''
folder, but you can easily create topic-specific folders.
</P>
<P>
   SurfSaver folders are displayed in one handy list, and a
QuickSave option lets you save the current page, with just one
mouse click, to the same location as your last save.
</P>
<P>
   SurfSaver's real advantage, though, shows up when you search,
because the program offers a slew of new options. You can search by
date of capture, or for any word or phrase on the page or in your
notes, your keywords or the original URL. Professional researchers
will find such advanced options as Boolean and proximity searching.
Searching is speedy, and when SurfSaver finds the page you're
after, you can open it in your browser _ with all of its original
formatting intact _ including frames and tables.
</P>
<P>
   What it all adds up to, once you've gotten the SurfSaver habit,
is a virtually painless way to store pages you find interesting and
retrieve them whenever you want.
</P>
<P>
   KEEBOO
</P>
<P>
   This application, which you launch separately from your browser,
uses a book-and-bookcase metaphor to help you organize and present
material you find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To open an existing book, you click on its spine on the shelf.
When you start a project, you select ``New Book'' from the
program's File menu. A Wizard then asks you to give it a title,
confirm the default author information (name, e-mail address and a
picture) and even specify what color jacket the book should have
and on which shelf of your bookcase it should go.
</P>
<P>
   Once your book has been created, you add pages by dragging and
dropping icons or links from your browser into the KeeBoo window.
You also can add files from your own hard disk _ the program can
handle a long list of word processing, graphics and spreadsheet
file formats.
</P>
<P>
   As you add material, KeeBoo automatically generates an
interactive table of contents _ clicking on the item opens the
page. Creating chapters and reordering the pages is a breeze. You
can highlight text on your pages, add your own sticky notes and
search the contents of the book.
</P>
<P>
   When you're done, you can e-mail the book, either in a format
readable only by other KeeBoo users or as a ``Web book,'' which can
be read on any Windows PC with Internet Explorer 4.01, Netscape
Navigator 4.0 or later versions.
</P>
<P>
   KeeBoo was released barely a month ago, and its immaturity
shows. I ran into several formatting glitches: Highlighting
sometimes changes the style of text and long table-of-contents
entries are truncated when a book is exported. Sometimes, the
program kept putting up annoying dialogs warning that my
``Graphical resources were running low.'' The online Help file is
generally good, but it is misleading on one key issue _ where to
find the icon you need to drag to put a page open in Internet
Explorer into a KeeBoo book.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, for me and anyone else who might want to send a
KeeBoo book to a Mac user, the company doesn't support the Apple
system at all. It's not just that there's no Mac version of KeeBoo;
you can't even export your books in a format readable on the Mac.
That's particularly annoying because KeeBoo's ``Web books''
ultimately are just HTML pages, which are perfectly readable on the
Mac, but the program wraps them up in an executable file that runs
only on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   In short, KeeBoo is a promising package, but the developers have
lots of work to do before the program lives up to its potential.
</P>
<P>
   WEB PRINTSMART 2.0
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest version of a utility I found handy in its
initial release. In many ways, the update is a major improvement,
starting with the fact that it works with any Windows printer, not
just HP ones. On the other hand, I'm afraid that the developers
caught a bad case of featuritis; what started as a fairly simple
utility now is a large and sometimes confusing application.
</P>
<P>
   The program's original purpose was to produce neater,
better-looking hard copy of Web pages than the misformatted
monstrosities that Web browsers often generate. (Whole forests have
given their lives to make the paper that gets wasted when single
Web pages print out broken up over three or four mostly empty
pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Version 2.0, both the free and $29.95 versions, goes a long way
toward eliminating such problems, mainly by modifying page layouts
slightly to make them fit in the available print area. Both let you
combine multiple pages into one file, add other graphics files,
apply style sheets to ensure a uniform look, preview before
printing, and generate a cover sheet, table of contents and index
of links.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you get most of the functionality of KeeBoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Plus Version gives more formatting choices, including the
ability to change the fonts and remove unwanted page breaks. It
also comes with lifetime online support; HP also supports the free
version online _ but only for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with Version 2.0, both free and paid, is that HP
turned the main Web PrintSmart application into something that's
virtually a Web browser in its own right, complete with browserlike
buttons and its own set of Favorites.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not a very capable Web browser, and HP has added a
page in its online support noting that the program is not designed
to be a Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   If HP wants to take on Microsoft and Netscape in the browser and
e-mail arenas, more power to it. But if not, going halfway just
adds confusion and complexity to the user experience. In Version
3.0, I hope the company will narrow its aspirations and refocus on
Web PrintSmart's core formatting and printing features.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can take advantage of its most important features
while continuing to use your current Web browser. Just launch the
Web PrintSmart application, go to its Preferences screen and check
``Display PrintSmart toolbar when running external browser.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check out Web PrintSmart, be sure to use the URL
listed in the table accompanying this story. It's almost impossible
to find from HP's home page.

 Intuit Aims at Online Services for Small Business  
 By Peter Sinton   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intuit Inc., the Mountain View, Calif., company best known for
its Quicken and TurboTax finance software for consumers, is
redefining itself as an electronic financial services provider and
is targeting small business as its largest and fastest-growing
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a radical transformation from producing
shrink-wrapped products for the desktop PC to delivering products
on the Web,'' said Intuit chief executive Bill Harris. The
company's aim is to provide all the online connections consumers
and companies need to conduct their financial affairs _ and take a
lot of hassle out of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has a good jump on the competition. Its software already
handles close to one-third of tax returns handled by computer, and
its QuickBooks accounting software has a whopping 85 percent share
of the small-business market, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is expanding vigorously into payroll services.
In May, it paid $200 million for Computing Resources Inc., a Reno
company that specializes in payroll services for small businesses.
Other services that could be linked in the future include employee
pension, medical, workers' compensation, insurance and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, said Harris, is to create ``a seamless connected
system'' between businesses and their employees, financial
institutions, customers, suppliers and government agencies, and to
free managers from a sea of paper and storm of data entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't get into small business because they like
bookkeeping,'' said Intuit founder and Chairman Scott Cook.
``That's the last thing they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can do is take the administrative hassle out of their
lives, so they can do what they want to, like being a contractor,
caterer or consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other e-commerce products, financial services can be
ordered and fulfilled electronically. ``These products are
fundamentally all about bits of information,'' said Cook. ``You
don't have to touch or feel it or try it on. You don't need
warehouses or have to ship stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In a market filled with plenty of e-finance companies and
information sites, Intuit is trying to position itself as a partner
to many of them rather than as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has established links with more than 100
financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America
and Wells Fargo, and is working on both paying and presenting bills
online.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has links with 600 financial instutions, but its Money
99 Personal &AMP; Business software and online services are aimed at
helping individuals and sole proprietors manage their personal and
business functions together.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft and other Internet portals have plenty of
information for businesses, Intuit's Harris notes that they also
cover sports, weather and horoscopes and do not have Intuit's
business depth.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Quicken.com Web site, which ranks right behind
Yahoo as the most popular finance site on the Internet, gets close
to 200 million page views per month and is designed to offer
consumers and businesses a full menu of financial information and
referrals to companies offering insurance, mortgages and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Some new companies like San Francisco's E-Benefits offer
Web-based insurance quotes for business and a free human resources
management system online. But Intuit is not particularly worried.
``Lots of competitors do one thing,'' said Cook. ``But they don't
connect everything.''
</P>
<P>
   They also don't have millions of businesses already using its
products and looking for new things to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuit's Quicken and QuickBooks customer base and name
recognition give it a major advantage in launching payroll and
other services,'' said Forrester Research senior analyst Brook
Newcomb.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Intuit's $240 million in quarterly revenues
now comes from the consumer market, while 80 percent is split
between tax and small-business products.
</P>
<P>
   The small-business market has the greatest potential. According
to Intuit, there are 22 million small U.S. businesses with 20 or
fewer employees. About 12 million of them have a PC, and half of
these use accounting software. Intuit claims 5.5 million business
users of Quicken and QuickBooks. Its main competitors, Peachtree
and MYOB (short for Mind Your Own Business) place a distant second
and third place, respectively, in business accounting software.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has similar designs on the electronic payroll services
market. It notes that nearly 40 percent of small-business owners
have been penalized by the IRS for filing late or inaccurate
payroll data. The average penalty is $845.
</P>
<P>
   That penalty is about what Intuit charges a small business for
its automated payroll services, including automatic deposit of
paychecks for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 percent of U.S. small businesses use outside payroll
services firms today, and e-commerce analyst Newcomb figures that
with its recent acquisition of Computing Resources, Intuit will be
able to offer such services at perhaps half what competitors like
PayChex charge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a possible price advantage, Quicken customers can
cut administrative costs by not having to re-enter payroll
information that is already in the accounting program. Newcom
figures this could be a major advantage since ``the more times you
retype information the greater the chance of clerical error.''
</P>
<P>
   QuickBooks Online Payroll currently has more than 10,000 of
Intuit's accounting customers and it is processing close to $17
million of payroll a week.
</P>
<P>
   One user is Socratic Technologies. The San Francisco research
firm has linked the payroll service to its QuickBooks accounting
software and uses it to make semimonthly automatic deposits to its
24 employees as well as withhold and pay appropriate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For $91.50 a month, including all deposit fees, Socratic
administration director Ron Treleven said the service is a bargain.
Although it is hard to figure exactly how much time and money it
saves, he said it does a lot more and is less cumbersome than the
previous system, which involved phoning Wells Fargo Bank and
punching a bunch of numbers into the telephone key pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company doesn't have to worry about lost checks and
employees on the road don't have to worry about their paychecks
being deposited,'' Trevelen added. ``And if there's a problem,
Intuit takes responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Business consultant Tina H. Anderson of Burlingame also is a fan
of Intuit's online payroll services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of options from printing out the checks or
having them sent electronically,'' she said. ``The great advantage
is you don't have to re-key the data into your accounting and
payroll programs.
</P>
<P>
   She notes, though, that if your business has a complex payroll
such as one that needs to track compensation and tax payments
separately for officers, sales people and union employees, you
might need a more sophisticated payroll program, like those offered
by Automatic Data Processing and PayChex.

EQUIPPING KIDS FOR SCHOOL CAN STRETCH FAMILY'S FINANCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You planned for the rent, the grocery bill, the car
payment, even a triple-digit electric bill to counter August's
sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like many people, you forgot one annual
budget-buster.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-school means big bucks: school supplies. Uniforms or
other new clothes. Shoes. Haircuts. Band fees. Athletic fees. Club
memberships. Prepaid lunch cards. Scouting uniforms and dues.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get pricey,'' said Beth Pline, director of community
building for the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. ``Even $25, in
the life of a parent who's making minimum wage, is a tremendous
amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   And equipping kids for school generally costs much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Christmas,'' said Sharon McLean, executive director
for the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of the Gulf Coast Area
in Houston. ``It comes every year, but ... we forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization, which helps people with debt and credit
problems, found in a recent survey of people attending its seminars
that half expect to spend more than $300 per child to get their
kids back to school. One of five expects to spend more than $500
per child.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third said they would have to borrow to pay for it
all. Twenty-one percent had no idea how they'd come up with the
money.
</P>
<P>
   McLean said that with older kids, especially style-conscious
high school girls, ``$500 might be conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't despair. Social service organizations can help with some
expenses. Guidelines vary, but eligibility generally requires
families to be at or below the poverty level, about $15,000 a year
for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   And McLean has some advice to ease the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it's best to plan ahead. Save for what your kids will
need. Buy clothes throughout the summer as they go on sale _ in
Houston, kids can wear summer clothes well into the fall _ and put
them away so they'll still be new when the school bell rings.
</P>
<P>
   Look for back-to-school sales and comparison-shop. School
uniforms are available at discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can generally get them for under $15, but a kid can't get
by on just one,'' Pline said. Some schools team with a store to buy
uniforms in bulk, lowering the cost for families, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends may sell or give away uniforms or other
school clothes their kids have outgrown, and the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service also recommends buying used clothing at resale
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you didn't plan ahead, McLean said you should start
planning now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too late to get a handle on your financial
situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down with your child _ even 6-year-olds can understand the
basics of budgeting, McLean said _ and decide what you can spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Include your child in the (budgeting) process,'' she said.
``It becomes a family decision, an opportunity to bring your child
into the reality of ... what the family can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids should be allowed to make some decisions about their
clothes, ``within reason,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who insist on an expensive brand of shoes or other
clothing can be asked to pay part of the cost, she said.
``Sometimes, when you ask them to use their money, their whole
priority changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying as you go is best, of course. But if you can't pay cash,
McLean recommends using your lowest-interest credit card, and
spending only what you can pay off within three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go hog wild,'' she said. ``I think sometimes when we use
a credit card, we think of it as free money and forget we have to
pay it back. ... Keep receipts so you won't lose track of what you
have spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, McLean and her staff see people in financial trouble
over back-to-school expenses, mainly because they borrowed the
money or used a credit card with a high interest rate or large
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Paying the debt quickly is crucial, she said, because the future
is looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, three months later and you're looking at
Christmas.''

FOR MANY, Y2K WILL MEAN A WORKDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A couple of years ago, Kay Carr and her husband
discussed going somewhere ancient like Egypt or maybe hopping a
cruise to Australia to celebrate the dawn of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, they never bought any plane tickets, because both
of them were named Y2K coordinators at their respective companies.
Now, it's clear where they're spending Dec. 31 _ at work.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrs won't be the only ones separated from their loved ones
New Year's Eve. Lots of people will be ringing in the New Year from
inside their work cubicles with nary a champagne bottle in sight.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, companies have been upgrading their
computers to prevent whatever computer-dependent systems they rely
on won't go haywire when the clock switches from 1999 to 2000. Now
they have to have employees standing by to make sure everything
goes as planned.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, where Kay Carr works as the
senior vice president and chief information officer, 50 percent
more staff will be called in than for a normal New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That way, if computerized dietary orders don't make it down to
the kitchen or if the computer-controlled pneumatic tube system for
sending doctors' orders and medical specimens shuts down, there
will be enough people on hand to act as delivery clerks.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the technology employees who'll have to pull
the extra duty: Employees from departments as varied as finance and
purchasing will be pressed into service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't be able to party as they normally would,'' Kay Carr
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same message American General Corp.'s retirement
services division has sent to its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should act more like the designated driver,'' said
Michael Betts, senior vice president of information technology for
American General's retirement services division.
</P>
<P>
   The division needs employees to run snapshots of all retirement
accounts before midnight and then rerun them shortly after midnight
to make sure any time-sensitive data hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance giant also told its employees not to plan vacation
time between Dec. 29 and April 15 to get over the hurdle of New
Year's along with several other big days during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need all hands on deck,'' said Betts, adding that he is
treating all vacation requests as special exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has suggested designating an alternative New Year's
Eve celebration in mid-January but so far he hasn't been able to
round up much support.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers typically don't have to work on New Year's Eve, but
Kim Dowler said she volunteered to provide technical support at
Reliant Energy HL&AMP;P. Engineers will be on hand to help about 50
substation technicians who will be manning critical stations at
midnight to ensure Houston doesn't plunge into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be bad, said Dowler, who expects a boring evening
because the utility is prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high-tech dream,'' said Henry Gonzalez Jr., vice
president of corporate systems and architecture for Chase Bank of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has spent years and millions of dollars preparing and
technology employees can't wait ``for the once-in-a-lifetime
event,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation is running so high, he said, that some employees
who aren't scheduled to work through midnight Dec. 31 have asked
for that duty.
</P>
<P>
   However, other employees are annoyed that they have to give up
what has been anticipated as the biggest party night of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Pannagl, managing partner of IS&AMP;T Staffing Group in
Houston, an information technology staffing firm, said he's heard
that some people are looking for new jobs because they've got the
word they have to work New Year's Eve along with the week of
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Many have plans with their families and don't want to pull the
extra duty, Pannagl said.
</P>
<P>
   To make it more palatable, some companies are giving bonuses and
extra days off to their employees who have to pull the dreaded
duty. They're also planning midnight buffets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see 2000 done in chocolate,'' said Irene Helsinger,
senior vice president and chief human resources officer at St.
Luke's, as she recalled the midnight dessert spreads she's sampled
on cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our human resources department is very whimsical,'' said Carr,
indicating the Houston hospital will have sparkling apple cider
along with other nonalcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital understands how tough it is to work on holidays and
tries to make it easier for employees, she said, recalling a Super
Bowl party the hospital hosted.
</P>
<P>
   Family members also will be invited, Carr said. There will be
games and contests for the children.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is putting its employees into downtown hotels and family
members are welcome to come along.
</P>
<P>
   Baby-sitting will be another headache for employees who have to
work. Teen-age baby sitters are getting snapped up already and
hourly rates are expected to be several times higher than their
normal fees.

UPCOMING TV SEASON COULD BE WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With the conclusion of the summer Television
Critics Association press tour _ a two-plus-week marathon a Florida
television critic dubbed the ``death march with cocktails'' _ I
must purge myself of all the hottest Hollywood cliches, and in one
sentence:
</P>
<P>
   There is a disconnect with the audience over the relevant
repurposing of our product, a verisimilitude of diversity in edgy
shows with attitude that push the envelope and highlight
relationships in a character-driven, organic way by actors whose
race _ black, white, yellow, blue or purple _ doesn't matter at the
end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Man, that feels better.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant theme of this press tour was racial diversity, or
lack thereof, in the new fall shows. The irony of the tour is that
arguably the best character from a new show is played by an
African-American (Dennis Haysbert, as Dr. Theodore Morris, in CBS'
``Now and Again''), and that the potential first spinoff of the
whitest sitcom since ``Petticoat Junction'' _ ``Seinfeld'' _ would
feature its lone black character, Jackie Chiles (Phil Morris).
</P>
<P>
   But no, the biggest shock of the summer is that most of the
programs for the 1999-2000 are ... not that bad.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some look pretty good, while the overwhelming majority
fall somewhere in the middle. The difference from this past season
is that there are no they-gots-to-be-kidding awful shows, ones
where clinical evaluation of both the makers and those who approved
the projects would be in order.
</P>
<P>
   The best candidate for disaster comes from _ where else? _ UPN,
in the form of ``Shasta McNasty,'' an updated hip-hop homage to the
Monkees. The short presentation critics have seen was mcnasty bad,
but the musical sitcom is being reshot, and I still think it may
turn out to be not as bad as everyone thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it turns out to be as bad as everyone thinks, I
will disavow any knowledge of the above paragraph, blaming its
inclusion on a fictitious editor.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief shakedown of what the networks will be offering
(look for more to follow in the next two months):
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC will roll out at least one very promising drama, ``Once
and Again,'' a post-divorce love yarn and a logical followup from
the makers of ``thirtysomething.'' The bad news: The new comedies
appear blah to worse.
</P>
<P>
   _ CBS' ``Now and Again,'' not to be confused with the ABC show,
is a shockingly different, not to mention solid, drama for the
network. CBS is also rolling out three female lawyer shows, none of
which seems all that distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   _ NBC's ``The West Wing'' will be a hit; it is actually as good
as heavily advertised. Mike O'Malley, who plays The Rick, the
Boston sports-crazed nut of the ESPN commercials, has his own
sitcom. It's being redone, which is a good move judging from what I
saw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's ``Action'' is the best new sitcom to come out, although
there are some concerns about bleeped-out vulgarity (if it offends,
just change the channel, OK?) and whether the story of a movie
producer is too inside-Hollywood. ``Get Real'' could be an
intriguing drama.
</P>
<P>
   _ WB will offer more white kids with pretty eyes. ``Roswell,'' a
teen sci-fi offering, could prove to be a worthy successor to ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   _ UPN, the network on the ropes, could be saved by WWF
wrestling. ``Secret Agent Man'' could be good, but we haven't seen
a finished pilot.
</P>
<P>
   _ PAX, the seventh network, will roll out new shows each weekday
for 8 p.m., in a unique strategy of building a schedule by time
slot rather than day.

THE NEW VITAMINS OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans would rather be able to bend over and
pick something up than have sex.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense to me. People can live without sex, but it's
harder to get by if you can't pull up your pants, after sex or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The arthritis drug Celebrex, introduced in January, has pulled
ahead of Viagra as the best-selling prescription drug in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason Celebrex sales have outstripped Viagra, of
course, is that people, especially older people, only want to have
sex so many times a week. They have to be able to bend over and
pull up their pants, or perform fine-motor tasks with their hands,
many times a day.
</P>
<P>
   When you get to a certain age, most people discover that sex is
not the point of life. They may not even wish to be 20 years old
again, when sex was the point of life.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't apply to me, of course. Oh, no. We males, no matter
our age, weight or follicular status, are all studly yet sensitive
guys in public presentations of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   That's why men mock former Sen. Bob Dole for being the
poster-grump for Viagra. He broke ranks and admitted he had a
problem with ED, and I don't mean Elizabeth Dole. Well, he did have
a problem with his wife, because the ads embarrassed her, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, women politicians are forced to be more macho than
men, and they have to be able to keep their spouses under control.
</P>
<P>
   First the former senator endorses Viagra, then he endorses Sen.
John McCain of Arizona who, like Elizabeth Dole, is a candidate for
the Republican presidential nomination. Don't those Doles talk
about anything together? Talk is the secret of all good marriages,
not sex.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that Viagra is working. That could explain why a
survey by the American Association for Retired Persons shows that
most Americans over the age of 45 are having terrific sex at least
once a week. Even many couples over 75 are having great sex, too,
according to that survey.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of the men need Viagra, of course. The 5.3 million
prescriptions of the stuff sold in its first six months on the
market went to men who were just experimenting. It's like
marijuana, except you don't have to inhale. Just huff and puff a
little.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are notorious liars when it comes to sex and surveys.
But fewer single older people are bragging about sex than married
ones. On the AARP sex survey, 6 percent of single men and 0.5
percent of single women over 45 reported having sex at least once a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Disparities like that are the spice of surveys. Maybe those 6
percent of older single men are having sex with younger women, or
maybe that 0.5 percent of older women really get around.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe more men than women lie about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Vitamin V, and I don't mean vodka, which
has the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   No man really needs Viagra, of course, but it has been selling
like crazy. I don't know about Celebrex, but Viagra has been the
hottest thing on the Internet since conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder why Amazon.com went into books, when Pfizer
reinvented the original substitute for nighttime reading.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of words are irksome when you read stories about
Viagra. It's considered ``recreational'' or a ``lifestyle'' drug by
many insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet doctors and the AARP will talk about the importance of
``healthy'' sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   The drug really does work wonders for men whose sexual
dysfunction is making their lives miserable. So what if it works to
enhance sex for pure pleasure- seekers, too?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. I forgot. This is America. You must do what's good
for you. You must not have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, did I not have fun discussing Viagra with my wife. Strictly
on a theoretical basis, of course.
</P>
<P>
   She yelled about how it's taken managed care companies years to
get around to covering birth-control pills, yet within a few months
many insurers started paying to make males potent, and thus create
more of a need for birth-control pills.
</P>
<P>
   Men run the world, I told her, although I don't agree with that
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   No drug can solve the ultimate sexual problem, which is the
inequality of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which makes both Viagra and Celebrex, is raking it in
because of the aging populace. The company will just get richer.
</P>
<P>
   Its marketing department seems to be looking for a way to expand
Viagra sales to a more lucrative market than the Dole demographic.
They seem to be targeting folks who aren't AARP members yet and
thus enjoying fantastic sex.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Viagra ad on TV doesn't show the vinegary former
senator from Kansas, but beautiful baby-boomer couples cavorting
and lovingly caressing each other around a pool.
</P>
<P>
   What were these young fogies with aching joints doing in a nice
place like that? This was clearly an ad for recreational or
lifestyle use of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So guys, are you having trouble prying the top off that bottle
of blue pills? Be honest, and admit you need Celebrex.
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For the first half of the decade since the Cold War's end, the
atmosphere in the U.N. Security Council was decidedly improved.
With less East-West divisiveness, the council met more frequently
and did more business.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven vetoes were cast in the post-Cold War period vs. 240
in the first 45 years of U.N. life. Twenty peacekeeping operations
were mandated, more than the total for all the preceding years.
</P>
<P>
   But then the initial optimism about the council's ability to get
its job done in a vetoless world turned sour. Over the past 12
months, it has been particularly dismaying as the council has been
bypassed, defied and abused.
</P>
<P>
   The council was bypassed when NATO began military action against
Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia without first seeking Security
Council approval. Indeed, the NATO countries knew their action
would be vetoed by Russia and China. The significance of NATO's
slight was not diminished by its agreement, after the conflict,
with Russia to seek Security Council endorsement and U.N.
participation in the policing and administration of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, Saddam Hussein defied the Security Council;
he assessed correctly that he could get away with disobeying its
disarmament resolutions thanks to a combination of influential
friends there, a general loss of will within the body and a
sympathetic secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   During the past eight years, many but not all of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction have been eliminated. Disarmament tasks remain
to be completed, however, and monitoring and verification systems
need to be secured to ensure that Saddam does not reconstitute his
illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Security Council has been unable to reach a decision
that would restore, even in a modified way, the implementation of
its own law. Indeed, some members _ including, incredibly, Canada,
a nonpermanent council member _ have sought to lower the standard
of Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been abuse of council procedures. China prevented
minor peacekeeping operations from proceeding in Guatemala and
Macedonia and threatened to do the same in Haiti, merely because
those countries had dealt with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Although vetoes driven by national interest, more than any sense
of collective responsibility, were common during the Cold War, they
have been less so since, with nothing that was comparable to these
Chinese vetoes, delivered and threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council's ability to function as the guardian of
international peace and security has been thrown into question by
such incidents. In all these cases, permanent members have weighted
their narrow national interests over collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Security Council is not working adequately. To fix
it, two key areas must be addressed urgently.
</P>
<P>
   First is the veto, which has been abused by permanent members in
defense of their interests, client states and ideological concerns
_ subjects which very often had nothing to do with maintaining
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is accepted, for argument's sake, that the profligate
use of the veto during the bitter contest of the Cold War might
have forestalled its worst consequence _ nuclear holocaust _ still,
in the current context, the raw exercise of veto power is no longer
appropriate, much less necessary. Today's world is more
interdependent and, if threatened, it is by weapons proliferation,
not superpower rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   The veto issue is a vexed one. Clearly, the major powers will
not give up their veto power voluntarily, and the U.N. charter
allows them to block any proposal that would remove the power to
exercise a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The question thus becomes whether the major powers can
voluntarily agree to a more constructive interpretation of the
nature of the veto and the uses to which it may legitimately be
put.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States, the undisputed lone superpower, indicated
a willingness to discipline its own use of the veto, it could then
ask other permanent members to do the same. Certainly, in the
absence of an American concession, nothing will change. If others
will not agree, then nor should the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Only if there is success in reforming the use of veto power can
the Security Council be rescued from its present breakdown. An
American initiative, however, would also have another advantage: It
would temper the growing anxiety in the international community
about the policies of its one superpower and America's position in
the unipolar world. A move by the United States to effectively
share authority would speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control is the second area that requires urgent attention.
Thirty years ago, the international community began a process of
drawing up treaties on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, starting with nuclear, and then working through
biological, chemical and missile technologies. One of the key
questions that inevitably arose was who would enforce such
treaties, especially in the event of a detected breach.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the answer given _ sometimes in writing within a
particular treaty, but certainly in political terms _ was the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council is the custodian of nonproliferation. It has the
task of providing confidence to the international community that
the tapestry of treaties designed to ensure that weapons of mass
destruction do not spread is enforced and kept whole. There is
simply no other body that can do this job, and this is widely
understood.
</P>
<P>
   But how does the council's decision-making process, including
the use of the veto, square with its obligation to enforce the
nonproliferation treaties?
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: North Korea clandestinely continues to develop
nuclear weapons in contravention of its obligations under the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Because of Chinese, and to
some extent Russian, interests, the Security Council has responded
inadequately. The attempted solution to the problem was agreed on
largely outside the council, and is not proving viable.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq represents an even more profound failure. Saddam Hussein
has broken all of Iraq's nonproliferation undertakings. He has lied
to the United Nations' weapons inspectors. Data indicate that he
continues to conceal illegal weapons of mass destruction.
Unquestionably, he retains the capacity to make them.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are known in the Security Council, including by
those permanent members who have given Saddam strong support.
Russia, Iraq's strongest backer in the council, is fully aware of
Iraq's weapon status, not least because the Soviet Union was
Saddam's major supplier of arms and the means to manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   The authority of the council is deeply challenged when objective
cases of treaty violation such as these end up being judged on a
narrow, subjective political basis by veto-wielding permanent
members.
</P>
<P>
   Were this to become the council's standard way of dealing with
weapons proliferation, it would amount to a profound and, I
suspect, mortal failure.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent members could make reforms in the areas of arms
control and veto power, it might help the Security Council get over
its ``annus horribilis'' _ as well as serve the interests of the
international community in the 21st century.

particular treaty, but certainly in political terms _ was the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council is the custodian of nonproliferation. It has the
task of providing confidence to the international community that
the tapestry of treaties designed to ensure that weapons of mass
destruction do not spread is enforced and kept whole. There is
simply no other body that can do this job, and this is widely
understood.
</P>
<P>
   But how does the council's decision-making process, including
the use of the veto, square with its obligation to enforce the
nonproliferation treaties?
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: North Korea clandestinely continues to develop
nuclear weapons in contravention of its obligations under the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Because of Chinese, and to
some extent Russian, interests, the Security Council has responded
inadequately. The attempted solution to the problem was agreed on
largely outside the council, and is not proving viable.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq represents an even more profound failure. Saddam Hussein
has broken all of Iraq's nonproliferation undertakings. He has lied
to the United Nations' weapons inspectors. Data indicate that he
continues to conceal illegal weapons of mass destruction.
Unquestionably, he retains the capacity to make them.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are known in the Security Council, including by
those permanent members who have given Saddam strong support.
Russia, Iraq's strongest backer in the council, is fully aware of
Iraq's weapon status, not least because the Soviet Union was
Saddam's major supplier of arms and the means to manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   The authority of the council is deeply challenged when objective
cases of treaty violation such as these end up being judged on a
narrow, subjective political basis by veto-wielding permanent
members.
</P>
<P>
   Were this to become the council's standard way of dealing with
weapons proliferation, it would amount to a profound and, I
suspect, mortal failure.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent members could make reforms in the areas of arms
control and veto power, it might help the Security Council get over
its ``annus horribilis'' _ as well as serve the interests of the
international community in the 21st century.
</P>

   &UR; To bolster your coverage of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and
the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 7, 1998 bombing of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
six excerpts, described in detail below, from the book, ``Unholy
Wars,'' by John K. Cooley. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- A veteran foreign correspondent for ABC-TV News, Cooley has
written widely on the Middle East and North Africa. In 1996 he won
the George Polk Memorial Award for more than 40 years of global
coverage. He is the author of five other books on the Middle East,
including ``Payback: America's Long War in the Middle East'' and
``Libyan Sandstorm: Qaddafi's Revolution.'' --
</P>
<P>
   -- The following excerpts will be released on the wire Tues.,
Aug. 3, in category codes ``k'' for commentary and ``a'' for
general news. --
</P>
<P>
   PART I: ``Osama bin Laden: The Early Years'' -- This Saudi exile
charged in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa last year tops
the FBI's ``10 Most Wanted'' list, with a $5 million reward for his
capture. The first excerpt describes how his father, an industrious
immigrant, built a fortune from scratch, and how, as a university
student, young Osama bonded with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud.
It tells how the bin Laden company's bulldozers and other equipment
cut roads, storage depots, bunkers and base camps in Afghanistan
which, on Aug. 20, 1998, would be the targets of retaliatory
strikes by U.S. cruise missiles. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-WEALTH-ONE)
</P>
<P>
   PART II: ``Terrorists from Freedom Fighters: Recruiting for the
Holy War'' -- Only after the U.S. Embassy bombings on Aug. 7, 1998
did disturbing facts begin to trickle out about how Osama bin Laden
and his corporate empire provided a bankroll for the recruitment
and training of volunteers in the ``holy war'' against the former
Soviet Union, from 1979-89. Those zealous volunteers would soon
provide a pool of talent _ men whose skills would be turned to
unholy wars of global terror. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-TALENT-TWO)
</P>
<P>
   PART III: ``Deadly Skills: the Training to be A Holy Warrior''
-- This excerpt details the sort of top-notch training and military
discipline which turned bands of novices and rogues into an
adversary strong enough to defeat the Red Army. The CIA-managed
training was conducted by U.S. military special-ops forces and
Pakistan's powerful intelligence service. (slugged:
BC-OSAMA-JIHAD-THREE)
</P>
<P>
   PART IV: ``Bin Laden and the Worldwide Jihad'' -- In August
1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, Osama bin
Laden was shocked to learn that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had
invited U.S. troops to defend the kingdom. To him, this was
treason. After the Persian Gulf War, when the Americans did not all
withdraw, bin Laden revolted against the royal family. He moved to
Sudan, increased his personal fortune and expanded his support for
the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations.
(BC-OSAMA-TERRORISM-FOUR)
</P>
<P>
   PART V: ``The Jihad Comes to America'' -- On the morning of Aug.
7, 1998, the jihad against America would become real. Truck bombs
devastated the area around the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The bombs killed 224 people and injured
more than 4,500, in attacks that were perceived almost instantly to
bear Osama bin Laden's signature. This excerpt details and updates
information on the capture and fate of the bombers as well as the
aftermath of the controversial U.S. cruise-missile retaliatory
strikes. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-EMBASSIES-FIVE)
</P>
<P>
   PART VI: ``They Unsheathed Their Knives ... and Were Pointing
Them At Our Backs'' -- Some experts call it ``blowback'' _ the
aftermath of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war. It consists of a
global drug trade; of U.S. weapons openly sold in Pakistani
bazaars; and of highly trained, highly motivated men, who turned
against their former benefactors and vowed to eradicate the ``Great
Satan'': all traces of secular Westernized culture. The
all-too-tragic results have been seen at recent sites of terror _
among them, Khobar Towers, the World Trade Center, CIA headquarters
in Langley, Va., and the U.S. Embassies in East Africa. (slugged:

   &UR; By JOHN K. COOLEY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Adapted from ``Unholy Wars: Afghanistan, America and International
Terrorism,'' by John K. Cooley. Reprinted by permission from Pluto
Press, London. c.1999 by John K. Cooley. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after months of tortuous negotiations, an American
TV news team managed to establish contact and to interview Osama
bin Laden _ in a mountain hideaway in Afghanistan, guarded by the
Taliban. He was considered by the U.S. government and many allies
to be the most dangerous international terrorist at large.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, bin Laden called for the murder of
Americans and Jews, wherever they might be, castigating Americans
as ``the biggest thieves in the world and the (worst) terrorists.''
He praised, and sometimes implied personal responsibility for, the
World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a desire to drive Western, especially American,
influence and interests from the Arab and Muslim worlds. He vowed
to drive the Saudi royal family from power and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the name Osama bin Laden was unfamiliar to many in
the West. News reports sparsely recounted how he built his vast
fortune as a Saudi Arabian citizen and became a leader and
financier of a complex global terrorist network that grew out of
the bloody Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about how bin Laden achieved his wealth and what his
activities actually have been over the years is still largely
untold.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, had a
rags-to-riches story: He founded a formidable construction dynasty
after emigrating in the mid-1940s to Saudi Arabia from Yemen as a
very young man. Poor but industrious, he got a job as a bricklayer
for Aramco, the Arabian-American Oil Co., and earned one Saudi
riyal _ the equivalent of about 20 U.S. cents _ per day.
</P>
<P>
   Like other immigrants from his region, the Yemeni coastal
province of Hadhramaut, east of the big seaport of Aden, bin Laden
deposited his riyals in a tin box and spent frugally on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In past centuries, the trading ships of the Hadrami Arabs had
voyaged out to Indonesia and China, bringing back spices, incense,
myrrh and frankincense from the Far East and the Indian
subcontinent. That was generations before the merchants of England
and Salem, Mass., made their fortunes in the China trade of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before independence, when Britain gave up its colonial grip
on Aden and South Arabia in 1967, Hadrami merchants, clerks and
moneychangers had migrated north to seek their fortunes in Saudi
Arabia. These fortunes _ earned by dint of hard work and good luck
combined _ built or contributed to Saudi business and banking
dynasties. Today some of them also finance radical Islamic causes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elder bin Laden had saved enough to go into business
for himself, he founded a construction firm and started modestly
with small jobs. By the early 1950s he had moved into building
palaces for the House of Saud in Riyadh. Eventually, bin Laden won
the highly lucrative contract for a Medina-to-Jeddah highway in the
holy province of Hejaz, after a foreign contractor had withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the bin Laden name was legendary in Arab construction _
especially in the Saudi kingdom and in Jordan _ for every sort of
major road, airport and other infrastructure project. The firm
attracted engineering talent from all over the world and amassed a
huge fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed, as he came to be called, developed a reputation
for piety as well as wealth, jetting from one Arab construction
site to another. He once had the unique experience of saying, in
one day, morning prayers in East Jerusalem (before Israel's 1967
conquest of the holy city), noon prayers in Medina and evening
prayers in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his reputation for piety rubbed off on the firm. By
1966, when his aircraft crashed and he was killed, bin Laden had
developed a conglomerate of companies and was the biggest private
contractor of this type in the world, owning 90 of the largest
Caterpillar excavators then in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its religious credentials _ useful later when it would
become a financier of the Afghan jihad _ the firm was short on
management knowhow. For a time, Saudi King Faisal appointed the
owner of a smaller construction company to watch over the financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Islamic tradition of polygamy, bin Laden
fathered no fewer than 52 children with various wives. One of his
sons, Osama, had already attracted the attention of the Saudi royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at age 23, Osama bin Laden was finishing studies in
economics and marketing at Jeddah University. He already had a
close friendship with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, who shared
his fervent ideas about the decline and decadence of Islam and
Islamic political dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Osama appreciated Prince Turki's honesty and antipathy to
corruption _ qualities he believed were not always found in the
Arab world's royalty or rulers. And, for his part, the prince seems
to have regarded Osama as an ernest young man who burned with a
pure, hard flame of devotion to religious principles.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Osama bin Laden was running much of the elite
construction business that his father had built from scratch. Under
his guidance, the company expanded its reputation for professional
excellence and a ``can-do'' spirit in major projects. His
inheritance from the family fortune was soon augmented by the huge
business earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a politically tumultuous time. In neighboring
Afghanistan, a fierce 1978 revolution had resulted in a Marxist
government and brought a sizeable amount of Soviet aid. But
non-stop in-fighting among the parties and protest demonstrations
among the devout Muslim citizenry were followed by a Soviet
invasion. This was an outrage to bin Laden, who seized the
opportunity to join forces against the ``godless'' Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enraged and went there at once,'' he said in a 1993
interview with Robert Fisk of the London Independent, one of the
first journalists to spot bin Laden as a key mover in the Afghan
holy war and, perhaps more significantly, in the larger jihad
against America that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Turki sent bin Laden to Peshawar, Pakistan, to scout out
the possibilities of raising an Arab volunteer army. Soon bin Laden
set up a base for the Afghan warriors, within easy reach of
Pakistan's powerful intelligence and security service, the
Interservices Intelligence Directorate _ known as ISI _ but
apparently not supervised by them.
</P>
<P>
   As the war rolled on, bin Laden was organizer, financier,
fighter and Islamic role model. He eagerly imported bulldozers and
other heavy equipment to cut new roads and tunnels. Operating out
of Karachi, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he agreed to build bases and
training camps, as well as landing strips for the private jets of
warlords and Muslim and Arab dignitaries. He built deeply buried
bunkers and tunnels in the mountains for command posts and
telecommunications centers to secure the communications against the
radio traffic analysts and codebreakers of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, bin Laden quickly became acquainted with Abdullah
Azzam, a charismatic Palestinian leader, who had made a name for
himself with fiery sermons in Zarqa, Jordan, addressed to
Palestinians fleeing the Jordanian army's crackdown in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam, later a founder of the Hamas Islamic resistance movement
in Gaza and the West Bank, had rejected the authority of Yassir
Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization and other
smaller groups as too Marxist and not Islamic enough. He believed
they depended too much on the Soviet ``Great Satan,'' the usurper
of Muslim Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In liaison with the generals running Pakistan's ISI, Azzam
outlined his need for weapons, transportation and incomes. Bin
Laden promised to be generous with financing and began fundraising
and organizational journeys throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the bin Laden financial and construction empire
strengthened its ties with the Saudi royal family, winning a $3
billion ``contract of the century'': the full restoration and
reconstruction of the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Also proving to be a brave foot soldier, bin Laden suffered a
shoulder wound in combat near Jalalabad. Under the approving eye of
Pakistan's ISI officers, he cultivated and guarded his good
relations with the two main ethnic Afghan warlords: Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial for his later global enterprise in private
terrorism, bin Laden used as a regional power base in Pakistan the
Binoori mosque in Karachi's Newton district. The prayer leader
there was a certain Mullah Mohammed Omar, then an unknown young
cleric, but by 1998 the leader of the Taliban and the most powerful
man in Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
   It could be called a strange love affair that went disastrously
wrong: the alliance, during the Afghan war, between the United
States and some of the most fanatical followers of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Four a quarter century after the onset of the Cold War in 1946,
the Soviet Union was perceived to be the principal threat to
American interests in the Middle East, as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, decided by a tiny
coterie in the Leonid Brezhnev-era politburo, jolted President
Jimmy Carter in the White House and his foreign-policy team. They
perceived the foolhardy invasion not only as a major international
threat, but also as a rare opportunity to undermine the already
tottering Soviet empire lying north of Afghanistan, in Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI), Saudi financing and Pakistani logistical
support, the CIA managed the program to send into battle a
mercenary army of Islamic volunteers. The tacit consensus was that
the Muslim religion, fundamentally anti-Communist, if translated
into politics, could be harnessed as a mighty force to oppose
Moscow in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   This impetus to support the anti-Soviet ``jihad,'' or holy war,
was amplified by President Ronald Reagan's men _ especially his
director of Central Intelligence, William Casey. By 1981, when new
sources of secret financing were needed for the Afghan campaign,
the bin Laden enterprises were on a short list of possible donors.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Sultan bin Abdul Azziz, the powerful Saudi defense and
aviation minister, told a high-level American business and
investors' delegation that the bin Laden firms had done great
things for the kingdom. To both Saudi intelligence and the CIA,
Osama bin Laden, through his personal reputation as an astute
businessman and a pious Muslim, seemed an ideal figure to play a
leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden would pay, with his own and company funds, for the
recruitment, transportation and training of the volunteers who
flocked in, first to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Afghanistan,
from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, parts of Europe and
America. He collected enough millions from his family and corporate
holdings and from donations by rich Arab Persian Gulf merchant
families, to organize Al Qaeda, the Islamic Salvation Foundation,
to support the jihad.
</P>
<P>
   He established a network of Al Qaeda centers in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Pakistan, through which he recruited, enlisted and
sheltered thousands of Arab volunteers. It is this large fraternity
of Al Qaeda alumni which is still internationally active _ not as
freedom fighters, but as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those bin Laden recruited turned out to be zealous
Muslims like himself, and brave soldiers. Some, however, were
criminals, who emerged from places such as Algerian or Tunisian
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Girardet, one of the most perceptive journalists covering
the war, estimated in summer 1983 that already there were between
80,000 and 150,000 full-time guerrilla fighters. Their pay had to
compete with what some had earned, or might earn, in more peaceful
civilian callings. The figures for ``regulars'' did not include
hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Pakistani civilians who
functioned as part-time fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After several long visits to different fronts, Girardet
determined that the resistance movement was operating, with varying
efficiency, in as many as 300 different regions throughout
Afghanistan's 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, through an ISI-managed logistical framework, tried to
supply and pay the guerrillas; in practice, pay and equipment in
the field often had to come directly from outside donors such as
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   During the peak period for foreign volunteers _ which spawned
bin Laden's Al Qaeda and various lesser foreign terrorist networks
_ up to 5,000 non-Afghan fighters streamed into the Peshawar area.
Easily 10 times that number would train or fight; others rested,
trafficked in drugs and arms or led the good life in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, as an Egyptian newsman who visited his compatriots
remarked, were drawn by the adventure and religious prestige,
involving a kind of emotional ``high, attached to feeling part of
the jihad.'' Some were university undergraduates or, like the
Taliban who appeared in 1993, students of Islamic colleges, known
as ``madrassas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men, from poorer Arab countries such as Yemen
or Sudan, had been working in the wealthy Persian Gulf oil emirates
and were ripe for recruitment there. They had grown tired of being
reduced, with their non-Arab, Asian colleagues, to proletarian
status. Others were self-financed or backed _ a notable example was
Egypt's cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman _ by tight-knit communities
of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who took up arms, the ideological core group were
believers who were politically, as well as emotionally or
materially, engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike training, recruiting for the jihad in the United States
was not handled directly by the CIA, despite its overall management
role. Various local cover groups, often legitimate Muslim charities
and mosque communities in cities such as New York, Detroit, Los
Angeles and other large centers of Arab-American population,
shielded the agency.
</P>
<P>
   If directly run by the men from Langley, Va., such activities _
as well as the weapons training in America _ would have been a
flagrant violation of the CIA's charter.
</P>
<P>
   The sites for induction and initial indoctrination of the future
holy warriors were modest and humdrum. One was in New York's Arab
district, in Brooklyn, on Atlantic Avenue. Another was a private
rifle club in affluent Naugutuck, Conn. There were similar
locations within the large Arab immigrant and Arab-American
districts in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Detroit and
Dearborn, Mich.,
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Alkifah Refugee Center was also known to the
Arabs, Arab-Americans and Muslim travelers from abroad who met and
worked there as the ``Al-Jihad'' center. This was because both
recruiting and fund-raising for the Afghanistan jihad went on
there.
</P>
<P>
   The funding came from charitable donations for Afghan refugee
relief in the United States. Most probably, there were also
hard-to-trace monies from the World Muslim League and other
missionary and charitable organizations located in Pakistan, such
as the Tablighi Jamaat, a vast international Islamic missionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key figures in the Brooklyn operation was bin Laden's
old friend, Abdullah Azzam, a fiery speaker and founder of Hamas.
In the early and mid-'80s, he toured the United States recruiting
for Afghanistan. But he was probably also raising funds for Hamas
and its post-1987 Palestinian revolt against Israel in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam was killed by a still-mysterious car bomb in Pakistan in
1987 _ it greatly upset bin Laden. Suspects included Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency; the Soviet KGB or its Afghan adjunct,
the Communist Afghan KHAD; the Pakistani ISI; and even the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The blind Egyptian prayer leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, also
had been a recruiter, sending his sons to fight in Afghanistan.
Later, with other suspects, he was convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and an aborted conspiracy to bomb the United
Nations headquarters, along New York's East River, as well as
traffic tunnels, bridges, FBI headquarters and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and the others frequented the Atlantic Avenue
headquarters and often prayed in nearby mosques. An investigation
on ABC's July 12, 1993, ``Day One'' magazine program aired details
of Azzam's recruiting activities in no fewer than 26 American
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Brooklyn jihad workers, including El Sayyid Nosair _
he later was convicted of the 1990 murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
Jewish Defense League leader _ trained as gunmen at a shooting
range in Naugutuck, just west of the highway from Bridgeport to
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits for Afghanistan, according to later New York court
documents, also trained in rifle shooting there. Nosair's course on
the AK-47 assault rifle _ the standard, Soviet-made weapon used by
the mujahedeen _ was held as late as the summer of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Afghan war was nearly over, but as Pakistan's
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto remarked on the ``Day One''
broadcast, the dispersal of the fighters had begun toward new
target countries. ``They are all over the world,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   As John Collins, senior American military analyst at the
Congressional Research Services, noted in 1987, it takes little
expertise to pour epoxy on movable machinery or sugar into gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Quite another matter, however, is strategic sabotage, which
requires activists and organizers who can mobilize people and
coordinate their actions in demonstrations, strikes, riots,
boycotts, production delays and in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   The zealous young men of the Afghan ``jihad'' would develop an
expertise in sabotage and various martial and murderous skills _
methods that were used successfully in Afghanistan, and also after
1989 in violent actions against their own Third World governments
and in anti-Western terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, as seen from CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the
program to ``train the trainers'' of the holy warriors followed the
principle of elevating combat into an expression of religious
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In a pyramidal training scheme, the CIA was the overall manager;
U.S. special-ops forces and a coalition of assorted allied
specialists were the main instructors. Pakistani officers were the
students who would experience tough courses in endurance, weapons
use, sabotage, killing techniques, battle communications and other
skills. Later, in the schools and camps of Pakistan and
Afghanistan, they would impart these skills to the scores of
thousands of fighters _ the mujahedeen _ and send them into battle.
Often, though not always, the same kind of process applied to the
use and distribution of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Selected officers of the Green Berets _ officially the U.S. Army
Special Forces _ many of them seasoned veterans of Vietnam, took
draconian secrecy oaths and then began the covert assignments for
the war in Afghanistan: training native, or indigenous, guerrillas
to fight the Communist foe.
</P>
<P>
   A few men of the Green Berets and the British Special Air
Service (SAS), elected to go beyond the role of trainers. They
volunteered for scouting and back-up roles with the warriors they,
or their colleagues, had trained.
</P>
<P>
   Many Green Berets were already familiar with one of their most
important training sites, Fort Bragg, N.C., the base of the U.S.
Army's 82nd Airborne Division and the site of the John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center, a school of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
warfare which the author, as a newspaper correspondent covering the
Pentagon, visited shortly before the ill-fated 1980 Iranian hostage
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   There Col. Charles (``Chargin' Charlie'') Beckwith began
training his elite Delta Force to free the Americans held captive
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. At that point, much of the adventure
in Afghanistan was still in the planning stages. Soon, however,
Beckwith decided to move his training to a smaller and more secure
area.
</P>
<P>
   That area, which Beckwith called ``Camp Smokey,'' was actually
the CIA's Camp Peary. It too would soon play a central role in
training for the Afghan war. Camp Peary, nicknamed ``The Farm'' in
the American spy world, was and probably still is the CIA's main
place of training for spies, infiltrators and covert operators. Its
very existence was a classified secret until various visitors
discovered it and began to write about it in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm is a parcel of land about 25 square miles in area, just
northeast of Williamsburg, Va., running between U.S. Route 64 and
the James River. Some of the future Afghan warrior-trainers,
chiefly Pakistanis sent by their country's Interservices
Intelligence Directorate (ISI), were probably able to see Beckwith
and his men train for the Iranian mission on a model of the
occupied U.S. Embassy compound, rehearsing all their hypothetical
moves once they got over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Peary was also where members of the CIA Career Training
Program, many of them officers seeking advancement and new
assignments in covert action in Afghanistan and elsewhere, studied
and worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary training also went on at another CIA-used Army
Special Forces site, Harvey Point, N.C., and at another Virginia
site, Fort A.P. Hill, off the Washington-Richmond interstate
highway. Like Fort Lee, Va., it had an authorized area for
parachute jumping. There, pilots and other personnel were supposed
to practice CARP (Computerized Airborne Point Release Flying) _ a
skill that misfired in the operation on the Caribbean island of
Grenada in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But it was apparently used effectively for supply drops to the
Afghan fighters against the Red Army, as well as very effectively
in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm to free Kuwait from Saddam
Hussein's occupying Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort A.P. Hill and also at Camp Pickett, Va., the Green
Berets and U.S. Navy Seals instructed key Pakistani officers and,
occasionally, visiting senior mujahedeen of Afghan or Pakistani
origin, in infiltration techniques and ways of extracting
``friendly wounded,'' enemy prisoners or captured weapons from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   The more successful aspiring guerrillas being trained were
inculcated with the Cold War principle that ``brainpower replaces
firepower'' as the foremost fighting implement. They were also
taught the tenet of Sun Tzu, the classical Chinese theoretician of
the art of war: ``to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme
of skill.'' In other words, use deception, ruse and evasion as much
as possible to defeat him, rather than conventional, frontal-style
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Along with courses in surveillance and counter-surveillance; how
to write reports according to CIA standards; how to shoot various
weapons; and the running of counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and
paramilitary operations, there was classroom instruction in the
all-important subject of recruiting new agents, couriers and
assorted helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the training given to the holy warriors in such
techniques as how to stab an enemy sentry from behind or strangle
him with a garrote, the fact was that murder and assassination _ of
senior enemy leaders, at least _ were forbidden to the CIA by law.
Indeed, on Dec. 4, 1981, President Reagan signed executive Order
No. 12333. ``No person,'' the order stated, ``employed by or acting
on behalf of the U.S. government shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   This confirmed and solidified a ban on political assassination
passed by Congress after a surge of CIA scandals in the 1970s,
involving such bizarre measures as trying to murder Fidel Castro
with poison or exploding cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the wording contradicted the curricula for
the Afghan trainees, or at least limited the targets of the lethal
methods _ acts such as strangulation, murderous karate chops and
how to use a sniper's rifle with telescopic sights to eliminate a
designated enemy officer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the holy warriors often brought traditional
techniques to the table. For example, the time-honored Afghan
method of throat-cutting needed no CIA or U.S. congressional
authorization. It terrified Russian personnel met on the
battlefield or captured as hostages, many of whom preferred an
instant conversion to Islam over death by a dagger drawn across the
throat. The technique was also later exported, notably to Algeria,
and used there to sinister effect against the military and some
foreigners as well.
</P>
<P>
   One subject learned from the foreign instructors was indirect
sabotage. In the context of the Afghan war, this meant destroying
crops belonging to a tribe or village committed to the Soviets or
otherwise reducing or degrading the production at facilities
controlled by the Communist regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, however, it became a favorite export of some
of the holy warriors, who, for example, tried to apply it to
destroy industrial enterprises _ especially those connected with
oil and natural gas _ benefiting foreign investors or the military
regime in Algeria, albeit without notable success.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition and arson was probably the most prized craft acquired
during the training for Afghanistan. This required detailed
knowledge about explosives and incendiary devices _ what kind, how
much, where placed, how triggered. It encompassed the making and/or
use of sophisticated fuses, timers and explosives; the creation of
fuel-and-fertilizer and other unconventional bombs; and
remote-control devices for triggering bombs and mines. These
capabilities were later transferred to the volunteers' home
countries; evidence of their mastery would crop up repeatedly in
actions against the Israelis in occupied Arab territory such as
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, under the U.S. presidency of George Bush, the CIA drank
champagne to celebrate victory of the anti-Soviet jihad. Indeed,
the Red Army had been defeated and ultimately sent home humiliated
by a volunteer army of religious believers who were disciplined
into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   But in the light of the next decade, that ``victory'' would come
into harsh question. The experience of the jihad _ and allying with
one another _ left indelible marks not only on the spirit of the
dying Soviet superpower, but also on the destinies of several
thriving nations.

</P>
<P>
   In August 1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait, Osama bin Laden was shocked by the decision of King Fahd to
invite Americans to defend the Saudi kingdom. To him, it qualified
as treason.
</P>
<P>
   During the Afghan holy war, bin Laden had worked with Americans
to expel the Soviet ``Great Satan.'' But already he and his
acolytes had begun to prepare for far larger jihads to come _
targeted against impious Arab governments overly beholden to the
corrupt and satanic West.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet defeat in 1989, bin Laden left the Afghan
scene, without being drawn into the bloody struggles between rival
clan warlords. He returned to Saudi Arabia to tend to the family
construction business at its Jeddah head office. Reportedly, Prince
Turki bin Faisal al-Saud urged him to keep bankrolling the
mercenary volunteers based in Pakistan _ this to ensure survival of
a mobile strike force that could be used to fight Islamic causes
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the scope of bin Laden's purposes likely very
much exceeded Turki's. Bin Laden was reorienting the training of
men in his Al Qaeda organization to specialize in urban guerrilla
warfare, aimed at destabilizing Western societies and governments.
And he was backing Islamic militants who had begun to challenge the
governments in Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, the Philippines and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Prince Turki reportedly reassured bin Laden that U.S.
troops would all withdraw from the kingdom as soon as Saddam
Hussein was defeated _ and they would not be stationed near the
Muslim holy places.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, when U.S. troops did not entirely leave, bin Laden
revolted against the royal family. Saudi security, already highly
uneasy about his activities, had held onto bin Laden's passport
during the 1989-91 period, hoping to prevent or at least discourage
his contacts with exiled Saudi dissidents, accusing the kingdom of
police corruption and abuse of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, along with a number of Afghan war veterans, bin Laden
moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and was welcomed by Hassan
al-Turabi, the leader of Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF).
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, bin Laden and his business associates had
been watching for investment opportunities in Sudan. Now, one of
his companies, Al-Hijrah for Construction and Development, Ltd.,
contracted to build a modern airport for Port Sudan, on the Red
Sea, and a highway link to Khartoum. His trading company, Wadi
al-Aqiq, Ltd., operating with his Taba Investment Co., obtained a
near monopoly over Sudan's main agricultural exports: gum arabica,
corn, and sunflower and sesame products.
</P>
<P>
   So too, his Al-Themar al-Mubarakah Agriculture Co., Ltd.
acquired large tracts of land near Khartoum and in eastern Sudan.
Together with affluent NIF members, bin Laden invested $50 million,
a controlling interest, in an Islamic bank.
</P>
<P>
   His work force included hundreds, perhaps thousands, of militant
veterans of the Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war. By January 1994,
according to U.S. intelligence reports, bin Laden was financing at
least three guerrilla or terrorist training camps for Egyptian,
Algerian, Tunisian and Palestinian rebels, in cooperation with the
NIF.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his assets and construction projects, bin Laden
helped his hosts by facilitating purchases of Saudi oil for
cash-poor Sudanese at subsidized prices. He took a large house on
Al Mashal Street, in a suburban quarter of Khartoum, located near
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Following his arrival, messages flowed regularly between
Washington, Riyadh and Khartoum, asking Sudan's opposition leaders
to scale down and end, if possible, bin Laden's support of armed
guerrillas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 bin Laden began to focus on the ancient and troubled
Arab country of Yemen, his father's birthplace. He began to channel
money, weapons and trained Afghan war veterans into North Yemen,
which was embroiled in a serious territorial dispute with Saudi
Arabia. The Saudi royal regime was supporting the secular-minded
South Yemenis in Aden against the North Yemenis in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's Yemeni activities during this general period,
according to U.S. government reports, included financing a group of
insurgents who, in December 1992, attempted bombing attacks against
about 100 U.S. servicemen in Aden. The troops were billeted there
to support U.N. relief operations in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's followers began to work with other Saudi dissident
groups against the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the
gulf region, and against the Saudi royal family. His followers in
the kingdom would mingle and travel with pilgrims making the
``haj,'' or holy passage, to Mecca and Medina, especially those
returning to Egypt or Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden issued false passports and identity papers, as well as
work contacts, to facilitate travel of the ``Afghanis,'' as the
veterans came to be called. In 1993, for example, he paid for the
travel to Sudan of up to 400 loyal veterans, who were threatened
with a crackdown by Pakistan, now under pressure from Egypt,
Algeria and other countries they were targeting.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of Al Qaeda _ the organization of exiled radical
Islamic leaders bin Laden had founded in the early '80s _ grew up
in Sudan to shelter and accommodate the new immigrants. Bin Laden
continued to finance them and to extend the training many had
already begun in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian intelligence, which had been concentrating on keeping
the Afghanis out, by maintaining tight checks on the Sudanese and
Libyan borders, realized that actually the leaks were coming from
Saudi Arabia. In April 1993, President Mubarak of Egypt made a
special visit to Riyadh to complain about bin Laden's support for
Egyptian subversives.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, the Peshawar-based Islamic terrorist groups in
Egypt increased their attacks on policemen, judges, Coptic
Christians, foreign tourists and other human targets. At the end of
May 1993, the Egyptian Interior Ministry, announcing the arrest of
more than 800 suspects and the dismantling of a major terrorist
network, added that bin Laden was financing a new group called
``Belonging to the Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   In another investigation, conducted with the Saudi authorities,
the Egyptians disclosed that the bin Laden companies were
channeling money to Egyptian rebels to buy printing presses,
weapons and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Saudi royal family decided to yield to the urgent
strictures of President Mubarak and the Americans. On April 7,
1994, after a special visit by President Mubarak to complain about
bin Laden to King Fahd, and a reported request to Interpol, the
International Police Organization, by Yemen for assistance in
apprehending bin Laden, the Saudi royal family went public.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah clearly proclaimed that hard-core Islamic
elements, preaching violence and linked to Egypt's covert groups,
were no longer welcome. King Fahd announced that bin Laden was
being stripped of citizenship ``because of his irresponsible
behavior that contradicts the interests of Saudi Arabia and harms
sisterly countries, and his refusal to obey instructions issued to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1994, Youssef M. Ibrahim of The New York Times
reported that Saudi officials had also moved to freeze bin Laden's
assets inside the kingdom, though he was ``believed to control
millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.'' The Times' report
added that the decision against bin Laden appeared to signal to
other less visible Saudi financial tycoons to cut their ties with
militants in Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, Ibrahim wrote, frequently takes the guise of
Islamic charity works, the building of mosques or the starting of
businesses that are used as channels to pump money into the
militants' war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these funds, already flowing into Pakistan and
Afghanistan since the decade of the jihad, were still being used as
late as 1997 to finance the terrorist and guerrilla training camps
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after King Fahd's action against bin Laden, some
newsmen covering the Middle East, including the author, received a
fax message originating in London. It announced that Mr. Osama bin
Laden had opened an office there. The fax bore his signature in
English and Arabic, and that of a man designated in London as his
office manager.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, bin Laden was linked to the ``Committee for Advice
and Reform,'' a London-based Saudi opposition network which, in the
later 1990s, issued more than 1,000 pamphlets and tracts attacking
the royal government and the House of Saud, often in violent terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden never publicly responded to the condemnation by his
eldest brother, Bakr bin Laden, who expressed in the Saudi media
his family's ``regret, denunciation and condemnation'' of his
younger brother's extremist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Until forced to depart from Sudan under American and Saudi
pressure in 1996, bin Laden expanded his wealth and global network
of political, banking and terrorist contacts.

</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the U.S. State Department issued a
standard and rather tardy fact sheet on Osama bin Laden. It
provided many interesting details about his career as a master of
Islamic extremism and anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But it omitted the background facts that help to explain his
early and close connections to the United States, which had
enlisted his talents and fortune to aid the attack on Communist
invaders in the Afghan holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, bin Laden met with at least four senior
radical Islamic leaders: Ayman el-Zawahri, chief of Egypt's
Al-Gihad; Abdul Salem Mohammed, chief of an extremist group in
Bangladesh; Fadi Errahmane Khalil, emir of the Pakistani Harakat
Ansar; and the Egyptian exile Abu Yassir Ahmed Taha, representing
Islamic groups in Arab North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These men and some aides set up an ``International Islamic
Struggle Front'' dedicated to fighting ``the Jews'' _ i.e., Israel
and all its friends and allies. They issued a ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence, declaring it to be legitimate to kill any American,
civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, a horrified Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, a
close boyhood friend of bin Laden, flew to Afghanistan to see
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban chief. He asked Omar to arrange a
meeting with bin Laden, who was installed near the village of
Khost, by the Pakistan border. There, Prince Turki reminded bin
Laden that although he had been deprived of Saudi citizenship, no
steps had been taken against his family in Saudi Arabia, and surely
it was time for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prince returned to Riyadh empty-handed, except for the
assurance from Omar that he would try to calm his guest. Indeed,
bin Laden offered to leave Afghanistan, if his presence was
bothering the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Omar is said to have responded. ``You are one of us,
and you will stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the real assault on America would begin. On
the morning of Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs devastated the area around
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The bombs killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. As the
world watched, the injured lay traumatized by shock, in pools of
blood. Nairobi's hospitals were crammed beyond capacity with
emergency cases: men, women and children, blinded, and mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which were perceived almost immediately to bear the
signature of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, founded
in Afghanistan in the early '80s, should not have been a surprise
to the U.S. intelligence establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A few insiders and some journalists had noted a warning that was
broadcast widely only about 24 hours before the attacks. It was not
signed by bin Laden, or Al Qaeda, or the ``International Islamic
Struggle Front,'' created months earlier for the purpose of an
anti-American jihad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Egypt's Al-Gihad, the extremist organization
responsible for President Anwar al-Sadat's murder in 1981 and much
terrorism inside Egypt, cautioned that it was about to take
reprisals against the United States. The reason, it said, was that
the CIA had aided in the arrest in Albania of several Egyptian
Islamic militants, some of whom were already condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where President Clinton was under heavy fire for
his affair with a former White House intern and perjury accusations
against him by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the U.S.
administration was suddenly galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 FBI agents and other intelligence teams and
military units, including medical rescue teams, and even Israeli
troops from Israel, were airborne for East Africa within hours.
Reports were coming in of threats to other U.S. embassies,
including those in Kampala and Tirana, Albania. Later, these and a
number of other U.S. diplomatic missions were temporarily
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, two suspects, a naturalized Kenyan of
Palestinian birth named Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohammed Rashed
Daoud al-Owhali, a Yemeni, were apprehended. Odeh was arrested in
Pakistan after flying out of Nairobi, and was returned quickly
after confessing a degree of guilt to Pakistani police. Al-Owhali
was seized in Kenya. Both were packed off in handcuffs on military
aircraft to New York, where they were charged with murder,
complicity in murder, use of munitions of massive power and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Also soon arrested was Abdullah Mohammed Fadhul, from the
Comoros, a republic of islands off East Africa. He, as did the
others, admitted belonging to bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Aug. 7 bombings, Clinton summoned his national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, and called back from Italy
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had been attending the
gala wedding of CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane
Amanpour, and State Department spokesman James Rubin. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Hugh
Shelton, and the latest of a long series of rapidly changing CIA
directors, George Tenet, were also called to join the crisis
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Clinton decided to strike back at two places
regarded as strongholds of bin Laden, implicated as the originator
of the embassy attacks by the suspect Odeh. The first strike would
be in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was in the protective custody of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   It was decided not to risk any American personnel or aircraft,
but to use the weapon already fired against Saddam Hussein in Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War: the remotely-guided Tomahawk cruise
missile.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 would be launched, from U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea
and the Indian Ocean, at three of bin Laden's camps near Khost.
There was a base camp, a support camp and a terrorist training
camp, all named Zhawar Kili Al-Badr, arranged in a rough isosceles
triangle a few miles inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, these were some of the same facilities planned and
designed by the CIA and Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI) to be used for training the holy warriors back in
the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   The second target for the missiles was the al-Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. Administration spokesmen
claimed they had firm evidence it was under bin Laden's influence,
if not financial control. They said it was cooperating with the
Iraqi chemical-weapons program and producing ethyl
methylphosphothionate, an important ingredient of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Codenamed ``Infinite Reach,'' the cruise-missile strike was
launched on Aug. 20, with varied reports back about the casualties
and damage. According to Taliban accounts, about 20 guerrilla
fighters were killed in the camps, not including bin Laden, who was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Washington sources said the United States was aware of his
absence, through its overhead satellite surveillance and electronic
monitoring of his radio-telephone traffic. Many agreed that a dead
bin Laden would be far more dangerous, rising to the status of a
martyr and stirring supporters to more frenzied acts of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After the al-Shifa raid, Sudan's government and the factory
owners unanimously and vehemently denied that the plant was used to
manufacture anything other than prescription medicines, vitamins
and other pharmaceuticals badly needed in Sudan's impoverished
society. They also denied that bin Laden had a controlling
financial interest in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later The New York Times, The Washington Post and
some Washington officials who had fed them news leaks began to back
off the story. They acknowledged that a dreadful error might have
been made in the attack on Khartoum, although Washington staunchly
resisted Sudan's demand for an on-the-spot investigation by U.N.
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1999, Salih Idris, the Saudi businessman who
owned the al-Shifa plant, was suing the U.S. government in the
Federal Court of Claims for $30 million in compensation for
destruction of his property.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late July, 17 people had been charged with roles
in the embassy bombings. Five were being held in New York for
trial; three in Britain; nine, including bin Laden, were fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, was extradited from
Germany to the United States, and charged with murder, conspiracy
and use of a weapon of mass destruction. Salim's arrest added a
nuclear aspect to the pattern of international conspiracy being
woven around bin Laden. Salim, described as a founding member of Al
Qaeda, was arrested on Sept. 16 at a car dealership outside Munich
on a tip from Interpol in Washington. He was identified as a
financial advisor and weapons procurer for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York court documents, a group including Salim
had tried to obtain components for nuclear weapons, including
enriched uranium, to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged that the bin Laden organization apparently had
tentacles into the U.S. armed forces. A former Army sergeant, Ali
A. Mohamed, was secretly arrested in September and held in the
Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ali left the U.S. Army after a three-year term in 1989. He had
earned a Parachute Badge and an expert M-16 rifleman's badge, and
taught soldiers in the U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
about Muslim culture. Earlier, in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan,
he trained members of Al Qaeda in urban and guerilla fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, 1999, Ibrahim Hussein Eidarous, 42, and Adel
Mohammed Abdul Bary, 39 _ two of bin Laden's Egyptian followers _
were rounded up and appeared in court in London. A British
magistrate said originals of faxes to three news organizations,
which claimed responsibility for the embassy blasts and bore the
men's fingerprints, were found at the London offices of a Saudi
dissident group.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect arrested in London, Khalid al-Fawwaz, a Saudi
national, allegedly agreed with bin Laden and others to kill
Americans anywhere in the world, especially diplomats and military
men.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Clinton administration officials have ordered special
alerts at U.S. installations around the world for Aug. 7, 1999, the
one-year anniversary of the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, 1999, the Afghan Islamic News Agency announced that
bin Laden, who was said to fear a Pakistan-based raid by U.S.
commando troops to capture or kill him, would leave Afghanistan for
any friendly Muslim country that would receive him.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the world was: What ruler or government
would be intrepid enough to offer protection or asylum to such a
dangerous guest?

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1998, a month after the U.S. Embassy bombings in
East Africa, FBI director Louis J. Freeh gave, in congressional
testimony, both a retrospective and a preview of official U.S.
government views about the Afghan war veterans' terrorist assault
against America.
</P>
<P>
   As lead anti-terrorist agency since 1995, the FBI was now
actively working with its new Counterterrorism Center, and a number
of other U.S. military and civilian intelligence and security
agencies, in a new permanent consultative committee operating under
tight security wraps in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Freeh cited the trend in anti-American
terrorist attacks ``toward large-scale incidents designed for
maximum destruction, terror and impact.'' He recalled how the
threat of ``jihad'' in America had finally been made real by the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that although there were no American victims in the
November '97 attack on foreign tourists at the Temple of Luxor, in
Egypt, still there were signs that the assault was meant to force
the release of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, from
prison in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh recalled that Rahman and his associates, aside from a role
in plotting the World Trade Center bombing, had been convicted in
1995 for plotting to murder President Mubarak during a visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The same group was caught red-handed mixing fertilizer and fuel
oil _ one of the old reliable recipes from the CIA manuals for
training in Afghanistan _ to make a lethal, do-it-yourself,
home-grown bomb of great power. Their goal was to destroy United
Nations buildings, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and police and
FBI headquarters, among other targets in New York. Freeh might have
added, but didn't, that they also had discussed assassinating some
leading pro-Israel congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also failed to mention the Afghanistan connection, a
subject generally taboo. Indeed, during a 1993 television
broadcast, New York's regional FBI director, Robert Fox, had
mentioned the CIA's earlier training of several of the World Trade
Center bombers _ and, by coincidence, found himself transferred
several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As for missions inside the United States, Freeh dealt with
another category of terrorism _ by ``autonomous, generally
transnational'' organizations. These have their own personnel,
financing and training facilities and are able to plan and mount
operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh noted that Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah (the Party of
God), Egypt's al-Gania'a and the Palestinian Hamas all had
supporters within the United States. Hezbollah, he recalled, had
been behind the 1983 truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine
barracks in Lebanon and the bombing of a second U.S. Embassy in
East Beirut in 1984, as well as detention of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's next category of terrorism was ``locally affiliated,''
although global in scope. Such terrorists might pose, Freeh said,
the most urgent threat because they ``are often organized on an ad
hoc, temporary basis, making them difficult for law enforcement to
infiltrate or track. They can also exploit the mobility that
technology and the lack of a rigorous base structure offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Freeh recalled, the FBI had investigated
leading ``extra-territorial'' cases of terrorism. These included
the June 25, 1996 truck-bombing of the U.S. servicemen's Khobar
Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia and, finally, the East
African bombings of August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Khobar Towers truck-bombing, which killed 19 American airmen
and wounded about 500 people, forced the relocation of Air Force
personnel still living there, in their capacity to service
overflights of Iraq and other air operations, from the Saudi
Dhahran Air Base to distant al-Kharj.
</P>
<P>
   That case remains unsolved. However, the Saudis executed four
men, who confessed to blowing up a Saudi-U.S. joint military office
facility in Riyadh on Nov. 13, 1995, killing three U.S. civilians
and two soldiers, and wounding about 60 other people including
civilian passers-by. Three of the four executed culprits, the
Saudis announced, had confessed their adherence to Osama bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also referred to terrorist ``renditions,'' by which he
meant those captured abroad and returned to the United States for
trial. He cited the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Afghan war
veteran, who ordered the chemicals for the World Trade Center
Bombing. Yousef was seized in a bin Laden-owned hotel in Pakistan
by U.S. and Pakistani agents. On Feb. 7, 1995, he was extradited to
New York for trial and later sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also cited the case of Mir Amal Kansi, 33, yet another
Afghan war veteran, who shot and killed two CIA employees outside
CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., a month before the World Trade
Center bombing. Tracked down by the FBI and probably other U.S.
services, Kansi was seized in Pakistan _ touching off reprisal
killings of several Americans in Karachi a short time later. He was
flown to the United States for trial on June 17, 1995 and sentenced
to death in Virginia, the scene of his crime. Kansi's case was
pending appeal in late July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, having finally recognized the threat
of the ``Afghanis'' _ or what some prefer to call the ``blowback''
of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war _ moved to appoint a new
anti-terrorism ``czar'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In early September 1998, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
swore in William Crowe, the former ambassador to Britain, as
chairman of two Accountability Review Boards, loaded with senior
specialists in anti-terrorism, to investigate the embassy bombings.
In a report he and Albright publicized on Jan. 8, 1999, Crowe found
no fault with U.S. security personnel, but said the United States
was correcting serious security deficiencies at U.S. embassies
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government of Pakistan, through whose airspace
the attacking U.S. Tomahawk missiles had passed on Aug. 20, fired
its intelligence chief. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
had lost face by having to retract a false report that at least one
missile landed near a Pakistani nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the blowback from Afghanistan was the
financing of the jihad, and its export, by the cultivation,
processing and traffic of drugs. By the late 1990s, a vast tide of
drugs flowing out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe, the
Americas and the Far East _ opium, morphine base and even refined
heroin, to say nothing of marijuana in various forms _ had reached
truly epic proportions. Its impact was felt from the inner cities
of America and Europe to the once-rich ``Tiger'' economies of the
Far East, as well as in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victorious Afghan leaders, who turned to
slaughtering one another after the Soviet withdrawal, had built a
huge international drug network in the 1980s. This turned the
opium-producing Golden Crescent countries _ Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan _ into an Aladdin's cave of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the expanding wealth helped to finance guerrilla wars and
terrorist actions in Algeria, Bosnia, Egypt, Kashmir, the
Philippines and other places. Second, it assured a handful of the
post-1990 terrorist leaders _ the generals and tycoons of world
terrorism _ that they'd have fabulous incomes and luxurious
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the sale and resale of U.S.-made weapons, from
rifles to Stinger missiles, and other commodities of all
descriptions, initially sent free to the Afghan holy warriors via
their Pakistani sponsors, but often reaching private arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   American weapons and munitions were diverted and abused on a
massive scale _ sold to raise funds for insurgents' field supplies,
or simply for personal profit. Even casual visitors to the bazaars
in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province keep finding these
weapons, for sale to any buyer with the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, rather than creating gratitude, the American
support for the war in Afghanistan led to aroused hatred toward
U.S. policies and fueled the assault on America led by bin Laden
and his disciples. The holy alliance of the Americans and the
Islamic forces against the Soviets would precede a series of unholy
wars and epidemics of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated Soviet invasion of 1979 would be one final error
of a dying superpower. It gave America an opening for a crusade,
conducted by Muslim mercenaries who then turned on their
benefactors and employers. But tragically, the world will continue
to experience this blowback well into the 21st century. And there
will be devastating consequences for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps future governments, whether in the United States, Great
Britain, Russia or less powerful nations, will take to heart an
important lesson of late-20th-century history: When you decide to
go to war against your main enemy, take a good look at the allies,
friends or mercenary fighters behind you. Look well to see whether
they already have unsheathed their knives _ and are pointing them
at your back.

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The woman waiting for her abortion is 20 years old, a college
student, wan and pretty, with long black hair and glasses. She
arrives for her appointment promptly at 10 a.m., neatly dressed in
pressed jeans and loafers, but her voice is shaking a little when
she signs in at the front desk and her shoulders stay hunched, in
what might be shyness or self-protection.
 &HT;    She follows the nurse-practitioner into the examining room and
lies down without being asked.
 &HT;    During the exam, she winces and cries, making hardly a sound.
But afterward, sitting up, her fingers laced together in her lap,
she is almost talkative.
 &HT;    ``Did you think about maybe keeping the baby or giving it up for
adoption?'' the nurse-practitioner asks kindly.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' says the young woman, ``but I knew I didn't want to do
that. My parents are having all kinds of financial difficulties. I
know they'd want me to finish school.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says, her voice a little stronger now, though her
sentences still end in that questioning upward lilt of late
adolescence, ``I want to finish school. I don't want to work in a
7-Eleven all my life.'' And, after a long pause: ``I want to have
kids someday, but I want to be able to take care of them so they
won't be miserable.''
 &HT;    When the nurse asks if she has been using birth control, she
says yes, she's on the pill, but she doesn't take it all that
regularly. ``My boyfriend and I want to try that injection _
Depo-Provera? _ 'cause the pill makes me sick.''
 &HT;    So far, there is nothing especially unusual about the young
woman's story. What is unusual is the kind of abortion she will
have today. For quite personal reasons, she has opted for a new
method with enormous political consequences.
 &HT;    At 10:30 a.m., she sits down with a counselor, a chatty
ex-schoolteacher, to hear about the procedure she is about to
undertake as part of a clinical trial. Then a nurse guides her into
another room, points her to the only chair and gives her a cup of
water and a tablet of mifepristone _ better known as RU-486, or the
French abortion pill.
 &HT;    ``Here goes!'' the young woman says. She knows there is no
turning back once she takes the pill. It will begin to work right
away, blocking the effects of her body's progesterone, a hormone
needed for the fertilized egg to sustain itself in the wall of her
uterus.
 &HT;    Looking calmer now, she grabs her backpack and heads downstairs
to find her boyfriend, who has been waiting for her in the lobby.
Together, they go home.
 &HT;    Within about 72 hours (in other cases, it is 48 or fewer), she
will find someplace private and comfortable to lie down _ probably
her own bed _ and vaginally insert four tablets of a medication
called misoprostol. The tablets will trigger uterine contractions.
She will cramp and bleed _ perhaps heavily.
 &HT;    When I ask her how she will manage the pain, she says her
boyfriend will read to her or tell her stories; he'll curl up next
to her and stroke her hair. She figures that and some Tylenol with
codeine should get her through.
 &HT;    About four hours later, in all likelihood, her body will expel
the uterine lining and with it a gestational sac. Because it has
been barely six weeks since her last period _ which means it has
been about four weeks since the union of egg and sperm _ the embryo
will be tiny, about five millimeters, or the size of a grain of
rice.
 &HT;    It will not look like a baby. The sac itself will look like a
miniature ball of gauze, whitish and fuzzy, and be one or two
centimeters wide. The incipient life she is now carrying will still
be considered an embryo, not a fetus.
 &HT;    All of this matters to the young woman _ a lot. In the examining
room, she twice asks the nurse-practitioner what ``it'' looks like
at this point.
 &HT;    ``When does it start looking like a person?'' she asks. ``When
can you see a face?''
 &HT;    She wants to know about brain waves (not yet measurable) and the
presence or absence of a beating heart (it's there, in rudimentary
form). She called for her appointment here the very morning she did
her at-home pregnancy test. That this is a method designed solely
for early pregnancy _ from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant
to about nine weeks _ appeals to her almost as much, if not more
than, the fact that it allows her to avoid a surgical abortion.
 &HT;    Surgery scares her. ``Invasive'' is the word she uses, and she
shudders when she says it. But there will be no surgery for her _
unless this is one of those rare cases (about 2 percent, according
to the latest clinical trials of mifepristone) when abortion by
medication does not work and vacuum aspiration by machine, the most
common method of abortion now, becomes necessary after all.
 &HT;    And there will be no trek to a clinic, where anyone watching her
enter and leave could make a reasonable surmise about her business
there. No protesters to dodge, no one shouting ``baby killer.''
 &HT;    The office she is visiting today is tucked deep in a sprawling
hospital complex in Rochester, N.Y., where she lives. Hundreds of
people come and go here all day for everything from vaccinations to
gall-bladder operations to visits with hospitalized friends. And
the doctor this young woman sees isn't even an OB-GYN. He's a
pediatrician who developed an interest in medical abortion while
treating pregnant teen-agers and who has lately been conducting
research on mifepristone. How could even the most enterprising
anti-abortion picketer figure out whom to buttonhole?
 &HT;    It now seems fair to say that this is the shape of abortion to
come. After a decade of struggle to bring RU-486 to the United
States _ a decade of setbacks and small advances during which
right-to-life politicians tried to ban the Food and Drug
Administration from even provisionally approving it, right-to-life
groups vowed to fight it and the big pharmaceutical companies
loudly refused to go near it _ a small pharmaceutical company, the
Danco Group, backed by a deliberately low-profile consortium of
investors, has announced definite plans to manufacture the drug and
market it for the general public by the end of this year.
 &HT;    This is the breakthrough pro-choice activists have been waiting
and working for ever since they first heard about the French
abortion pill, the one they have tried to achieve through
strategies ranging from the bluntly political to the ingeniously
covert.
 &HT;    By the late '80s, Carl Djerassi, the Stanford chemist and
leading contraceptive researcher, was touting RU-486 as the only
real discovery in fertility control since the pill. Women's
magazines were triumphantly announcing its imminent arrival at your
local Planned Parenthood. Yet for years production and distribution
in this country hit snag after snag.
 &HT;    When the French manufacturer, Roussel-Uclaf, and its parent
company, Hoechst A.G. of Germany, refused to sell RU-486 here,
American feminists organized picket lines outside Hoechst plants in
this country and flew delegations to Paris to lobby company
officials. It didn't work.
 &HT;    By then, the pope himself had denounced RU-486 as the ``pill of
Cain _ the monster that cynically kills its brothers,'' and Hoechst
feared boycotts of its products in the United States, where it does
more than $6 billion worth of business.
 &HT;    Moreover, Hoechst had particular reason to be touchy. It was one
of three corporations that emerged from the breakup of I.G. Farben,
the German chemical company that manufactured the cyanide gas,
Zyklon B, for Nazi death camps, and Hoechst was sensitive to
charges that it was again manufacturing what one right-to-life
group called ``a human pesticide.''
 &HT;    In 1988, in the face of opposition from anti-abortion groups and
Catholic bishops in France, Hoechst's subsidiary, Roussel,
announced it would drop the drug entirely. Only after the French
Health Minister declared RU-486 ``the moral property of women'' and
ordered Roussel to bring it to market, did the company do so. In
the United States, where abortion is a far more volatile issue,
Hoechst seemed determined to stay out of the fray.
 &HT;    ``We've been petitioned, we've been yelled at and we've been
telephoned by everybody,'' Edward Norton, the spokesman for
Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, said in 1990. ``But
our formal position hasn't changed in two years, and I don't expect
it to change.''
 &HT;    During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the FDA classified
RU-486 as a banned drug, effectively halting all Federal research
on it, and pro-choicers decided they would resort to more
unconventional means.
 &HT;    In 1992, a pregnant 29-year-old social worker named Leona Benten
tried to challenge the law by bringing her own personal stash of
RU-486 into the country from England, only to see it confiscated by
U.S. Customs. The Supreme Court heard Benten's appeal (but upheld
the confiscation) just 16 days after she arrived at JFK accompanied
by the abortion-rights activist Lawrence Lader.
 &HT;    Next, Lader and his organization, Abortion Rights Mobilization
(ARM), fixed on the daring idea of making the pill themselves,
using published patents. In 1993, they rented part of a warehouse
in a Westchester County suburb and, unbeknown to the landlord, set
up what was in effect an underground drug lab, complete with
plentiful dry ice, an oversize ventilation hood and a volunteer
scientist who agreed to moonlight there only if he could be known
to his new colleagues as Dr. X, for fear of reprisals from
anti-abortion extremists.
 &HT;    If outsiders questioned them, project members agreed to say they
had been working on a new treatment for cancer, Lader recalls in
his book, ``A Private Matter: RU-486 and the Abortion Crisis.''
 &HT;    Even logistically, it was a complicated process; the synthesis
of mifepristone involved 10 separate steps, and since the equipment
Lader and his colleagues could afford wasn't really big enough for
the task, each step had to be repeated many times.
 &HT;    Yet by 1994 ARM had developed its own copy of the drug, and by
1997 Lader was announcing plans to offer mifepristone to as many as
10,000 women. ARM would donate the supply to clinics conducting
research on it.
 &HT;    Still, the only real hope for a more reliable source of
mifespristone, and for FDA approval, lay in persuading Hoechst to
give up its patent on the drug or else start making it itself. Soon
after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, his administration had
begun exerting pressure on Roussel-Uclaf, and in 1994, the company,
which stopped manufacturing the drug in 1997, donated the U.S.
rights to the Population Council, a New York-based nonprofit
organization that promotes reproductive health.
 &HT;    Now the day is at hand when RU-486 will at last be widely
available _ and we can see for ourselves whether a significant
change in abortion technology really can transform the abortion
debate.
 &HT;    To talk to the doctors and nurses and patients who have been
using this method over the last few years is to be persuaded that
it may well reconfigure the politics and perception of abortion in
this country more definitively than any piece of legislation has in
the quarter century since Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    As Suzanne Poppema, a Seattle doctor who has participated in
both of the major clinical trials of mifepristone in the United
States, puts it, ``This method is the best means we've had yet for
defusing the abortion conflict.''
 &HT;    Her optimism seems well founded. Not only are mifepristone
abortions, by nature, more discreet than their surgical equivalents
(such as vacuum aspiration), but the practitioners who prescribe
them will almost certainly constitute a larger and a more varied
group than the dwindling corps of OB-GYNs willing to do surgical
abortions.
 &HT;    In 1998, for example, when the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
polled family practitioners about their interest in using
mifepristone once it was approved and available, 45 percent of
doctors responding said they were ``very'' or ``somewhat'' likely
to do so. Fifty-four percent of nurse-practitioners and physician
assistants expressed interest in offering the drug. Yet only 3
percent of the physicians in the study and 2 percent of the
practitioners and assistants had performed surgical abortions.
 &HT;    Similarly, in a 1996 survey of doctors who belong to the Society
for Adolescent Medicine, 42 percent said they would prescribe legal
medical abortion, though only 2 percent currently offered the
surgical option.
 &HT;    The potential for expanding the number of abortion providers in
rural areas is perhaps even more dramatic. One 1995 study, for
example, found that while less than 4 percent of all OB-GYNs,
family practitioners and general surgeons practicing in rural Idaho
performed abortions, 26 percent said they would definitely be
interested in prescribing RU-486, and another 35 percent were
uncertain.
 &HT;    ``One of my real, and I think realistic, hopes for this
method,'' says Carolyn Westhoff, an OB-GYN at Columbia University
medical school who offers medical abortion as part of a clinical
trial, ``is that it will help get abortion back into the medical
mainstream and out of this ghettoized place it's been in.''
 &HT;    And if that is indeed the scenario we're looking at - a scenario
in which abortion is folded far more seamlessly into regular
medical practice - then it has implications not only for women's
experience of abortion but for the politics of abortion as well.
 &HT;    At the very least, it will present the right-to-life movement
with new tactical challenges. If abortions are taking place in all
kinds of medical settings, and at home, then abortion clinics can
no longer be the potent symbols they have become over the last
decade.
 &HT;    Mifepristone is also an abortifacient that can be used very
early in pregnancy - earlier, by as many as five weeks, than
surgical abortions have typically been offered. Along with other
new methods, including a less practical but already FDA-approved
drug called methotrexate and a newly revived technique called
manual vacuum aspiration, mifepristone pushes back the time at
which women can get abortions - back as far as the point at which
sophisticated new home-pregnancy tests can first tell them they are
pregnant.
 &HT;    ``The other question then,'' says Carole Joffe, a sociologist at
the University of California at Davis who has been studying the
probable response of doctors to mifepristone ``is, Will abortion
become more socially acceptable in this country if these
technologies help to make more and more abortions happen earlier
and earlier?''
 &HT;    Abortions in the earliest weeks of pregnancy are not only safer,
cheaper and less emotionally wrenching for the women who undergo
them, they are also more politically tenable.
 &HT;    A 1998 New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 61 percent of
Americans favor legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy,
but that support drops precipitously as pregnancy develops, down to
15 percent in the second trimester and a mere 7 percent in the
third.
 &HT;    ``For most Americans, as opposed to most of the right-to-life
movement,'' says Cory Richards, the vice president for public
policy at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the family-planning think
tank, ``an abortion at 3 weeks is a very different thing from an
abortion at 23 weeks. Earlier is better, and prevention is better
yet.''

 &HT;    By then, the pope himself had denounced RU-486 as the ``pill of
Cain _ the monster that cynically kills its brothers,'' and Hoechst
feared boycotts of its products in the United States, where it does
more than $6 billion worth of business.
 &HT;    Moreover, Hoechst had particular reason to be touchy. It was one
of three corporations that emerged from the breakup of I.G. Farben,
the German chemical company that manufactured the cyanide gas,
Zyklon B, for Nazi death camps, and Hoechst was sensitive to
charges that it was again manufacturing what one right-to-life
group called ``a human pesticide.''
 &HT;    In 1988, in the face of opposition from anti-abortion groups and
Catholic bishops in France, Hoechst's subsidiary, Roussel,
announced it would drop the drug entirely. Only after the French
Health Minister declared RU-486 ``the moral property of women'' and
ordered Roussel to bring it to market, did the company do so. In
the United States, where abortion is a far more volatile issue,
Hoechst seemed determined to stay out of the fray.
 &HT;    ``We've been petitioned, we've been yelled at and we've been
telephoned by everybody,'' Edward Norton, the spokesman for
Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, said in 1990. ``But
our formal position hasn't changed in two years, and I don't expect
it to change.''
 &HT;    During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the FDA classified
RU-486 as a banned drug, effectively halting all Federal research
on it, and pro-choicers decided they would resort to more
unconventional means.
 &HT;    In 1992, a pregnant 29-year-old social worker named Leona Benten
tried to challenge the law by bringing her own personal stash of
RU-486 into the country from England, only to see it confiscated by
U.S. Customs. The Supreme Court heard Benten's appeal (but upheld
the confiscation) just 16 days after she arrived at JFK accompanied
by the abortion-rights activist Lawrence Lader.
 &HT;    Next, Lader and his organization, Abortion Rights Mobilization
(ARM), fixed on the daring idea of making the pill themselves,
using published patents. In 1993, they rented part of a warehouse
in a Westchester County suburb and, unbeknown to the landlord, set
up what was in effect an underground drug lab, complete with
plentiful dry ice, an oversize ventilation hood and a volunteer
scientist who agreed to moonlight there only if he could be known
to his new colleagues as Dr. X, for fear of reprisals from
anti-abortion extremists.
 &HT;    If outsiders questioned them, project members agreed to say they
had been working on a new treatment for cancer, Lader recalls in
his book, ``A Private Matter: RU-486 and the Abortion Crisis.''
 &HT;    Even logistically, it was a complicated process; the synthesis
of mifepristone involved 10 separate steps, and since the equipment
Lader and his colleagues could afford wasn't really big enough for
the task, each step had to be repeated many times.
 &HT;    Yet by 1994 ARM had developed its own copy of the drug, and by
1997 Lader was announcing plans to offer mifepristone to as many as
10,000 women. ARM would donate the supply to clinics conducting
research on it.
 &HT;    Still, the only real hope for a more reliable source of
mifespristone, and for FDA approval, lay in persuading Hoechst to
give up its patent on the drug or else start making it itself. Soon
after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, his administration had
begun exerting pressure on Roussel-Uclaf, and in 1994, the company,
which stopped manufacturing the drug in 1997, donated the U.S.
rights to the Population Council, a New York-based nonprofit
organization that promotes reproductive health.
 &HT;    Now the day is at hand when RU-486 will at last be widely
available _ and we can see for ourselves whether a significant
change in abortion technology really can transform the abortion
debate.
 &HT;    To talk to the doctors and nurses and patients who have been
using this method over the last few years is to be persuaded that
it may well reconfigure the politics and perception of abortion in
this country more definitively than any piece of legislation has in
the quarter century since Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    As Suzanne Poppema, a Seattle doctor who has participated in
both of the major clinical trials of mifepristone in the United
States, puts it, ``This method is the best means we've had yet for
defusing the abortion conflict.''
 &HT;    Her optimism seems well founded. Not only are mifepristone
abortions, by nature, more discreet than their surgical equivalents
(such as vacuum aspiration), but the practitioners who prescribe
them will almost certainly constitute a larger and a more varied
group than the dwindling corps of OB-GYNs willing to do surgical
abortions.
 &HT;    In 1998, for example, when the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
polled family practitioners about their interest in using
mifepristone once it was approved and available, 45 percent of
doctors responding said they were ``very'' or ``somewhat'' likely
to do so. Fifty-four percent of nurse-practitioners and physician
assistants expressed interest in offering the drug. Yet only 3
percent of the physicians in the study and 2 percent of the
practitioners and assistants had performed surgical abortions.
 &HT;    Similarly, in a 1996 survey of doctors who belong to the Society
for Adolescent Medicine, 42 percent said they would prescribe legal
medical abortion, though only 2 percent currently offered the
surgical option.
 &HT;    The potential for expanding the number of abortion providers in
rural areas is perhaps even more dramatic. One 1995 study, for
example, found that while less than 4 percent of all OB-GYNs,
family practitioners and general surgeons practicing in rural Idaho
performed abortions, 26 percent said they would definitely be
interested in prescribing RU-486, and another 35 percent were
uncertain.
 &HT;    ``One of my real, and I think realistic, hopes for this
method,'' says Carolyn Westhoff, an OB-GYN at Columbia University
medical school who offers medical abortion as part of a clinical
trial, ``is that it will help get abortion back into the medical
mainstream and out of this ghettoized place it's been in.''
 &HT;    And if that is indeed the scenario we're looking at - a scenario
in which abortion is folded far more seamlessly into regular
medical practice - then it has implications not only for women's
experience of abortion but for the politics of abortion as well.
 &HT;    At the very least, it will present the right-to-life movement
with new tactical challenges. If abortions are taking place in all
kinds of medical settings, and at home, then abortion clinics can
no longer be the potent symbols they have become over the last
decade.
 &HT;    Mifepristone is also an abortifacient that can be used very
early in pregnancy - earlier, by as many as five weeks, than
surgical abortions have typically been offered. Along with other
new methods, including a less practical but already FDA-approved
drug called methotrexate and a newly revived technique called
manual vacuum aspiration, mifepristone pushes back the time at
which women can get abortions - back as far as the point at which
sophisticated new home-pregnancy tests can first tell them they are
pregnant.
 &HT;    ``The other question then,'' says Carole Joffe, a sociologist at
the University of California at Davis who has been studying the
probable response of doctors to mifepristone ``is, Will abortion
become more socially acceptable in this country if these
technologies help to make more and more abortions happen earlier
and earlier?''
 &HT;    Abortions in the earliest weeks of pregnancy are not only safer,
cheaper and less emotionally wrenching for the women who undergo
them, they are also more politically tenable.
 &HT;    A 1998 New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 61 percent of
Americans favor legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy,
but that support drops precipitously as pregnancy develops, down to
15 percent in the second trimester and a mere 7 percent in the
third.
 &HT;    ``For most Americans, as opposed to most of the right-to-life
movement,'' says Cory Richards, the vice president for public
policy at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the family-planning think
tank, ``an abortion at 3 weeks is a very different thing from an
abortion at 23 weeks. Earlier is better, and prevention is better
yet.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: World rights, except for the UK, until further notice  
 &HT;    Before John Myatt was sentenced to prison in February for his
part as a forger in perhaps the most ingenious and damaging art con
of the 20th century, he lived in a humble cottage on a narrow lane
in the idyllic Staffordshire village of Sugnall, a three-hour drive
northwest of London.
 &HT;    To his neighbors, he appeared to be an unremarkable painter who
had never established a style with which to spawn a career.
 &HT;    He also wrote catchy pop tunes. If Myatt was known for anything,
it was for a hit single, ``Silly Games,'' which made the British
Top 40 in 1979.
 &HT;    But beginning in 1986, Myatt discovered that he could paint like
the masters, and for the next nine years he led a secret and
stunningly successful professional life as a painter.
 &HT;    Braque, Matisse, Giacometti, Le Corbusier, all became part of
his repertoire. He faked their styles with such virtuosity that his
paintings passed for the real thing.
 &HT;    Then, one morning in September 1995, Myatt opened his front door
to walk his young son to the school bus and found policemen in his
yard. A plainclothes officer introduced himself as Jonathan Searle,
a one-time painter, restorer and art historian, and now detective
sergeant at Scotland Yard.
 &HT;    Myatt, 50, sturdily built with the toughened hands of a laborer,
nodded with resigned expectancy and invited the policemen inside
for tea. Then he asked if could walk his son to the bus.
 &HT;    While he did, the officers ransacked the house. Upon returning,
Myatt stood in the studio with Searle, surveying the chaos.
 &HT;    ``Do you like this one?'' Myatt asked, pointing to a competent
if undistinguished drawing of his son.
 &HT;    Searle nodded sympathetically, but was amazed by what looked to
be paintings by Giacometti, Chagall, Braque and Dubuffet hanging
about the room. Drawing pads lying around showed sketched studies
for works by Giacometti, Le Corbusier and Ben Nicholson.
 &HT;    Myatt confessed on the spot to having drawn and painted what the
police later said were about 200 forgeries in the styles of nine
modern masters and personally delivering them to London, one
roughly every six weeks, to a man by the name of John Drewe.
 &HT;    Scotland Yard already suspected Drewe of masterminding the sale
of Myatt's forgeries (and perhaps those of at least one other
painter, still unidentified) through the auction houses Christie's,
Sotheby's and Phillips, as well as reputable dealers in London,
Paris and New York.
 &HT;    Then Myatt told Searle something the police didn't know: that
he'd made most of the pictures out of an easily detectable
household emulsion paint developed in the mid-'60s, decades after
most of the paintings were supposed to have been executed. In some
cases, he used K-Y Jelly as a medium to add body and fluidity to
his brushstrokes.
 &HT;    Myatt had no idea how many millions had changed hands on account
of his paintings, but estimated that he had earned as much as
$165,000 over the years, some of which was deposited into a Swiss
bank account in his name. The painter immediately offered to return
the $30,000 he still had and to help snare Drewe.
 &HT;    Seven months later, on April 6, 1996, after recording
conversations between the partners, detectives raided Drewe's home
in the tony London suburb of Reigate, where they found hundreds of
documents from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery and
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
 &HT;    Sitting on Drewe's kitchen table were two catalogues missing
from the V. and A.'s National Art Library, still in the museum bag
that Drewe had used to smuggle them out. There were rubber stamps
bearing the authenticating seals of the Tate and of an order of
monastic priests; receipts for the sale of paintings across
continents going back decades; certificates of authenticity from
the estates of Dubuffet and Giacometti; also the more mundane
instruments of document forgery: scissors, razors, correction
fluid, glue, tape.
 &HT;    As police and art experts soon discovered, forging masterpieces,
as Myatt had done, was the least of it. Drewe's real genius lay in
his ability to authenticate Myatt's works through bogus provenances
_ the history of a work of art, from its creation through its
purchasings and exhibitions to its current ownership, crucial
elements in the sale of any picture.
 &HT;    It would turn out that over the previous 10 years, Drewe had
systematically infiltrated some of the most security-conscious art
archives in the world, altering the provenances of genuine
paintings to establish a lineage making way for Myatt's mostly
unexceptional forgeries, and then seeding the collections with
false records that provided the pictures with instant heritage. The
scale of the corruption is unprecedented. The method is too.
 &HT;    Archivists may never know how much of their libraries have been
compromised. Of the approximately 200 ``masterworks'' Myatt painted
and Drewe sold, the police have located only 73. Drewe did more
than slip phony pictures into a market hungry for important
contemporary art _ he altered art history.
 &HT;    The police call the con ``the biggest contemporary art fraud the
20th century has seen.'' The British prosecution office declared
Drewe a menace to Britain's cultural patrimony.
 &HT;    The scandal has not only upset the market for the artists Myatt
forged, but it has also exposed the art industry as its own worst
enemy _ too reliant on sources of authenticity that are vulnerable
to manipulation and riddled with conflicts of interest that invite
corruption.
 &HT;    Drewe's story says less about his own brilliance than about the
readiness _ if not the willingness _ of the art world to be
deceived.
 &HT;    ``It's one of the most extensive frauds in the visual arts,''
says Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. ``What
distinguishes this case is how methodical Drewe was, and how well
he understood the process of validation. His manipulation of the
system is as interesting and troubling as the forgeries
themselves.''
 &HT;    When Drewe found him, Myatt's life was in wretched shape,
emotionally and financially. His wife had recently abandoned him
and their two young children, and he was left to scratch out a
meager living teaching art in the local schools.
 &HT;    ``I spent all day teaching other people's children and had no
time for my own,'' he told me this spring in Brixton Prison, in
southwest London, where he was serving a one-year sentence for
conspiracy to defraud. (He was released in June.) ``I wasn't doing
my own painting. I needed to find a way to work at home.''
 &HT;    A few years before, a friend had offered to pay him $400 to copy
a painting by the French Post-Impressionist Raoul Dufy. He copied
the picture and Dufy's signature so masterfully that his friend
told him his painting was fooling art experts.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was funny,'' Myatt says with a shrug, insisting
he didn't give it another thought until he became desperate to stay
at home with his children. In 1986, he placed a classified ad in
Private Eye, a satirical London biweekly: ``19th- and 20th-century
fakes for $240.''
 &HT;    He received a call from a ``Professor Drewe,'' who said he was a
nuclear physicist in need of paintings to decorate his home. Drewe
asked first for a Matisse, then a Klee, then two marine paintings
in the style of 17th-century Dutch masters.
 &HT;    Myatt would meet Drewe at London's Euston Station to deliver the
rolled canvases. They'd have a pint together. Myatt began to
confide in Drewe about the turmoil of his divorce. Drewe offered
advice and comfort and eventually invited him to his home. ``I saw
the size of his house,'' Myatt says, ``his Mercedes, his clothes,
his manner.''
 &HT;    Drewe told Myatt that in addition to his work for the Ministry
of Defense, he was associated with British Intelligence. He pulled
back his jacket to reveal two pistols in shoulder holsters.
 &HT;    ``I was very much your creature,'' Myatt would later say to
Drewe in court. ``I found you hypnotizing and challenging and a
very exciting person to be around.'' One day Drewe asked Myatt what
style he wanted to paint in. Myatt told Drewe he'd always relished
the idea of painting in the Cubist style. Myatt soon painted Drewe
a Braque.
 &HT;    One evening in 1986, Drewe called Myatt with news. ``'I took one
of your paintings to Christie's, and they said it was worth
$38,000,''' Myatt recalls Drewe as saying. ``That was the moment
that the legitimate business stopped and the crime began. He said
to come down to London and we'll talk it over. I said: 'I can't
believe it. Are you aware it's painted in emulsion paint?''' He
pauses. ``My vanity was quite ghastly,'' he says. ``The mistake
occurred here. My reaction was to express an interest.''
 &HT;    Drewe's timing, in many ways, couldn't have been better. By the
mid-'80s, the art market was generating unprecedented profits and
front-page headlines.
 &HT;    Jasper Johns' ``False Start,'' which cost $3,150 in 1960, sold
for $17 million in 1988. Picasso's ``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.9
million in 1989, more than twice the preauction estimate. In 1990,
Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' a painting whose
authenticity is still controversial, was bought by a Japanese
collector for a record $82.5 million. The prices of pictures even
by obscure artists skyrocketed. Myatt's ``masterpieces'' were
suddenly hot commodities.
 &HT;    The painter took trips to Coventry Cathedral to copy Graham
Sutherland's studies for his huge tapestry of Christ in His glory.
He meditated on Giacometti reproductions, then took five hours to
paint a picture that eventually sold for $175,000.
 &HT;    Myatt moved on to Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Stael, Le Corbusier,
Matisse, Roger Bissiere, glorying in painting his way through
20th-century art history. His unorthodox formula of emulsion and
K-Y Jelly was fast-drying, allowing him to paint quickly, if
obsessively. ``I took no trouble technically,'' he says. ``There
was a negligence to everything I did.''
 &HT;    Even so, his pictures were passing as genuine and selling for
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was enjoying a
financial success he could never have approached by painting
Myatts. Perhaps no other forger of his or any other time has worked
so prodigiously and in so many styles.
 &HT;    ``It was a kind of addiction,'' he says, then shakes his head
sadly. ``It was shocking, it quite terrified me. The moment they
started to restore them they would know what they were faced
with.''
 &HT;    But Drewe calmed his nerves by telling Myatt, who a year before
had been lovelorn and broke, how brilliant he was, how rich he
would get. ``I was flattered into thinking I was a man of
importance,'' Myatt says, although he concedes he had an ``abiding
sense of unreality, that this wasn't really happening, that this
would all end in tears.''
 &HT;    Before Myatt, the most successful forgers of our time counted on
the brute force of their pictures, imitating one or two giants of
art so that the paintings' discovery would be splashy news, the
reclamation of a ``lost masterpiece.''
 &HT;    Hans van Meegeren aped Vermeer in the 1930s and '40s; the
flamboyant Tom Keating did Rembrandt in the 1950s, and Eric Hebborn
copied Augustus John, Corot and others of their ilk.
 &HT;    Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult
to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and
auction houses, is usually kept secret to boost public confidence
in the art market.
 &HT;    Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, has said that during his tenure, a full 40 percent of the
artworks considered for purchase by the museum were phony or
overrestored. Geraldine Norman, the British art journalist credited
with exposing Keating and Hebborn, says that at least 10 percent of
the pictures purportedly made by major Impressionists are fake.
 &HT;    Some experts say that as much as 60 percent of the Giacomettis
on the market are fake, at least in part as a result of Drewe's
con. Forty percent of pictures supposedly from the Russian
avant-garde era are almost certainly forgeries. The widows of
Modigliani and Chagall were accused of selling certificates of
authentication.
 &HT;    Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to
have been fed thousands of sheets of blank paper to sign for fake
lithographs. In a grotesquely sad twist, the Italian painter
Giorgio de Chirico was caught back-dating new pictures to a time,
20 years previously, when his work was popular and in heavy demand,
in effect forging himself.
 &HT;    Modern art, in particular, seems especially vulnerable to fraud.
Its abstractions are sometimes difficult to understand or grasp,
and a modern painting is often loved less because of its intrinsic
quality _ its beauty, as conventionally understood _ than because
of the identity of the painter, its mark of social status.
 &HT;    Says Hoving: ``When the collector gets what he wants and he's
told it isn't real, he says, 'I don't care, to me it's a Renoir.'''
Even though one forged Giacometti, a 1955 ``Nu Debout'' Drewe sold
to two New York dealers, is obviously lacking in the artist's
typical depth of field and manic linearity, one of the dealers
maintains, ``I still think it's one of the best Giacomettis I've
ever seen.''
 &HT;    As Geraldine Norman puts it, many collectors' interests in art
``are reflections of social climbing and romanticism about names, a
thousand things that have nothing to do with the surface of the
work of art you are looking at.''
 &HT;    A forger's chief motivation is typically intellectual
gamesmanship. Embittered by the spurning of his own work, he takes
satisfaction in suckering the entire art world en masse, then
pulling aside the curtain, exposing himself as a renegade genius
and the art experts as the frauds and fools.
 &HT;    Drewe had a different strategy: to deliver low-profile paintings
in high volume, make multiple hits for hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ which would not attract unwanted attention _ rather than
a few jackpots worth millions.
 &HT;    In fact, Drewe changed and fabricated so many records at both
the Victoria and Albert and the Tate, and with so many different
artists, that the directors of both museums admit that they may
never know how much of their collection has been corrupted.
 &HT;    And the scandal has reverberated in the United States. Lowry,
for one, is deeply concerned about MOMA. ``We take our role as a
public institution very seriously,'' he says. ``That means
providing as much access as possible to research documents. The
thought that we have to think about restricting access is
profoundly troubling.''
 &HT;    Once Drewe was discovered, Lowry says, a process of reverse
screenings took place on both sides of the Atlantic. Records were
scoured, paintings were re-examined, all to purge the system. ``It
will take years, probably, before it is fully accomplished,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Drew is now serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy to
defraud and multiple counts of forgery; he is appealing his
conviction.
 &HT;    If his success provides any lesson, it is that the art world's
aura of sophistication creates a false sense of security that makes
it especially vulnerable to what was, in the end, a confederacy of
mediocrity.
 &HT;    Myatt's sloppy pictures and Drewe's litany of far-fetched cons
should have been no match for such sophisticated auction houses,
scholars and dealers. But in the end, the system's multiple lines
of defense _ dealers, galleries, auction houses, museums, archives,
world-class experts _ proved all too permeable.
 &HT;    Yet, one might ask, if a picture brings esthetic pleasure and is
beloved before its fictitious pedigree is exposed, and the only
person who loses money is a collector probably wealthy enough to
absorb the loss, then where exactly is the problem?
 &HT;    As Van Meegeren said at his 1947 trial for forgery about a
Vermeer he had faked: ``Yesterday this picture was worth millions
of guilders, and experts and art lovers would come from all over
the world and pay money to see it. Today, it is worth nothing, and
nobody would cross the street to see it for free. But the picture
has not changed. What has?''

 &HT;    Then, one morning in September 1995, Myatt opened his front door
to walk his young son to the school bus and found policemen in his
yard. A plainclothes officer introduced himself as Jonathan Searle,
a one-time painter, restorer and art historian, and now detective
sergeant at Scotland Yard.
 &HT;    Myatt, 50, sturdily built with the toughened hands of a laborer,
nodded with resigned expectancy and invited the policemen inside
for tea. Then he asked if could walk his son to the bus.
 &HT;    While he did, the officers ransacked the house. Upon returning,
Myatt stood in the studio with Searle, surveying the chaos.
 &HT;    ``Do you like this one?'' Myatt asked, pointing to a competent
if undistinguished drawing of his son.
 &HT;    Searle nodded sympathetically, but was amazed by what looked to
be paintings by Giacometti, Chagall, Braque and Dubuffet hanging
about the room. Drawing pads lying around showed sketched studies
for works by Giacometti, Le Corbusier and Ben Nicholson.
 &HT;    Myatt confessed on the spot to having drawn and painted what the
police later said were about 200 forgeries in the styles of nine
modern masters and personally delivering them to London, one
roughly every six weeks, to a man by the name of John Drewe.
 &HT;    Scotland Yard already suspected Drewe of masterminding the sale
of Myatt's forgeries (and perhaps those of at least one other
painter, still unidentified) through the auction houses Christie's,
Sotheby's and Phillips, as well as reputable dealers in London,
Paris and New York.
 &HT;    Then Myatt told Searle something the police didn't know: that
he'd made most of the pictures out of an easily detectable
household emulsion paint developed in the mid-'60s, decades after
most of the paintings were supposed to have been executed. In some
cases, he used K-Y Jelly as a medium to add body and fluidity to
his brushstrokes.
 &HT;    Myatt had no idea how many millions had changed hands on account
of his paintings, but estimated that he had earned as much as
$165,000 over the years, some of which was deposited into a Swiss
bank account in his name. The painter immediately offered to return
the $30,000 he still had and to help snare Drewe.
 &HT;    Seven months later, on April 6, 1996, after recording
conversations between the partners, detectives raided Drewe's home
in the tony London suburb of Reigate, where they found hundreds of
documents from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery and
the Institute of Contemporary Art.
 &HT;    Sitting on Drewe's kitchen table were two catalogues missing
from the V. and A.'s National Art Library, still in the museum bag
that Drewe had used to smuggle them out. There were rubber stamps
bearing the authenticating seals of the Tate and of an order of
monastic priests; receipts for the sale of paintings across
continents going back decades; certificates of authenticity from
the estates of Dubuffet and Giacometti; also the more mundane
instruments of document forgery: scissors, razors, correction
fluid, glue, tape.
 &HT;    As police and art experts soon discovered, forging masterpieces,
as Myatt had done, was the least of it. Drewe's real genius lay in
his ability to authenticate Myatt's works through bogus provenances
_ the history of a work of art, from its creation through its
purchasings and exhibitions to its current ownership, crucial
elements in the sale of any picture.
 &HT;    It would turn out that over the previous 10 years, Drewe had
systematically infiltrated some of the most security-conscious art
archives in the world, altering the provenances of genuine
paintings to establish a lineage making way for Myatt's mostly
unexceptional forgeries, and then seeding the collections with
false records that provided the pictures with instant heritage. The
scale of the corruption is unprecedented. The method is too.
 &HT;    Archivists may never know how much of their libraries have been
compromised. Of the approximately 200 ``masterworks'' Myatt painted
and Drewe sold, the police have located only 73. Drewe did more
than slip phony pictures into a market hungry for important
contemporary art _ he altered art history.
 &HT;    The police call the con ``the biggest contemporary art fraud the
20th century has seen.'' The British prosecution office declared
Drewe a menace to Britain's cultural patrimony.
 &HT;    The scandal has not only upset the market for the artists Myatt
forged, but it has also exposed the art industry as its own worst
enemy _ too reliant on sources of authenticity that are vulnerable
to manipulation and riddled with conflicts of interest that invite
corruption.
 &HT;    Drewe's story says less about his own brilliance than about the
readiness _ if not the willingness _ of the art world to be
deceived.
 &HT;    ``It's one of the most extensive frauds in the visual arts,''
says Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. ``What
distinguishes this case is how methodical Drewe was, and how well
he understood the process of validation. His manipulation of the
system is as interesting and troubling as the forgeries
themselves.''
 &HT;    When Drewe found him, Myatt's life was in wretched shape,
emotionally and financially. His wife had recently abandoned him
and their two young children, and he was left to scratch out a
meager living teaching art in the local schools.
 &HT;    ``I spent all day teaching other people's children and had no
time for my own,'' he told me this spring in Brixton Prison, in
southwest London, where he was serving a one-year sentence for
conspiracy to defraud. (He was released in June.) ``I wasn't doing
my own painting. I needed to find a way to work at home.''
 &HT;    A few years before, a friend had offered to pay him $400 to copy
a painting by the French Post-Impressionist Raoul Dufy. He copied
the picture and Dufy's signature so masterfully that his friend
told him his painting was fooling art experts.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was funny,'' Myatt says with a shrug, insisting
he didn't give it another thought until he became desperate to stay
at home with his children. In 1986, he placed a classified ad in
Private Eye, a satirical London biweekly: ``19th- and 20th-century
fakes for $240.''
 &HT;    He received a call from a ``Professor Drewe,'' who said he was a
nuclear physicist in need of paintings to decorate his home. Drewe
asked first for a Matisse, then a Klee, then two marine paintings
in the style of 17th-century Dutch masters.
 &HT;    Myatt would meet Drewe at London's Euston Station to deliver the
rolled canvases. They'd have a pint together. Myatt began to
confide in Drewe about the turmoil of his divorce. Drewe offered
advice and comfort and eventually invited him to his home. ``I saw
the size of his house,'' Myatt says, ``his Mercedes, his clothes,
his manner.''
 &HT;    Drewe told Myatt that in addition to his work for the Ministry
of Defense, he was associated with British Intelligence. He pulled
back his jacket to reveal two pistols in shoulder holsters.
 &HT;    ``I was very much your creature,'' Myatt would later say to
Drewe in court. ``I found you hypnotizing and challenging and a
very exciting person to be around.'' One day Drewe asked Myatt what
style he wanted to paint in. Myatt told Drewe he'd always relished
the idea of painting in the Cubist style. Myatt soon painted Drewe
a Braque.
 &HT;    One evening in 1986, Drewe called Myatt with news. ``'I took one
of your paintings to Christie's, and they said it was worth
$38,000,''' Myatt recalls Drewe as saying. ``That was the moment
that the legitimate business stopped and the crime began. He said
to come down to London and we'll talk it over. I said: 'I can't
believe it. Are you aware it's painted in emulsion paint?''' He
pauses. ``My vanity was quite ghastly,'' he says. ``The mistake
occurred here. My reaction was to express an interest.''
 &HT;    Drewe's timing, in many ways, couldn't have been better. By the
mid-'80s, the art market was generating unprecedented profits and
front-page headlines.
 &HT;    Jasper Johns' ``False Start,'' which cost $3,150 in 1960, sold
for $17 million in 1988. Picasso's ``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.9
million in 1989, more than twice the preauction estimate. In 1990,
Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' a painting whose
authenticity is still controversial, was bought by a Japanese
collector for a record $82.5 million. The prices of pictures even
by obscure artists skyrocketed. Myatt's ``masterpieces'' were
suddenly hot commodities.
 &HT;    The painter took trips to Coventry Cathedral to copy Graham
Sutherland's studies for his huge tapestry of Christ in His glory.
He meditated on Giacometti reproductions, then took five hours to
paint a picture that eventually sold for $175,000.
 &HT;    Myatt moved on to Ben Nicholson, Nicolas de Stael, Le Corbusier,
Matisse, Roger Bissiere, glorying in painting his way through
20th-century art history. His unorthodox formula of emulsion and
K-Y Jelly was fast-drying, allowing him to paint quickly, if
obsessively. ``I took no trouble technically,'' he says. ``There
was a negligence to everything I did.''
 &HT;    Even so, his pictures were passing as genuine and selling for
tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. He was enjoying a
financial success he could never have approached by painting
Myatts. Perhaps no other forger of his or any other time has worked
so prodigiously and in so many styles.
 &HT;    ``It was a kind of addiction,'' he says, then shakes his head
sadly. ``It was shocking, it quite terrified me. The moment they
started to restore them they would know what they were faced
with.''
 &HT;    But Drewe calmed his nerves by telling Myatt, who a year before
had been lovelorn and broke, how brilliant he was, how rich he
would get. ``I was flattered into thinking I was a man of
importance,'' Myatt says, although he concedes he had an ``abiding
sense of unreality, that this wasn't really happening, that this
would all end in tears.''
 &HT;    Before Myatt, the most successful forgers of our time counted on
the brute force of their pictures, imitating one or two giants of
art so that the paintings' discovery would be splashy news, the
reclamation of a ``lost masterpiece.''
 &HT;    Hans van Meegeren aped Vermeer in the 1930s and '40s; the
flamboyant Tom Keating did Rembrandt in the 1950s, and Eric Hebborn
copied Augustus John, Corot and others of their ilk.
 &HT;    Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult
to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and
auction houses, is usually kept secret to boost public confidence
in the art market.
 &HT;    Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, has said that during his tenure, a full 40 percent of the
artworks considered for purchase by the museum were phony or
overrestored. Geraldine Norman, the British art journalist credited
with exposing Keating and Hebborn, says that at least 10 percent of
the pictures purportedly made by major Impressionists are fake.
 &HT;    Some experts say that as much as 60 percent of the Giacomettis
on the market are fake, at least in part as a result of Drewe's
con. Forty percent of pictures supposedly from the Russian
avant-garde era are almost certainly forgeries. The widows of
Modigliani and Chagall were accused of selling certificates of
authentication.
 &HT;    Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to
have been fed thousands of sheets of blank paper to sign for fake
lithographs. In a grotesquely sad twist, the Italian painter
Giorgio de Chirico was caught back-dating new pictures to a time,
20 years previously, when his work was popular and in heavy demand,
in effect forging himself.
 &HT;    Modern art, in particular, seems especially vulnerable to fraud.
Its abstractions are sometimes difficult to understand or grasp,
and a modern painting is often loved less because of its intrinsic
quality _ its beauty, as conventionally understood _ than because
of the identity of the painter, its mark of social status.
 &HT;    Says Hoving: ``When the collector gets what he wants and he's
told it isn't real, he says, 'I don't care, to me it's a Renoir.'''
Even though one forged Giacometti, a 1955 ``Nu Debout'' Drewe sold
to two New York dealers, is obviously lacking in the artist's
typical depth of field and manic linearity, one of the dealers
maintains, ``I still think it's one of the best Giacomettis I've
ever seen.''
 &HT;    As Geraldine Norman puts it, many collectors' interests in art
``are reflections of social climbing and romanticism about names, a
thousand things that have nothing to do with the surface of the
work of art you are looking at.''
 &HT;    A forger's chief motivation is typically intellectual
gamesmanship. Embittered by the spurning of his own work, he takes
satisfaction in suckering the entire art world en masse, then
pulling aside the curtain, exposing himself as a renegade genius
and the art experts as the frauds and fools.
 &HT;    Drewe had a different strategy: to deliver low-profile paintings
in high volume, make multiple hits for hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ which would not attract unwanted attention _ rather than
a few jackpots worth millions.
 &HT;    In fact, Drewe changed and fabricated so many records at both
the Victoria and Albert and the Tate, and with so many different
artists, that the directors of both museums admit that they may
never know how much of their collection has been corrupted.
 &HT;    And the scandal has reverberated in the United States. Lowry,
for one, is deeply concerned about MOMA. ``We take our role as a
public institution very seriously,'' he says. ``That means
providing as much access as possible to research documents. The
thought that we have to think about restricting access is
profoundly troubling.''
 &HT;    Once Drewe was discovered, Lowry says, a process of reverse
screenings took place on both sides of the Atlantic. Records were
scoured, paintings were re-examined, all to purge the system. ``It
will take years, probably, before it is fully accomplished,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Drew is now serving a six-year sentence for conspiracy to
defraud and multiple counts of forgery; he is appealing his
conviction.
 &HT;    If his success provides any lesson, it is that the art world's
aura of sophistication creates a false sense of security that makes
it especially vulnerable to what was, in the end, a confederacy of
mediocrity.
 &HT;    Myatt's sloppy pictures and Drewe's litany of far-fetched cons
should have been no match for such sophisticated auction houses,
scholars and dealers. But in the end, the system's multiple lines
of defense _ dealers, galleries, auction houses, museums, archives,
world-class experts _ proved all too permeable.
 &HT;    Yet, one might ask, if a picture brings esthetic pleasure and is
beloved before its fictitious pedigree is exposed, and the only
person who loses money is a collector probably wealthy enough to
absorb the loss, then where exactly is the problem?
 &HT;    As Van Meegeren said at his 1947 trial for forgery about a
Vermeer he had faked: ``Yesterday this picture was worth millions
of guilders, and experts and art lovers would come from all over
the world and pay money to see it. Today, it is worth nothing, and
nobody would cross the street to see it for free. But the picture
has not changed. What has?''

 By CHARLES C. MANN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the news broke in March that the FBI discovered that
Wen Ho Lee, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, had
filled one of his computers with top-secret files about
nuclear-weapons design, the lab has been vilified in Congress for
its lack of computer-system security.
 &HT;    But computer-security professionals have not joined the chorus.
 &HT;    For them, the Los Alamos case simply exemplifies the inherent
difficulty of controlling the flow of digital information _ not
just in laboratories, but anywhere.
 &HT;    The heart of these problems is that computer networks _ and the
Internet _ are extremely difficult to protect.
 &HT;    ``The only system that is truly secure is one that is switched
off and unplugged, locked in a titanium safe, buried in a concrete
vault on the bottom of the sea and surrounded by very highly paid
armed guards,'' says Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Purdue
Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and
Security. ``Even then I wouldn't bet on it.''
 &HT;    Computers can be secured better only if users accept Draconian
restrictions that make their systems much harder to use _ which, as
a rule, users refuse to do. Alas, the risks of willful ignorance
are growing.
 &HT;    Never have the methods of attack been so powerful and easy to
use. Never has the Internet made it possible to disseminate those
methods everywhere in minutes. And never have so many livelihoods _
and lives _ depended on systems so vulnerable to attack.
 &HT;    ``I can't say that 1999 will be the year when a blowup
happens,'' says A. Padgett Peterson, chief of information security
at Lockheed-Martin. ``But what I can say is that, compared to what
is possible, what we have seen so far has been almost benign in
nature.''
 &HT;    Roughly 8,000 researchers are scattered about the 43-square-mile
campus of Los Alamos. Each one has a computer. Many have more than
one. Almost all are wired, one way or another, into a laboratory
network. Additional thousands of administrators and support
personnel have access to computers. So do the 3,000 visitors who
work temporarily at the laboratory each year.
 &HT;    This year, 450 of the employees are foreign citizens, including
more than 30 from Russia, China, North Korea and seven other
``sensitive'' countries.
 &HT;    Keeping track of what these thousands of people are up to is
difficult, to say the least. Los Alamos' efforts to do so
illustrate both the difficulty of the task and why users so often
rebel against their own security measures.
 &HT;    Los Alamos _ like other facilities with classified work _ gave
scientists a ``black'' computer for their secret material and a
``white'' computer for contacting the outside world. Lee worked
with 300 other researchers in the weapon-design group, known
melodramatically as the ``X Division.'' All the researchers had
both machines chewing up real estate on their desks.
 &HT;    In theory, scientists are not supposed to copy work from one
machine to the other; in practice, the temptation is strong.
 &HT;    ``The military insists on reviewing all the software you put on
your black computer,'' says Jeffrey I. Schiller, network manager
for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a director of the
security group for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the ad hoc
international body that develops technical standards for the
Internet. Such a review process, invariably, is slow.
 &HT;    ``It guarantees that their systems are up to three years out of
date. You want to write a report with the latest version of
Microsoft Word on your insecure computer or on some piece of junk
with your secure computer?''
 &HT;    The superior usefulness of the unclassified systems, Schiller
speculates, may be why the former CIA chief John Deutch was caught
last year with top-secret files on his home computer.
 &HT;    ``People load up the classified stuff on their white computer,
then delete it,'' Schiller says. ``But you do that enough times,
you start to lose track.'' Eventually, the white machine becomes
gray.
 &HT;    Military installations try to contain classified data by
``air-gapping'' their networks. Recognizing that they cannot
control the flow of material within a network, they seek to fence
off the entire network _ maintaining a literal gap of air between
the computer and all connection to the outside world.
 &HT;    That is more easily said than done; computers can transmit
information in multiple ways.
 &HT;    To air-gap its computers, the National Security Agency not only
controls modems, floppy disks, Zip drives, optical disks, CD-ROMs
and Ethernet cards, it installs ``blacker boxes'' _ special devices
that prevent data from leaking out through the power cable.
 &HT;    That is not enough, says Simson Garfinkel, the author, with
Spafford, of ``Practical Unix and Internet Security.'' ``It's very
difficult to be sure data is ever actually taken off a hard
drive,'' Garfinkel says. ``You might think you could just wipe the
disk but that won't do it.''
 &HT;    He says the military used to safeguard data by grinding up old
disks. Now that doesn't work anymore. Tiny pieces of hard drives
can contain sizable amounts of information.
 &HT;    According to a rough calculation by Garfinkel, a
one-sixteenth-inch-square piece of a 6-gigabyte hard drive can hold
750,000 bytes _ enough for a 300-page book. ``A spy could remove a
hard disk, grind it up and smuggle out the data in little pieces
like pocket lint,'' he says.
 &HT;    Los Alamos has split off all machines with secret information
from all machines with access to the Internet, according to John
Morrison, deputy director of the lab's computing, information and
communications division.
 &HT;    Since the controversy, when researchers have access to both
networks, the lab eliminates their floppy drives to block them from
copying files between them. It is demanding that researchers on
classified projects communicate electronically only over encrypted
lines. It is telling people not only to turn off their cell phones
but to remove the batteries. It is doing enough, in fact, to drive
the users crazy.
 &HT;    ``In theory, cutting the cable works great,'' says Dan Wallach,
a security researcher at Rice University. ``Nobody from outside can
attack you or steal your files. Except suddenly you can't do as
much stuff as you used to. And then people start feeling their
security system is a pain in the neck, so they take active steps to
subvert it.''
 &HT;    Laboratories are especially prone to such sabotage, because they
are filled with people who know a lot about computers. Eventually,
compromises are made, and the original problem comes back.
 &HT;    ``Suppose people at Los Alamos are collaborating with people in
Britain,'' says Jon R. David, an internationally recognized
security consultant who is the senior editor of the journal
Computers and Security.
 &HT;    ``They have to talk to somebody in the UK by computer, and so
the lab arranges this encrypted line, which promises to be secure.
But is it true? No. The information on the line is safe, because
it's encrypted, but everything else _ the machines at the other
end, the connection points _ can be attacked, and have been
attacked successfully.''
 &HT;    By coincidence, his point was precisely demonstrated to me last
spring. A man I have come into contact with is an officer in Army
intelligence. It is safe to say that this man is greatly concerned
with security in general, and with computer security in particular.
His facility too has two networks _ one classified, one very
classified _ with security precautions much like those being
installed at Los Alamos.
 &HT;    In March, the computer virus Melissa flooded more than 100,000
computers across the world. Seizing users' machines, it E-mailed
copies of itself to the top 50 names in their address books (if
they used a particular Microsoft program), and so on, until
hundreds of networks were swamped by a mail storm of Melissa
copies.
 &HT;    The Army intelligence man I contacted knew all about Melissa. On
his classified network _ his guarded, protected, sealed-off network
_ he had received some 80 copies of the virus.
 &HT;    A network's security problems, of course, are not only due to
its users. There are all the folks outside who are trying to break
in. A terminological note: Computer cognoscenti use the word
``crackers'' to refer to the vandals who bust into computer systems
illicitly; ``hacker,'' in their lexicon, is reserved for expert
programmers and network administrators.
 &HT;    The people who disabled the Web sites of the FBI, the
Departments of Energy and the Interior, the Senate and the White
House last May were crackers. And when, soon after, the Pentagon
took its Web site off the air to shore up security, it feared being
cracked, not hacked.
 &HT;    These cracking incidents disturbed security researchers _ but
not because the break-ins were unusual. Crackers went after the
U.S. military more than 250,000 times in 1996, the most recent year
for which official estimates are available, and thousands _ perhaps
tens of thousands _ actually broke in.
 &HT;    Nor were the attacks disturbing because they succeeded in doing
permanent damage. (They didn't.) Nor were the crackers able to make
off with classified data _ the breached networks had none (in
theory, anyway).
 &HT;    What distressed security researchers is how far these crackers
got, considering that they almost certainly labored under the
handicap of having no idea of what they were doing.
 &HT;    Most crackers are what real hackers refer to disdainfully as
``script kiddies.'' Just as the great majority of Netscape or
Explorer users have no idea how the software puts Web images on
their screens, the great majority of crackers blindly try out
scripts _ routines written and posted on the Internet by the tiny
number of crackers who know something about programming.
 &HT;    From a network administrator's point of view, the result is like
being besieged by a million monkeys randomly firing catapults _
some of them, by virtue of their sheer numbers, are bound to get a
hit.
 &HT;    ``You see it all the time,'' Schiller says. ``Someone slips in
with some incredibly sophisticated technique.''
 &HT;    Even as the number of script kiddies rises, the ``malware'' _
the security maven's term for malicious software _ they use is
becoming more sophisticated, dangerous and rapidly disseminated.
 &HT;    Last year, Microsoft issued 20 software updates to stop
break-ins. In the first six months of this year, it released 22.
Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane, a computer-security
company in Minnesota, calls 1999 ``a pivotal year for malicious
software'' _ the year that problems really have become serious.
 &HT;    The line was crossed first by Melissa, which caused such havoc
that it obscured the antics of an almost equally unpleasant virus
known as CIH or Chernobyl, so named because the virus appears on
April 26, the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. CIH infected
as many as 600,000 computers in South Korea alone; damage estimates
run up to $10 million. Then, in June, came the Explore worm.
 &HT;    Technically, a worm is a program that crawls through networks,
automatically making and distributing copies of itself. (Viruses,
by contrast, need human help to propagate.) The Explore worm
appeared in a victim's E-mail in the guise of a note from a
correspondent. Attached to the note was a file: zipped_files .exe.
When recipients open the file, they see an error message and assume
nothing has happened.
 &HT;    In fact, the worm has effectively erased documents, spreadsheets
and presentations. In addition, the worm infects other machines on
the network, hitting even people who haven't recently used their
E-mail.
 &HT;    To the relief of security experts, no one has yet combined the
unbelievably rapid spread of Melissa (sending out 50 copies of
itself at once) and the toxic actions of the Explore worm (trashing
files). But it might not be long before someone does, and Schneier
believes that the results may be catastrophic.
 &HT;    ``It's a really big deal,'' he argued in a warning widely
distributed over the Internet. With cracking scripts posted on the
Web by their inventors, Schneier wrote, the new malware programs
``don't propagate over weeks and months; they propagate in
seconds.''
 &HT;    When a cracker can figure out a new way of attack in the morning
and spread it across the world in the afternoon, users cannot
possibly be protected by, say, updating their antiviral software
and security patches every week. (And how many users do even that?)
 &HT;    A new approach will be needed, Schneier believes. Society will
have to insist that security is built into software from the
beginning.
 &HT;    ``From a security point of view, the software in everyday use is
nonfunctional,'' says Rice University's Wallach. ``There's an old
joke. If cars were like computers, they would go 300 mph and get a
hundred miles to the gallon and cost $50. Except that twice a month
someone a thousand miles away would be able to blow up the car,

 By CHARLES C. MANN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Ever since the news broke in March that the FBI discovered that
Wen Ho Lee, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, had
filled one of his computers with top-secret files about
nuclear-weapons design, the lab has been vilified in Congress for
its lack of computer-system security.
 &HT;    But computer-security professionals have not joined the chorus.
 &HT;    For them, the Los Alamos case simply exemplifies the inherent
difficulty of controlling the flow of digital information _ not
just in laboratories, but anywhere.
 &HT;    The heart of these problems is that computer networks _ and the
Internet _ are extremely difficult to protect.
 &HT;    ``The only system that is truly secure is one that is switched
off and unplugged, locked in a titanium safe, buried in a concrete
vault on the bottom of the sea and surrounded by very highly paid
armed guards,'' says Eugene H. Spafford, director of the Purdue
Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and
Security. ``Even then I wouldn't bet on it.''
 &HT;    Computers can be secured better only if users accept Draconian
restrictions that make their systems much harder to use _ which, as
a rule, users refuse to do. Alas, the risks of willful ignorance
are growing.
 &HT;    Never have the methods of attack been so powerful and easy to
use. Never has the Internet made it possible to disseminate those
methods everywhere in minutes. And never have so many livelihoods _
and lives _ depended on systems so vulnerable to attack.
 &HT;    ``I can't say that 1999 will be the year when a blowup
happens,'' says A. Padgett Peterson, chief of information security
at Lockheed-Martin. ``But what I can say is that, compared to what
is possible, what we have seen so far has been almost benign in
nature.''
 &HT;    Roughly 8,000 researchers are scattered about the 43-square-mile
campus of Los Alamos. Each one has a computer. Many have more than
one. Almost all are wired, one way or another, into a laboratory
network. Additional thousands of administrators and support
personnel have access to computers. So do the 3,000 visitors who
work temporarily at the laboratory each year.
 &HT;    This year, 450 of the employees are foreign citizens, including
more than 30 from Russia, China, North Korea and seven other
``sensitive'' countries.
 &HT;    Keeping track of what these thousands of people are up to is
difficult, to say the least. Los Alamos' efforts to do so
illustrate both the difficulty of the task and why users so often
rebel against their own security measures.
 &HT;    Los Alamos _ like other facilities with classified work _ gave
scientists a ``black'' computer for their secret material and a
``white'' computer for contacting the outside world. Lee worked
with 300 other researchers in the weapon-design group, known
melodramatically as the ``X Division.'' All the researchers had
both machines chewing up real estate on their desks.
 &HT;    In theory, scientists are not supposed to copy work from one
machine to the other; in practice, the temptation is strong.
 &HT;    ``The military insists on reviewing all the software you put on
your black computer,'' says Jeffrey I. Schiller, network manager
for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a director of the
security group for the Internet Engineering Task Force, the ad hoc
international body that develops technical standards for the
Internet. Such a review process, invariably, is slow.
 &HT;    ``It guarantees that their systems are up to three years out of
date. You want to write a report with the latest version of
Microsoft Word on your insecure computer or on some piece of junk
with your secure computer?''
 &HT;    The superior usefulness of the unclassified systems, Schiller
speculates, may be why the former CIA chief John Deutch was caught
last year with top-secret files on his home computer.
 &HT;    ``People load up the classified stuff on their white computer,
then delete it,'' Schiller says. ``But you do that enough times,
you start to lose track.'' Eventually, the white machine becomes
gray.
 &HT;    Military installations try to contain classified data by
``air-gapping'' their networks. Recognizing that they cannot
control the flow of material within a network, they seek to fence
off the entire network _ maintaining a literal gap of air between
the computer and all connection to the outside world.
 &HT;    That is more easily said than done; computers can transmit
information in multiple ways.
 &HT;    To air-gap its computers, the National Security Agency not only
controls modems, floppy disks, Zip drives, optical disks, CD-ROMs
and Ethernet cards, it installs ``blacker boxes'' _ special devices
that prevent data from leaking out through the power cable.
 &HT;    That is not enough, says Simson Garfinkel, the author, with
Spafford, of ``Practical Unix and Internet Security.'' ``It's very
difficult to be sure data is ever actually taken off a hard
drive,'' Garfinkel says. ``You might think you could just wipe the
disk but that won't do it.''
 &HT;    He says the military used to safeguard data by grinding up old
disks. Now that doesn't work anymore. Tiny pieces of hard drives
can contain sizable amounts of information.
 &HT;    According to a rough calculation by Garfinkel, a
one-sixteenth-inch-square piece of a 6-gigabyte hard drive can hold
750,000 bytes _ enough for a 300-page book. ``A spy could remove a
hard disk, grind it up and smuggle out the data in little pieces
like pocket lint,'' he says.
 &HT;    Los Alamos has split off all machines with secret information
from all machines with access to the Internet, according to John
Morrison, deputy director of the lab's computing, information and
communications division.
 &HT;    Since the controversy, when researchers have access to both
networks, the lab eliminates their floppy drives to block them from
copying files between them. It is demanding that researchers on
classified projects communicate electronically only over encrypted
lines. It is telling people not only to turn off their cell phones
but to remove the batteries. It is doing enough, in fact, to drive
the users crazy.
 &HT;    ``In theory, cutting the cable works great,'' says Dan Wallach,
a security researcher at Rice University. ``Nobody from outside can
attack you or steal your files. Except suddenly you can't do as
much stuff as you used to. And then people start feeling their
security system is a pain in the neck, so they take active steps to
subvert it.''
 &HT;    Laboratories are especially prone to such sabotage, because they
are filled with people who know a lot about computers. Eventually,
compromises are made, and the original problem comes back.
 &HT;    ``Suppose people at Los Alamos are collaborating with people in
Britain,'' says Jon R. David, an internationally recognized
security consultant who is the senior editor of the journal
Computers and Security.
 &HT;    ``They have to talk to somebody in the UK by computer, and so
the lab arranges this encrypted line, which promises to be secure.
But is it true? No. The information on the line is safe, because
it's encrypted, but everything else _ the machines at the other
end, the connection points _ can be attacked, and have been
attacked successfully.''
 &HT;    By coincidence, his point was precisely demonstrated to me last
spring. A man I have come into contact with is an officer in Army
intelligence. It is safe to say that this man is greatly concerned
with security in general, and with computer security in particular.
His facility too has two networks _ one classified, one very
classified _ with security precautions much like those being
installed at Los Alamos.
 &HT;    In March, the computer virus Melissa flooded more than 100,000
computers across the world. Seizing users' machines, it E-mailed
copies of itself to the top 50 names in their address books (if
they used a particular Microsoft program), and so on, until
hundreds of networks were swamped by a mail storm of Melissa
copies.
 &HT;    The Army intelligence man I contacted knew all about Melissa. On
his classified network _ his guarded, protected, sealed-off network
_ he had received some 80 copies of the virus.
 &HT;    A network's security problems, of course, are not only due to
its users. There are all the folks outside who are trying to break
in. A terminological note: Computer cognoscenti use the word
``crackers'' to refer to the vandals who bust into computer systems
illicitly; ``hacker,'' in their lexicon, is reserved for expert
programmers and network administrators.
 &HT;    The people who disabled the Web sites of the FBI, the
Departments of Energy and the Interior, the Senate and the White
House last May were crackers. And when, soon after, the Pentagon
took its Web site off the air to shore up security, it feared being
cracked, not hacked.
 &HT;    These cracking incidents disturbed security researchers _ but
not because the break-ins were unusual. Crackers went after the
U.S. military more than 250,000 times in 1996, the most recent year
for which official estimates are available, and thousands _ perhaps
tens of thousands _ actually broke in.
 &HT;    Nor were the attacks disturbing because they succeeded in doing
permanent damage. (They didn't.) Nor were the crackers able to make
off with classified data _ the breached networks had none (in
theory, anyway).
 &HT;    What distressed security researchers is how far these crackers
got, considering that they almost certainly labored under the
handicap of having no idea of what they were doing.
 &HT;    Most crackers are what real hackers refer to disdainfully as
``script kiddies.'' Just as the great majority of Netscape or
Explorer users have no idea how the software puts Web images on
their screens, the great majority of crackers blindly try out
scripts _ routines written and posted on the Internet by the tiny
number of crackers who know something about programming.
 &HT;    From a network administrator's point of view, the result is like
being besieged by a million monkeys randomly firing catapults _
some of them, by virtue of their sheer numbers, are bound to get a
hit.
 &HT;    ``You see it all the time,'' Schiller says. ``Someone slips in
with some incredibly sophisticated technique.''
 &HT;    Even as the number of script kiddies rises, the ``malware'' _
the security maven's term for malicious software _ they use is
becoming more sophisticated, dangerous and rapidly disseminated.
 &HT;    Last year, Microsoft issued 20 software updates to stop
break-ins. In the first six months of this year, it released 22.
Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane, a computer-security
company in Minnesota, calls 1999 ``a pivotal year for malicious
software'' _ the year that problems really have become serious.
 &HT;    The line was crossed first by Melissa, which caused such havoc
that it obscured the antics of an almost equally unpleasant virus
known as CIH or Chernobyl, so named because the virus appears on
April 26, the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. CIH infected
as many as 600,000 computers in South Korea alone; damage estimates
run up to $10 million. Then, in June, came the Explore worm.
 &HT;    Technically, a worm is a program that crawls through networks,
automatically making and distributing copies of itself. (Viruses,
by contrast, need human help to propagate.) The Explore worm
appeared in a victim's E-mail in the guise of a note from a
correspondent. Attached to the note was a file: zipped_files .exe.
When recipients open the file, they see an error message and assume
nothing has happened.
 &HT;    In fact, the worm has effectively erased documents, spreadsheets
and presentations. In addition, the worm infects other machines on
the network, hitting even people who haven't recently used their
E-mail.
 &HT;    To the relief of security experts, no one has yet combined the
unbelievably rapid spread of Melissa (sending out 50 copies of
itself at once) and the toxic actions of the Explore worm (trashing
files). But it might not be long before someone does, and Schneier
believes that the results may be catastrophic.
 &HT;    ``It's a really big deal,'' he argued in a warning widely
distributed over the Internet. With cracking scripts posted on the
Web by their inventors, Schneier wrote, the new malware programs
``don't propagate over weeks and months; they propagate in
seconds.''
 &HT;    When a cracker can figure out a new way of attack in the morning
and spread it across the world in the afternoon, users cannot
possibly be protected by, say, updating their antiviral software
and security patches every week. (And how many users do even that?)
 &HT;    A new approach will be needed, Schneier believes. Society will
have to insist that security is built into software from the
beginning.
 &HT;    ``From a security point of view, the software in everyday use is
nonfunctional,'' says Rice University's Wallach. ``There's an old
joke. If cars were like computers, they would go 300 mph and get a
hundred miles to the gallon and cost $50. Except that twice a month
someone a thousand miles away would be able to blow up the car,
killing everyone nearby.'' Believing there is no cry for better
security, software vendors simply ignore the issue, he says.
 &HT;    Ultimately, Spafford thinks, all is not hopeless. A solution may
lie on the horizon: the Y2K problem. Like the asbestos lawyers
involved in the tobacco lawsuits, Y2K lawyers will start looking
for new targets.
 &HT;    They will discover that many of society's most valued assets
have been entrusted to badly designed and unsafe software. ``I tell
you,'' Spafford says, ``they won't be able to believe their good
fortune.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    George W. Bush Jr. has raised the most money of any presidential
candidate in history: $36 million and counting. Much of it was
gathered by only 200 people, super-fund-raisers whom Bush has
dubbed ``Pioneers.''
 &HT;    Should Bush get elected president next year, it is not caviling
to say that those 200 people are more likely to get a phone call
through, and possibly even get a favor returned, than, say, I will.
 &HT;    So who are these very special people? Bush's campaign advisers
have decided it is not in our interest to know, and there is no
legal means to compel them to tell.
 &HT;    Outrageous?
 &HT;    Well, is it any more upsetting than Al Gore's notorious visit to
the Buddhist temple? Or the afternoon in 1995 when Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio, the GOP Conference chairman, was spotted on the
House floor cheerfully tossing out checks from tobacco lobbyists
like daisies? How about when Trent Lott and Bill Clinton conspired
in a fit of midnight fraternity to sneak through a $50 billion tax
loophole for the tobacco companies?
 &HT;    Does anyone disagree that our campaign-finance system has lapsed
into legalized corruption?
 &HT;    For closeted campaign-finance wonks like myself, the real news
every presidential election is not who is running but what fresh
scheme has been devised by the high-finance shamans to exploit the
newest loophole.
 &HT;    This year's twist: George W.'s $36 million is composed of direct
contributions to his campaign, or ``hard money.'' The focus of
reformers over the last few election cycles, of course, has been
``soft money'' _ contributions to the national party, which comes
into play only after party nominations are official.
 &HT;    The McCain-Feingold bill, which is likely to be forced onto the
Senate by John McCain, another Republican presidential candidate,
in the next few weeks, deals almost exclusively with soft money.
Why? Because Clinton's scheme in the last two elections was to
artfully co-opt the soft-money coffers of the Democratic National
Committee to his own use.
 &HT;    (Today, for example, the national chairman of the DNC is Steven
Grossman, a man, in all likelihood, you have never heard of. But
he's a very good friend of Gore's. Coincidence?)
 &HT;    Every poll taken reveals that voters strongly favor reform. But
when pressed for details of what might work, folks appear
overwhelmed by the complexity. It seems like some public policy
Rubik's cube for think-tank nerds to solve, with all that talk of
spending caps, soft-money restrictions, limits on political action
committees and Federal Election Commission reporting requirements.
Even most expert commentary is little more than frustration
venting.
 &HT;    In a recent Op-Ed article, George McGovern lamented the
``vexing'' problem of ``big money in politics. Thoughtful members
of both parties are stymied by this issue.''
 &HT;    What everyone seems to agree on, and has for decades, is that
the problem boils down to ``too much money'' and the solution
unquestionably involves ``restrictions'' and ``fuller disclosure.''
 &HT;    Actually, not everyone agrees about this. There are other
would-be reformers out there who describe the problem differently.
To see the world their way is to see the limitations of fixes
inspired by conventional wisdom. And to see how a radically
different solution might not only solve our predicament quite
elegantly but also profoundly change the way elections are
conducted in the process.
 &HT;    The current crop of labored patches to the system _ such as the
McCain-Feingold bill and its bouquet of technical fixes - is trying
to end-run a 23-year-old Supreme Court decision that reasonably
warned reformers that the voters' right to give money to candidates
is inextricably bound up with the voters' right to free speech,
expression and peaceable assembly.
 &HT;    The brain teaser is this: How do you allow voters to freely
donate money to the candidates and parties without permitting the
easy money of special interests to crowd the rest of us out? Or,
vice versa, how do you restrict the special interests without
hobbling the necessary expression of voters in a robust election?
 &HT;    The official big fix that Beltway reformers are at least willing
to acknowledge is ``clean money,'' or public financing, which
solves the riddle by asking candidates to voluntarily forgo all
donated money in exchange for a stream of revenue from the state.
 &HT;    Again, it is fundamentally about limiting money. The proposal
has some support in cozy small-d democratic states like Maine and
Vermont, liberal Massachusetts and the libertarian outpost of
Arizona. But government-financed elections are unlikely to find
much of a reception in states as heterogeneous as New York or as
angry as South Carolina.
 &HT;    One night not long ago, at dinner in New Haven, I met Prof.
Bruce Ackerman of Yale, who has a provocative plan indeed: He
proposes to create a dedicated form of election currency and
positively flood the system with it.
 &HT;    At election time, every registered voter would receive, say, 100
``patriot dollars'' via a digital credit card. The voters could
donate this money any way they saw fit _ to a party, a union, to
Tom DeLay's PAC or to People for the American Way. While the last
presidential election cost roughly $400 million, Patriot dollars
would marginalize all greenbacks by sluicing $13 billion into the
system.
 &HT;    Since the viable candidates could get money only directly from
voters, voters are who they'd have to campaign to. Patriot dollars
bring to fund-raising the equality inherent in voting. One man, one
vote? One vote, a hundred bucks.
 &HT;    This has its charms, but does seem a little unwieldy. Then, at
another dinner, I learned that a friend had a plan that shares one
of the assumptions of Ackerman's scheme _ that limiting money is
the wrong way to go.
 &HT;    Prof. Ian Ayres of Yale and a co-author, Jeremy Bulow of
Stanford, have published a law-review article detailing their idea
to allow anybody or any institution to give as much campaign money
as they want. But with one key proviso: The candidate cannot find
out who the donors are.
 &HT;    All campaign donations would be funneled through a blind trust.
The candidate still gets the money. He just can't know to whom he
owes, or doesn't owe, a favor. Anyone could claim to be a donor
with the same impunity that each of us can safely claim to have
``voted'' for the politician.
 &HT;    This idea questions reform's most basic assumption - that more
and fuller disclosure is the only answer. ``Instead of limiting
money,'' the authors write, ``we might limit information.''
 &HT;    The constitutionality of such a plan would be difficult to
question. It is modeled on something seemingly more fundamental
than even free-speech concerns: the secret ballot. Just as a voter
goes into a booth and votes secretly, the donor would go into what
the authors call, metaphorically, a ``donation booth'' and donate.
In both cases, the voters know for whom they voted (donated to),
but the candidates do not.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court would be hard pressed to explain why a secret
ballot is constitutional and a secret donation is not. And
politicians would be equally challenged to come up with a
convincing answer to this question: Why do you need to know the
identity of your donors?
 &HT;    It turns out the secret ballot was invented for the precise
reason the authors suggest the donation booth. In the 19th century,
voting in America was shockingly corrupt.
 &HT;    Party bosses organized voters and drove them to the voting
stations like cattle. The ballots for opposing candidates were
published on different colored paper. The bosses typically checked
on their vote-buying by forcing voters into single-file lines and
demanding that they physically wave their paid-for ballots over
their heads.
 &HT;    This practice came to an end when the ``Australian ballot'' _
the secret ballot was invented there _ came to America.
Massachusetts was the first state to adopt the secret ballot, in
1888. South Carolina was the last ... in 1950.
 &HT;    By and large, the secret ballot pretty much eliminated
vote-buying; perhaps a donation booth would have a similar effect.
It neatly solves the PAC problem, which is a dark mutation of
mandatory disclosure.
 &HT;    Today, the PAC can ``bundle'' bags of legal checks for the
candidates and explain precisely where they came from. With
donation booths, PACs would wither. So, perhaps, would a lot of
campaign contributions.
 &HT;    After the secret ballot went into effect, voting dropped off
nearly 7 percent. The authors themselves worry that their reform
would ``shift money toward less accountable 'issue advocacy'
expenditures and may be so effective in disrupting the market for
influence that it cripples candidates' ability to raise funds.''
 &HT;    Just how far you think donations might plunge is almost a
Rorschach test of how deeply corrupt you believe the system to be.
I don't know about you, but I am comforted by the fact that voting
fell only 7 percent.
 &HT;    Would donations dip only a bit, suggesting that most
contributors want little more than the election of a generally
like-minded individual? Or would they crash, revealing that donors
want specific quid for quo, or nothing? Either outcome of the
donation booth would be radical, in the sense that it would
completely upend the system we currently have in place. But would
anyone really miss it?
 &HT;    Perhaps the candidates would just become shuttlecocks battered
amid a riot of citizen-financed issue ads. Would that be so bad?
 &HT;    And if candidates could not afford to saturate television with
either feel-good commercials Vaselined with slo-mo family values or
with negative ads predicting moral decay in stentorian voice-over,
perhaps they would have to work the streets for votes and fashion
clever speeches to attract free media exposure.
 &HT;    It would be utopian to think that any of these solutions would
restore us to some Jeffersonian democracy of high-minded yeomen.
(That never existed anyway.) But now we tolerate a system in which
we routinely hear stories about, say, the presence of corporate
campaign donors at congressional staff meetings to draw up new
environmental laws.
 &HT;    In a truly transformed system, it just might be that our
politicians would, from time to time, find themselves contemplating
the affairs of their voters as a coherent whole instead of the
concerns of their most generous fund-raisers. Imagine that.

 &HT;    George W. Bush Jr. has raised the most money of any presidential
candidate in history: $36 million and counting. Much of it was
gathered by only 200 people, super-fund-raisers whom Bush has
dubbed ``Pioneers.''
 &HT;    Should Bush get elected president next year, it is not caviling
to say that those 200 people are more likely to get a phone call
through, and possibly even get a favor returned, than, say, I will.
 &HT;    So who are these very special people? Bush's campaign advisers
have decided it is not in our interest to know, and there is no
legal means to compel them to tell.
 &HT;    Outrageous?
 &HT;    Well, is it any more upsetting than Al Gore's notorious visit to
the Buddhist temple? Or the afternoon in 1995 when Rep. John
Boehner of Ohio, the GOP Conference chairman, was spotted on the
House floor cheerfully tossing out checks from tobacco lobbyists
like daisies? How about when Trent Lott and Bill Clinton conspired
in a fit of midnight fraternity to sneak through a $50 billion tax
loophole for the tobacco companies?
 &HT;    Does anyone disagree that our campaign-finance system has lapsed
into legalized corruption?
 &HT;    For closeted campaign-finance wonks like myself, the real news
every presidential election is not who is running but what fresh
scheme has been devised by the high-finance shamans to exploit the
newest loophole.
 &HT;    This year's twist: George W.'s $36 million is composed of direct
contributions to his campaign, or ``hard money.'' The focus of
reformers over the last few election cycles, of course, has been
``soft money'' _ contributions to the national party, which comes
into play only after party nominations are official.
 &HT;    The McCain-Feingold bill, which is likely to be forced onto the
Senate by John McCain, another Republican presidential candidate,
in the next few weeks, deals almost exclusively with soft money.
Why? Because Clinton's scheme in the last two elections was to
artfully co-opt the soft-money coffers of the Democratic National
Committee to his own use.
 &HT;    (Today, for example, the national chairman of the DNC is Steven
Grossman, a man, in all likelihood, you have never heard of. But
he's a very good friend of Gore's. Coincidence?)
 &HT;    Every poll taken reveals that voters strongly favor reform. But
when pressed for details of what might work, folks appear
overwhelmed by the complexity. It seems like some public policy
Rubik's cube for think-tank nerds to solve, with all that talk of
spending caps, soft-money restrictions, limits on political action
committees and Federal Election Commission reporting requirements.
Even most expert commentary is little more than frustration
venting.
 &HT;    In a recent Op-Ed article, George McGovern lamented the
``vexing'' problem of ``big money in politics. Thoughtful members
of both parties are stymied by this issue.''
 &HT;    What everyone seems to agree on, and has for decades, is that
the problem boils down to ``too much money'' and the solution
unquestionably involves ``restrictions'' and ``fuller disclosure.''
 &HT;    Actually, not everyone agrees about this. There are other
would-be reformers out there who describe the problem differently.
To see the world their way is to see the limitations of fixes
inspired by conventional wisdom. And to see how a radically
different solution might not only solve our predicament quite
elegantly but also profoundly change the way elections are
conducted in the process.
 &HT;    The current crop of labored patches to the system _ such as the
McCain-Feingold bill and its bouquet of technical fixes - is trying
to end-run a 23-year-old Supreme Court decision that reasonably
warned reformers that the voters' right to give money to candidates
is inextricably bound up with the voters' right to free speech,
expression and peaceable assembly.
 &HT;    The brain teaser is this: How do you allow voters to freely
donate money to the candidates and parties without permitting the
easy money of special interests to crowd the rest of us out? Or,
vice versa, how do you restrict the special interests without
hobbling the necessary expression of voters in a robust election?
 &HT;    The official big fix that Beltway reformers are at least willing
to acknowledge is ``clean money,'' or public financing, which
solves the riddle by asking candidates to voluntarily forgo all
donated money in exchange for a stream of revenue from the state.
 &HT;    Again, it is fundamentally about limiting money. The proposal
has some support in cozy small-d democratic states like Maine and
Vermont, liberal Massachusetts and the libertarian outpost of
Arizona. But government-financed elections are unlikely to find
much of a reception in states as heterogeneous as New York or as
angry as South Carolina.
 &HT;    One night not long ago, at dinner in New Haven, I met Prof.
Bruce Ackerman of Yale, who has a provocative plan indeed: He
proposes to create a dedicated form of election currency and
positively flood the system with it.
 &HT;    At election time, every registered voter would receive, say, 100
``patriot dollars'' via a digital credit card. The voters could
donate this money any way they saw fit _ to a party, a union, to
Tom DeLay's PAC or to People for the American Way. While the last
presidential election cost roughly $400 million, Patriot dollars
would marginalize all greenbacks by sluicing $13 billion into the
system.
 &HT;    Since the viable candidates could get money only directly from
voters, voters are who they'd have to campaign to. Patriot dollars
bring to fund-raising the equality inherent in voting. One man, one
vote? One vote, a hundred bucks.
 &HT;    This has its charms, but does seem a little unwieldy. Then, at
another dinner, I learned that a friend had a plan that shares one
of the assumptions of Ackerman's scheme _ that limiting money is
the wrong way to go.
 &HT;    Prof. Ian Ayres of Yale and a co-author, Jeremy Bulow of
Stanford, have published a law-review article detailing their idea
to allow anybody or any institution to give as much campaign money
as they want. But with one key proviso: The candidate cannot find
out who the donors are.
 &HT;    All campaign donations would be funneled through a blind trust.
The candidate still gets the money. He just can't know to whom he
owes, or doesn't owe, a favor. Anyone could claim to be a donor
with the same impunity that each of us can safely claim to have
``voted'' for the politician.
 &HT;    This idea questions reform's most basic assumption - that more
and fuller disclosure is the only answer. ``Instead of limiting
money,'' the authors write, ``we might limit information.''
 &HT;    The constitutionality of such a plan would be difficult to
question. It is modeled on something seemingly more fundamental
than even free-speech concerns: the secret ballot. Just as a voter
goes into a booth and votes secretly, the donor would go into what
the authors call, metaphorically, a ``donation booth'' and donate.
In both cases, the voters know for whom they voted (donated to),
but the candidates do not.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court would be hard pressed to explain why a secret
ballot is constitutional and a secret donation is not. And
politicians would be equally challenged to come up with a
convincing answer to this question: Why do you need to know the
identity of your donors?
 &HT;    It turns out the secret ballot was invented for the precise
reason the authors suggest the donation booth. In the 19th century,
voting in America was shockingly corrupt.
 &HT;    Party bosses organized voters and drove them to the voting
stations like cattle. The ballots for opposing candidates were
published on different colored paper. The bosses typically checked
on their vote-buying by forcing voters into single-file lines and
demanding that they physically wave their paid-for ballots over
their heads.
 &HT;    This practice came to an end when the ``Australian ballot'' _
the secret ballot was invented there _ came to America.
Massachusetts was the first state to adopt the secret ballot, in
1888. South Carolina was the last ... in 1950.
 &HT;    By and large, the secret ballot pretty much eliminated
vote-buying; perhaps a donation booth would have a similar effect.
It neatly solves the PAC problem, which is a dark mutation of
mandatory disclosure.
 &HT;    Today, the PAC can ``bundle'' bags of legal checks for the
candidates and explain precisely where they came from. With
donation booths, PACs would wither. So, perhaps, would a lot of
campaign contributions.
 &HT;    After the secret ballot went into effect, voting dropped off
nearly 7 percent. The authors themselves worry that their reform
would ``shift money toward less accountable 'issue advocacy'
expenditures and may be so effective in disrupting the market for
influence that it cripples candidates' ability to raise funds.''
 &HT;    Just how far you think donations might plunge is almost a
Rorschach test of how deeply corrupt you believe the system to be.
I don't know about you, but I am comforted by the fact that voting
fell only 7 percent.
 &HT;    Would donations dip only a bit, suggesting that most
contributors want little more than the election of a generally
like-minded individual? Or would they crash, revealing that donors
want specific quid for quo, or nothing? Either outcome of the
donation booth would be radical, in the sense that it would
completely upend the system we currently have in place. But would
anyone really miss it?
 &HT;    Perhaps the candidates would just become shuttlecocks battered
amid a riot of citizen-financed issue ads. Would that be so bad?
 &HT;    And if candidates could not afford to saturate television with
either feel-good commercials Vaselined with slo-mo family values or
with negative ads predicting moral decay in stentorian voice-over,
perhaps they would have to work the streets for votes and fashion
clever speeches to attract free media exposure.
 &HT;    It would be utopian to think that any of these solutions would
restore us to some Jeffersonian democracy of high-minded yeomen.
(That never existed anyway.) But now we tolerate a system in which
we routinely hear stories about, say, the presence of corporate
campaign donors at congressional staff meetings to draw up new
environmental laws.
 &HT;    In a truly transformed system, it just might be that our
politicians would, from time to time, find themselves contemplating
the affairs of their voters as a coherent whole instead of the
concerns of their most generous fund-raisers. Imagine that.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Sgt. Mike Lewis of the Maryland State Police is a bull-necked,
megaphone-voiced, highly caffeinated drug warrior who, on this
shiny May morning outside of Annapolis, is conceding defeat. The
drug war is over, the good guys have lost and he has been cast as a
racist.
 &HT;    ``This is the end, buddy,'' he says. ''I can read the writing on
the wall.''
 &HT;    Lewis is driving his unmarked Crown Victoria down the fast lane
of Route 50, looking for bad guys. The back of his neck is burnt by
the sun, and he wears his hair flat and short under his regulation
Stetson.
 &HT;    ``They're going to let the NAACP tell us how to do traffic
stops,'' he says. ``That's what's happening. There may be a few
troopers who make stops solely based on race, but now they're going
to let these people tell us how to run our department. I say, to
hell with it all. I don't care if the drugs go through. I don't.''
 &HT;    He does, of course. Lewis was born to seize crack. He grew up in
Salisbury, on the Eastern Shore _ Jimmy Buffett country _ and he
watched his friends become stoners and acid freaks. Not his scene.
He buzz-cut his hair away and joined the state troopers when he was
19.
 &HT;    He's a star, the hard-charger who made one of the nation's
largest seizures of crack cocaine out on Route 13. He's a national
expert on hidden compartments. He can tell if a man's lying, he
says, by watching the pulsing of the carotid artery in his neck. He
can smell crack cocaine inside a closed automobile. He's a human
drug dog, a walking polygraph machine.
 &HT;    ``I have the unique ability to distinguish between a law-abiding
person and an up-to-no-good person,'' he says. ``Black or white.''
 &HT;    All these skills, though, he's ready to chuck. The lawsuits
accusing the Maryland State Police of harassing black drivers, the
public excoriation _ and most of all, the governor of New Jersey
saying that her state police profiled drivers based on race, and
were wrong to do so _ have twisted him up inside.
 &HT;    ``Three of my men have put in for transfers,'' he says. ``My
wife wants me to get out. I'm depressed.''
 &HT;    What depresses Lewis is that he believes he is in possession of
a truth polite society is too cowardly to accept. He says that when
someone tells this particular truth, his head is handed to him.
``The superintendent of the New Jersey State Police told the truth
and he got fired for it,'' Lewis says.
 &HT;    This is what Carl Williams said, fueling a national debate about
racial profiling in law enforcement: ``Today, with this drug
problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most
likely a minority group that's involved with that.''
 &HT;    Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired Williams, and the news
ricocheted through police departments everywhere, especially those,
like the Maryland State Police, already accused of racial profiling
_ the stopping and searching of blacks because they are black.
 &HT;    The way cops perceive blacks _ and how those perceptions shape
and misshape crime fighting _ is now the most charged racial issue
in America. The systematic harassment of black drivers in New
Jersey, the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African
immigrant, by New York City police officers earlier this year, and
other incidents in other states have brought the relationship
between blacks and cops to a level of seemingly irreversible
toxicity.
 &HT;    Neither side understands the other. The innocent black man,
jacked-up and humiliated during a stop-and-frisk or a pretext car
stop, asks: Whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment? It is no
wonder, blacks say, that the police are so wildly mistrusted.
 &HT;    And then there's the cop, who says: Why shouldn't I look at race
when I'm looking for crime? It is no state secret that blacks
commit a disproportionate amount of crime, so ``racial profiling''
is simply good police work.
 &HT;    In the old days, when Lewis was patrolling the Eastern Shore, it
was white people he arrested.
 &HT;    ``Ninety-five percent of my drug arrests were dirt-ball-type
whites _ marijuana, heroin, possession-weight. Then I moved to the
highway, I start taking off two, three kilograms of coke, instead
of two or three grams. Black guys. Suddenly I'm not the greatest
trooper in the world. I'm a racist. I'm locking up blacks, but I
can't help it.''
 &HT;    His eyes gleam: ``Ask me how many white people I've ever
arrested for cocaine smuggling _ ask me!''
 &HT;    I ask.
 &HT;    ``None! Zero! I debrief hundreds of black smugglers, and I ask
them, 'Why don't you hire white guys to deliver your drugs?' They
just laugh at me. 'We ain't gonna trust our drugs with white boys.'
That's what they say.''
 &HT;    Lewis' dream: ``I dream at night about arresting white people
for cocaine. I do. I try to think of innovative ways to arrest
white males. But the reality is different.''
 &HT;    A big part of Lewis' reality is a black man named Keith Hill.
Lewis killed Hill three years ago. Hill was speeding down Route 13
when Lewis pulled him over. He approached the car, Hill rolled down
the window and Lewis smelled burning marijuana. He ordered Hill out
of the car, began to search him and came up with thousands of
dollars of cash and packets of marijuana.
 &HT;    Hill suddenly resisted. What flashed through Lewis' mind was his
friend Edward Plank, a trooper killed by a coke runner on this same
highway a few months before. They fought, Hill knocking Lewis into
a ravine. They wrestled, and Hill went for Lewis' gun.
 &HT;    ``We were in a clinch, just breathing heavy,'' Lewis recalls,
''and I said, 'Man, it's just pot, it's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    But Hill kept going for the gun, Lewis tells me. He couldn't get
it, and ran. He looped through a housing development and back to
his car. Hill gunned the engine just as Lewis got himself in front
of the car. Lewis drew his weapon and fired, striking Hill twice in
the chest.
 &HT;    Lewis speaks often of the shooting, and of Plank's death. One
day, he collects for me old newspaper stories of trooper shootouts.
I'm reading them when we pass two members of his interdiction squad
parked on the median of Route 13. They've stopped two cars with New
York license plates filled with young black men.
 &HT;    ``What's up?'' Lewis asks Gary Bromwell, a bulky, sullen
trooper.
 &HT;    The two cars were pulled over for speeding and weaving, but that
was a pretext. The goal of Lewis' unit, the criminal-interdiction
unit, is to find drugs, guns and untaxed cigarettes in the cars of
smugglers. However, in order to stop a suspected gunrunner or drug
mule, troopers first have to find a reason in the state's traffic
laws.
 &HT;    Bromwell issues written warnings and sends them on their way. I
ask Bromwell, who is white, why he didn't ask the young men their
consent to search the cars. Reasonable suspicion _ anything the
trooper can articulate before a judge _ is enough to justify a
consent search.
 &HT;    ``They're decent people,'' Bromwell says.
 &HT;    How can you tell?
 &HT;    ``They looked me in the eye, and the driver's hand didn't shake
when he handed me his license.''
 &HT;    Lewis interrupts: ``No visible sign of contraband, no
overwhelming odor of air fresheners emanating from the vehicle, no
signs of hard driving'' _ that is, driving long hours without
making stops.
 &HT;    He is listing Drug Enforcement Administration-endorsed
indicators of drug smuggling. Smugglers use air fresheners to fool
drug-sniffing dogs. Signs of hard driving _ these guys drive
straight through because they don't want to leave their drugs
alone,'' Lewis says _ include loose-fitting clothing, day-old
beards and food wrappers on the floor. These signs, though, can
also indicate the presence of college students _ which is, in fact,
the case here.
 &HT;    Did you stop them because they were black men from New York? I
ask.
 &HT;    ``Tell you the truth,'' Bromwell says, ``we couldn't see who was
driving these cars. They were speeding.''
 &HT;    After the New York cars pull into traffic, Lewis shows Bromwell
and his partner, Rob Penny, the newspaper clippings, hoping they
will back him up. ``Eddie Plank,'' he says. ``Killed by a black
male. My shooting _ a black. Robbie Bishop, down in Georgia, killed
by a black. North Carolina trooper, killed by a black.''
 &HT;    Bromwell looks uneasy. I ask him if he believes in a connection
between the race of the shooters and the crimes they commit.
 &HT;    ``People might think it,'' Bromwell says, walking away, ``but
they don't say it.'' He flashes Lewis a look that says, Shut up,
and quick.
 &HT;    This is what a cop might tell you in a moment of reckless
candor: In crime fighting, race matters. When asked, most cops will
declare themselves color blind. But watch them on the job for
several months, and get them talking about the way policing is
really done and the truth will emerge, the truth being that cops,
white and black, profile. Here's why, they say.
 &HT;    African-Americans commit a disproportionate percentage of the
types of crimes that draw the attention of the police. Blacks make
up 12 percent of the population, but accounted for 58 percent of
all carjackers between 1992 and 1996. (Whites accounted for 19
percent.) Victim surveys _ and most victims of black criminals are
black _ indicate that blacks commit almost 50 percent of all
robberies.
 &HT;    Blacks and Hispanics are widely believed to be the blue-collar
backbone of the country's heroin- and cocaine-distribution
networks. Black males between the ages of 14 and 24 make up 1.1
percent of the country's population, yet commit more than 28
percent of its homicides. Reason, not racism, cops say, directs
their attention.
 &HT;    Cops, white and black, know one other thing: They're not the
only ones who profile. Civilians profile all the time _ when they
buy a house, or pick a school district, or walk down the street.
Even civil rights leaders profile.
 &HT;    ``There is nothing more painful for me at this stage in my
life,'' Jesse Jackson said several years ago, ``than to walk down
the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery _
and then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.''
 &HT;    Jackson now says his quotation was ``taken out of context.'' The
context, he said, is that violence is the inevitable byproduct of
poor education and health care. But no amount of ``context''
matters when you fear that you are about to be mugged.
 &HT;    At a closed-door summit in Washington between police chiefs and
black community leaders recently, the black chief of police of
Charleston, S.C., Reuben Greenberg, argued that the problem facing
black America is not racial profiling, but precisely the sort of
black-on-black crime Jackson was talking about.
 &HT;    ``I told them that the greatest problem in the black community
is the tolerance for high levels of criminality,'' he recalled.
``Fifty percent of homicide victims are African-Americans. I asked
what this meant about the value of life in this community.''
 &HT;    The police chief in Los Angeles, Bernard Parks, who is black,
argues that racial profiling is rooted in statistical reality, not
racism.
 &HT;    ``It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males
or put them in jail,'' Parks told me. ``It's the fault of the
minority males for committing the crime. In my mind it is not a
great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal
activity, they're going to look at the kind of people who are
listed on crime reports.''
 &HT;    I asked Parks to comment on the 3-out-of-10 hypothetical. In
Maryland, the state police, as part of a settlement of an American
Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, reported that on a particular
stretch of highway, the police came up with drugs in 3 out of every
10 consent searches. This was deemed unacceptable by the ACLU.
 &HT;    ``Three out of 10?'' Parks said. ``That would get you into the
Hall of Fame. That's a success story.'' He continued: ``At some
point, someone figured out that the drugs are being delivered by
males of this color driving these kinds of vehicles at this time of
night. This isn't brain surgery. The profile didn't get invented
for nothing.''
 &HT;    To justify aggressive policing in black neighborhoods and on the
highways, cops cite numbers _ but those numbers tell only, albeit
important, part of the story. For one thing, blacks make up only 13
percent of the country's illicit drug users, but 74 percent of
people who are sentenced to prison for drug possession, according
to David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University and the
author of ``No Equal Justice.''
 &HT;    Common sense, then, dictates that if the police conducted
pretext stops on the campus of UCLA with the same frequency as they
do in South Central, a lot of whites would be arrested for drug
possession too.
 &HT;    Of course, this doesn't happen, because no white community is
going to let the police throw a net over its children.
 &HT;    The real question about racial profiling is this: Is it ever
permissible for a law-enforcement officer to use race as one of
even 5, or 10 or 20, indicators of possible criminality? In other
words, can the color of a man's skin help make him a criminal
suspect?
 &HT;    Yes, says Whitman, the New Jersey governor. She suggests she
doesn't have a problem with the use of race as one of several
proxies for potential criminality.
 &HT;    ``I look at Barry McCaffrey's Web site,'' she says, referring to
the Clinton administration's drug czar, ``and it says certain
ethnic groups are more likely to engage in drug smuggling.''
 &HT;    It is true. Despite President Clinton's recent declaration that
racial profiling is ``morally indefensible,'' the Office of
National Drug Control Policy's Web site helpfully lists which
racial groups sell which drugs in different cities.
 &HT;    In Denver, McCaffrey's Web site says, it is ``minorities,
Mexican nationals'' who sell heroin. In Trenton, ``crack dealers
are predominantly African-American males, powdered cocaine dealers
are predominantly Latino.''
 &HT;    The link between racial minorities and drug-selling is exactly
what Whitman's former police superintendent, Carl Williams, was
talking about. So was Williams wrong?
 &HT;    ``His comments indicated a lack of sensitivity to the
seriousness of the problem.''
 &HT;    But was he wrong on the merits?
 &HT;    ``If he said, 'You should never use this solely; race could be a
partial indicator, taken in concert with other factors''' _ she
pauses _ ``but you can't be that broad-brushed.''

 &HT;    He does, of course. Lewis was born to seize crack. He grew up in
Salisbury, on the Eastern Shore _ Jimmy Buffett country _ and he
watched his friends become stoners and acid freaks. Not his scene.
He buzz-cut his hair away and joined the state troopers when he was
19.
 &HT;    He's a star, the hard-charger who made one of the nation's
largest seizures of crack cocaine out on Route 13. He's a national
expert on hidden compartments. He can tell if a man's lying, he
says, by watching the pulsing of the carotid artery in his neck. He
can smell crack cocaine inside a closed automobile. He's a human
drug dog, a walking polygraph machine.
 &HT;    ``I have the unique ability to distinguish between a law-abiding
person and an up-to-no-good person,'' he says. ``Black or white.''
 &HT;    All these skills, though, he's ready to chuck. The lawsuits
accusing the Maryland State Police of harassing black drivers, the
public excoriation _ and most of all, the governor of New Jersey
saying that her state police profiled drivers based on race, and
were wrong to do so _ have twisted him up inside.
 &HT;    ``Three of my men have put in for transfers,'' he says. ``My
wife wants me to get out. I'm depressed.''
 &HT;    What depresses Lewis is that he believes he is in possession of
a truth polite society is too cowardly to accept. He says that when
someone tells this particular truth, his head is handed to him.
``The superintendent of the New Jersey State Polie told the truth
and he got fired for it,'' Lewis says.
 &HT;    This is what Carl Williams said, fueling a national debate about
racial profiling in law enforcement: ``Today, with this drug
problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most
likely a minority group that's involved with that.''
 &HT;    Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired Williams, and the news
ricocheted through police departments everywhere, especially those,
like the Maryland State Police, already accused of racial profiling
_ the stopping and searching of blacks because they are black.
 &HT;    The way cops perceive blacks _ and how those perceptions shape
and misshape crime fighting _ is now the most charged racial issue
in America. The systematic harassment of black drivers in New
Jersey, the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African
immigrant, by New York City police officers earlier this year, and
other incidents in other states have brought the relationship
between blacks and cops to a level of seemingly irreversible
toxicity.
 &HT;    Neither side understands the other. The innocent black man,
jacked-up and humiliated during a stop-and-frisk or a pretext car
stop, asks: Whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment? It is no
wonder, blacks say, that the police are so wildly mistrusted.
 &HT;    And then there's the cop, who says: Why shouldn't I look at race
when I'm looking for crime? It is no state secret that blacks
commit a disproportionate amount of crime, so ``racial profiling''
is simply good police work.
 &HT;    In the old days, when Lewis was patrolling the Eastern Shore, it
was white people he arrested.
 &HT;    ``Ninety-five percent of my drug arrests were dirt-ball-type
whites _ marijuana, heroin, possession-weight. Then I moved to the
highway, I start taking off two, three kilograms of coke, instead
of two or three grams. Black guys. Suddenly I'm not the greatest
trooper in the world. I'm a racist. I'm locking up blacks, but I
can't help it.''
 &HT;    His eyes gleam: ``Ask me how many white people I've ever
arrested for cocaine smuggling _ ask me!''
 &HT;    I ask.
 &HT;    ``None! Zero! I debrief hundreds of black smugglers, and I ask
them, 'Why don't you hire white guys to deliver your drugs?' They
just laugh at me. 'We ain't gonna trust our drugs with white boys.'
That's what they say.''
 &HT;    Lewis' dream: ``I dream at night about arresting white people
for cocaine. I do. I try to think of innovative ways to arrest
white males. But the reality is different.''
 &HT;    A big part of Lewis' reality is a black man named Keith Hill.
Lewis killed Hill three years ago. Hill was speeding down Route 13
when Lewis pulled him over. He approached the car, Hill rolled down
the window and Lewis smelled burning marijuana. He ordered Hill out
of the car, began to search him and came up with thousands of
dollars of cash and packets of marijuana.
 &HT;    Hill suddenly resisted. What flashed through Lewis' mind was his
friend Edward Plank, a trooper killed by a coke runner on this same
highway a few months before. They fought, Hill knocking Lewis into
a ravine. They wrestled, and Hill went for Lewis' gun.
 &HT;    ``We were in a clinch, just breathing heavy,'' Lewis recalls,
''and I said, 'Man, it's just pot, it's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    But Hill kept going for the gun, Lewis tells me. He couldn't get
it, and ran. He looped through a housing development and back to
his car. Hill gunned the engine just as Lewis got himself in front
of the car. Lewis drew his weapon and fired, striking Hill twice in
the chest.
 &HT;    Lewis speaks often of the shooting, and of Plank's death. One
day, he collects for me old newspaper stories of trooper shootouts.
I'm reading them when we pass two members of his interdiction squad
parked on the median of Route 13. They've stopped two cars with New
York license plates filled with young black men.
 &HT;    ``What's up?'' Lewis asks Gary Bromwell, a bulky, sullen
trooper.
 &HT;    The two cars were pulled over for speeding and weaving, but that
was a pretext. The goal of Lewis' unit, the criminal-interdiction
unit, is to find drugs, guns and untaxed cigarettes in the cars of
smugglers. However, in order to stop a suspected gunrunner or drug
mule, troopers first have to find a reason in the state's traffic
laws.
 &HT;    Bromwell issues written warnings and sends them on their way. I
ask Bromwell, who is white, why he didn't ask the young men their
consent to search the cars. Reasonable suspicion _ anything the
trooper can articulate before a judge _ is enough to justify a
consent search.
 &HT;    ``They're decent people,'' Bromwell says.
 &HT;    How can you tell?
 &HT;    ``They looked me in the eye, and the driver's hand didn't shake
when he handed me his license.''
 &HT;    Lewis interrupts: ``No visible sign of contraband, no
overwhelming odor of air fresheners emanating from the vehicle, no
signs of hard driving'' _ that is, driving long hours without
making stops.
 &HT;    He is listing Drug Enforcement Administration-endorsed
indicators of drug smuggling. Smugglers use air fresheners to fool
drug-sniffing dogs. Signs of hard driving _ these guys drive
straight through because they don't want to leave their drugs
alone,'' Lewis says _ include loose-fitting clothing, day-old
beards and food wrappers on the floor. These signs, though, can
also indicate the presence of college students _ which is, in fact,
the case here.
 &HT;    Did you stop them because they were black men from New York? I
ask.
 &HT;    ``Tell you the truth,'' Bromwell says, ``we couldn't see who was
driving these cars. They were speeding.''
 &HT;    After the New York cars pull into traffic, Lewis shows Bromwell
and his partner, Rob Penny, the newspaper clippings, hoping they
will back him up. ``Eddie Plank,'' he says. ``Killed by a black
male. My shooting _ a black. Robbie Bishop, down in Georgia, killed
by a black. North Carolina trooper, killed by a black.''
 &HT;    Bromwell looks uneasy. I ask him if he believes in a connection
between the race of the shooters and the crimes they commit.
 &HT;    ``People might think it,'' Bromwell says, walking away, ``but
they don't say it.'' He flashes Lewis a look that says, Shut up,
and quick.
 &HT;    This is what a cop might tell you in a moment of reckless
candor: In crime fighting, race matters. When asked, most cops will
declare themselves color blind. But watch them on the job for
several months, and get them talking about the way policing is
really done and the truth will emerge, the truth being that cops,
white and black, profile. Here's why, they say.
 &HT;    African-Americans commit a disproportionate percentage of the
types of crimes that draw the attention of the police. Blacks make
up 12 percent of the population, but accounted for 58 percent of
all carjackers between 1992 and 1996. (Whites accounted for 19
percent.) Victim surveys _ and most victims of black criminals are
black _ indicate that blacks commit almost 50 percent of all
robberies.
 &HT;    Blacks and Hispanics are widely believed to be the blue-collar
backbone of the country's heroin- and cocaine-distribution
networks. Black males between the ages of 14 and 24 make up 1.1
percent of the country's population, yet commit more than 28
percent of its homicides. Reason, not racism, cops say, directs
their attention.
 &HT;    Cops, white and black, know one other thing: They're not the
only ones who profile. Civilians profile all the time _ when they
buy a house, or pick a school district, or walk down the street.
Even civil rights leaders profile.
 &HT;    ``There is nothing more painful for me at this stage in my
life,'' Jesse Jackson said several years ago, ``than to walk down
the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery _
and then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.''
 &HT;    Jackson now says his quotation was ``taken out of context.'' The
context, he said, is that violence is the inevitable byproduct of
poor education and health care. But no amount of ``context''
matters when you fear that you are about to be mugged.
 &HT;    At a closed-door summit in Washington between police chiefs and
black community leaders recently, the black chief of police of
Charleston, S.C., Reuben Greenberg, argued that the problem facing
black America is not racial profiling, but precisely the sort of
black-on-black crime Jackson was talking about.
 &HT;    ``I told them that the greatest problem in the black community
is the tolerance for high levels of criminality,'' he recalled.
``Fifty percent of homicide victims are African-Americans. I asked
what this meant about the value of life in this community.''
 &HT;    The police chief in Los Angeles, Bernard Parks, who is black,
argues that racial profiling is rooted in statistical reality, not
racism.
 &HT;    ``It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males
or put them in jail,'' Parks told me. ``It's the fault of the
minority males for committing the crime. In my mind it is not a
great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal
activity, they're going to look at the kind of people who are
listed on crime reports.''
 &HT;    I asked Parks to comment on the 3-out-of-10 hypothetical. In
Maryland, the state police, as part of a settlement of an American
Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, reported that on a particular
stretch of highway, the police came up with drugs in 3 out of every
10 consent searches. This was deemed unacceptable by the ACLU.
 &HT;    ``Three out of 10?'' Parks said. ``That would get you into the
Hall of Fame. That's a success story.'' He continued: ``At some
point, someone figured out that the drugs are being delivered by
males of this color driving these kinds of vehicles at this time of
night. This isn't brain surgery. The profile didn't get invented
for nothing.''
 &HT;    To justify aggressive policing in black neighborhoods and on the
highways, cops cite numbers _ but those numbers tell only, albeit
important, part of the story. For one thing, blacks make up only 13
percent of the country's illicit drug users, but 74 percent of
people who are sentenced to prison for drug possession, according
to David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University and the
author of ``No Equal Justice.''
 &HT;    Common sense, then, dictates that if the police conducted
pretext stops on the campus of UCLA with the same frequency as they
do in South Central, a lot of whites would be arrested for drug
possession too.
 &HT;    Of course, this doesn't happen, because no white community is
going to let the police throw a net over its children.
 &HT;    The real question about racial profiling is this: Is it ever
permissible for a law-enforcement officer to use race as one of
even 5, or 10 or 20, indicators of possible criminality? In other
words, can the color of a man's skin help make him a criminal
suspect?
 &HT;    Yes, says Whitman, the New Jersey governor. She suggests she
doesn't have a problem with the use of race as one of several
proxies for potential criminality.
 &HT;    ``I look at Barry McCaffrey's Web site,'' she says, referring to
the Clinton administration's drug czar, ``and it says certain
ethnic groups are more likely to engage in drug smuggling.''
 &HT;    It is true. Despite President Clinton's recent declaration that
racial profiling is ``morally indefensible,'' the Office of
National Drug Control Policy's Web site helpfully lists which
racial groups sell which drugs in different cities.
 &HT;    In Denver, McCaffrey's Web site says, it is ``minorities,
Mexican nationals'' who sell heroin. In Trenton, ``crack dealers
are predominantly African-American males, powdered cocaine dealers
are predominantly Latino.''
 &HT;    The link between racial minorities and drug-selling is exactly
what Whitman's former police superintendent, Carl Williams, was
talking about. So was Williams wrong?
 &HT;    ``His comments indicated a lack of sensitivity to the
seriousness of the problem.''
 &HT;    But was he wrong on the merits?
 &HT;    ``If he said, 'You should never use this solely; race could be a
partial indicator, taken in concert with other factors''' _ she
pauses _ ``but you can't be that broad-brushed.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound
of white one-story buildings. The chiefs drop by, one after the
other, every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at
least 60 percent of his time on community relations. Damian Obiagu,
a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the
chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company
to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary
because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers
among the delta residents.
 &HT;    At one of the wells, Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to
provide ``security.'' But one day, displeased, the chief's men
invaded the well. ``No, no, Damian, you don't understand,'' Hutto
recalls telling the chief. ``You're our security contractor, to
protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said.
He's a nice old man.''
 &HT;    Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many
billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day
in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corp.'s total worldwide revenues amounted
to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by
the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's GNP, while a
pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's
biggest.
 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he
can buy his own big house here.''
 &HT;    Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality,
``He's a pig.'' Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss:
``But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really
bother you, does he? He's just greedy.''
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Hutto says, ``they're all greedy.''
 &HT;    After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser
through Port Harcourt's ``go slows,'' or traffic jams. Boys hawking
everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
 &HT;    A year ago Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a
position the company considers difficult to fill because there is
no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction
with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside
headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a
surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses
straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
 &HT;    And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the
delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But,
particularly after 1995, they were forced to change their approach.
 &HT;    General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he
demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained
impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in
their region. Nigeria became an international pariah. Shell, the
biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black
eye and began a review of its relations with its host communities.
The other companies increased their community contributions.
 &HT;    But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The
deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups,
competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas.
The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and
the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the
military.
 &HT;    A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says
the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has
brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights
Watch says that twice in the last year the military used Chevron
boats and helicopters to crack down on protesters. Four villagers
were killed in one incident, according to the organization.
 &HT;    Like the other oil companies, Chevron argues that its hands are
tied in these situations. The companies are minority partners in
joint ventures with the government and say they cannot refuse any
requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint
venture.
 &HT;    What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often
been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were
kidnapped and are presumed dead.
 &HT;    In Kula, about a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading
a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely
strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two
shutdowns per month last year. In May, 50 young men invaded a Shell
station and closed it for five days, for a loss of 134,050 barrels
of oil, worth about $2.4 million.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one wonders whether President Obasanjo's pleas for
time and another chance will be heeded. Will he push through
policies to reform the entrenched system of corruption and
pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more
angry? And will they be emboldened _ now that civilians, not
soldiers, rule the country _ to create more disorder?
 &HT;    At the office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing
outside under the canopy on one rainy day, and Hutto's voice is
raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an
American worker _ ``a big guy from Alabama.''
 &HT;    It seems he took his boat up a canal near the oil station in
Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The
worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors
pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the
Alabama man is released.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how we'll operate,'' Okoaye says, worried that
such incidents will rise under the new civilian government. ``I
don't know, because security is going to be a big problem.'' Hutto
rubs his forefinger and thumb together.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it doesn't go far enough, money alone,'' Okoaye
says.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, spend more money?''
 &HT;    ``Spend more money.''

 By NORIMITSU ONISHI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound
of white one-story buildings. The chiefs drop by, one after the
other, every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at
least 60 percent of his time on community relations. Damian Obiagu,
a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the
chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company
to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary
because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers
among the delta residents.
 &HT;    At one of the wells, Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to
provide ``security.'' But one day, displeased, the chief's men
invaded the well. ``No, no, Damian, you don't understand,'' Hutto
recalls telling the chief. ``You're our security contractor, to
protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said.
He's a nice old man.''
 &HT;    Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many
billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day
in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corp.'s total worldwide revenues amounted
to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by
the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's GNP, while a
pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's
biggest.
 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he
can buy his own big house here.''
 &HT;    Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality,
``He's a pig.'' Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss:
``But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really
bother you, does he? He's just greedy.''
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Hutto says, ``they're all greedy.''
 &HT;    After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser
through Port Harcourt's ``go slows,'' or traffic jams. Boys hawking
everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
 &HT;    A year ago Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a
position the company considers difficult to fill because there is
no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction
with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside
headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a
surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses
straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
 &HT;    And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the
delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But,
particularly after 1995, they were forced to change their approach.
 &HT;    General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he
demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained
impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in
their region. Nigeria became an international pariah. Shell, the
biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black
eye and began a review of its relations with its host communities.
The other companies increased their community contributions.
 &HT;    But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The
deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups,
competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas.
The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and
the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the
military.
 &HT;    A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says
the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has
brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights
Watch says that twice in the last year the military used Chevron
boats and helicopters to crack down on protesters. Four villagers
were killed in one incident, according to the organization.
 &HT;    Like the other oil companies, Chevron argues that its hands are
tied in these situations. The companies are minority partners in
joint ventures with the government and say they cannot refuse any
requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint
venture.
 &HT;    What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often
been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were
kidnapped and are presumed dead.
 &HT;    In Kula, about a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading
a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely
strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two
shutdowns per month last year. In May, 50 young men invaded a Shell
station and closed it for five days, for a loss of 134,050 barrels
of oil, worth about $2.4 million.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one wonders whether President Obasanjo's pleas for
time and another chance will be heeded. Will he push through
policies to reform the entrenched system of corruption and
pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more
angry? And will they be emboldened _ now that civilians, not
soldiers, rule the country _ to create more disorder?
 &HT;    At the office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing
outside under the canopy on one rainy day, and Hutto's voice is
raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an
American worker _ ``a big guy from Alabama.''
 &HT;    It seems he took his boat up a canal near the oil station in
Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The
worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors
pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the
Alabama man is released.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how we'll operate,'' Okoaye says, worried that
such incidents will rise under the new civilian government. ``I
don't know, because security is going to be a big problem.'' Hutto
rubs his forefinger and thumb together.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it doesn't go far enough, money alone,'' Okoaye
says.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, spend more money?''
 &HT;    ``Spend more money.''
 &HT;    ``Keep them quiet? Make them happy?''
 &HT;    ``Yup.''

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Bill Bradley had come home again, almost. To St. Louis, just up
the Mississippi from Crystal City (where, as you know if you've
heard his stump speech, there were 96 in his graduating class,
along with one stoplight and 3,492 souls all told).
 &HT;    Here, more than anywhere, he is an American hero, the good kid
who worked hard, minded his manners and grew up to be a Rhodes
scholar, a New York Knick, then a New Jersey senator. And now, who
knows, maybe even president.
 &HT;    People who knew Bradley as a kid remember not just his stats but
also how he was the kind of guy who, even as a high school
all-American, made a point of asking the shy or gawky girls to
dance.
 &HT;    One schoolmate, Sam Richards, who works for the town where they
grew up, still feels good that, way back when, Bradley the
student-council president bothered to thank him in front of a whole
convention of student leaders for moving the chairs in and out of
the auditorium.
 &HT;    Bradley the presidential candidate still does that sometimes,
showing a rare feeling for those who have worked hard making the
table arrangements or preparing food for an event. At a YMCA
``character breakfast,'' in Manchester, N.H., last month, he
reminded the crowd, ``Rooms like this don't just happen.''
 &HT;    But he can also show a real prickliness at odd moments. And on
the day of this homecoming, at a news conference for local
reporters, he bridled at the kind of question most pols answer on
cruise control. Missouri's secretary of state had endorsed him and
told of pickup games in which a young Bradley sometimes ``gave away
shots and even let the little kids win once in a while.''
 &HT;    The candidate too had spoken, in his poet's way, about ``the
sense of place along the Mississippi River'' as a metaphor that has
run through his life.
 &HT;    After that came the questions, none of them unfriendly. Yet when
a radio reporter looking for a sound bite with the word
``Missouri'' in it asked him whether he expected to carry their
state, Bradley was snide.
 &HT;    ``If you ask that of any candidate they're not going to say no _
so yeahhh,'' he drawled, as if speaking to an imbecile. ``Of course
I plan on carrying Missouri. And Iowa. And New Hampshire. And
California.''
 &HT;    As everyone filed out of the room, the same reporter dared to
ask a second innocuous question, about the latest school shooting,
and Bradley scolded him: ``Hey, this is a press conference. You had
your chance to ask a question, and now you're trying to get in
another one. That's not fair.''
 &HT;    Later I asked the reporter, for WIL-FM, if there was some
history between them. ``Never saw him before,'' he said.
 &HT;    Bradley was crotchety on several occasions during recent
campaign trips, usually with the local press. A couple of times, he
also took the unusual tack of correcting prospective voters whose
questions seemed to him predicated on faulty assumptions.
 &HT;    Twice too he corrected supporters whose glowing introductions
had slightly understated his resume. After a former intern
introduced him at Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, by
referring to Bradley's ``two tremendous books,'' the senator
amended the count. ``Three great books,'' he said, joking but also
setting the record straight. It seems to have been quite a while
since Bradley danced with the fat girl.
 &HT;    And one of the most radical aspects of Bradley's campaign is his
apparent willingness to be himself, even when the result is not
particularly appealing. The effect, as he travels the country
telling Iowans that he knows nothing about agriculture policy, for
example, is Bulworth with all his marbles _ a sometimes jarringly
frank candidate who seems to feel he has nothing to lose. Which, of
course, can be appealing.
 &HT;    When he makes his pitch for campaign finance reform _ ``Do you
really think one man, one vote counts as much as somebody who can
give $500,000?'' _ heads usually bob. Because Bradley on the stump
is a truth-teller, especially when he's kidding.
 &HT;    Speaking to investment managers in Merrimack, N.H., he invited
questions: ``I'll call on you, and if I don't know the answer or
think the question is stupid, I'll go like this'' _ waving his arms
for the questioner to sit down. ``I mean, haven't you wanted to
have a candidate say what he's really thinking? You think this is a
piece of cake up here?''
 &HT;    Yet he is also peculiarly aloof, running for the highest public
office while safeguarding his privacy to the point that he refuses
to reveal what he reads. And he is surpassingly vague about what he
would do if elected. He wants to heal the racial divide, expand
access to health care and address child poverty. How? In the fall,
he says, all will be revealed.
 &HT;    Listening to Bradley, who is running to help us ``see the
collective whole,'' it is never completely clear whether he is
incredibly deep or just a shade dotty. Is he silent on the issues
by design or default? ``I think it's to my advantage to have people
get to know me'' before they hear the specifics of policy, he told
me. Specifics, of course, with which they may or may not agree.
 &HT;    Though Democratic bigwigs still aren't taking him too seriously,
Bradley has already given Al Gore a bad case of the williwaws _
without saying much more about his own plans than that line about
how he'd like his onetime teammate Phil Jackson, the former Chicago
Bulls coach, to be his secretary of defense.
 &HT;    Merely by announcing that his ideas are bigger, he has spooked
the vice president into unveiling all sorts of specific
initiatives, to the general amazement of the Bradley camp. (Who
knew it would be this easy?) So he won't be rushed into saying
more.
 &HT;    ``Policy has to have some roots,'' he explained. ``If it's just
policy, then you're back in interest-group land. People think
policy means legislation, a bill, but that is not connected to the
deeper yearnings. For love. For hope.'' Which, apparently, is where
Bradley comes in.
 &HT;    The Iowans who turned out for a political breakfast in Maquoketa
on a rainy Saturday last month seemed pretty content, chewing
homemade doughnuts and waiting for Bradley.
 &HT;    One man in the crowd got that misty look that comes over so many
white guys of a certain age when they mention the senator's years
as a Knick. Eventually, he snapped out of it; he's a Republican.
``I'm not here ready to say, 'Rah, rah, rah,''' he cautioned. ``But
I like his family values. A lot of what I've heard are crossover
themes,'' with appeal for independents.
 &HT;    Across the room, a teacher said she felt good about Bradley for
the opposite reason: He seemed to represent a return to traditional
Democratic principles. A couple of people even said they sensed
that Bradley probably knows more about farm issues than Gore, whose
summers hosing out hog parlors down on the family farm seemed to
have been wasted on this crowd.
 &HT;    These folks seemed inclined to like Bradley, even after he
showed up and told them he wasn't really conversant on farm issues:
``I represented New Jersey for 18 years. I don't pretend to know
agriculture.'' (A sore point, I'm sure, for truck farmers in South
Jersey.)
 &HT;    A man who asked him: ``Are you a person of high moral standards?
Are you now and have you always been?'' got this reply: ``I think
people have a right to know if I'm a crook. I don't think they have
a right to know if you're a sinner. We all are.'' Without so much
as a little dollop of sugar-free topping, he told a woman wearing a
huge ``Choose Life'' button that they would never agree.
 &HT;    As he speechifies, clearing his throat every few beats, he kicks
a chair, absently, or digs the heel of his foot into the floor,
hands burrowed deep in his pockets and then set free, all over the
place. Sometimes he rubs them together as if to warm them. When
audiences run out of questions, he papers over the quiet by asking
and answering his own: ``Who was the toughest guy I ever guarded?
Without question, John Havlicek.''
 &HT;    Despite persistent reports of dullness, he is in fact highly
ironic for someone in his line of work, mocking what he clearly
sees as his semiridiculous role in a semiridiculous process. As he
turned around and walked back into the building where he'd just
spoken in Merrimack, we nearly collided.
 &HT;    Forget something? ``No,'' he said, rolling his eyes. ``I'm just
being authentic for CBS.'' The cameras ready, he tried his exit
again.
 &HT;    But when he talks about our ``yearning for something beyond the
material,'' audiences do respond.
 &HT;    ``There is a goodness in most of us,'' he says. ``If we can see
that goodness in our neighbor, we'd feel less lonely, less
isolated, less fearful, and we'd see our untapped potential.'' Then
he invites them to ``feel a part of something you might look back
on and say, 'That was a special time and a special journey.'''
 &HT;    As a candidate, Bradley is first a celebrity, a sports legend.
In his 18 years in the Senate, he was considered a loner, hard to
know and, sometimes, hard to work with. Politically too he was hard
to pigeonhole, voting against President Clinton's welfare bill but,
at one point, in favor of support for the Nicaraguan contras.
 &HT;    He was one of only two senators to oppose Alan Greenspan's
confirmation as chairman of the Federal Reserve, questioning his
international experience.
 &HT;    As others have pointed out, Bradley and his immediate
competition have a certain amount in common, including calm
personal lives and only middling oratory skills. Bradley says he
barely knows Gore, never having worked with him on anything in the
Senate _ where neither won any prizes for collegiality.
 &HT;    Both are free-traders who support abortion rights and the death
penalty, though in each case Bradley a little more so. They voted
alike about 80 percent of the time.
 &HT;    No legislative lightweight, Bradley worked on Latin American
debt consolidation and monetary exchange rates and took home his
biggest victory in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But he nearly lost
his last race, in 1990, to Christine Todd Whitman over a state tax
increase pushed through by Jim Florio when he was the Democratic
governor. When Bradley retired two and a half years ago, he walked
away, saying, ``Politics is broken.''
 &HT;    Most audiences, though, still know him principally as Dollar
Bill, famous good guy and a fairly blank canvas on which to project
any number of their own feelings. Certainly the national press
seems awed, the boys in particular.
 &HT;    ``You'd be surprised how many journalists we've heard from who
want to go to work for him,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's press
secretary, who is hyping the mytho-poetic aspects of the campaign.
(``The campaign replicates the rhythm of when he was on the road
playing ball,'' Hauser claims, though the schedule seems perfectly
standard. ``He does something, we drive, talk, down time, he
settles back in, works the crowd and gets the juices going. We kind
of stumbled into it, and now we try to build it in.'')
 &HT;    Even Gore loyalists are not immune. At a cocktail party for
labor leaders where Bradley appeared with Phil Jackson, only the
presence of the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, kept
another administration official from asking for an autograph.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking, 'How much do I want that autograph versus my
job?''' said the official, who begged for anonymity. ''I don't
think you'd find too many people who could say one thing he stands
for,'' he added, back in Gore 2000 mode. Still, ``when they left, I
couldn't believe I had let the moment pass.''
 &HT;    This kind of adulation has allowed, and probably even
encouraged, Bradley to run, as he says, ``a different kind of
campaign.'' To run on trust. Who should be president? ``The
decision,'' he says, ``boils down to who do you trust with your
life? Who do you trust with your job?''
 &HT;    Of course, this nicely contrasts his own clean slate to the
Clinton-Gore scandals, which he never mentions.
 &HT;    More important, he's asking voters to simply take him on faith,
to trust him to do the right thing even before he's said what that
might be. In fact, even before he's worked it out for himself.
 &HT;    But surely there is an arrogance in his position that, while he
might not have thought through the issues or decided exactly where
he wants to take the country, we should trust him because he is,
after all, Bill Bradley. He has repeatedly said his ideas are
bigger than Gore's.
 &HT;    And in a sense, the answer to those who are asking, ``Then, so
what's the big idea?'' is that the idea of Bill Bradley is his big
idea: the idea that the candidate himself, his history and all he
represents, is the message in a campaign that is the opposite of
say, Steve Forbes' '96 run on the flat tax, flat tax, flat tax.
 &HT;    As Bradley told one particularly enthusiastic group in New
Hampshire, while the sun set over the foothills of the White
Mountains behind him, ``The things I'm going to mention are more
important than policy differences'' between candidates. After the
gathering, one woman hung her head out the window of her car and
yelled, ``He's so refreshing!''
 &HT;    People don't really vote on issues, Bradley told me.
``Particularly for president, they don't. They vote on the basis of
trust.'' And right or wrong, that idea is without question bigger
than the 15-point health-care plan that we in the media are all
pretending we can't wait to get our hands on.
 &HT;    Eventually, in the fall, Bradley promises, content will be
added. Meanwhile, weary of being pressed for specifics, he has made
up some nonsense about how his campaign is now in the ``vision''
phase, soon to be followed by the principle, policy and action
phases.
 &HT;    At this point, he is off to a fast start, raising a surprising
$4.3 million last quarter, with help from Hollywood and Wall
Street. He has described the primary campaign as many months of
``one on one'' with Gore.
 &HT;    Sometimes, Bradley throws a little sand in Gore's direction. ``I
only have time to read good books,'' he said, explaining why he
never tackled ``Earth in the Balance.'' But of course, Bill Bradley
cannot be Bill Bradley and pick a nasty fight with Al Gore.
Instead, he's going so far in the other direction as to claim he
isn't even running against Al Gore.
 &HT;    Really? He sighed: ``The question is, Can you have a politics
that becomes a little bit like the McGwire-Sosa home-run contest
last year? One of them won the title, but both of them won in terms
of what the competition produced for the baseball fans. Why can't
politics be like that?''
 &HT;    Then, he smiled, liking this new idea. ``That's pretty good. I
never said that before.''

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Bill Bradley had come home again, almost. To St. Louis, just up
the Mississippi from Crystal City (where, as you know if you've
heard his stump speech, there were 96 in his graduating class,
along with one stoplight and 3,492 souls all told).
 &HT;    Here, more than anywhere, he is an American hero, the good kid
who worked hard, minded his manners and grew up to be a Rhodes
scholar, a New York Knick, then a New Jersey senator. And now, who
knows, maybe even president.
 &HT;    People who knew Bradley as a kid remember not just his stats but
also how he was the kind of guy who, even as a high school
all-American, made a point of asking the shy or gawky girls to
dance.
 &HT;    One schoolmate, Sam Richards, who works for the town where they
grew up, still feels good that, way back when, Bradley the
student-council president bothered to thank him in front of a whole
convention of student leaders for moving the chairs in and out of
the auditorium.
 &HT;    Bradley the presidential candidate still does that sometimes,
showing a rare feeling for those who have worked hard making the
table arrangements or preparing food for an event. At a YMCA
``character breakfast,'' in Manchester, N.H., last month, he
reminded the crowd, ``Rooms like this don't just happen.''
 &HT;    But he can also show a real prickliness at odd moments. And on
the day of this homecoming, at a news conference for local
reporters, he bridled at the kind of question most pols answer on
cruise control. Missouri's secretary of state had endorsed him and
told of pickup games in which a young Bradley sometimes ``gave away
shots and even let the little kids win once in a while.''
 &HT;    The candidate too had spoken, in his poet's way, about ``the
sense of place along the Mississippi River'' as a metaphor that has
run through his life.
 &HT;    After that came the questions, none of them unfriendly. Yet when
a radio reporter looking for a sound bite with the word
``Missouri'' in it asked him whether he expected to carry their
state, Bradley was snide.
 &HT;    ``If you ask that of any candidate they're not going to say no _
so yeahhh,'' he drawled, as if speaking to an imbecile. ``Of course
I plan on carrying Missouri. And Iowa. And New Hampshire. And
California.''
 &HT;    As everyone filed out of the room, the same reporter dared to
ask a second innocuous question, about the latest school shooting,
and Bradley scolded him: ``Hey, this is a press conference. You had
your chance to ask a question, and now you're trying to get in
another one. That's not fair.''
 &HT;    Later I asked the reporter, for WIL-FM, if there was some
history between them. ``Never saw him before,'' he said.
 &HT;    Bradley was crotchety on several occasions during recent
campaign trips, usually with the local press. A couple of times, he
also took the unusual tack of correcting prospective voters whose
questions seemed to him predicated on faulty assumptions.
 &HT;    Twice too he corrected supporters whose glowing introductions
had slightly understated his resume. After a former intern
introduced him at Phillips Exeter Academy, in New Hampshire, by
referring to Bradley's ``two tremendous books,'' the senator
amended the count. ``Three great books,'' he said, joking but also
setting the record straight. It seems to have been quite a while
since Bradley danced with the fat girl.
 &HT;    And one of the most radical aspects of Bradley's campaign is his
apparent willingness to be himself, even when the result is not
particularly appealing. The effect, as he travels the country
telling Iowans that he knows nothing about agriculture policy, for
example, is Bulworth with all his marbles _ a sometimes jarringly
frank candidate who seems to feel he has nothing to lose. Which, of
course, can be appealing.
 &HT;    When he makes his pitch for campaign finance reform _ ``Do you
really think one man, one vote counts as much as somebody who can
give $500,000?'' _ heads usually bob. Because Bradley on the stump
is a truth-teller, especially when he's kidding.
 &HT;    Speaking to investment managers in Merrimack, N.H., he invited
questions: ``I'll call on you, and if I don't know the answer or
think the question is stupid, I'll go like this'' _ waving his arms
for the questioner to sit down. ``I mean, haven't you wanted to
have a candidate say what he's really thinking? You think this is a
piece of cake up here?''
 &HT;    Yet he is also peculiarly aloof, running for the highest public
office while safeguarding his privacy to the point that he refuses
to reveal what he reads. And he is surpassingly vague about what he
would do if elected. He wants to heal the racial divide, expand
access to health care and address child poverty. How? In the fall,
he says, all will be revealed.
 &HT;    Listening to Bradley, who is running to help us ``see the
collective whole,'' it is never completely clear whether he is
incredibly deep or just a shade dotty. Is he silent on the issues
by design or default? ``I think it's to my advantage to have people
get to know me'' before they hear the specifics of policy, he told
me. Specifics, of course, with which they may or may not agree.
 &HT;    Though Democratic bigwigs still aren't taking him too seriously,
Bradley has already given Al Gore a bad case of the williwaws _
without saying much more about his own plans than that line about
how he'd like his onetime teammate Phil Jackson, the former Chicago
Bulls coach, to be his secretary of defense.
 &HT;    Merely by announcing that his ideas are bigger, he has spooked
the vice president into unveiling all sorts of specific
initiatives, to the general amazement of the Bradley camp. (Who
knew it would be this easy?) So he won't be rushed into saying
more.
 &HT;    ``Policy has to have some roots,'' he explained. ``If it's just
policy, then you're back in interest-group land. People think
policy means legislation, a bill, but that is not connected to the
deeper yearnings. For love. For hope.'' Which, apparently, is where
Bradley comes in.
 &HT;    The Iowans who turned out for a political breakfast in Maquoketa
on a rainy Saturday last month seemed pretty content, chewing
homemade doughnuts and waiting for Bradley.
 &HT;    One man in the crowd got that misty look that comes over so many
white guys of a certain age when they mention the senator's years
as a Knick. Eventually, he snapped out of it; he's a Republican.
``I'm not here ready to say, 'Rah, rah, rah,''' he cautioned. ``But
I like his family values. A lot of what I've heard are crossover
themes,'' with appeal for independents.
 &HT;    Across the room, a teacher said she felt good about Bradley for
the opposite reason: He seemed to represent a return to traditional
Democratic principles. A couple of people even said they sensed
that Bradley probably knows more about farm issues than Gore, whose
summers hosing out hog parlors down on the family farm seemed to
have been wasted on this crowd.
 &HT;    These folks seemed inclined to like Bradley, even after he
showed up and told them he wasn't really conversant on farm issues:
``I represented New Jersey for 18 years. I don't pretend to know
agriculture.'' (A sore point, I'm sure, for truck farmers in South
Jersey.)
 &HT;    A man who asked him: ``Are you a person of high moral standards?
Are you now and have you always been?'' got this reply: ``I think
people have a right to know if I'm a crook. I don't think they have
a right to know if you're a sinner. We all are.'' Without so much
as a little dollop of sugar-free topping, he told a woman wearing a
huge ``Choose Life'' button that they would never agree.
 &HT;    As he speechifies, clearing his throat every few beats, he kicks
a chair, absently, or digs the heel of his foot into the floor,
hands burrowed deep in his pockets and then set free, all over the
place. Sometimes he rubs them together as if to warm them. When
audiences run out of questions, he papers over the quiet by asking
and answering his own: ``Who was the toughest guy I ever guarded?
Without question, John Havlicek.''
 &HT;    Despite persistent reports of dullness, he is in fact highly
ironic for someone in his line of work, mocking what he clearly
sees as his semiridiculous role in a semiridiculous process. As he
turned around and walked back into the building where he'd just
spoken in Merrimack, we nearly collided.
 &HT;    Forget something? ``No,'' he said, rolling his eyes. ``I'm just
being authentic for CBS.'' The cameras ready, he tried his exit
again.
 &HT;    But when he talks about our ``yearning for something beyond the
material,'' audiences do respond.
 &HT;    ``There is a goodness in most of us,'' he says. ``If we can see
that goodness in our neighbor, we'd feel less lonely, less
isolated, less fearful, and we'd see our untapped potential.'' Then
he invites them to ``feel a part of something you might look back
on and say, 'That was a special time and a special journey.'''
 &HT;    As a candidate, Bradley is first a celebrity, a sports legend.
In his 18 years in the Senate, he was considered a loner, hard to
know and, sometimes, hard to work with. Politically too he was hard
to pigeonhole, voting against President Clinton's welfare bill but,
at one point, in favor of support for the Nicaraguan contras.
 &HT;    He was one of only two senators to oppose Alan Greenspan's
confirmation as chairman of the Federal Reserve, questioning his
international experience.
 &HT;    As others have pointed out, Bradley and his immediate
competition have a certain amount in common, including calm
personal lives and only middling oratory skills. Bradley says he
barely knows Gore, never having worked with him on anything in the
Senate _ where neither won any prizes for collegiality.
 &HT;    Both are free-traders who support abortion rights and the death
penalty, though in each case Bradley a little more so. They voted
alike about 80 percent of the time.
 &HT;    No legislative lightweight, Bradley worked on Latin American
debt consolidation and monetary exchange rates and took home his
biggest victory in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But he nearly lost
his last race, in 1990, to Christine Todd Whitman over a state tax
increase pushed through by Jim Florio when he was the Democratic
governor. When Bradley retired two and a half years ago, he walked
away, saying, ``Politics is broken.''
 &HT;    Most audiences, though, still know him principally as Dollar
Bill, famous good guy and a fairly blank canvas on which to project
any number of their own feelings. Certainly the national press
seems awed, the boys in particular.
 &HT;    ``You'd be surprised how many journalists we've heard from who
want to go to work for him,'' said Eric Hauser, Bradley's press
secretary, who is hyping the mytho-poetic aspects of the campaign.
(``The campaign replicates the rhythm of when he was on the road
playing ball,'' Hauser claims, though the schedule seems perfectly
standard. ``He does something, we drive, talk, down time, he
settles back in, works the crowd and gets the juices going. We kind
of stumbled into it, and now we try to build it in.'')
 &HT;    Even Gore loyalists are not immune. At a cocktail party for
labor leaders where Bradley appeared with Phil Jackson, only the
presence of the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, kept
another administration official from asking for an autograph.
 &HT;    ``I kept thinking, 'How much do I want that autograph versus my
job?''' said the official, who begged for anonymity. ''I don't
think you'd find too many people who could say one thing he stands
for,'' he added, back in Gore 2000 mode. Still, ``when they left, I
couldn't believe I had let the moment pass.''
 &HT;    This kind of adulation has allowed, and probably even
encouraged, Bradley to run, as he says, ``a different kind of
campaign.'' To run on trust. Who should be president? ``The
decision,'' he says, ``boils down to who do you trust with your
life? Who do you trust with your job?''
 &HT;    Of course, this nicely contrasts his own clean slate to the
Clinton-Gore scandals, which he never mentions.
 &HT;    More important, he's asking voters to simply take him on faith,
to trust him to do the right thing even before he's said what that

 &HT;    But surely there is an arrogance in his position that, while he

BRADLEY, GORE SHOULD STICK TO WHAT THEY ARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley turned up on ``Meet the Press'' over the weekend,
having decided to take the wraps off an underdog campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination that had previously been darn
near invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former pro basketball star and ex-U.S. senator from
New Jersey, had been quietly going about the business of raising
money and cementing relationships with new and longtime supporters
who might be helpful later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's low-key approach was praised by any number of pols and
pundits as an intriguing countermeasure to front-runner Al Gore's
high-profile stumping. But the onetime Rhodes scholar _ that's
Bradley, not Gore _ obviously believes it's time to turn up the
heat on the vice president _ that's Gore, not Bradley _ by jumping
into the media fray.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's foray seemed to go well, with ``Meet the Press''
moderator and avid sports fan Tim Russert showing Bradley
considerable deference _ and also showing some videotape of Bradley
trading quips with Jay Leno in an apparent attempt to demonstrate
that Bradley isn't the pedantic stiff he appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who have followed Bradley's exploits in sports and
in politics for any length of time, of course, know that he is
indeed a pedantic stiff and will always be. Do you suppose that
it's better being a pedantic stiff than being a just plain stiff?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Gore. If the Democratic presidential
race turns into a personality contest, the smart money will be
scouring the countryside for a write-in candidate. Bradley and Gore
have similar personalities _ which is another way of saying that
neither has any personality at all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these guys are bravely trying to crack jokes on
late-night television or delivering speeches on scintillating
subjects such as global warming and international monetary policy,
the result is the same: Can we say ``yawn,'' boys and girls?
</P>
<P>
   I should interject a personal note at this point. I have long
been an admirer of both Bradley and Gore, have had the good fortune
to meet each of them in person and can say without hesitation: They
are no more exciting up close than they are on television.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There's more.
</P>
<P>
   When you shake hands with Bradley and Gore and look them in the
eye, it is perfectly obvious that you are dealing with individuals
of great substance and _ this is not a joke, people _ considerable
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not the movie-star sort of charisma that sets hearts
aflutter, or even the Clintonesque brand of charisma that some say
conjures up a heartfelt sense of empathy and personal connection.
What you sense about both Bradley and Gore is strength, intellect,
confidence. You sense leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of that seems to come across on television,
which is where most political campaigns are contested nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and Gore have enlisted the aid of consultants and
coaches over the years in hopes of becoming more magnetic media
personalities. They could have saved themselves the trouble;
magnetism is not in the cards for these two.
</P>
<P>
   What Bradley and Gore really ought to do is quit worrying about
how dull they are and just go about the business of telling voters
why they believe they ought to be president. Gore, especially, is
inclined to affect a forced ebullience that comes across as
hopelessly transparent and flat-out silly; he does nothing to win
voters' respect by pretending to be something he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the Democratic Party is lucky to have two highly
qualified candidates seeking the top spot on the party's ticket in
the 2000 presidential election. Both candidates have plenty to
offer without resorting to contrived exhibitions of snappy patter
and phony exuberance. They should present themselves to the public
as they are and trust voters to make an informed and intelligent
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians would find it hard to understand, but most
voters would undoubtedly appreciate such an uncommon display of
sincerity.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    There is nothing sleek or high-tech about this third-floor
conference room in Fairfax, Va., except, perhaps, the bright red
laser pointer that skitters across the eerie greenish slide of
phosphorescent sperm.
 &HT;    The projector jams periodically during the hourlong
presentation, and the central air-conditioning can't keep up with
the late-spring heat, so some very low-tech fans are brought in to
move the muggy air around in circles.
 &HT;    The crowd _ about 40 people, mostly couples, mostly in their
mid-30s, nearly all of them paying a baby sitter so they can be
here _ shifts and rustles in the hodgepodge of chairs. One very
pregnant woman in the second row (planning ahead, for the baby
after this one) fans her face with the cardboard information
packet, creating a breeze in the most old-fashioned way.
 &HT;    There is, to be sure, a very high-tech laboratory downstairs,
but it is highly unlikely that any of these people (What shall I
call them? Clients? Patients? Research subjects?) will ever be
allowed to see it.
 &HT;    At its center is a flow cytometer, a beige box of a machine
about the size of an L-shaped office desk that spends all day,
every day, sorting sperm. Using fluorescent dyes followed by zaps
from an ultraviolet laser, it separates sperm that carry X
chromosomes (which create female embryos) from those that carry Y
chromosomes (which create male embryos).
 &HT;    It is a sensitive and delicate piece of technology, and the
slightest change in room temperature, even the breeze created by
too many people walking about, can alter the results. So no one,
other than the masked-and-gloved lab technician, is allowed in the
room while the sorting is going on.
 &HT;    The process _ known and now trademarked as Microsort _ has been
used in cattle for more than a decade. The Genetics and IVF
Institute, an infertility clinic with a reputation somewhere
between cutting edge and maverick, is the only place in the world
authorized to use it on humans.
 &HT;    Scientists don't like the word ``experiment,'' with its
Frankensteinian overtones, but that is precisely what is under way
here. On this day in late May, only 111 pregnancies and 46 births
have resulted from the Microsort method, and that means there is
not yet enough data to declare it safe for widespread use and to
bring it to a for-profit clinic near you.
 &HT;    To reach that statistical comfort level, Edward Fugger, the
Texas native who runs Microsort, estimates that he will need to
engineer several hundred more births. These 40 people, like the
hundreds of others who have called and E-mailed and scheduled
appointments since the clinical trial became public last fall, have
come to this conference room to learn how to sign up.
 &HT;    They are here for a constellation of reasons: Perhaps they want
a little girl, to balance a houseful of boys; or maybe they want a
little boy, to carry on the family name. Could be they are carriers
of genes for diseases that can be inherited only by boys.
 &HT;    But whatever the specifics of the yearning, it all boils down to
the same thing: They want to help dismantle one more barrier of
nature, to be among the first to cross yet another Rubicon of
science, to make a breathtaking leap in the evolution of human
reproduction.
 &HT;    They want to do what generations before them have sought to do,
and what generations after them may routinely do. They want to
choose the sex of their next child.
 &HT;    And why am I here? The simpler of my answers is that I am a
reporter. I specialize in subjects like these _ stories about the
collision between what technology can and should make possible. I
have written a book about medical ethics, and I know all the
arguments against this manipulation of nature, arguments that are
rallied increasingly as this dizzying decade transforms so much of
science fiction into fact.
 &HT;    Along the way, I have developed a healthy fear of the ``slippery
slope'' _ if we allow parents to choose the sex of their child
today, how long will it be before they order up eye color, hair
color, personality traits and IQ?
 &HT;    I understand the risks of tampering with nature, as they do in
China, where the population has been so drastically skewed (through
abortion and infanticide) that at one point there were 153 boys to
every 100 girls. I cringe at the idea of treating human beings as a
commodity _ pay Microsort $2,500 (per try, not per pregnancy; the
average pregnancy takes three tries) and purchase the sex of your
choice.
 &HT;    And I am all too aware that to people with real problems _
couples who cannot have children, couples whose children are
injured or ill _ this talk of sperm sorting sounds shallow and
vain.
 &HT;    I know all this ... and yet, I am also the mother of two sons. I
love my boys fiercely and I cannot imagine the world without them.
But I always thought _ always assumed _ that I would have a
daughter. Emma, I called her during our silent conversations. Emma,
or maybe Emily. And her middle name would be Penina. It means
``pearl'' in Hebrew, and that was my favorite grandmother's name.
 &HT;    I bought Emma clothes during my first pregnancy. A dusty pink
dress, falling in folds from the lacy Peter Pan collar, which
stirred a memory of something I think I wore when I was a toddler.
Also a blue-and-white polka-dot number, with matching navy
leggings, because rearing my strong, feminist daughter would mean
freedom to climb and freedom from pink.
 &HT;    I tucked Emma's outfits into the far reaches of the closet, and
over the years _ it has been eight years now _ I have found them
during periodic cleaning sprees. I always hesitate for a moment,
then brush them lightly with my fingers and hang them back in
place.
 &HT;    A family of two children was always our plan, our goal, the
symmetrical box within which my husband and I have built our life.
We are comfortable in there. And yet ... I've always said _ always
joked _ ``If someone could guarantee me a girl ...''
 &HT;    Now here stands Fugger, with his crew cut and cowboy boots,
aiming his laser pointer at slides of glowing sperm and claiming a
93 percent success rate for couples seeking to conceive a daughter.
That is not a guarantee, of course, but it is as close to one as
the world has ever been offered.
 &HT;    Microsort is not an absolute, but it takes choosing the sex of a
child out of the realm of how-to books and old wives' tales and
hurtles it into the realm of available and quantifiable science
that is affordable to many.
 &HT;    We care about the sex of our children. Some of us care more than
others, but we all care. It is the first question asked about a
baby, almost from conception, certainly at the moment of birth. Any
preference has always been but a wish, a dream, sometimes a
throbbing unspoken regret. Now those of us who choose to take the
controls are being handed them.
 &HT;    And that is why I am here, scribbling, hiding behind my
notebook. I want to explore what this means for science, for
society. And I need to explore what it means for my family and
myself.
 &HT;    It is striking how quickly the medical establishment responded
to the news of Microsort. Not all doctors approve of the
technology, and most want to know much more, but from the first
announcement of the earliest results, they have considered
Microsort to be real science.
 &HT;    ``It's in a different category from everything else,'' says Dr.
Alan Copperman, director of reproductive endocrinology at the Mount
Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. ``It is not a scam.''
 &HT;    He is reassured, he says, by the fact that the first Microsort
results were published in Human Reproduction, ``a reputable
peer-reviewed journal,'' but he notes that it was only one study
and a small one at that. Of 14 couples using Microsort to conceive
a girl, 13 were successful.
 &HT;    ``I hope that over the years we can see numbers large enough to
call it safe,'' Copperman says, adding that he does not foresee
ever offering it to his own patients. ''But you can definitely call
it science.''
 &HT;    Like much technology, this science began with a narrow, lofty
goal _ to help couples who are carriers for a specific subset of
genetic flaws. There are 350 ``X-linked'' genetic disorders _
conditions such as hemophilia and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy,
which are most prevalent in boys. If an affected couple can be
guaranteed a girl, they can be spared the wrenching decision of
whether or not to terminate a second-trimester pregnancy.
 &HT;    The first human Microsort baby arrived in 1995. She was a girl,
born to a woman who had lost two brothers and two sons to X-linked
hydrocephalus, a fatal swelling of the brain that occurs only in
boys. For several years, nearly all Microsort babies were much like
her _ born to families that used technology to prevent nature's
deadly mistakes.
 &HT;    But word spread and the clinic began receiving requests from
couples who simply preferred children of a certain sex. Fugger
calls this ``family balancing,'' and he struggled for months with
criteria that he could use to evaluate those requests.
 &HT;    It was dogmatic, he says, to restrict the procedure only to
carriers of genetic disorders. (Nor, it should be noted, was it
good for business.) But he was equally uncomfortable with the
appearance that anyone could come in and order up a baby. This was,
as he describes it, a practical struggle as much as a philosophical
one, in that it was conducted with an emphasis on what the
institutional review board would permit, rather than what was best
for society.
 &HT;    The resulting policy _ a couple must have at least one child to
be eligible for the program, and they may select a child only of
the ``nondominant'' sex in their family _ addresses potential
ethical objections, but leaves the door open for expansion.
 &HT;    Keith Blauer, a reproductive endocrinologist at Microsort, says:
``That is the policy for the clinical trial. What will happen in 5,
10 years will depend on what society wants.''
 &HT;    Microsort's decision to accept requests to balance families led
to several surprises. The first was the discovery that the
technique is better at producing girls than boys. While the success
rate for daughters is 93 percent, it is only 73 percent for sons.
 &HT;    The second surprise was that Americans, unlike much of the rest
of the world, do not prefer boys. Of the first 111 Microsort
attempts, 83 were for females and 28 were for males. True, the
process began as a way to select for girls, and true, because it is
better at selecting girls it is more likely to attract couples who
want them.
 &HT;    But there is something else going on as well, something that
actually was learned a long time ago. ``More want girls,'' says
Landrum B. Shettles, 89, an ob-gyn who has sold more than one
million copies of ``How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby,'' first
published in 1970. ``Definitely we heard more from women who had
many boys and wanted a girl.''
 &HT;    Ronald J. Ericsson, 64, agrees. He has licensed the Ericsson
method of gender selection, which is practiced in 28 fertility
clinics in the United States and 15 more around the world. ``We see
more requests for girls,'' he says. At some Ericsson clinics, the
ratio is as high as 2 to 1, despite Ericsson's own statistics
showing a higher success rate for boys. It is, he says, a gap that
has been growing since he first introduced his method 25 years ago.
 &HT;    In a lopsided, counterintuitive way, he insists, this is a
streak of feminism, although it hardly appears that way at first,
what with all the talk of ponytails, dresses and bows.
 &HT;    ``Women are the driving force, and women want daughters,'' he
says. ``And they're not apologizing about it anymore. They used to
call and there would be this qualification: 'I love my two boys to
death, but... .' Now ... there's no apology.''
 &HT;    I opted for surprise with my first pregnancy, and long after the
birth I was numb that Emma was a boy. When I looked at my son,
adorable though he was, I saw a stranger. Where was the daughter I
had been talking to for nine months? The surprise was layered with
guilt and stirred by hormones, an explosive combination. I cried on
and off for weeks.
 &HT;    I approached my second pregnancy determined not to be surprised.
I was still in my bathrobe the morning the geneticist called with
my amnio results. Yes, I asked first if the baby was healthy. Then
I found out it would be a boy, and crawled back into bed, mourning
my daughter. Ultimately, when Alex was born, they put him in my
arms, and the bonding was as the books said it should be. Not ''Who
are you?'' but ``I know you.''
 &HT;    Medical ethicists as a group are troubled by selfish acts _ and
choosing the sex of a child is a selfish act. ``Because I want to''
is never good enough. Their next question is always ``What if
everyone uses it?'' or ``What if the wrong people use it?'' or
``What if well-meaning people use it in the wrong way?''
 &HT;    Ethicists, not surprisingly, are troubled by Microsort, and
their reasons are global.
 &HT;    ``Any new biotechnology is not simply confined within one
nation,'' warns Lori Knowles, the associate for law and bioethics
at the Hastings Center, in Garrison, N.Y. Although the limited
experience of Microsort shows a preference for girls within the
United States, she says, ``it will be used in cultures where women
are oppressed, and it will be used to select for male children.
That will further institutionalize the discrimination against
women.''
 &HT;    Lori Andrews, a professor of law at Chicago-Kent College of Law
and the author of ``The Clone Age,'' describes the 258 clinics in
Bombay that advertise prenatal screening as a way to end a
pregnancy and avoid a dowry: ''Spend 700 rupees now and save
700,000 rupees later.'' One study of 8,000 abortions, she writes,
found that 7,999 of the fetuses were female.
 &HT;    The United States is not free from abortions performed on the
basis of sex. Although numbers are not available, such abortions
are known to exist, albeit to a much lesser extent than in other
parts of the world. Even if it is not used here as it might be in
India, ethicists say, there is potential for abuse.
 &HT;    This fear of the slippery slope, of a slide into eugenics, is
why many countries have prohibited technologically assisted sex
selection. The draft guidelines on bioethics of the World Health
Organization warn that ``sex is not a disease,'' and nations such
as Austria, France, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden ban the
practice.
 &HT;    However, all these prohibitions were put in place before
Microsort published its results last fall, and none who object
think there is a chance that their objections will keep it from
being used in the United States.
 &HT;    ``People want it,'' says Dr. Benjamin Younger, executive
director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``And
when people want things, science finds a way to make it happen.''
 &HT;    Indeed, if Microsort had been an option five years ago, I might
have used it for my second child. Which would mean there would be
no Alex. How could there be no Alex?
 &HT;    I look over at him. He has finished with his frozen hot
chocolate and is pretending to be Anakin Skywalker. I try to
picture Emma, but she fades. She has been fading a lot lately.
 &HT;    Today I know that I can have my daughter if I want her. I am not
too old; the technology exists. But I decide I will not do this. I
have two boys because I chose to. Microsort opened the door to
something else. I chose not to walk through it.

 By LISA BELKIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    There is nothing sleek or high-tech about this third-floor
conference room in Fairfax, Va., except, perhaps, the bright red
laser pointer that skitters across the eerie greenish slide of
phosphorescent sperm.
 &HT;    The projector jams periodically during the hourlong
presentation, and the central air-conditioning can't keep up with
the late-spring heat, so some very low-tech fans are brought in to
move the muggy air around in circles.
 &HT;    The crowd _ about 40 people, mostly couples, mostly in their
mid-30s, nearly all of them paying a baby sitter so they can be
here _ shifts and rustles in the hodgepodge of chairs. One very
pregnant woman in the second row (planning ahead, for the baby
after this one) fans her face with the cardboard information
packet, creating a breeze in the most old-fashioned way.
 &HT;    There is, to be sure, a very high-tech laboratory downstairs,
but it is highly unlikely that any of these people (What shall I
call them? Clients? Patients? Research subjects?) will ever be
allowed to see it.
 &HT;    At its center is a flow cytometer, a beige box of a machine
about the size of an L-shaped office desk that spends all day,
every day, sorting sperm. Using fluorescent dyes followed by zaps
from an ultraviolet laser, it separates sperm that carry X
chromosomes (which create female embryos) from those that carry Y
chromosomes (which create male embryos).
 &HT;    It is a sensitive and delicate piece of technology, and the
slightest change in room temperature, even the breeze created by
too many people walking about, can alter the results. So no one,
other than the masked-and-gloved lab technician, is allowed in the
room while the sorting is going on.
 &HT;    The process _ known and now trademarked as Microsort _ has been
used in cattle for more than a decade. The Genetics and IVF
Institute, an infertility clinic with a reputation somewhere
between cutting edge and maverick, is the only place in the world
authorized to use it on humans.
 &HT;    Scientists don't like the word ``experiment,'' with its
Frankensteinian overtones, but that is precisely what is under way
here. On this day in late May, only 111 pregnancies and 46 births
have resulted from the Microsort method, and that means there is
not yet enough data to declare it safe for widespread use and to
bring it to a for-profit clinic near you.
 &HT;    To reach that statistical comfort level, Edward Fugger, the
Texas native who runs Microsort, estimates that he will need to

something else. I chose not to walk through it.

 By PATRICK E. TYLER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On the night of Feb. 19, 1997, I was detained by a squad of
Chinese policemen in a small town on China's border with
Kazakhstan, which is about as far away as you can get from Beijing
and still be in the country.
 &HT;    The region is hauntingly beautiful, framed on the north and
south by the snowy Mountains of Heaven, which overlook the arid
plain where Chinese and Russian forces clashed so ferociously in
1969 that President Nixon thought nuclear war was going to break
out between the two Communist giants.
 &HT;    I had flown to Kazakhstan in order to cross over the border into
China and to return to Beijing via a long overland route that would
take me through Yining, a remote city where Chinese Muslims had
rioted during the holy month of Ramadan. Unfortunately, the Chinese
had other plans for my trip.
 &HT;    When the creaky bus I was in rolled across the no-man's land and
up to the checkpoint on the Chinese side, I was asked to step out
and show my papers.
 &HT;    As soon as the guards saw my passport they set up a commotion,
calling out, ``Jizhe!'' (``journalist''), as if I were an invader.
They conducted a four-hour search of my luggage and, by the time
the evening was over, I was shown to a hotel room whose door was
then secured with a tractor chain and padlock.
 &HT;    Thus ensconced as a guest of the local Public Security Bureau, I
dozed off, only to be awakened by the phone sometime after
midnight. In a feat bordering on the miraculous, a colleague had
managed to get a circuit through to tell me that China's state news
agency had just reported the death of Deng Xiaoping.
 &HT;    In a panic at being so far away from the story I had been
waiting to cover for five years, I persuaded a guard to open the
door a crack. When he did, I pushed by him and ran into the night.
 &HT;    I gestured wildly at each set of headlights that pierced the
blackness along the Chinese highway, until I finally hitched a ride
to Urumqi _ eight hours across the desert _ and caught the last
plane heading east that afternoon.
 &HT;    Flying over the whole of China on the day that the Deng era
ended, I was overcome with curiosity about the Chinese with whom I
was traveling, and so I walked the aisles for the next two hours,
introducing myself in imperfect Chinese and asking my fellow
passengers their thoughts about the future.
 &HT;    The answers I received reinforced for me not only how profoundly
pragmatic the Chinese are, but also how misguided American
perceptions about China have traditionally been _ and continue to
be.
 &HT;    The Chinese on board _ merchants, traders and some Communist
Party members _ were not seething with animosity toward the United
States. They weren't even particularly suspicious of America.
Instead, they were worried that Deng's death would weaken the
Communist Party's commitment to a ``socialist market economy,''
that it would undermine the successful economic revolution that the
Chinese leader had begun nearly two decades earlier.
 &HT;    These people were fearful that Deng's dictum, ``To get rich is
glorious,'' might be upended and that China would lapse back into
the chaotic politics that characterized the Mao era.
 &HT;    How different these sentiments were from American perceptions at
the time. For Americans, Deng was connected with the bloodshed at
Tiananmen Square. Though the Chinese leader had charmed Americans
during his 1979 state visit _ wearing a 10-gallon hat at a Texas
rodeo and coming across as an impish Yoda _ that image was erased
in a single bloody night.
 &HT;    The June 1989 massacre, in which unarmed students were gunned
down by Chinese troops, instantly created a new and seemingly
indelible picture of China in the United States _ that of the
repressive state.
 &HT;    The summer of 1999 seems in many ways to be a repeat of the
summer of Deng's death, when American perceptions of China and
Chinese perceptions of their own predicament were two huge Titanics
passing in the night.
 &HT;    Americans were swamped in May by images of riotous Chinese
youths, their faces contorted by anger, throwing rocks and other
projectiles at the American Embassy in Beijing in retaliation for
NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
 &HT;    Then, in July, Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, reopened the
dangerous question of Taiwanese sovereignty _ is Taiwan part of
China or not? In an interview, the Taiwanese leader appeared to
proclaim that the doctrine of ``One China'' was dead as far as he
was concerned. When Beijing answered with harsh language, it gave
rise to fears the Chinese might be ready to engage in the kind of
ballistic-missile diplomacy that prompted President Clinton to
dispatch two aircraft carriers to the region in 1996.
 &HT;    This was also the summer of the Cox committee report, the hasty
product of an ideologically supercharged select committee of the
House of Representatives led by Christopher Cox, Republican of
California. The committee concluded that over a 20-year period,
Chinese spies had stolen secrets for missiles, military weaponry
and nuclear warheads from American weapons labs.
 &HT;    The Chinese bounty included design elements for the neutron bomb
and the W-88, a hydrogen bomb so compact that eight of them can be
loaded into the nose cone of a submarine-launched Trident II
missile. The 700-page Cox report portrayed the People's Republic of
China as nothing less than a voracious, dangerous and fully
equipped military rival of the United States.
 &HT;    ``The P. R.C. will exploit elements of the stolen design
information'' to build strategic weapons that ``will be able to
strike the United States,'' the report stated. It also asserted
that ``a modernized P.R.C. strategic nuclear-ballistic-missile
force would pose a credible, direct threat against the United
States.''
 &HT;    That these fears are aroused so effortlessly is not surprising.
A number of Americans have remained deeply suspicious of the
People's Republic and, ever since the Korean War, politicians have
turned this fear to their strategic advantage whenever they could.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton scored points in 1992 when he accused George Bush
of ``coddling dictators from Baghdad to Beijing.'' And China shows
every sign of figuring prominently in the 2000 campaign. Armed with
the Cox report, Republicans have already begun to chastise
Democrats for courting Communist fund-raisers and indulging Chinese
espionage at the nation's weapons labs.
 &HT;    There's just one problem: 1.3 billion Chinese have no interest
in threatening America or in kicking U.S. forces out of Asia or in
becoming an imperial power to dominate the region.
 &HT;    Certainly, the Chinese are fiercely patriotic. Every time a
foreigner says that Tibet ought to be an independent nation, or
Taiwan should be allowed to declare a separate state, it incites an
energetic response, for the Chinese see themselves as victims of
ceaseless foreign invasion since the Opium Wars 150 years ago.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, if any generalization is to be made about 1.3
billion people, it would be that the Chinese want nothing more than
to have a long period of peace and stability in which to develop
their economy.
 &HT;    The people I flew with that day in 1997, those I met and worked
with during my five years in China, just want to get rich, as Deng
exhorted them to do. That is why they are hustling, saving their
money and investing as never before.
 &HT;    And that is why it would be unthinkable for China's leaders to
embark on an arms race with the United States. Prosperity at home
and military expansionism abroad are fundamentally incompatible in
China today.
 &HT;    Nowhere is this clearer than in the Yangtze River Valley, where
the Chinese are building the largest hydroelectric structure in the
world: the Three Gorges Dam. When completed, the controversial dam
will provide nearly 10 percent of China's electrical output.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, no one seems to know where China will get the
financing to finish the project, and this is a source of great
unease for the country's leaders.
 &HT;    China's growth depends on power _ power to run the factories
that are booming in southern China, power to build new factories
there and across the country. Indeed, just to keep pace with
growth, China must construct approximately a dozen 1,000-megawatt
power stations every year. (In America, one or two of these large
stations is added per year _ at the most.)
 &HT;    The need for energy is not just economic _ it's demographic. In
the next 30 years China's population is expected to grow by 400
million, bringing the total to 1.6 billion. In short, the Chinese
need the dam and other infrastructure investments simply to stay
afloat.
 &HT;    Mindful of their Soviet counterparts, whose system collapsed
because its leaders chose to invest in swords rather than
plowshares, China's leaders understand that to embark on a military
build-up would be nothing short of folly.
 &HT;    Economic imperatives are not the only reason China poses a
limited threat to the United States. Strong language aside,
attacking America has never been a centerpiece of Chinese doctrine.
 &HT;    China's nuclear doctrine certainly has advanced in the past
decade, but with a no-first-use policy and adherence to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, China is not (nor has it ever been)
the nuclear rogue that U.S. presidents once feared. China has never
resorted to nuclear blackmail in its international relations; nor
has it activated its nuclear forces in any military crisis.
 &HT;    And yet, over the course of the summer, nuclear laboratories at
Los Alamos and Livermore have been portrayed as undisciplined nests
of naive technicians whose pockets were not so much being picked as
looted by clever Chinese spies posing as scholars and distinguished
visitors.
 &HT;    To hear from a group that has been roundly ignored in the
controversy _ American weapons scientists and nuclear experts _ I
ventured to Stanford University in July for a conference organized
by Wolfgang Panofsky of Stanford and Iain Johnston of Harvard.
 &HT;    I arrived a little late at Encina Hall, which flanks the bell
tower at the center of campus. The room was packed, with people
spilling into the hallway. Panofsky, a physicist and the former
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator, took his place at the
front of the room.
 &HT;    As a young man, Panofsky was in the B-29 that flew over the
Trinity Test Site at 10,000 feet when the United States detonated
its first atomic bomb. Though he advised Presidents Eisenhower,
Kennedy and Carter on nuclear weapons policy, Pief, as he is known,
could be almost invisible in a crowded room _ but for his prominent
scientific brow which juts like a promontory over his small frame.
 &HT;    In a voice accented by his native German, Panofsky explained how
he had read the entire Cox report and found it so full of false
assumptions, unsubstantiated claims and errors that it could not be
a useful reference for anyone studying the Chinese military, as he
has been doing for decades.
 &HT;    Flipping through slide transparencies to illustrate his point,
Panofsky described China as a small nuclear power, with fewer than
30 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the
United States.
 &HT;    In contrast, the U.S. president has at any time about 10,000
nuclear weapons under his command, about 6,000 of which could be
programmed to strike China.
 &HT;    Where America's intelligence community has attributed gradual
improvements in China's nuclear arsenal to the skill of Chinese
physicists and to design information gleaned from open sources,
European countries and espionage, including espionage in America,
the Cox committee rounded all the corners to conclude that whatever
China took, it took from us.
 &HT;    Even if that were the case, Panofsky said, it wouldn't matter.
China, he argued, has not built or deployed many of the weapons it
is accused of having stolen.
 &HT;    Moreover, and perhaps most important, there is no silver bullet
in the American arsenal that could be stolen by the Chinese that
would ameliorate the chronic and fundamental weaknesses in its
conventional and nuclear forces.
 &HT;    The greatest threat China poses to the United States has always
been a distant one: an attack or naval blockade on Taiwan that
would destabilize Asia and pull America into war. The threat is
real, but it too has been exaggerated and misunderstood.
 &HT;    Neither Washington nor Beijing can predict or control the
political changes on Taiwan, which now has a population of 21
million. China and the United States could stumble into a military
conflict over the island if Taiwan declares its independence.
Barring that unlikely situation, however, it is essential that the
United States hang back in the region.
 &HT;    In fact, mainland and Taiwan leaders are constantly talking to
one another in private channels, from which the United States is
excluded. Therefore, the public campaigns mounted by Beijing or
Taipei often are attempts to gain leverage within these private
negotiations.
 &HT;    Both China and Taiwan seek to manipulate American public opinion
and congressional action to their advantage. Americans should be
aware of this ideological battleground _ and that it might be a
mistake to take too seriously the strong words from both sides.
 &HT;    Conjuring nuclear threats where none really exist is a diversion
from the more urgent American task of accommodating China's rise as
a power in Asia, one that will have its own national interests,
many of them congruent with the American interest in a stable and
prosperous Asia.
 &HT;    In 1998 Clinton told President Jiang Zemin that China's leaders
were on the wrong side of history. President Clinton was right _
but it is also true that China, even with woefully imperfect
leaders, is on an irreversible upswing.
 &HT;    The sum of China's negatives in the last 20 years has never
surpassed the positives that have taken place post-Mao: Economic
freedoms have expanded, but so too have personal and democratic
ones.
 &HT;    A hostile American policy toward China would surely undermine
the constructive forces now at work in the People's Republic. That
would be tragic. That such a policy would be based on faulty and
perhaps politically motivated assumptions would be a travesty.

conventional and nuclear forces.
 &HT;    The greatest threat China poses to the United States has always
been a distant one: an attack or naval blockade on Taiwan that
would destabilize Asia and pull America into war. The threat is
real, but it too has been exaggerated and misunderstood.
 &HT;    Neither Washington nor Beijing can predict or control the
political changes on Taiwan, which now has a population of 21
million. China and the United States could stumble into a military
conflict over the island if Taiwan declares its independence.
Barring that unlikely situation, however, it is essential that the
United States hang back in the region.
 &HT;    In fact, mainland and Taiwan leaders are constantly talking to
one another in private channels, from which the United States is
excluded. Therefore, the public campaigns mounted by Beijing or
Taipei often are attempts to gain leverage within these private
negotiations.
 &HT;    Both China and Taiwan seek to manipulate American public opinion
and congressional action to their advantage. Americans should be
aware of this ideological battleground _ and that it might be a
mistake to take too seriously the strong words from both sides.
 &HT;    Conjuring nuclear threats where none really exist is a diversion
from the more urgent American task of accommodating China's rise as
a power in Asia, one that will have its own national interests,
many of them congruent with the American interest in a stable and
prosperous Asia.
 &HT;    In 1998 Clinton told President Jiang Zemin that China's leaders
were on the wrong side of history. President Clinton was right _
but it is also true that China, even with woefully imperfect
leaders, is on an irreversible upswing.
 &HT;    The sum of China's negatives in the last 20 years has never
surpassed the positives that have taken place post-Mao: Economic
freedoms have expanded, but so too have personal and democratic
ones.
 &HT;    A hostile American policy toward China would surely undermine
the constructive forces now at work in the People's Republic. That
would be tragic. That such a policy would be based on faulty and
perhaps politically motivated assumptions would be a travesty.

   NIXON (Tentative) _ Most people know the story of Watergate, but
relatively few people _ historians, researchers, occasional

 By NICHOLAS KRISTOF  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The security guards at the night entrance seemed to be just
about the only people left inside the fluorescent catacombs of the
Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute (ATR), in the
ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto.
 &HT;    But then Hugo de Garis emerged from a cubicle and strode quickly
down the deserted hallways. Lanky and intense, dressed in green
shorts and a pale short-sleeve shirt, de Garis confidently led me
to the research laboratory's innermost sanctum, stepped inside and
let the door wheeze shut behind us.
 &HT;    Grinning exultantly, he reached out his hand and began stroking
his brain.
 &HT;    ``This is the gray matter,'' he said, almost delirious with
pride, his fingers fondling it again.
 &HT;    It is de Garis' brain, but it's not the one inside his head _
although it started there, half a dozen years ago, as a wild idea.
At first he was scorned by more respectable scientists as a crazy
dreamer, and sometimes he still is. But now that second brain of
his is a physical reality: a pair of desktop boxes sitting on a
small table.
 &HT;    One box, curved to evoke a slice of human cortex, holds the
``gray matter,'' or information-processing cells; the other
contains primarily ``white matter'' _ that is, the power supply.
The boxes are painted gray and white, completing the neurological
joke.
 &HT;    But this electronic brain that de Garis is building is serious
business. In fact, it may be the most audacious artificial brain
ever to exist outside of science fiction.
 &HT;    In the next year or two, this piece of ``evolvable hardware'' is
supposed to become the brain _ via wireless remote control _ of a
robotic kitten called Robokoneko, which is Japanese for Robokitty.
 &HT;    The feline's body alone will cost $30,000. When built, it will
be 10 inches long and made of metal, with video cameras for eyes,
stereo microphones for ears and speakers for meowing. On its back
and head, Robokoneko will have touch sensors that will let it know
when it is being stroked, so it can purr.
 &HT;    ``The kitten will be able to do virtually anything you like,''
said de Garis, an ebullient 51-year-old Australian, as he sat back
in his research cubicle. ``It'll play with wool. If you pull its
tail, it'll reach around to scratch. It'll run around and do
hundreds of behaviors. We're hoping it'll jump in the air.''
 &HT;    Yet the complex part is not the kitten itself. Indeed, the robot
is an almost arbitrary vehicle for showing off the artificial
brain, which should be able not only to follow orders but also to
learn new things, even to think independently.
 &HT;    The brain, which costs $300,000 just for the basic hardware, is
roughly equivalent to 10,000 Pentium II-powered PCs. But the
crucial question is whether de Garis can create a convincing mind
from all that circuitry.
 &HT;    ``How do you build a brain?'' asked de Garis, shrugging his
shoulders with more enthusiasm than doubt. ``Nobody has ever done
it before. I'm doing it blind.''
 &HT;    Robokoneko, even if it turns out to be a dead end in the
evolutionary tree, is part of something that is bigger and perhaps
unstoppable. Artificial intelligence is pushing ahead on many
fronts, and Robokoneko is only one of a growing number of ventures
that are redefining the nature of ``being,'' ''intelligence,'' even
``life'' itself. In other words, machines are beginning to encroach
upon terrain that we humans have always regarded as our own.
 &HT;    Some specialists, de Garis among them, believe that by the
2020s, robots will be conscious and will have the memory and
thinking speed of humans _ and then will roar effortlessly past.
They would represent a silicon-based form of life to rival the
carbon-based forms of life that now exist.
 &HT;    The optimists have often been wrong before, and the enthusiasts
often forget that Alan Turing, the founder of modern computing,
predicted in 1950 that machines would reach par with humans by
2000. But if it does happen, then de Garis' kitten may be hailed _
at least by the robots _ as a milestone along the way.
 &HT;    Actually, these are thrilling times in the world of robotics and
artificial intelligence. Particularly in Japan, which is a leader
in the field, robots are stepping creakily into the mainstream.
 &HT;    Sony has just unveiled a robot pet dog, Aibo, which sells for
$2,500 and comes preprogrammed with six ``emotions'': happiness,
sadness, anger, surprise, fear and dislike. And another Japanese
electronics giant, Matsushita, has developed a prototype of a $450
robotic cat aimed at keeping elderly widows company.
 &HT;    ``Good morning!'' the cat says cheerily each morning as it boots
up, and it responds with brief conversation when it is petted or
spoken to.
 &HT;    When connected to a cell phone, the robot downloads news from
the Web and records phone messages. Yet Matsushita's product is
more like a cuddly Palm Pilot than a bona-fide life form. Indeed,
most of today's computers still have less intellect _ measured in
processing speed and memory _ than cockroaches. They also have no
common sense.
 &HT;    IBM's computer Deep Blue may be able to beat the world chess
champion Garry Kasparov, but it would be helpless if a Luddite
approached it with a hammer in hand. In contrast, even the dullest
of cockroaches has the good sense to run away from a rolled-up
magazine.
 &HT;    That difference is what makes de Garis' project so fascinating
and alluring. Robokoneko represents Big Science, harnessing a huge
computer capacity to try to create a breakthrough robot that is
more biologically inspired, more autonomous and, most important,
blessed with a hint of common sense.
 &HT;    In contrast to Sony's pet dog or Matsushita's cat, Robokoneko
will have not just a chip but also the beginnings of a thought
process. ``It's a whole new ball park,'' de Garis grumbled. ``It's
a brain, not a toy.''
 &HT;    But what is the distinction? The answer touches on delicate
questions of artificial intelligence and even artificial life. No
one would call Sony's Aibo an example of artificial life, and
Robokoneko will probably not meet that test either.
 &HT;    It may, however, mark an important step in that direction.
That's because the goal of artificial intelligence is not to
produce a machine that is wondrous and obeys us _ a microwave oven
usually meets that standard _ but rather to make something that is
wondrous and disobedient. Of course, some microwaves meet that
standard as well.
 &HT;    But the point is that creating a mischievous, moody, disobedient
kitten that hides behind the sofa and disregards the litter box _
that would be a triumph.
 &HT;    De Garis thinks he can do it. ``You'll be able to say that it's
in a bad mood or a good mood,'' he promised. ``It'll have a high
degree of autonomy.''
 &HT;    We are still some distance from that. Robokoneko's technology is
unproven, and it could well end up as the world's most expensive
stuffed cat. Most of the time, de Garis is giddily optimistic, full
of confidence that Robokoneko will revolutionize the field and
secure his place in the history of brain-building.
 &HT;    Over lunch in his institute's cafeteria, however, as he
pensively applied his chopsticks to a bowl of vegetables, he looked
up and acknowledged his nightmare.
 &HT;    ``My big fear is that it'll just end up as a big blob,'' he
said, his eyes suddenly luminous with distress. ``Real evolution
has had billions of years to filter these improbable collections of
neurons, and we don't. Now expectations are high, and I just have
to deliver.''
 &HT;    De Garis has unruly, modishly long brown hair. On a typical day,
he likes to wear shorts to work and follows an idiosyncratic
schedule, arriving about 12:30 p.m. His first order of business is
to go into a downstairs theater and sit at a concert grand piano.
De Garis took up the piano only since coming to Japan six years
ago, but his daily practices have made his fingers fluent.
 &HT;    Sitting at the piano recently, he studied the sheet music,
Chopin's etudes, his brow furrowed. Then, at first tentatively and
then with fervor he began to play, his fingers racing over the
keys. Afterward, he broke into a soulful smile and said with a
laugh, ``This helps to build my own brain.''
 &HT;    It would be difficult to imagine a worse place for an outspoken
nonconformist like de Garis than a reticent, conformist society
like Japan's. Indeed, de Garis doesn't quite fit in with ATR's
conservative culture. Gleaming and expensive, its offices look more
like a bank headquarters than a research center. The Japanese
scientists there are partial to dark suits and sober discussion.
 &HT;    Once, ATR nearly fired de Garis for posting on his Web site a
frank discussion of Japan's shortcomings as a place to conduct
freewheeling research. As we talked about all this at the ATR
cafeteria, a Japanese man came over and sat a few seats away.
 &HT;    ``Let's move,'' de Garis whispered.
 &HT;    ``What?'' I asked, puzzled.
 &HT;    ``Let's continue somewhere else,'' he whispered again.
 &HT;    As we walked away, he expressed concern that the man might be an
in-house spy.
 &HT;    Distrust and controversy dog de Garis everywhere, not just in
ATR. He has become a polarizing figure in the world of artificial
intelligence, partly because of his penchant for publishing
alarmist papers in scientific journals about future conflicts
between machines and humans.
 &HT;    Tomorrow's robots, he fears, may decide to deal with bothersome
humans by reaching for the 21st century's equivalent of Raid.
 &HT;    This dystopian vision, normally confined to fantasy movies such
as ``The Matrix,'' irritates many experts because it is so
speculative, but it is vintage de Garis. He seems never happier
than when sitting restlessly in front of his computer, exulting in
his technical achievements while bemoaning their implications for
humanity.
 &HT;    ``I've been reading about the people who built the atomic bomb,
because I profoundly identify with them,'' he confided to me one
day. ``They knew what they were doing and where it would lead, and
I worry about where this will lead.''
 &HT;    Despite all the tension between de Garis' eccentric personality
and Japan's punctilious conformism, there has been one good reason
for de Garis to stick around at ATR. In robotics, this is where the
money is. While Japan is often derided for lagging behind in terms
of personal computers and the Internet, it has been more willing
than the West to invest in robotics. Will these investments pay
off?
 &HT;    De Garis hopes to be one of the first success stories. He brings
the same determination to the design of Robokoneko's brain that he
brings to his piano playing.
 &HT;    But whatever happens to Robokoneko _ whether or not it graduates
from gadget to creature _ there is little doubt that computers are
gaining speed and memory and a growing ability to interact with the
world.
 &HT;    Kasparov, after being defeated by the computer Deep Blue, said
that while other chess computers had been mechanical, this time he
had felt for the first time a mind, a strategy, an ``alien''
intelligence.
 &HT;    For society, the challenge is that while almost nothing will be
more important in the future than the relationship between humans
and machines, just about all predictions about the future have been
wildly mistaken. The technology experts' own record in this area is
pretty bad.
 &HT;    Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, said in 1943, ``I think there
is a world market for about five computers,'' while legend has it
that Bill Gates once said, ''640,000 bytes of memory ought to be
enough for anybody.''
 &HT;    De Garis acknowledges the uncertainties but is convinced of the
threat nonetheless. He argues that the danger is not just of
extermination by robots but also of a war in the 21st century
between those who favor artificial intelligence and those who seek
to block further development of machines.
 &HT;    ``I love my work during the day,'' he said. ``But I lie awake at
night, feeling terrified that my work may lead to gigadeath.'' So
why not change jobs?
 &HT;    De Garis paused, and his answer came slowly, devoid of his
customary impetuosity. ``Personally, as a human being, I don't want
humans to be swatted like mosquitoes,'' he said. ``But humans
should not stand in the way of a higher form of evolution. These
machines are godlike. It is human destiny to create them.''

carbon-based forms of life that now exist.
 &HT;    The optimists have often been wrong before, and the enthusiasts
often forget that Alan Turing, the founder of modern computing,
predicted in 1950 that machines would reach par with humans by
2000. But if it does happen, then de Garis' kitten may be hailed _
at least by the robots _ as a milestone along the way.
 &HT;    Actually, these are thrilling times in the world of robotics and
artificial intelligence. Particularly in Japan, which is a leader
in the field, robots are stepping creakily into the mainstream.
 &HT;    Sony has just unveiled a robot pet dog, Aibo, which sells for
$2,500 and comes preprogrammed with six ``emotions'': happiness,
sadness, anger, surprise, fear and dislike. And another Japanese
electronics giant, Matsushita, has developed a prototype of a $450
robotic cat aimed at keeping elderly widows company.
 &HT;    ``Good morning!'' the cat says cheerily each morning as it boots
up, and it responds with brief conversation when it is petted or
spoken to.
 &HT;    When connected to a cell phone, the robot downloads news from
the Web and records phone messages. Yet Matsushita's product is
more like a cuddly Palm Pilot than a bona-fide life form. Indeed,
most of today's computers still have less intellect _ measured in
processing speed and memory _ than cockroaches. They also have no
common sense.
 &HT;    IBM's computer Deep Blue may be able to beat the world chess
champion Garry Kasparov, but it would be helpless if a Luddite
approached it with a hammer in hand. In contrast, even the dullest
of cockroaches has the good sense to run away from a rolled-up
magazine.
 &HT;    That difference is what makes de Garis' project so fascinating
and alluring. Robokoneko represents Big Science, harnessing a huge
computer capacity to try to create a breakthrough robot that is
more biologically inspired, more autonomous and, most important,
blessed with a hint of common sense.
 &HT;    In contrast to Sony's pet dog or Matsushita's cat, Robokoneko
will have not just a chip but also the beginnings of a thought
process. ``It's a whole new ball park,'' de Garis grumbled. ``It's
a brain, not a toy.''
 &HT;    But what is the distinction? The answer touches on delicate
questions of artificial intelligence and even artificial life. No
one would call Sony's Aibo an example of artificial life, and
Robokoneko will probably not meet that test either.
 &HT;    It may, however, mark an important step in that direction.
That's because the goal of artificial intelligence is not to
produce a machine that is wondrous and obeys us _ a microwave oven
usually meets that standard _ but rather to make something that is
wondrous and disobedient. Of course, some microwaves meet that
standard as well.
 &HT;    But the point is that creating a mischievous, moody, disobedient
kitten that hides behind the sofa and disregards the litter box _
that would be a triumph.
 &HT;    De Garis thinks he can do it. ``You'll be able to say that it's
in a bad mood or a good mood,'' he promised. ``It'll have a high
degree of autonomy.''
 &HT;    We are still some distance from that. Robokoneko's technology is
unproven, and it could well end up as the world's most expensive
stuffed cat. Most of the time, de Garis is giddily optimistic, full
of confidence that Robokoneko will revolutionize the field and
secure his place in the history of brain-building.
 &HT;    Over lunch in his institute's cafeteria, however, as he
pensively applied his chopsticks to a bowl of vegetables, he looked
up and acknowledged his nightmare.
 &HT;    ``My big fear is that it'll just end up as a big blob,'' he
said, his eyes suddenly luminous with distress. ``Real evolution
has had billions of years to filter these improbable collections of
neurons, and we don't. Now expectations are high, and I just have
to deliver.''
 &HT;    De Garis has unruly, modishly long brown hair. On a typical day,
he likes to wear shorts to work and follows an idiosyncratic
schedule, arriving about 12:30 p.m. His first order of business is
to go into a downstairs theater and sit at a concert grand piano.
De Garis took up the piano only since coming to Japan six years
ago, but his daily practices have made his fingers fluent.
 &HT;    Sitting at the piano recently, he studied the sheet music,
Chopin's etudes, his brow furrowed. Then, at first tentatively and
then with fervor he began to play, his fingers racing over the
keys. Afterward, he broke into a soulful smile and said with a
laugh, ``This helps to build my own brain.''
 &HT;    It would be difficult to imagine a worse place for an outspoken
nonconformist like de Garis than a reticent, conformist society
like Japan's. Indeed, de Garis doesn't quite fit in with ATR's
conservative culture. Gleaming and expensive, its offices look more
like a bank headquarters than a research center. The Japanese
scientists there are partial to dark suits and sober discussion.
 &HT;    Once, ATR nearly fired de Garis for posting on his Web site a
frank discussion of Japan's shortcomings as a place to conduct
freewheeling research. As we talked about all this at the ATR
cafeteria, a Japanese man came over and sat a few seats away.
 &HT;    ``Let's move,'' de Garis whispered.
 &HT;    ``What?'' I asked, puzzled.
 &HT;    ``Let's continue somewhere else,'' he whispered again.
 &HT;    As we walked away, he expressed concern that the man might be an
in-house spy.
 &HT;    Distrust and controversy dog de Garis everywhere, not just in
ATR. He has become a polarizing figure in the world of artificial
intelligence, partly because of his penchant for publishing
alarmist papers in scientific journals about future conflicts
between machines and humans.
 &HT;    Tomorrow's robots, he fears, may decide to deal with bothersome
humans by reaching for the 21st century's equivalent of Raid.
 &HT;    This dystopian vision, normally confined to fantasy movies such
as ``The Matrix,'' irritates many experts because it is so
speculative, but it is vintage de Garis. He seems never happier
than when sitting restlessly in front of his computer, exulting in
his technical achievements while bemoaning their implications for
humanity.
 &HT;    ``I've been reading about the people who built the atomic bomb,
because I profoundly identify with them,'' he confided to me one
day. ``They knew what they were doing and where it would lead, and
I worry about where this will lead.''
 &HT;    Despite all the tension between de Garis' eccentric personality
and Japan's punctilious conformism, there has been one good reason
for de Garis to stick around at ATR. In robotics, this is where the
money is. While Japan is often derided for lagging behind in terms
of personal computers and the Internet, it has been more willing
than the West to invest in robotics. Will these investments pay
off?
 &HT;    De Garis hopes to be one of the first success stories. He brings
the same determination to the design of Robokoneko's brain that he
brings to his piano playing.
 &HT;    But whatever happens to Robokoneko _ whether or not it graduates
from gadget to creature _ there is little doubt that computers are
gaining speed and memory and a growing ability to interact with the
world.
 &HT;    Kasparov, after being defeated by the computer Deep Blue, said
that while other chess computers had been mechanical, this time he
had felt for the first time a mind, a strategy, an ``alien''
intelligence.
 &HT;    For society, the challenge is that while almost nothing will be
more important in the future than the relationship between humans
and machines, just about all predictions about the future have been
wildly mistaken. The technology experts' own record in this area is
pretty bad.
 &HT;    Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, said in 1943, ``I think there
is a world market for about five computers,'' while legend has it
that Bill Gates once said, ''640,000 bytes of memory ought to be
enough for anybody.''
 &HT;    De Garis acknowledges the uncertainties but is convinced of the
threat nonetheless. He argues that the danger is not just of
extermination by robots but also of a war in the 21st century
between those who favor artificial intelligence and those who seek
to block further development of machines.
 &HT;    ``I love my work during the day,'' he said. ``But I lie awake at
night, feeling terrified that my work may lead to gigadeath.'' So
why not change jobs?
 &HT;    De Garis paused, and his answer came slowly, devoid of his
customary impetuosity. ``Personally, as a human being, I don't want
humans to be swatted like mosquitoes,'' he said. ``But humans
should not stand in the way of a higher form of evolution. These
machines are godlike. It is human destiny to create them.''

LOTS OF LAUGHS FROM THE OVAL OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dick'' looked like something to run from _ an exploitative
comedy about two high school girls who get ogled by the men of the
Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton parallels seemed obvious, inevitable and ugly. And,
frankly, the sight of Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst in those
skimpy American flag outfits gave me a case of ``The '60s,'' a gag
reflex caused by overexposure to NBC's miniseries extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew Fleming's madhouse satire manages to disarm the
second you realize it's laughing with you _ and sometimes harder.
</P>
<P>
   Written with Sheryl Longin, ``Dick'' is both a ludicrous game
whose object is to get its characters to say its title _ with
feeling _ and a raucous saturnalia comprising a bunch of sketches
strung together into a story told with the energy of a sleepover
and the wobbly-but-lethal aim of phys-ed archery.
</P>
<P>
   Soda-jerky Betsy and dorky Arlene (Dunst and Williams) are on a
class trip from their Washington, D.C.,. school to the White House
when they abandon their tour to chase a suspicious-looking G.
Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) to tell him about the document
attached to his shoe. They recognize him from the night before when
they saw him lurking in the stairwell of the Watergate, where
Arlene lives.
</P>
<P>
   They were trying to sneak out to the mailbox to drop their Tiger
Beat entry for a Bobby Sherman sweepstakes as the cops arrested
participants in a break-in at the Democratic headquarters at the
Watergate. All Betsy and Arlene think they saw was a jewel-heist
bust.
</P>
<P>
   A shifty, paranoid mess, Liddy passes the word that the girls
might ``know something,'' and soon Bob Haldeman (Dave Foley) sits
the girls down in a conference room and tries to find out what they
know, which, as it turns out, is little more than how to crimp
their hair. But they do know how to charm the president's dog.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Richard Nixon (Dan Hedaya, whose fantastically
impressionistic ``Dick'' is day to Anthony Hopkins' night in Oliver
Stone's ``Nixon'') has anointed them the official White House
dog-walkers. A few days later they walk in on a mass document
shredding. Nixon, presumably high on the pot-laced oatmeal cookies
Betsy and Arlene have been feeding the staff and security, makes
them his Secret Youth Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Dunst and Williams form a two-girl Brady Bunch of
pigtails, giggle spasms, Beavis and Butt-head nervous breathing and
deceptive sagacity.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Dick,'' Williams shows an understated,
ready-for-anything awareness as a mostly reserved girl whose
sexual-romantic awakening is brought to fruition by a president who
insists she call him ``Dick.'' Arlene's beach-bound fantasy with
Hedaya's Nixon set to the Love Unlimited Orchestra's ``Love's
Theme'' is a supremely absurd and inspired bit of farcical
foreplay. Williams, like everyone around her, is funny as hell.
</P>
<P>
   The film serves up the girls as a pair of yin-yang Monica
Lewinsky blabbermouths who hardly can contain their excitement over
their easy Oval Office access. But it invests them with a great
deal of moral-social conscience. They use their new political
station to get Nixon to do things like end the war in Vietnam so
Betsy's drug-making brother (Devon Gummersall) ``can live.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming heretofore had specialized in such girl trash as ``Bad
Dreams'' and ``The Craft.'' Now he's thrown sight gags, furious
time-capsule invasions, a verbatim ``All the President's Men'' riff
and a fleet of ``SNL,'' ``Kids in the Hall'' and ``SCTV'' veterans
into a movie best thought of as ``I Lost My Ideological Virginity
to Richard Nixon.''

MORE ARE EMBRACING IDEA OF NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KRISTIN VAUGHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more non-Catholic couples who shun contraceptive drugs,
devices, and intrusive fertility methods are turning to natural
family planning methods commonly used by Catholics whose beliefs
prohibit chemical and mechanical contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   While little data exists to show an increase in the trend,
physicians, nurses, and lay teachers of the methods report more
couples of all religious backgrounds, or no religious affiliation,
are using all-natural ways to avoid or achieve pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that starting 10 years ago we were probably
talking about 80 to 90 percent (of the people learning this method)
were Catholics and now it is probably closer to 60 percent,'' said
Dr. Joseph Stanford, former president of the American Academy of
Natural Family Planning. Stanford is a proponent of a birth control
method that monitors a woman's fertility more scientifically than
the rhythm method, which combines abstinence with careful plotting
of the calendar to predict which days a woman is most likely to
conceive.
</P>
<P>
   Of the method's increased popularity, Stanford said, ``That's
not to say that fewer Catholics are doing it, just that others
besides Catholics are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   According to 1995 data from the Center for Disease Control's
National Center for Health Statistics, slightly fewer than 1
million women ages 15 to 44 who use contraception use periodic
abstinence, which includes natural family planning as well as the
rhythm method.
</P>
<P>
   However, the natural techniques go beyond the traditional rhythm
method to include more precise fertility measurements that backers
contend can make periodic abstinence as effective as other
contraceptive methods.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that, once learned, the techniques take little
time, don't require regular menstrual cycles, and don't introduce
chemicals to the body or cause side effects.
</P>
<P>
   That's what appealed to Suzanne and David Bolling of Amherst,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to live as naturally as possible. I am not a
drinker. I take Tylenol and that's it and I prefer not to take
that,'' said Suzanne Bolling, 34, who has earned a black belt in
karate and runs up to 4 miles five days a week. ``You have to
wonder about anything that you put in your body.''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw an article in a hospital newsletter that described
natural family planning methods, she and her husband, David,
thought it would be a great way to help prevent pregnancy while she
was breastfeeding their 6-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nursing and couldn't take anything and I wanted to do
something natural and there aren't a lot of options,'' Bolling
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about would I go back on the pill, and I don't
think I will. I didn't have negative reactions, but I just don't
want to manipulate my hormones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bollings learned a cervical discharge observation model,
called the Creighton Model Fertility Care System, one of several
natural methods. Women carefully track and chart daily changes in
their cervical discharge, which indicate periods of high fertility.
</P>
<P>
   When a women nears ovulation, her discharge will have certain
characteristics to indicate she is fertile.
</P>
<P>
   Couples using natural family planning abstain from intercourse
during the fertile time to avoid pregnancy; or, if a pregnancy is
desired, they now know when the woman is most fertile. When Lisa
and Christopher Lebreton sought help several years ago, they
discovered that their HMO primary care doctor, Dr. Mark J. Rollo of
the Fallon Clinic in Fitchburg, Mass., is a physician who
recommends only natural methods for family planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he described it, we knew it was for us,'' said Lisa
Lebreton.
</P>
<P>
   Since the birth of the couple's second son, Camden, nine months
ago, the couple have been using the Creighton model for birth
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to do and I don't have to remember to take a
pill,'' Lisa Lebreton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rollo said about 10 couples that he sees use the method, mostly
for avoiding pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the Journal of Reproductive Medicine published an
effectiveness study of the Creighton model, by Dr. Thomas J.
Hilgers and Dr. Stanford, for avoiding pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The study included 1,876 couples who used the method in five
Creighton Model centers in Omaha, St. Louis, Wichita, Kan.,
Houston, and Milwaukee. It showed the method had an effectiveness
rate comparable with those for the pill and the male condom,
according to data collected in the 1995 National Center for Health
Statistics survey.
</P>
<P>
   However, the natural family planning methods are criticized by
health-care professionals who say that only highly motivated people
follow the method closely enough for it to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very select people who are very motivated and aware and
intelligent and reliable, sure it works . . . (however,) people
don't have time to fiddle around with these types of things. They
are too busy to be concerned intellectually and physically when
there are other reliable methods to depend on,'' said Dr. Raymond
Haling, an obstetrician and gynecologist in private practice in
Pittsfield, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for anybody who wants a stronger relationship and
happy family. It is not a contraceptive. It is a system where one's
fertility is put into the hands of the married couple,'' said
Hilgers, director of the Pope Paul 6th Institute in Omaha, who
helped standardize the Creighton Model while at Creighton
University two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 1,000 people have learned how to teach the
Creighton method. The training centers span from New Hampshire to
New Mexico, and have grown from two to six in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Ferreira, who teaches the method in British Columbia, said
she sometimes travels up to eight hours to teach couples the
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say a third of my couples are not Catholic. My newest
clients are actually Baptist, Anglican, B'hai, atheist, or have no
affiliation at all,'' Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
   While the reasons for choosing the natural method vary, Ferreira
said, some ``feel that (contraception) is against their church
teachings, but their teachings are rather vague about it or they
got into it because they wanted the more natural way of life that
more people are choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Pratte, 31, and Steve Pratte, 32, of Manchester, N.H., who
are parents of three boys, have used the method both to achieve
pregnancy and now for ``spacing'' following their third child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us feel like, `Why didn't anyone tell us about this
before?' '' Amy Pratte said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the best-kept secret in medicine,'' Rollo said.
``It's a matter of time. I think that it will only grow, especially
with all of the alternative medicine and holistic care. People are
more in tune to doing the natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate each other on a deeper level and when we are
together again it's like the honeymoon effect,'' Amy Pratte said,
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Many couples report similar results, Hilgers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the reputation of not being very fun-loving folks and,
really,'' Hilgers said, ``it's quite the opposite.''

A MAPLE LEAF LEXICON FROM `EH' TO `Z' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; spent most of the past week in Canada, seeing how the upper
half lives. I listened to the radio, scanned the newspapers, went
shopping, and interacted with innumerable Canadians. And all this
without the aid of a dictionary _ astonishing!
</P>
<P>
   I say this because not only has Oxford University Press
published a Dictionary of Canadian English, but the 130,000-word
tome is a runaway success. Since publication, it has spent 54 weeks
on the Toronto Globe and Mail's bestseller list and sold 100,000
copies. ``We've sold more than Pierre Trudeau's memoirs and Ken
Dryden's `The Game,' '' enthuses editor Katherine Barber, who now
has her own television show piggybacking on the dictionary's
success.
</P>
<P>
   (Ken Dryden, ``Canadian hockey player, executive, author, and
lawyer,'' is, of course, the legendary Montreal goalie who shares
an entry with John Dryden, the English poet. The DCE's biographical
entries are generally strong, including Canada's own Ralph Nader
and the great novelist Timothy Findley. Panflashes like Peter
Jennings and Alex Trebek will be reserved for future
consideration.)
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone pay 45 Canadian dollars _ now there's a word
with a different meaning north of Niagara Falls! _ for a dictionary
that has barely 2,000 entries that are purely Canadian? ``We have
this thing about Canadian identity,'' Barber explains. ``Canadians
want to prove to the world that they're not Americans. This
dictionary has iconic significance. Now, we can point to the
bookshelf and say, `See.' ''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to lug the DCE around with me during my Canada
sojourn. I kept an eye out for new words, and then pawed through
the dictionary to see if they were there. Herewith my not entirely
scientific results:
</P>
<P>
   I found the word ``isogonic'' (DCE: ``corresponding to equal
values of magnetic declination'') in a fascinating article about an
escapist sea voyage in Saturday Night magazine. Wandering around
Halifax, I spotted a sign directing me to a ``parkade'' (``n. Cdn.
a parking garage''). A University of Toronto professor used the
phrase ``hive off'' (``to separate from a larger group'') during a
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show called ``Some of the Best Minds of
Our Time.''
</P>
<P>
   I tripped across the term ``lisle stockings'' (``a fine smooth
cotton thread for stockings'') in Alice Munro's short story ``The
Jack Randa Hotel.'' ``Finical,'' a cognate and synonym for
``finicky,'' showed up in a poem by Elizabeth Bishop. I am
stretching for Canadian content here, but I read the Bishop poem
``The Sandpiper'' on the Yarmouth-Portland ferry, which sails well
within Canada's 200-mile economic zone. Furthermore, Bishop spent
many formative childhood years in Nova Scotia, a biographical
fillip overlooked by the DCE.
</P>
<P>
   Final tally: DCE 5, Skeptical Reviewer 0.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's practical. But the Dictionary of Canadian English is
also fun. ``Hooch'' is a Canadian word, not derived from the
chemical notation for the alcohol molecule (C2H5OH), as the DARE
program tells young children. It actually comes from a Tlingit
word, ``hutsnuwu,'' meaning ``grizzly-bear fort,'' Barber says.
``It got borrowed into English as `Hoochinoo' to designate an
Indian people living in Alaska who are reputed to produce strong
drink.'' Barber and her staff of 10 also chased down
``40-pounder,'' slang for the 40-ounce liquor containers popular in
some corners of the frozen northlands.
</P>
<P>
   Other memorable Canadianisms: ``garburetor,'' for garbage
disposal, sometimes called a ``pig'' here in the United States.
``Hydro'' for household electricity. ``Have had the biscuit'' means
``to be done for,'' which should not be confused with the
Britishism ``to take the biscuit,'' which means `'to take the
cake.'' I was surprised to learn from Barber that Canadian English
has no proprietary, derogatory terms for Americans. French has at
least two, probably many more.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian English does have four slang words for underwear:
``gaunch,'' ``gotch'' (``compare Hungarian gatya, Serbo-Croat
gace''), ``gitch,'' and ``ginch.'' Canada trumps us, yet again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when we thought we had heard the last word about Bill and
Hill's relationship, author Christopher Andersen pulls us back in
with his new book, ``Bill and Hillary: The Marriage.'' And the
American people _ that monolithic group often cited by politicians
and the media _ may initially be none too thrilled. After all,
didn't we discover more than we ever wanted to about the Clintons'
union by the time l'affaire Lewinsky limped to its conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there are some lingering questions. And Andersen's page
turner, published by William Morrow, offers enough salacious
answers that people will no doubt be sucked back into the vortex of
the Clintons' troubled marriage.

<P>
   Like an ersatz romance novel, ``Bill and Hillary'' has it all.
Lies. Betrayals. Sexual intrigue. And, yes, even love. Forget the
benign story lines of ``Sex and the City,'' lurid ``news'' items in
The Star, or gossip about Hollywood celebrities' drug and sex
habits. The most spellbinding action seems to be coming out of the
White House (which had no comment about the book), and it's packed
into the 340 pages of ``Bill and Hillary.'' Andersen spoke to about
40 players, everyone from Juanita Broaddrick to Kathleen Willey to
Dick Morris, and sifted through depositions, archival material, and
periodicals. Here are some of his more intriguing offerings:
</P>
<P>
   Do Hill and Bill really sleep together? Nope. Following in the
footsteps of their political idols Jack and Jackie Kennedy, Bill
and Hill slept in separate bedrooms at the time of the scandal.
Andersen further states: ``In fact, the Clintons had not shared the
same bedroom _ much less the same bed _ for at least seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons fought. A lot. Heated arguments between Hill and
Bill were a familiar sound to White House staffers and Secret
Service agents. They usually occurred several times a week. And
Hillary was a hurler. Books and an ashtray are just some of the
things she apparently threw at the president during their White
House battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They yell at each other a lot,'' Chelsea supposedly told a
friend. ``And that made me worry that they were going to get a
divorce. But then my mom told me not to worry _ that all parents
fight sometimes, and that it doesn't mean they don't still love
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Why it's obvious Hillary didn't know about Monica and ``the
Creep.'' This is how Hillary is said to have reacted when Bill
finally confessed his liaisons with Lewinsky to Hillary: She
slapped his face ``hard enough to leave a red mark.'' Then she
yelled. ``You stupid, stupid bastard.'' Her words, delivered in the
shrill, ear-splitting level that had become familiar to White House
personnel over the years, ricocheted down the corridor. ``My God,
Bill, how could you risk everything for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Women Bill has ``known'' during his marriage to Hillary (or why
Hillary should have at least suspected the Monica business was
true). Yeah, we all know about Broaddrick, Gennifer Flowers, Susan
McDougal, and 1981's Miss America, Elizabeth Ward Gracen. But there
were apparently at least a dozen other women Clinton had had
affairs with before becoming president, he admitted to Betsey
Wright, his chief of staff during his days as governor of Arkansas.
Shockingly, Andersen says, that number doesn't include Clinton's
one-night stands and encounters with prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trysts went upscale in the 1990s to include Barbra
Streisand, Sharon Stone, and Eleanor Mondale, daughter of former
vice president Walter Mondale. As Hillary cared for her dying
father Hugh in 1993, Clinton invited Streisand for an overnight
White House visit. Clinton arranged a hotel rendezvous with Stone.
And in 1996, Mondale was once seen exiting Clinton's Los Angeles
hotel room _ at 3:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   How Hillary followed John F. Kennedy's advice: ``Don't get mad,
get even.'' After Clinton aborted his attempt to run for president
in 1987 because of his extracurricular activities, Hillary
reportedly had her own torrid affair, with Vince Foster, the
deceased White House counsel who was then her Rose Law Firm cohort
in Arkansas. Reportedly Foster was often seen fondling and kissing
Hillary in public. The couple even vacationed at a Rose Law Firm
cabin in a secluded mountain resort in 1987. They would disappear
inside the cabin for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and Vince were deeply in love,'' L. D. Brown, an
Arkansas state trooper assigned to guard the Clintons, told
Andersen. ``I saw them, locked in each other's arms, deep-kissing,
nuzzling.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown says Hillary told him, ``There are some things you have to
get outside your marriage that you can't get in it.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Clintons broke the news of the Lewinsky affair to
Chelsea. They didn't. A friend of Chelsea's tells Andersen,
``President Clinton did not apologize to Chelsea. He did not even
talk to Chelsea about the Monica Lewinsky thing, and Mrs. Clinton
was too angry and humiliated to do it. So Chelsea was more or less
left to fend for herself. She wound up getting the news from TV
like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the author claims Bill is still a sex addict. Andersen says
a mere two weeks after the Senate's impeachment verdict, a Secret
Service agent invited a tall blond woman to have a private cocktail
with the president. A month later a military officer told her
superior that Clinton had groped her after another Washington
function.
</P>
<P>
   Why Bill and Hill will remain together nevertheless. Well,
there's their daughter and that pesky Senate campaign in New York
that Hillary seems to be gravitating toward. But the Clintons'
unity seems to come from a deeper level. Says Andersen, ``Just as
Jack Kennedy admired Jackie for her grace, beauty, and courage even
as he pursued other women, Bill is in awe of Hillary's
intelligence, grit, and unwavering loyalty. To her, he represents
not only an avenue to power _ and by extension a means of
accomplishing great things.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, just think of their marriage as a dysfunctional
version of the phrase made famous in ``Jerry Maguire'': ``You
complete me.''

VENEZUELAN LEADER CONSOLIDATES POWER, BUT AIMS UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ As she stood in a downtown park last week watching her
president, Hugo Chavez, blow out the candles on his birthday cake,
Maribel Rosado's eyes glistened with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Although she hasn't held a steady job for more than a year since
her former employer, a discount clothing store, went bankrupt, the
27-year-old mother of three children couldn't contain her emotions
as she joined hundreds of other well-wishers in a ceremony that was
broadcast live on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never paid much attention to politics before because I knew
they were all corrupt thieves,'' she said, her eyes fixed on her
president on the tube. ``But Hugo Chavez is different and he's our
only hope for a better future.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Latin America's longest-running democracies is undergoing
a remarkable political transformation, due mostly to the unorthodox
style of its 45-year-old president who has reawakened an apathetic
population and all-but-destroyed its traditional political
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Chavez attempts to push his ``peaceful and
democratic revolution'' to rid this South American country of
decades of political corruption, there are worries whether he can
fix the country's growing economic problems _ or whether he is
simply laying the foundation to become the region's newest
dictator. Such questions are of vital concern to Washington, which
depends on oil from Venezuela more than from any other nation in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the answers so unclear is Chavez himself. In
one year he has gone from bombastic, beret-wearing outsider _ known
primarily for his 1992 attempted military overthrow of his nation _
to a leader who now draws comparisons to Argentine populist Juan
Peron and even to John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a classic Latin American populist, and there's no doubt
that many people like him,'' said Maxim Ross, a prominent economist
who is one of Chavez's most vocal critics because he fears that a
Chavez presidency will lead to a more state-controlled economy.
``But he has no short- or long-term plan. It's a revolution of
words but not of action.''
</P>
<P>
   Since winning the presidential election in an upset victory in
December, Chavez has accumulated power with military precision. In
March, he demanded and got an ``enabling law'' passed through
Congress that gives him power to change fiscal policy without
legislative approval. The following month, voters approved a
referendum that he called for to create a new assembly to rewrite
the country's 38-year-old constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Elections last month gave Chavez's party control of over 90
percent of the 131-member constitutional assembly, making it likely
that it will rubber-stamp his requests to allow presidents to be
reelected, have longer terms, and be able to dissolve the nation's
Congress and Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution itself is not going to change things, but it
has become a symbolic point of departure for Chavez and his
message,'' said Richard Hillman, a political scientist and
Venezuela expert at St. John Fisher College in New York. ``He has
to improve people's everyday lives.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also fears that the former paratrooper is militarizing
the presidential palace by appointing more than 50 active or
retired officers to top government positions, including the board
of directors of Petroleros de Venezuela, the country's massive,
state oil enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Chavez's steamrolling presidency has been weak, in
part because the president's approval ratings, especially among
poor residents who have pinned their economic hopes on him, hover
around 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also because both of Venezuela's political parties have
been left nearly decimated by the Chavez phenomenon. Since last
month's electoral drubbing, leaders of both parties _ the
Democratic Action and the Social Christian organization known as
COPEI _ have pledged to make over their reviled image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The page has turned for the other political parties, and I
think they are mostly dead,'' said COPEI's Henrique Capriles, 27,
president of the country's Chamber of Deputies. ``There is still so
much resentment and accumulated frustration against them and that
is exactly what Chavez has tapped into.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chavez has concentrated on his political power, the country's
economic problems have become a more urgent issue. Record-low oil
prices last year caused Venezuela's unemployment and inflation
rates to soar above 20 percent. Although petroleum prices have
rebounded this year, analysts still predict the country's economy
will shrink by about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has offered a small menu of economic measures: he has
replaced a sales tax _ which affects rich and poor alike _ with a
more progressive value-added tax; he has created a new,
government-funded public works plan that will temporarily put
thousands of workers to work rebuilding the country's decaying
infrastructure; and he plans to privatize parts of Venezuela's
spotty electricity industry.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using his new powers to create an overall
economic blueprint or offer investors soothing words about
stability, Chavez has done neither, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days he can sound very moderate, and talk about opening
up the economy,'' said Ross, who lost in his own bid for the
assembly. ``And other days he talks about resdistributing wealth
with leftist rhetoric that will only take this country backwards.
That's why no one knows who he really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Born to a poor family in the western interior city of Barinas,
Chavez's first dreams were about the major leagues. After gaining
entrance into the army's military academy he became a star pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But he was never signed by a team, so he stuck with the army,
where he continued to develop his populist ideas and rose to the
rank of lieutenant colonel. In February 1992, he and a band of
fellow soldiers stormed the country's presidential palace in a
failed coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   While in prison, he read voraciously, devouring everything from
the Bible to speeches by Simon Bolivar, the country's liberator
whom he calls his greatest influence. When he was released in 1994
by a presidential decree, he vowed to continue his crusade but with
votes rather than guns.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Chavez seems to bask in the sudden glory. In a country
where most of its 24 million residents have some Indian or African
ancestry but its celebrities are often light-skinned, the darker
president hosts nationally televised radio and TV shows every week
where voters can talk directly to him. Chavez has also started a
new weekly government-run newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He also appears to relish his role as a political provocateur,
developing ties with controversial figures. He has a strong
friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro, and in April wrote a fan
letter to Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos the Jackal,
the jailed Venezuelan terrorist behind several Cold War-era
assassinations, hijackings and bombings. Last week, Chavez invited
Iraq's Saddam Hussein to an oil-related conference he plans to
convene later this year.
</P>
<P>
   While such behavior may unsettle outside observers and the
country's elite, it probably won't be a problem as long as Chavez
doesn't compromise Venezuela's 41-year-old democracy and can keep
his promise to weed out corruption and mend the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's a dictator, though sometimes he sounds like
it,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, a former economic minister who is now
editor of the Caracas daily El Mundo. ``The road is completely open
to Chavez right now. But if things don't get better, people will
get frustrated with him, too. Then the really scary question is,
what happens next?''

INTERNET SPONSORS USE LPGA AS SITE LAUNCHING PAD

<P>
   When Jean Boudreau heard the Ladies Professional Golf
Association was returning to Massachusetts last week, she said she
immediately saw a marketing opportunity for her new company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect fit,'' said Boudreau, who with her husband
Jim and mother Frances Wong opened LadysGolf.com in Framingham last
December. ``We wanted to launch our on-line store right about the
time the tournament is scheduled, so we thought it was a great
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 20 percent of all golfers are women, and one-third of
all new golfers are women,'' she said. ``More and more women are
playing for fun, but also for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA is back at the Pleasant Valley Country Club in Sutton,
Mass. this week for the first time in a quarter century, with the
AreaWeb.com Challenge presented by LadysGolf.com.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest, and arguably the most successful, women's
professional sports organization, the LPGA is enjoying a huge year
in 1999, just before it celebrates its 50th anniversary next year.
Winning purses are burgeoning; the tour is garnering more
television coverage than ever, and corporate sponsors are
increasingly interested in the marketing opportunities it provides.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA officials say that while the men's tours continue to far
outpace the financial performance of the women's, their goal is
continued growth through increasing television coverage and
corporate sponsorships. While a couple of perilous hazards must be
avoided in the near term, most observers say the tour is positioned
for continued expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LPGA is growing at a pretty strong clip,'' said Lance
Helgeson, managing editor of the IEG Sponsorship Report, in
Chicago. ``It's an increasingly popular platform for companies to
join with marketing efforts, and the LPGA is doing a pretty good
job of growing its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's going on is that companies know women are
playing golf, not just because it's a good game, but because women
realize it's imperative in the business world to be out there with
the men,'' Helgeson said. ``Golf courses have always been a place
where lots of deals are done, and where that sort of networking
takes place. And women very clearly are playing right along.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorship of the LPGA has increased by more than 33
percent from 1995 to 1998, from $21.9 million to $28.4 million,
according to IEG. But that remains a small slice of the overall
corporate sponsorship of golf in the United States, which totals
$650 million for all events, including the Professional Golf
Association, the PGA Senior Tour, the United States Golf
Association events for men and women, the Nike Tour, and others.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA officials say they believe the tournment at Pleasant Valley
will be the first sports event in history to feature Internet
companies as both a named sponsor and a presenting sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LPGA is just such a high caliber organization and the
participants and the audience are all high demographics _ it is a
great fit for us,'' said Domenic Caloia, president and chairman of
the board of AreaWeb.com, an Internet search engine that uses area
codes to find local Web sites that lists events, retail outlets,
services, institutions and other information by designated
geographic area. Caloia said he invested in the LPGA tournament
even though his company's new online service will not be launched
until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was not perfect, but the opportunity was too great
to pass up,'' Caloia said. ``Like many Internet companies, we're
doing a lot of private financing, right now, to expand the company.
That kind of entertaining, face-to-face meeting opportunity
provides us with huge opportunities well beyond just spending the
money on advertising and sitting behind the desk waiting for
something to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorships of AreaWeb.com and LadysGolf.com were secured
for the new LPGA tournament in Pleasant Valley _ one of four new
tournaments on the tour this year _ by Golf Classics Inc., a
division of Entertainment Sports Equities Co., of Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms have paid somewhat more than $1 million, in total,
for the name and presenting sponsorships, and they have options,
with rights of first refusal, for three additional years, according
to David Rogers, president and chief operating officer of
Entertainment Sports Equities.
</P>
<P>
   Large, established companies say they also increasingly value
their relationship with the womens' tour. The Gillette Co. and at
least two other firms with Massachusetts roots, Titleist and
FootJoy Worldwide and Spalding Sports Worldwide sponsor the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's role is integral to the LPGA's operations. The
company finances the Gillette Tour Challenge, a 38-event program
that spans the LPGA, Senior and PGA Tours. Players compete in an
unusual alternate shot competition for a $21,000 purse, culminating
in the Gillette Tour Challenge Championship in Bermuda, on Oct. 4
and 5. That championship purse is $1.95 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the LPGA as a great way to associate our products
with one of the leading sports organizations and one of the hottest
growing sports,'' said Eric Kraus, a marketing spokesman for
Gillette. ``The presentation tie-ins at the retail level are great,
and the particpation of our retail partners is doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the LPGA, signs of growth abound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the tour handled 36 events. Now it is 43. Total purses
have nearly doubled, from $18.4 million in 1991 to $36.2 million
this year. There are now 11 events that offer purses of at least $1
million, and last year Annika Sorenstam became the fastest player
in LPGA hstory to break the $3 million career earnings mark (5
years, 5 months and 29 days).
</P>
<P>
   A total of 33 LPGA events will be televised this year, providing
the most coverage ever, some 238 hours. Just as importantly, the
LPGA is suddenly risking less of its own capital purchasing
television time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 100 percent of the television coverage time was
purchased by LPGA, with corporate sponsors and television
advertisers helping defray the cost. Now, the Golf Channel is
paying a rights fee and ESPN and ESPN2 are sharing the risk with
the LPGA. While the arrangements are still a long way from the $136
million television contract secured by the PGA, they are
significant steps beyond the days that the LPGA had to finance its
own television time.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Votaw, president of the LPGA, has said that he anticipates
continued growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to get more rights fees,'' Votaw told Street &AMP;
Smith's SportsBusiness Journal in April. ``But there needs to be
more demand out there, and more competition between broadcasters
for an event or two. We're probably on step two of a seven step
process that might take us three to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   But television executives agree that the LPGA in an increasingly
attractive property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players like Sorenstam, Se Ri Pak and Karrie Webb are just
like Tiger Woods and David Duval on the men's side,'' said one
network sports executive. ``They are perhaps more talented than
anyone who has ever played the game. All of a sudden, there is a
group of young, women players to get excited about, and that is
what television really likes about sports, the storyline.''
</P>
<P>
   Little seems to be standing in the way of continued success and
business expansion for the LPGA, but Votaw and others must begin
grappling with two significant issues almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Today, LPGA tour players are scheduled to wind up one of their
``major'' championships, the 14-year-old du Maurier Classic, in
Piddis, Alberta, just outside of Calgary. Next year may be the last
du Maurier, something akin to the men losing the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Because of legislation pending in Ottawa that would seriously
curtail advertising by tobacco companies, du Maurier executives
said they would lose any marketing benefit from the $500,000 it
annual commits to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a senior tour, the Women's Senior Golf Tour, hopes to
play four events in 2000, eight in 2001 and eventually 20 events,
rivaling the LPGA for corporate supporters and, perhaps more
importantly, top players over the age of 40, golfers like Nancy
Lopez who occasionally compete for championships and almost alway
attract heavy attention from galleries and television.
</P>
<P>
   Votaw has said he hopes to strike an agreement with the
organizers of the senior tour, including the women's golf immortal
Jane Blalock, that would permit the older LPGA players to compete
in both tours.

POPE DEFINES HELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While hell may not be the fiery chamber depicted in popular art,
Pope John Paul II said last week hell is a reality and eternal
damnation is self-imposed and not a punishment from God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell is not a punishment imposed externally by God, but the
condition resulting from attitudes and actions which people adopt
in this life,'' John Paul says.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven, the pontiff said in an earlier lecture, is ``neither an
abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living and
personal relationship of union with the Holy Trinity.''
</P>
<P>
   While many historical paintings picture hell as a physical place
where sinners cast into flames are writhing in pain, the Roman
Catholic Church's teaching on hell is quite different _ although
still equally painful for believing Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy editorial that was approved by the Vatican, the
authoritative Jesuit journal Civilta Cattolica addressed the
theological concept of hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell exists, not as a place but as a state, a way of being of
the person who suffers the pain of the deprivation of God,'' the
editorial stated.
</P>
<P>
   The pope told the 8,500 pilgrims attending his audience much the
same thing. ``More than a physical place,'' the pontiff said,
``hell is the state of those who freely and definitively separate
themselves from God, the source of all life and joy. So eternal
damnation is not God's work but actually our doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Demons, he added, ``are creatures who have already given a
definitive `no' to God. These are the spirits who rebelled against
God. They serve as a warning for human beings: Eternal damnation
remains a real possibility for us too.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the pope said, the existence of hell should have a
positive effect, encouraging the faithful to obey God's will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of hell should not be a cause of anxiety or
despair for believers,'' he said. ``Rather, it is a necessary and
healthy reminder that human freedom has to be conformed to the
example of Jesus, who always said `yes' to God, who conquered
Satan, and who gave us his spirit so that we, too, could call God
`Father.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After his talk, John Paul briefly greeted some Polish countrymen
who had come to Rome and offered an impromptu prayer that no one
might go to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us pray heartily that the will that refuses the saving
will of God does not happen in anyone anywhere,'' the pope said.
``Let us pray for the salvation of all men, for the eternal
salvation of everyone.''

   --During a visit to the United States Russian Prime Minister
Sergei Stepashin told US Jewish leaders he would crack down on
anti-Semitism in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime Minister Stepashin said very clearly that he and his
government are committed to provide security today to the
synagogues and Jewish institutions,'' Denis Braham, chairman of the
National Conference on Soviet Jewry, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes in the wake of an increased number of
anti-Semitic acts in Russia, including an attempted bombing last
Sunday of a Lubavitch synagogue in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Washington Stepashin also met with Vice
President Al Gore who expressed ``deep concern'' over anti-Semitism
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   --Two of this century's most respected and revered figures in
the Roman Catholic Church _ Mother Teresa and Pope John XXIII _ are
on the fast track to sainthood and could be pronounced saints early
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of John XXIII, the pontiff who oversaw the Second
Vatican Council, perhaps the most significant event in modern
church history, is so far advanced he could be beatified in
September 2000 as part of the Holy Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the second to last step before sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa's cause was opened last week in Calcutta, the city
where she founded the Sisters of Charity missionary order and rose
to become one of the world's most renowned champions of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Pope John Paul II waived the five-year
waiting period normally required for a candidate for sainthood.
Mother Teresa died two years ago at the age of 87.
</P>
<P>
   --Hate crimes against Hispanic houses of worship are rising,
according to a report issued last week by a leading Hispanic
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of La Raza report detailed cases of church
burnings as well as alleged abuses by police and violence against
Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``At issue is a simple question,'' said Raul Yzaguirre,
president of La Raza during the the group's annual meeting in
Houston. ``Do Hispanic Americans have the right to drive the
streets, attend places of worship and otherwise live their lives
free from hate, violence, harassment and law enforcement abuse? For
countless Latinos, this report suggests that these rights are very
much in question in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that 24 Hispanic houses of worship nationwide
are on a list of church arson sites being investigated.

<P>
   NY-NOMAD (New York) _ The fashionistas are on the move _ this
time to a neighborhood so anonymous it doesn't even have a name. On
the maps in city taxis that show Manhattan neighborhoods _ Chelsea,
Greenwich Village, Upper East Side _ this area is conspicuously
gray. Historical-minded people may refer to it as Rosehill, after
the 18-century farm belonging to John Watts, a Tory sympathizer,
that covered roughly the same acreage. George Trescher, the
fund-raiser, and a local resident, calls it Curry Hill, because of
the many Indian and Bangladesh restaurants. Others call it NoMad,
for north of Madison Square Park. By Elaine Louie.

   CLIMBING-ROSES (Undated) _ One day in early June, I was
thunderstruck by the big pink roses climbing up a pergola in a Long
Island garden that's like a second home to me. The luminous, satiny
double blossoms hung like lush petticoats from the crossbar over my
head, and I gaped up at them, chanting, ``I want that rose. I want
that rose.'' By Ann Raver.

<P>
   PAVILIONS (Undated) _ Architecture history is well endowed with
pavilions that deliver their occupants to panoramas of nature;
designers shaping garden rooms are often hypnotized by the prospect
of adding another chapter to this rich tradition. Unencumbered by
the functional demands of kitchens, closets and bedrooms, pavilions
can be designed without the usual constraints and without the
safety net of excuses. Designers do not toss them off lightly. By
Joseph Giovanini.

   HUGUENOT-HOUSES There was no Home Depot in the 17th century when
the French Huguenots settled along the fertile banks of the
Wallkill River in what is now New Paltz, N.Y. Only willpower,
combined with clay, sand and stone. From these materials, the
French Protestants built a street of stone houses with
deeply-furrowed rooflines and heavily-timbered ceilings. The quiet
treasure, called Huguenot Street, is tucked away from college-town
burger joints and other modern tumult _ ``a whole village of
virtually undisturbed pre-Revolutionary 18th-century dwellings,''
in the words of Morrison Heckscher, the curator of decorative arts
at the Metropolitan Museum. By Patricia Lee Brown.

WILL HISTORY BE KINDER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YORBA LINDA, Calif. _ John F. Kennedy, musing about history,
once wrote, ``We are still too close in time to those in our own
midst whose actions a more detached historical perspective may
stamp as worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after he resigned the presidency on Aug. 9,
1974, one focus of perspective is the Richard Nixon Library &AMP;
Birthplace, a handsome, low-rise building amid beautiful gardens in
nine acres of former citrus groves. The 37th president and his
wife, Pat, are buried here, next to the house his father built in
which Nixon was born in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of Nixon's ``enemies list,'' (which he probably did
not compile personally, but no doubt found readable), I toted a
tabula not-totally rasa, along with a willingness to listen. The
library's executive director, also the co-executor of Nixon's
estate, is John H. Taylor, an articulate, combative spokesman, a
fellow the Old Man, as Pat Buchanan called him, surely liked. The
flame-keeper is a flame-thrower, as his answer to my first question
suggests:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a person from Mars 100 years from now would find that
the central event of the Nixon period was Vietnam and that Richard
Nixon was, at the time and for a couple of generations after,
viewed through the prism of Vietnam. That generation of young
Americans coming of age in the '60s and '70s envisioned itself as
the most idealistic, least materialistic, most spiritual generation
in history. That generation went on to be no more or less spiritual
or idealistic than any other generation and in the economic boom of
the 1990s became the most grasping and consuming generation in
history. But it never lost its sense of generational self-idolatry.
In order to preserve its image of superiority against obvious
information to the contrary, it decided that it needed a scapegoat
in the strictly Levitical, Biblical sense, the scapegoat upon whom
the sins of a person or group are settled, a scapegoat sent out
into the wilderness to wander forever. My generation's scapegoat is
Richard Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in 1954. ``That's my generation; I understand
it,'' he says, so his own prism may be boomercentric. What of
others among the library's 145,000 annual visitors? ``We've had
about 500 weddings'' since 1990, says Evie Lazzarino, the library's
director of communications. ``And next year's prom season is almost
completely booked.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon defenders may be looking for love in all the wrong places.
He was the last liberal president, the last to expand government.
``He was not a Republican who was at war with the federal
government,'' Taylor says. Yet one of the smaller galleries here is
``domestic policy'' and one of the 200 docents wonders why.
``There's so much here,'' she says. ``Ending the draft,
revenue-sharing, and the first Earth Week proclamation.'' (Not Al
Gore's idea?) Adjacent is the Watergate pavilion, a long, dark
space that is the largest gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Nixon bias holds that Nixon's domestic deeds were, unlike
those of others, politically motivated. ``Motivation, as any
psychiatrist will tell us, is always difficult to assess,'' JFK
wrote in ``Profiles in Courage.'' Bob Wood, an urban adviser to
Kennedy and to Lyndon Johnson, once speculated that Nixon, the poor
grocer's son, was sincere. ``I'll give him that,'' he said. I'll
give him that, too, but the president who once urged Americans to
``lower our voices'' is drowned out by Watergate and Vietnam
static, even at his own library.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor predicts ``revisionist scholarship on the early
campaigns'' and forecasts ``important scholarship on Watergate, on
what the president knew and when he knew it, on what the president
did and when he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   No more stonewalling and the smoking gun? No more Tricky Dick
and the Pink Lady? Next stop, the Vatican and canonization. Total
redemption is an ambitious goal, but the Old Man, the last liberal
president, is somewhere nodding ferociously in approval.

WILLIAMSTOWN AGOG OVER GWYNETH PALTROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ ``The Village Beautiful,'' boasts a sign
at the top of Spring Street, the quaint main drag through
Williamstown. And it is indeed a lovely burg, all stately homes and
leafy backdrops. But it is also, for a few short weeks, The Village
Gwyneth.
</P>
<P>
   As in Gwyneth Paltrow _ she of the cool grace, the
Hitchcock-blonde perfection, the Oscar, the intellect, the
boyfriends (Brad &AMP; Ben), the mom (Blythe Danner). That Gwyneth.
</P>
<P>
   That Gwyneth has taken up residence in the Berkshires for a
month at the Williamstown Theatre Festival (WTF), where she'll
appear through Aug. 15 in the Barry Edelstein-helmed production of
Shakespeare's ``As You Like It.'' She's been in town since mid-July
and this small, sophisticated town is in a state of heightened
Gwyneth Alert.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite a hubbub, not at all a tumult, nowhere near a
mania. Williamstown is far too accustomed to celebrity visitors to
start flapping its arms over a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   But Paltrow is definitely on the brain: Her best-actress Oscar
for ``Shakespeare in Love'' is still a fresh memory, and her
family's long affiliation with the theater festival means that a
few of the folks bustling downtown remember little Gwyn on stage
with her mom in a 1981 production of ``The Greeks.'' She was 9
then, 26 now. Over the years she's appeared in four more plays, the
last being WTF's 1994 production of ``The Seagull.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People locally feel they own a little piece of her,'' said Sue
Mead, 48, an automotive writer and self-described outdoor
adventurer, as she filled out shipping forms at a Spring Street
package drop-off Monday afternoon. ``There's a huge amount of
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the feeling that, `Hey, she's back in the fold at
Williamstown, if only for five weeks,''' said Aimee Zygmonski,
marketing and publicity director for the WTF. Things may change on
opening night (Thursday), she said, but thus far the flash-popping
hordes of paparazzi have not descended. Representatives of the
press are here, and they're hovering, but the feared media
explosion has yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the town hums, however discreetly, with excitement. Rumors
jig about _ no, she isn't flanked by bodyguards; yes, she likes to
hang out at the Side Bar, on North Street, and Mezze, on Water
Street. Tales of Gwyneth sightings abound and smack of close
encounters with UFOs. (A Gwyneth spotting in a bar is a Close
Encounter of the First Kind; if she leaves cigarette butts, it's
Second. If you see her in a vehicle, it's Third. If she abducts you
without saying a word, it's Fourth. And if you actually speak with
her, it's Fifth.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This play is kind of the climax of the season because she's in
it, and that's clear, and everybody sort of feels that, I guess,''
said Alessandro Nivola, 27, who plays Orlando opposite Paltrow's
Rosalind in ``As You Like It.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's here as part of an ensemble, and that's how we know
her.'' Paltrow is, Nivola said, ``really sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nivola, a wiry blond actor best known as Nicolas Cage's brother
in the 1997 movie ``Face/Off,'' was hoofing up Spring Street with
Kate Moennig, an ensemble member of the production. It was Monday,
the cast's day off, and the pair were on their way back from
playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known (Paltrow) for a while, so it's kind of odd,'' said
Moennig, 21, characterizing the production as ``just people working
to get something up on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, everyone's just a person,'' she said. ``That's the way
it goes.'' Still, Paltrow's a big deal in Williamstown _ if only
because everyone's so tickled to have her home. ``Older people
would come in and say, `Oh, I remember Gwynnie when she was This
High,''' said Angela Cardinali, managing director of Williamstown's
Images Cinema, which will screen ``Shakespeare in Love'' Aug. 6-12.
(Paltrow's Oscar for best actress was one of seven the film won.)
</P>
<P>
   Cardinali hasn't had a Gwyneth encounter, but her business
partner has _ at the Side Bar, where Paltrow was seen playing chess
with David Schwimmer. ``Well,'' she corrected, ``she was sitting at
the table with a chess game, with David Schwimmer. I don't know if
they actually played.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwimmer was in town last month, for ``Glimmer Brothers,'' and
caused a bit of a stir on his own. The lugubrious Ross of
``Friends'' was often spotted prowling the haunts of Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was in an uproar when David Schwimmer was here,''
said Dan Bryant, 33, a furniture salesman, poised to buy kettle
chips at the Berkshire Hills Market on Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Ethan Hawke!'' chirped the cashier, 17-year-old Lis
Salerno, her blue eyes betraying the thrill of meeting the Gen-X
actor during his stay for the WTF production of ``Camino Reale.''
</P>
<P>
   She clicked her tongue, twice: chkk-chkk. ``He winked at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Salerno, as it happens, is Ground Zero for Gwyneth Sightings.
Turns out Paltrow has been known to drop by for a turkey sandwich
(or a fruit salad, or sesame noodles) now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very nice. She's friendly. She's polite. She's like a
normal, polite woman,'' Salerno said, gracious but adamantly ho-hum
with a reporter's fussy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, she explained, leave Paltrow alone: They might see
her, they might recognize her, but no one chugs down the street
asking for autographs. They simply bask in her klieg-light
Hollywood glow.
</P>
<P>
   Salerno admires her fashion sense. ``I love her clothes.
They're, like, unique.'' Pressed for details, she got specific:
``Usually, like those pants that are three-quarters high'' _ capri
pants _ ``and cute little skirts and little tank-top-type shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Bryant chatted a bit more about celebrities, and
Williamstown, and the quiet thrill of crossing paths with a star.
Then Salerno cast her glance out the window and said,
matter-of-factness intact, ``There's Gwyneth Paltrow now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gwyneth? That Gwyneth? Sure enough. A quick swivel toward
the window confirmed it: Paltrow, clad in capri pants and a short
black tank, pedaling down Spring Street on a mountain bike. On cue,
as ever.

AMERICAN ROULETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone would agree that Russian roulette is a stupid game of
machismo, sticking a single bullet into an empty chamber, whirling
the chamber round and round until you do not know where the bullet
is, sticking the gun to one's temple and pressing the trigger to
see if it is your lucky, or very unlucky, day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is precisely the game the United States plays with
guns. No other developed nation lets so many guns circulate that
there is one for nearly every adult and child. The percentage of US
households with at least one gun _ 35 percent _ is over three times
the average of other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The result of American roulette is the perfunctory murder,
routine executions with no major political reaction. We do not know
on any given day who will pick up a gun. One day it is a ghetto boy
with no hope. The next month it is a suburban boy who has lost
hope. The next day it is a possessive husband.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, it is a possessed, fired postal worker. The next
week it is a peeved lottery worker. Last week it was Mark Barton, a
high-risk stock trader in Atlanta who blew a small fortune and blew
away nine people in two office buildings _ after bludgeoning his
wife and two children to death.
</P>
<P>
   Americans watch the funerals on TV, acknowledging the victims
with passing notes of sadness, but ultimately burying the context
of their killings with them.
</P>
<P>
   We spend immense time reporting on the insanity of the killers,
detailing their deprivations, depressions, and destructive urges as
if to convince ourselves that nothing could stop this horror.
Therefore we do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The ``nothing'' is the gun control debate. Three and a half
months after the series of school shootings that culminated in the
massacre this spring at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
the US House of Representatives and the Senate remain far apart on
minor gun restrictions. The carnage in Atlanta barely elicited a
blip of outrage from a Capitol Hill kept in line by the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The United States does not necessarily have higher rates of
robbery or assault than other industrialized nations. We do not
necessarily have any more stressed out, enraged, or depraved people
than other industrialized nations. But since we have far more
firearms per person than other industrialized nations, we have far
more victims to show for our stress and rage.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths in the United States caused by firearms has
at least gone down, from 39,595 in 1993 to 32,436 in 1997. But
compared with the rest of the developed world, that is like trying
to detect from sea level whether snow has melted on Mount Everest.
The death rate from firearms in the United States is twice that of
France, three times that of Norway and Canada, four times that of
New Zealand and Australia, six times that of Denmark and Sweden,
nine times that of Germany, 13 times that of Spain, 22 times that
of Scotland, 27 times that of the Netherlands, 34 times that of
England and Wales, and 195 times that of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics, from the Centers for Disease Control and the
United Nations, are charitable to the United States, since it
combines homicide with suicide. The death rate from homicide in the
United States is 12 times that of Canada, 15 times that of France,
Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand, 19 times that of
Sweden, 20 times that of Norway and Denmark, 29 times that of
Germany, 32 times that of Spain, 59 times that of the United
Kingdom and 200 times that of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Children are killed in American roulette at a rate that would be
unacceptable in any other nation in the industrialized world.
According to the CDC, the death rate by firearms among children
under 15 years old was 12 times higher than the average in 25 other
developed nations. The firearm homicide rate was 16 times higher.
In the 26 industrialized nations studied by the CDC, three out of
every four children who died from guns were in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What America is waiting for is anyone's guess. Perhaps we need a
massacre of 50 children at a school to wake us up, or a slaying of
60 people at a post office.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the focus on the depravity of Mark Barton and the
sick letter he left behind, one salient fact seems to have failed
to reignite public debate. While one can, as Barton did,
singlehandedly bludgeon his wife and two small children, one cannot
stroll into a school or office with merely a sledgehammer or a
knife and kill or wound a dozen or more people without resistance
in a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Until America considers that fact, the roulette goes on. We
circulate more guns. We have more bullets in the chambers. We do
not know who will pick up a gun and put it to someone's temple.
This is not a game show, but we have not tired sufficiently of the
game _ or of being the game.

PARENTS PERPLEXED BY PHYSICIANS' SUGGESTED BAN ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the diaper crowd, ``Blue's Clues,'' ``Teletubbies,''
``Barney,'' ``Maisy Mouse,'' and ``Sesame Street'' are as big a
part of the day as board books and mashed carrots.
</P>
<P>
   These hit television shows delight toddlers with their
repetition, meandering pace, and focus on the wonders of everyday
things like colors, counting, and baby animals.
</P>
<P>
   So say parents like Stephanie Davidoff, a psychiatrist who
enjoys seeing her 2 1/2-year-old son light up when the shows come
on each morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son started watching around 18 months old,'' Davidoff said,
referring to television and videos. ``It was a kind of sheer
enjoyment. I personally don't see the harm in judicious amounts of
educational television or television for enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   But, much to the surprise of many parents and television
producers, the nation's most respected pediatric group this week
told parents of babies and toddlers to turn it all off, whether
it's Big Bird or ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to get across to parents is there are activities
that stimulate growth of the healthy brain more than watching
television,'' said Dr. Miriam Bar-on, associate professor of
pediatrics at Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-on helped write the position paper for the American Academy
of Pediatrics that poured cold water on television for the very
young.
</P>
<P>
   Brain development is at a crucial stage during a child's first
two years, the paper maintains, and they would benefit more from
constant human contact than flickering TV images.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child playing with a toy is stimulating her brain more than
a child sitting in front of the television set,'' Bar-on added.
``She is making conscious decisions about what she is doing, while
not much decision-making is going on while watching television.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55,000-member academy's paper, released during its annual
meeting in Chicago this week, also urged parents to create a
``media-free zone'' for children of all ages by taking TVs,
computers, and video games out of the children's bedrooms and by
not using TV to help children fall asleep or keep busy.
</P>
<P>
   Children watch an average of 21 hours of television a week, not
including video movies and games, according to the academy. Bar-on
said she is not aware of similar research on television and video
watching by children under age 2.
</P>
<P>
   For working parents, many of them frenzied as they juggle
morning coffee, showers, and telephone calls, this latest warning
seems like yet another swipe at a simple, dependable solution to
carve out a few precious minutes before work or while making
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the morning, I work at home and make phone
calls,'' said Terri Garceau, an insurance saleswoman who has a 4-,
6-, and 7-year-old. ``I admit I park them for an hour or two in
front of the TV while I am working. We used to sit and have
breakfast and talk. But we don't do that anymore and they are
missing out. Sometimes they snack on cereal in front of the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Garceau is far from alone when it comes to depending on the tube
for electronic baby-sitting. Mothers are in the workplace at a high
rate _ more than three out of five mothers with children under 3
and nearly four out of five mothers with children ages 6 to 17,
according 1998 data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   For other parents, the academy's recommendations for the
youngest viewers seemed overly dramatic because they could not
fathom how a few television shows could hurt a child who is loved,
talked to, and read to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any parent who would just stick their kid in
front of the TV for hours,'' said Michael Henry, a father of two,
ages 5 and 8. ``There is always other interactions besides
``Barney'' and ``Sesame Street.'' We've been conscientious about
what they watch since they were little, so I really can't
understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public television and networks that produce the
country's most respected children's programs said Tuesday they
agreed with the academy's conclusions, but also stressed that
children's television viewing habits should be a matter of parental
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television can be a powerful learning tool and WGBH/public
television offers a range of age-appropriate, high-quality
programs,'' said Angela Lifsey, a spokeswoman for WBGH-TV in
Boston, which airs ``Barney,'' ``Arthur,'' and ``Zoom,'' as well as
``Teletubbies,'' the only program that is targeted to the under-2
crowd. ``It is ultimately up to parents to decide what's best for
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   At Nickelodeon's Nick Jr., the network's block of preschool
programming _ home to the highly successful ``Blue's Clues'' and
``Maisy Mouse'' _ senior vice president Brown Johnson said: ``Any
opportunity for a doctor or figure of authority to say it is good
to blow bubbles and play kissy-face with your baby is great. But I
do really believe that TV is a part of our lives and parents are
really busy. They (the academy) may feel they have to put this
message at this fever pitch to get through to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Children's Television Workshop, which
produces ``Sesame Street,'' declined comment Tuesday, saying the
workshop's programs and research are geared to children ages 2 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the quality of some TV shows, the academy said even the
ones geared to the youngest viewers should be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although certain programs may be promoted to this age group,
research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers
have a critical need for direct interaction with parents and other
significant caregivers for healthy brain development,'' the
academy's report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents said they were scratching their heads over the
academy's findings because their toddlers do not have the attention
span to sit rapt in front of the TV for more than a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Emmons's daughter Jessica just turned 2 and the mother
said she is anxious to include good programs in her daughter's
educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to introduce it to her because everybody talks so
highly about these learning shows, and what they can teach
children,'' Emmons said. ``Her interest level is not there yet. She
likes the catchy songs, but watches for five or 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Patricia Barber, the mother of 5-year-old Clayton and
2-year-old Lily: ``With little ones, it doesn't work as
baby-sitter. They move from one thing to another. Lily might catch
a glimpse of it, but it is background noise for her at this age. I
don't worry too much.''

EMBATTLED GADFLY KEEPS COURTS ON THE DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif., N.Y., Conn.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFIELD, N.H. _ There are certain hazards in the life of a
gadfly. In the abandoned bed and breakfast where Theodore
Kamasinski has based his assault on New Hampshire's legal system,
most of the furniture has been seized by the state, with the
exception of seven dining-room chairs, which stand arranged in a
perfect rectangle around nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on one of those chairs on a recent morning, Kamasinski
vowed to fight the seizure the way he has fought scores of court
decisions for 20 years as a self-described ``legal reform
activist'' _ with a blizzard of scrupulous legal research and a
nearly religious persistence. In the meantime, he's lucky for what
the sheriffs left him; it's hard to make a revolution when you're
sitting on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski, 61, has a fading accent from his native Queens. He's
got no law degree, two discarded last names, and a trail of legal
entanglements that have resulted in jail time in three countries,
although he says his only conviction _ for passing a bad check in
1967 _ was later wiped out. But in the New England states where he
has lived over the past decade, he has also figured as a real
player in the legal system, and a threat to the judges and lawyers
whom he accuses of dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, where Kamasinski's misconduct complaints and
civil actions have been focused for the last three years, he's
radioactive even as a topic of conversation: His friends see him as
a noble reformer challenging judicial cronyism. His enemies see him
as a freelance courtroom bully, flooding overworked courts with
paper while he acts out an old grudge against the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups agree that it is foolish to shrug him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't laugh at him in the courtroom,'' said Richard
Hesse, who teaches constitutional law at Franklin Pierce Law Center
in Concord, N.H. ``He's been right often enough, and he's prevailed
often enough that anyone who's dealt with him couldn't laugh him
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski never meant to end up in New Hampshire _ he was
compelled to stay there in 1996 while under indictment for wire
fraud, a charge that was later dismissed _ but he found himself in
a state that has always given non-lawyers unusual access to the
courts. New Hampshire is one of the few states that upholds the
right of non-lawyers to do legal work for clients. Intentionally or
not, Kamasinski follows in a tradition of colorful citizen-lawyers
who have applied New Hampshire's populism to the sequestered
profession of the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Kamasinski may be stretching it to the breaking point. This
spring, the New Hampshire attorney general's office charged
Kamasinski _ who earns income performing legal research and writing
legal briefs _ with the unauthorized practice of law, arguing that
he didn't have the requisite ``good character'' to act as someone's
attorney. The attorney general's case was thrown out by the state
Supreme Court in March, a significant victory for Kamasinski. But
it shows the growing animus in the legal community he has charged
himself with policing.
</P>
<P>
   When Kamasinski tells the story of how he made it his mission to
bust judges, he returns to his days in New York City, when his name
was still Theodore Ratnoff. Under that name, which he legally
changed in 1979, Kamasinski was involved in the 1969-71 Knapp
Commission investigation of police corruption, which was
immortalized in the book and movie about whistle-blower Frank
Serpico. As Teddy Ratnoff, Kamasinski helped lead the Knapp
investigators to their star witness, a crooked cop named William
Phillips, via the notorious East Side madam Xaviera Hollander,
immortalized as the ``Happy Hooker.''
</P>
<P>
   He dates his distrust of judges further back, to a humiliating
day when a New York judge named Mitchell Schweitzer ruled against
his father in a case over a $2,000 bounced check. Then, says
Kamasinski, he took it upon himself to investigate Schweitzer by
systematically looking for patterns in his decisions that might
reveal outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing Schweitzer for many years,'' he said. ``It's
amazing, the energy you had in those days. I would stay there until
3 or 4 in the morning. I thought it was better than hanging out
with girls. The law became fascinating to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski's detractors _ many of whom have longstanding
disputes with him _ say he is no angel himself, pointing to a
series of lawsuits and charges against Kamasinski over the years.
One of them is Michael Armstrong, chief counsel for the Knapp
Commission, who confirmed that Kamasinski had taken part in his
investigations but said ``you couldn't believe anything he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski counters that Armstrong was happy to rely on him in
the investigation. He maintains Armstrong should never have used
Phillips as a witness because he was a confessed murderer, and says
that is at the root of their old dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Douglas III, a Concord, N.H., lawyer and former state
Supreme Court justice who has been a frequent target of
Kamasinski's misconduct charges, said allegations involving
Kamasinski date to 1972, when Kamasinski was accused of stealing
surveillance equipment from the Knapp Commission. A warrant for
Kamasinski's arrest on those charges still exists in the state of
New York, although Dan Gildea, a federal probation officer in New
Hampshire, said New York law enforcement had shown no interest in
extraditing Kamasinski, and that if he returned to New York the
matter would probably be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   A California lawyer sued Kamasinski in 1985 for $5,000 on behalf
of an automobile dealer who said that Kamasinski failed to deliver
a car he had promised. Steven Angus, of Cardiff-by-the-Sea, said
his client, Frank Fahey, finally dropped the suit against
Kamasinski because of the time and expense of litigating for such a
small amount. Richard Peck, of Mystic, Conn., has a similar story:
He said he installed heat pumps worth about $7,000 for Kamasinski
in the mid-1980s and was never paid, but eventually gave up a
lawsuit against Kamasinski because attorneys could not locate him.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony D'Amato, a professor at Northwestern University Law
School in Chicago, got to know Kamasinski while assisting him in
nullifying a 1981 fraud conviction in Austria. He said that about
10 years ago, he had asked the New Hampshire attorney general to
investigate an allegedly bogus investment for which he gave
Kamasinski $26,000. Kamasinski was indicted on that charge but the
case was later thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski, asked about the accusations, denied any wrongdoing,
and stressed that each case came to nothing. He said he did not
recall Richard Peck, but that he appeared regularly in newspapers
in Connecticut throughout that period, and could have been tracked
down. He said Frank Fahey owed him the money for the imported car
because of a change in the exchange rate, and that he dropped his
lawsuit. And he said the D'Amato fraud case was thrown out because
the government dismissed the charge as meritless.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent accusation has left Kamasinski in a house mostly
empty of furniture. Charles Douglas is representing Roland
Williams, who says he had to file for bankruptcy because Kamasinski
has not paid $6,000 rent on the bed and breakfast he rented from
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Kamasinski said he is arranging to buy the property from its
current owner, the Federal National Mortgage Association. Although
Williams prevailed in the lower court, Kamasinski has successfully
petitioned the state Supreme Court to supervise the case on the
grounds that the seizure of furniture had been made unlawfully, he
said. The higher court has ordered that the furniture be turned
over to the county sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   But even as his own legal troubles persisted, Kamasinski's legal
reform efforts have met with success. In Connecticut, for instance,
Kamasinski in 1991 successfully challenged the idea that formal
complaints against judges should be kept from the public, and the
assistant attorney general who faced off against Kamasinski told
the Connecticut Law Tribune that he had been ``a pleasure to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kamasinski has filed class action suits pressing for
a more open disciplinary process for judges and lawyers in New
Hampshire and petitioning the Supreme Court for the same access to
court records that reporters enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Kamasinski's work tipped the balance for an
important First Amendment case, said Rodney Smolla, a professor at
T. C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond, who
pushed through a similar reform in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give him all of the credit. He had the energy, he had
the _ I don't know _ anger,'' said Smolla. ``Characters like him
have their pluses and minuses, and one of the pluses is that they
can act as a catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   His other initiative is complaints against lawyers and judges
whom he suspects of bad judgment, cronyism, or bad character _
including state Supreme Court Chief Justice David Brock, who
Kamasinski has accused of attempting to illegally influence other
lawmakers. Late in May, Kamasinski filed a complaint with the
state's Professional Conduct Committee against Jack Middleton, a
prominent lawyer who he says lied in court. Here's how serious
Kamasinski is: At a personal cost of $3,000, he made 530 CD
recordings of Middleton's court appearance and sent them to members
of the American Bar Association's House of Delegates. Middleton is
a secretary-elect of the ABA.

   That kind of dogged pursuit makes other critics of the legal
system deeply respectful. It also makes lawyers nervous, says Keene
attorney Arnold Falk. ``I wouldn't want to be on the other end of
one of those searches. It's like a government audit,'' he said. But
he added, ``there are things he says that must be attended to.''
</P>
<P>
   That threat is precisely what makes Kamasinski a good influence,
said the Franklin Pierce Law Center's Richard Hesse, a friend and
admirer who says most lawyers in the state ``overlook missteps by
judges.'' For one thing, Kamasinski keeps winning. And what he has
achieved, Hesse says, is less a permanent transformation than a
constant, low-grade reminder that even judges are being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Theo is doing so far is in the nature of the price of
liberty being eternal vigilance. As a player, he is holding the
system's feet to the fire,'' said Hesse. And as soon as he's gone,
his influence will disappear. ``When Theo leaves a state, he takes
his courage with him,'' he said.

<P>
   Like the Mafia, Tricky Dick Nixon has come full circle, being
downgraded in the national mythology from '70s power icon to pop
culture joke. It may be argued that any political group with enough
of a death wish to willingly affix to itself the acronym CREEP, as
the Republicans did to designate its Committee to Re-Elect the
President, is the real gang that couldn't shoot straight. Lobbed
this softball by history, Andrew Fleming's wickedly clever ``Dick''
laughs all the way to that famous DC underground parking garage
with Woodward and Bernstein and Deep Throat. ``Dick'' gleefully
slams the final nail into the Watergate coffin by filtering the
story through the eyes of two ditzy teenage girls who, the film
fantasizes, not only were there, but influenced what happened.
</P>
<P>
   `Dick'' invents a back story to the Watergate debacle, putting
at its center two pals, Kirsten Dunst's Betsy and Michelle
Williams's Arlene. When Arlene sneaks out of her mother's Watergate
apartment with Betsy to mail an entry in a
win-a-date-with-Bobby-Sherman contest, they spot G. Gordon Liddy
and his commandos, thinking little of it at the time. But during a
White House school tour a few days later, they not only spot him
again and pick up a CREEP hit list that had been sticking to his
shoe and fell off, but stumble into a White House paper-shredding
and money-packaging room. When Harry Shearer's Liddy starts having
them interrogated, they meet Nixon himself, who decides to
neutralize them by co-opting them. On the spot, he deputizes them
as special White House youth advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Their duties include walking Checkers each day, which gives them
access to the inner sanctum. Williams is funny as the clueless
Arlene, who in no time develops a crush on Nixon, rips crooner
Sherman's pictures off her bedroom wall, and imagines the leader of
the free world on horseback, impetuously galloping toward her on a
beach. Soon, the girls provide the answer to exactly what was on
the missing 18 1/2 minutes of Rosemary Woods's tapes. They even
bake Nixon a batch of psychedelic brownies, which he shares with
Leonid Brezhnev, unknowingly striking a blow for world peace. The
bubble bursts when they discover that Nixon not only has a
foulmouthed and venomous side, but actually hates Checkers because
the dog doesn't like him.
</P>
<P>
   The actresses excel at filling the screen with teeny-bopper
squeals and sighs, but the film rests on the tensed shoulders of
Dan Hedaya's Nixon. So well known are the Nixon mannerisms and so
thoroughly and definitively has Nixon caricatured himself that the
role can be a trap. But Hedaya plays it brilliantly, broadening the
contours of the part only just as much as comedy playing dictates,
but no more. In fact, he's only a notch or two above naturalistic,
reminding us how uncomfortable Nixon always seemed in his own skin,
how awkward his gestures, how unable to see how his malevolence
inevitably boomeranged on him. His hunted stare wanders out to the
edges of his field of vision, giving life to his paranoia. Yet he
remains a creature of tunnel vision. Hedaya is sublime as he
reminds us that the funniest figures are those who regard
themselves with deadly seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   The president's men are deftly caricatured, too, especially Saul
Rubinek's Kissinger. And it will be hard for any other actor to
play Nixon for a while, given Hedaya's wonderfully calibrated
performance. Yet the proof of the film's comic astuteness is that
it doesn't restrict its satiric barbs to the forces of CREEP, but
buries them deepest in the self-inflated hides of Will Ferrell's
Woodward and Bruce McCulloch's Bernstein. Each is drawn as a
hilariously narcissistic dork in his own way, fiercely jealous of
and competitive toward the other. McCulloch's pushy little
pompadoured Napoleon and Ferrell's twitchy careerist are the icing
on the cake. Those who remember the Watergate follies, and perhaps
even some who don't, will get a kick out of ``Dick.''

WEALTH OF DETAILS OBSCURES IN `WOLVES` 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
WHEN WE WERE WOLVES 
By Jon Billman 
Random House, 239 pp., $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Billman, author of this impressive collection of short
stories, is an enormously talented writer, and his talent adorns
every story and almost every line. And yet there is something odd
about his writing, something bothersome, that came clearer when
half the book was read.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are all set in the West, several of them in a
Wyoming hamlet called Hams Fork. They are all told by a
first-person narrator, and though the narrator varies, his voice
does not. He is tough, flinty, mostly free of illusion about human
nature, including his own. He has a certain half-despairing wit in
his outlook that sounds like an effort to transcend that which is
unstable and eccentric but basically unfixable.
</P>
<P>
   In the first story, ``Indians,'' set during the Dust Bowl years
of the Great Depression, a South Dakota-based Indian baseball team
called the Mud Butte Indians drives around the West, playing
small-town teams. It is a polyglot team, including prominently a
one-armed pitcher named Job Looks Twice. The team gets paid only
when it wins. The narrator, a white missionary's son and one of the
players (apparently recalling these events from the present),
passes the rumor that if the Indian team is beaten, rain will
follow, which gets the team games but also sometimes makes the
locals angry enough not to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In the climactic scene, the team plays a team of Bible thumpers
in a town called Faith. The Indians are leading, and a rainstorm
may be brewing. Job has begun to believe the rain-making business
himself, takes pity on the townspeople, and decides to throw the
game. The story ends with a twist, but the narrator doesn't seem to
make much of it. One is left with a ``So? Is that all?'' feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, with a similar line, a prison hockey team in
the late 1940s goes around the upper Rocky Mountain region under
the supervision of the prison chaplain, playing small-town teams.
The players and the situations are richly and colorfully described,
and Billman has a gift for setting up scenes _ but again, the big
finish is tepid. It's much like a true story, rather than fiction,
in which a yarn may be engaging in the telling but not necessarily
add up to much. In that sense these realistic stories are too
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Billman has a strong eye for detail, and it seems that the
often-comic details themselves, and the carefully wrought sentences
in which they are revealed, are so fine and profusely journalistic
that one almost has a hard time following the narrative. At times,
I had to go back to pick up the thread: Where are we now? What
exactly is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   One suspects there isn't as much as there should be underneath
the details. In a rodeo scene in ``Atomic Bar,'' for example: ``No
clowns, no barrel racing, no country-and-Western singers. Not even
bleachers. Just bronc riding and spirits. Cowboys and ranchers
leaned against the fencerail as riders drew their broncs out of a
hat and climbed into the chute to straddle angry horses with names
like Inferno, Bearclaw,'' and here follows a list of 37 horse
names. Billman might have omitted about 35 of these names and given
us more of what is lacking: persuasive, fully developed characters,
believable conversation between people, some kind of emotional
field that would support all the color.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ash,'' the narrator is a Plains firefighter in Wyoming,
interested in a woman, part of the firefighting team, named Ashley
Elkind. She is dreamy and plain and not much interested in the
narrator:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ash hated fire duty. It wasn't her job unless she was
available. She called Ponderosa pine `weeds.' But though she
groused about it, Cappy made her keep her fire pack with her hard
hat and fire-resistant Nomex shirt and pants in her truck. He had
her keep her hand-held radio on her belt. If she was close enough
to a smoke or if we were down on men, she would have to go. She was
certified as a crew boss, certified to be in charge of twenty men,
but putting out fire was beneath her. Or she was above it in that
the suppression of fires has caused an ecological illness that will
take decades of controlled burns to cure.'' This is accomplished
writing, but we learn more about the setting of the story, the
fires, and fire-fighting than we do about Ash, and since she says
but little and the narrator understands her hardly at all, we never
quite figure out what makes her tick, who she is and what she
wants. That seems to be true of many of the characters in these
stories: They are too much made of observed details, like the
fire-resistant Nomex shirt.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: These are vivid, readable stories by an
extremely talented writer. The book jacket reports that Jon Billman
is at work on a novel. If he lets his characters live and breathe
and have interior lives, and lets the cinematic detail follow
rather than lead, it should be a book worth waiting for.

GEN X AT CROSSROADS; LITTLETON REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be hard to sympathize with Generation Xers, particularly
those amassing wealth from wildly successful Internet ventures, but
after reading Xer Tim Halstead in this month's Atlantic Monthly, I
actually came close to empathizing with this (I want it now!)
generation. And I understand better why Xers are the most
politically apathetic generation to come down the pike this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Halstead (who seems to be an exception to this rule) argues that
many Xers are so fed up with the lack of political leadership on
issues they care about _ like their fiscal woes (did you know that
Xers as a group may be the first generation to earn less than their
parents?) and the disturbing environmental legacy we're leaving
them _ that they have ``tuned out'' of the political arena, for the
time being at least. After detailing the challenges his generation
face, Halstead issues an impassioned call to arms: ``Today's young
adults will be remembered either as the late-blooming generation
that ultimately helped to revive American democracy...or as another
silent generation that stood by as our democracy and society
suffered a slow decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question remains: as Xers canyon down swollen rivers in
pursuit of extreme thrills and make the Internet their own private
playground, are any of them out there listening?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While few of the Atlantic's offerings this month could be
considered light summer reading, the magazine does provide a number
of meaty and surprisingly tasty morsels. Max Singer (of the
conservative Hudson Institute) weighs in on the issue of population
growth and manages to make what sounds like good news -- in 50
years, the world's population may take a nosedive -- into something
quite ominous. His basic argument, that as more and more countries
become modernized, the fertility of their women will drop, makes
sense, but Singer never bothers to explain why, on a planet with
such strained resources and rapidly shrinking biodiversity, he
should be so concerned about this eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   Claude M. Steele's essay on why black college students
underperform academically is more satisfying. After studying the
issue for years, Steele, a sociologist at Stanford and twin brother
of conservative essayist Shelby Steele, has come up with a
commonsensical answer that skirts the handwringing of the left and
the racial genetics of the right: middle-class black students don't
perform as well as their white counterparts on academic measures
because their constant fear of being stereotyped as underperformers
wears them down to the point where they try too hard on
standardized tests or stop caring enough to succeed. Steele argues
that men and women of all races don't do well in situations in
which they expect others to have negative stereotypes about them,
even when they know the stereotypes do not apply. And he backs up
his argument with some proof: When in the course of an experiment
he and colleagues told white male students who were strong in math
that a difficult math test they were about to take was one that
Asians generally did better on, those students did worse on the
test than similarly ranked white male students who were not told
that. To his credit, Steele does not leave readers shaking their
heads at this all-too human reaction to ``stereotype threat;'' he
offers some innovative solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>

   It's late in the summer, but a few magazines are still trying to
come up with explanations for the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado,
and it's amazing how different their theories are. In the
surprisingly readable current issue of Family Networker, which
bills itself as a magazine on psychotherapy and family life, social
worker Garry Cooper, a family therapist and contributing editor to
the magazine, says what a lot of folks have been thinking but don't
dare say: that ``disconnected parents'' have a lot to do with the
current spate of violence among suburban youth. Cooper argues that
some ``parents have left a big vacuum in their kids' lives, and the
vacuum has been filled with a second family of angry, disconnected
and confused peers who are often virtually raising themselves in a
toxic media culture of violence and materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! That sounds mighty persuasive, but if you read this
month's Ms magazine, you'll get an entirely different take from
Gloria Steinem. She states an unarguable fact _ that ``white males,
usually intelligent, middle class and heterosexual or trying
desperately to appear so, account for virtually all the serial,
sexually motivated, sadistic killings'' _ and then goes on to argue
that that's because they are ``the group most likely to become
hooked on the drug of superiority.'' Dominating others is so
important to this group, Steinem opines, that ``a mere insult can
justify lethal revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steinem fails to mention is that nonwhite males can be just
as murderous over mere insults and that white guys may simply be
more likely to get away with murder, if only because they look and
act like the people charged with arresting them.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps both Steinem and Cooper's theories, as
oversimplified as they are, are part of the complicated mosaic that
gave us Littleton, and now, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a somewhat lighter note, Salon magazine, which is published
on the Internet at www.salonmagazine.com, delves into the debate
over whether ``girl talk'' on the Web is encouraging teenage
sexuality or helping young women deal with sexual pressures in a
positive way. Janelle Browning, of course, has a bias (clue: she
makes her living off the Web), but she does her homework, and the
best part of the piece (which can be found in Salon's Technology
section) is that it provides parents and other interested parties
instant access (with a click of the mouse) to the sites where their
chatting girls are most likely to be found.

Thursday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   NY-NOMAD (New York) _ The fashionistas are on the move _ this
time to a neighborhood so anonymous it doesn't even have a name. On
the maps in city taxis that show Manhattan neighborhoods _ Chelsea,
Greenwich Village, Upper East Side _ this area is conspicuously
gray. Historical-minded people may refer to it as Rosehill, after
the 18-century farm belonging to John Watts, a Tory sympathizer,
that covered roughly the same acreage. George Trescher, the
fund-raiser, and a local resident, calls it Curry Hill, because of
the many Indian and Bangladesh restaurants. Others call it NoMad,
for north of Madison Square Park. By Elaine Louie.

</P>
<P>
   CLIMBING-ROSES (Undated) _ One day in early June, I was
thunderstruck by the big pink roses climbing up a pergola in a Long
Island garden that's like a second home to me. The luminous, satiny
double blossoms hung like lush petticoats from the crossbar over my
head, and I gaped up at them, chanting, ``I want that rose. I want
that rose.'' By Ann Raver.

</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   PAVILIONS (Undated) _ Architecture history is well endowed with
pavilions that deliver their occupants to panoramas of nature;
designers shaping garden rooms are often hypnotized by the prospect
of adding another chapter to this rich tradition. Unencumbered by
the functional demands of kitchens, closets and bedrooms, pavilions
can be designed without the usual constraints and without the
safety net of excuses. Designers do not toss them off lightly. By
Joseph Giovanini.
</P>
<P>
   HUGUENOT-HOUSES There was no Home Depot in the 17th century when
the French Huguenots settled along the fertile banks of the
Wallkill River in what is now New Paltz, N.Y. Only willpower,
combined with clay, sand and stone. From these materials, the
French Protestants built a street of stone houses with
deeply-furrowed rooflines and heavily-timbered ceilings. The quiet
treasure, called Huguenot Street, is tucked away from college-town
burger joints and other modern tumult _ ``a whole village of
virtually undisturbed pre-Revolutionary 18th-century dwellings,''
in the words of Morrison Heckscher, the curator of decorative arts
at the Metropolitan Museum. By Patricia Lee Brown.

   CIR-TEEN-WHIZ-JOBS (Undated) _ All over the country,
computer-savvy students in high school or their first few years of
college are landing summer jobs that look a lot like professional,

consequence of the digitization of everything from money to mail.

Security number and maybe a phone number or two. But since the
introduction of the automated teller machine, people have
accumulated an arsenal of passwords, access codes and personal

REHABBING EDWARDS MUST WALK BEFORE HE RUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Six months ago, he was finishing up a fine
rookie season in fun fashion at Pro Bowl Week activities in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Then Patriots running back Robert Edwards went up to defend a
pass in a rookie four-on-four flag football game on the beach. When
he came down, his left knee and leg were mangled, his 1999 season
was wiped out, his football future was thrust into great doubt, and
the team's running back position went up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The last couple of days, Edwards has been attending his second
Patriots training camp, lending his support to Kevin Faulk and
others trying to replace him in the backfield, and showing everyone
how far he has come in his rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Edwards was a starter by the second game of the
season and went on to gain 1,115 yards as the replacement for
Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he was to leave camp and return home to Athens, Ga.,
to continue his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The knee, he said, is coming along well. The bigger problem is
the major nerve damage he suffered in the leg. He was operated on
first on Feb. 5 in Hawaii the day he was hurt, and then again on
Feb. 15 back in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve is getting better, Edwards said, but no one can tell
him when or if it will ever heal enough to allow him to continue
playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was just the knee, there wouldn't be any question about
me returning,'' Edwards said. ``The nerve is a big factor right
now. Until that comes back, it's going to be a little doubtful for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   How long it will take for the nerve to recover is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows,'' Edwards said. ``Everyone heals differently.
The nerve will come back when it wants to. Every month there's a
lot of improvement in that area. I have sensations in my foot and I
can move it in and out and down, but trying to control it to come
up has been a problem. But it's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is walking normally, and he is nearly there.
Edwards has graduated from working out in a pool and now works on
the bike and various leg machines. He is looking forward to the
time when he can run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when they are going to allow me to start doing
that,'' Edwards said. ``I would say sometime at the end of the
month or maybe the beginning of next month.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to be here for real next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm shooting for,'' Edwards said. ``If it doesn't
happen, I'm going to continue to work until it does. But that's the
goal, to be at this point next year and be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He came up this time, Edwards said, to check in with his
teammates and coaches. He likes what he's seen of Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' Edwards said. ``The coach is on him
a lot, and I try to tell him I was in the same position last year
and he's going to be on you to become the best player you can be to
help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Edwards has made an impression on his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see him,'' said linebacker Ted Johnson. ``It's
just great to see him walking. He's finally got some strength back
in his leg, the atrophy he had in his knee was so bad. It's good to
see him out here and working. He's still a part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which can be tough to realize, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time when I had my injury, I remember I was
driving back to practice and it was like, `They're still practicing
without me?' '' Johnson said. ``Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes, we're not very good at being injured. We think we're
indestructible. It's tough. We want to be in the mix. For him, it's
going to be a long haul. He's got to be strong and believe he can
get back. If he does it, it will be a huge comeback for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While coach Pete Carroll downplayed early reports on the knee
injury to Ben Coates, the team did make some moves to shore up the
tight end spot, for the short term at least. They brought in
6-foot-3-inch, 240-pound Brandon Condie, who had been with the
Kansas City Chiefs earlier this year after sitting out last year.
Condie, who was signed April 22 and cut July 17 by the Chiefs, is
also a long snapper. He participated in both sessions Tuesday.
Also, rookie Jamie Bowers out of Wabash has been moved from
fullback to tight end . . . Carroll said Harold Shaw is going to be
running mostly out of the fullback spot, which created a bit of a
logjam there. With Coates and Mike Bartrum (like Coates, sprained
knee) out for the time being, there was a need for bodies at tight
end . . . Coates was on crutches on the sidelines for both
sessions. ``He has a very mild sprain, a little swelling,'' Carroll
said. ``It's a day-to-day deal we're working with. It's not a
serious situation. It was a vicious play, the guy leg-whipped him.
We were very, very fortunate.'' . . . In the morning session, Faulk
took a big hit from Kadar Hamilton, a second-year safety out of
Stanford, and fumbled. Faulk was shaken up a bit but continued . .
. The local quarterbacks _ Northeastern's Jim Murphy and Boston
College's Scott Mutryn _ have their work cut out for them. Drew
Bledsoe and John Friesz are, of course, No. 1 and 2. And Carroll
talked Tuesday about how much, and what a different look, Michael
Bishop brings to the team as a No. 3.

   SOFTMONEY _ On June 30, with a single $1,000 check, California
businessman Alex Spanos did all that one man fiscally can to help
George W. Bush win the White House next year. That one check put
Spanos at the federal limit for political generosity to a
candidate. But thanks to a system critics say is fatally flawed,
Spanos did not hit the limit for political generosity. In March, as
the Bush campaign was hitting stride, Spanos sent $250,000 to the
Republican National Committee, which will use some of it next year
to help its presidential nominee. So far this year, Bush donors
have sent more than $2 million in unregulated ``soft money'' to the
RNC. Al Gore supporters have shipped more than $1 million to the
Democratic National Committee. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

CHEFS CAST A SKEPTICAL EYE ON ALTERED FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (rBST is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our food and exactly what's in it is shaping up to be the
burning issue of the next millennium. And chefs, the
come-from-behind superstars of the end of this one, are poised to
be our gurus.
</P>
<P>
   The storm clouds have been gathering for most of this decade,
ever since scientists devised a tomato with a longer shelf life,
called it Flavr Savr, and put it on the market. It flopped, but the
battle lines, as muddled as in real warfare, began to be drawn. On
one side, there is science and industry; on the other, the skeptics
who worry about bioengineered vegetables, grains, and even fish.
Now the United States and the European Union are locked in a fight
over altered foods that threatens to explode into an international
trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scientists for Monsanto and other big seed and food
companies are genetically engineering corn, soybeans, and other
products. Some milk producers inject cows with a growth hormone to
increase production. Genes from one species of fish are being
spliced with other species to counteract cold water and speed
production.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs, led by such young lions as Stan Frankenthaler, owner of
Salamander in Cambridge, Mass., are stepping up, scrutinizing the
rush, questioning the results. ``What I feed my customers, my
friends, my family is definitely important to me,'' says
Frankenthaler, who is the vice chairman of the national Chefs
Collaborative 2000. The collaborative, an initiative of Oldways
Preservation &AMP; Exchange Trust, seeks to promote sustainable cuisine
and to encourage eating local and seasonal products.
</P>
<P>
   To Frankenthaler and Rick Bayless, chef-owner of Frontera Grill
and Topolobampo in Chicago and the collaborative's chairman, it
makes perfect sense for restaurateurs to be as concerned with
what's in food as with how to be creative and make money from
serving it. ``We buy a lot of food,'' says Bayless, and biogenetic
engineering ``is definitely going to affect our food supply.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Chefs are becoming more articulate and more savvy. I
don't know all the scientific things, but I can choose whether or
not to serve my customers genetically altered food. Right now,
there are a lot of questions floating around that we don't have
answers for.''
</P>
<P>
   The past decade has seen an upsurge not only in fine dining but
in listing the sources of food. Even at fairly modest restaurants,
menus now are likely to tout the farms where the green beans were
raised, give the provenance of the beef, reveal the source of the
strawberries. Chefs have proudly proclaimed relationships with
small growers and farmers, many of them organic, and made it a
selling point of their food.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern about biogenetics is a natural outgrowth. ``I'm
bothered by the idea that I don't know the origins of ingredients
in my food,'' says Frankenthaler. By working with farmers in
season, knowing his suppliers, and using as many organic products
as he can, Frankenthaler feels he's fairly knowledgeable about
origins. But some ingredients, such as soy oil used in frying,
would cost three times as much as nonorganic, he says. ``Customers
are only willing to bear so much,'' he says, adding with a smile,
``It would be difficult to get customers to pay $38 for chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   He buys organic flour, eggs, and canned tomatoes, plus milk
produced without growth hormones. The milk issue crystallized his
views early in the '90s. ``I became more deeply aware, because of
the controversy around the bovine growth hormone, of the
seriousness of science being involved in the foodstream.'' Milk _
and whether it is affected by the hormone called rBST, used to
increase production _ has created stronger comment, Frankenthaler
thinks, because ``it struck home. Milk is nurturing; it's what you
give children. It's supposed to come straight from the cow''
without tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Both Frankenthaler and Bayless emphasize that the Chefs
Collaborative is not saying that genetic engineering is inherently
bad for the food supply. After all, as Frankenthaler says, farmers
have crossed seeds and manipulated agriculture for centuries, but
``within the laws of nature.'' Now scientists are able to do
amazing things, Bayless says, but some in the agricultural industry
and the federal Food and Drug Administration are taking the
position that the public should not be worried unless there's proof
of damage. Because corn and soybeans, so far the most likely crops
to have been genetically altered, are in many processed foods,
consumers aren't likely to know or be able to make decisions. On
the milk issue, in contrast, there was enough outcry that
supermarkets began refusing to stock milk containing rBST.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just put some brakes on all of this,'' says Bayless. His
question: ``Do we want the companies like Monsanto'' making these
decisions for us?
</P>
<P>
   ``We want labeling, so that people can make their own
decisions,'' he adds. And the recent case of monarch butterflies
dying after feeding on the pollen of genetically altered corn was a
wakeup call, he says, indicating that the seed companies hadn't
thought through all the possible results.
</P>
<P>
   The question of labeling is under review by the US Department of
Agriculture. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said he is
reconsidering the labeling issue after the outcry over bovine
growth hormones in milk. And the monarch butterfly incident has
caused more discussion among the science and industry components.
</P>
<P>
   One restaurateur who has chosen to take the purist's approach is
Nora Pouillon, owner of the elegant Nora and Asia Nora in
Washington, D.C. A national organic commission recently certified
her restaurants 95 percent organic, with ingredients ranging from
vegetables, milk, cheeses, and meats to items such as salt from
Brittany and spices. ``I've been in business 20 years,'' Pouillon
says, ``and so it's maybe more economical for me,'' because of
rents and long associations with organic suppliers. ``I wouldn't do
it any other way,'' she says, adding that one person on her staff
is employed only to source organic products.
</P>
<P>
   Why chefs, one might ask. ``The answer is, chefs have always
been authority figures about food,'' says K. Dun Gifford, whose
Oldways organization spawned the collaborative, ``but only in the
last decade have they been taken seriously. We pay a lot of money
to go eat their food. If food is dangerous, they care deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the premise that the issue is important only to an elite
group of chefs and those who pay more for organic products, Gifford
angrily replies: ``The people who speak that way about the public
are really the snobs. They treat food as a subject important to
only rich people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayless brings the argument back to the consumer. He scoffs at
the idea that Americans prefer not knowing about their food sources
if that saves them money. ``The US pays less for its food than
anywhere else,'' Bayless says. ``Europeans pay a lot more for food,
and they won't accept'' hormones or genetic engineering. ``We're on
the wrong road'' on prices, Bayless thinks. As a nation of
consumers, we need to make sure our food is safe, rather than
worrying so much about cost and demanding giant amounts of food.
</P>
<P>
   And all consumers, as well as restaurateurs, should have the
right to know what's in their food, the chefs agree.

AT FINANCIAL SUMMER CAMPS, GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUNDS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shrewdly, her eyes scanned the list of stocks: Tommy Hilfiger,
Delta Air Lines, IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what looks good?'' she asked her brokerage partners.
``Mobil. Sony looks pretty good. It closed at its high point. Gap's
pretty bad. Do McDonald's. Mobil and McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? If Amanda Weener, 12, were working the stock market
with real money, she might rake up a bundle for herself and her two
partners, Pamela Lama, and Aria Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   The trio _ calling themselves APA Brokers _ chose five stocks
that will be tracked on line for about four months by Salomon Smith
Barney Inc., sponsors of a two-day financial summer camp for girls
held last month in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm, like, really interested and into it,'' said Pierce, 15.
``I'm going to start buying The Wall Street Journal. My mom's going
to think something is wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years, financial planners have been preaching the
value of money-saving skills to young adults. Now the message is
being spread to an even younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Salomon Smith Barney camp, part of a weeklong Girl Scout day
program at Camp Cedar Hill, hosted 22 girls, ages 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Start-Up, a two-week summer residential program at the Dana
Hall School in Wellesley, Mass., hosted 25 girls and cost about
$1,600, with half the girls receiving financial aid. The girls,
ages 13 to 19, are from throughout the United States and Europe.
The camp is one of three in the United States run by Independent
Means Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., company.
</P>
<P>
   While the two camps focused on different aspects of business _
investment and personal finance vs. entrepreneurship _ both were
designed to urge young women to view the business world as a
desirable destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to understand that the business world is a world
that includes them,'' said Barbara Dowd, program director for Camp
Start-Up, which teaches girls how to start their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Aziza Robinson-Goodknight, 15, knew exactly what business she
wanted to work on as soon as she arrived at Camp Start-Up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to open a unisex health spa/beauty salon,'' said the
Dorchester resident. ``I want to own them all over the world, but
my first three locations I want to be in Paris, New York, and on
Newbury Street.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in the real world, dedication to an idea sometimes is not
enough. Robinson-Goodknight could not go ahead with her plan
without the consent of her business partners _ four other girls.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her group decided to go with another business, a
line of hair accessories for teens called ``Perfect Touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Laure de la Baume, 15, of Paris, a camper and one of
Robinson-Goodknight's financial partners, was concerned the idea
was not original enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it for a while,'' she said. ``And in the end
we decided that the idea was good. And that it was better to do a
product than a service. The marketing would be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups tackled similarly ambitious projects such as a
make-your-own-smoothies business. In the past, groups have
brainstormed ideas such as teen nightclubs, note-taking services,
and surfboards designed specifically for women.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial skills can be lifesaving, say those who run the
camps.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 Syracuse University study, 90 percent of
women will have to take care of themselves economically at some
point in their lives. The statistics are more dire for older women:
Forty-percent of women over 65 are poor, while 13 percent of men at
that age are poor.
</P>
<P>
   With the power of these statistics behind them, Camp Start-Up
focused on a plan to create a brownie-making business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to tell me what the start-up costs are?'' asked
Harvard doctoral student Anita Wooley.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the girls in the circle raised their hands to give
answers while others conferred with one another or searched through
notebooks. ``An oven,'' shouted one girl. ``A car to transport the
brownies,'' added another.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has a car we could borrow,'' said Anna van der
Horst, 14, of Abcoude, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fantastic,'' Wooley said. ``That's called
`bootstrapping,' when you can use what you already have and don't
have to buy it. That saves us a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls clapped and whooped as Hershey candies flew across the
room in Van der Horst's direction. Celebrations and candy are
staples of the sessions and are awarded when girls come up with
great ideas or use the ``industry buzz words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are still young girls,'' said Valjeanne Estes, director
of the Dana Hall camp. ``And they're so used to being constantly
entertained that if it becomes boring for a second we've lost them.
We call what we do here ``edutainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another vital element of the camps is role models.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate that financial smarts are not exclusive to men,
the girls interact with successful business women.
</P>
<P>
   Jane E. O'Brien was developing affirmative action and equal
opportunity programs at Harvard University in 1982 when she was
inspired to enter one of the fields she knew lacked women. That led
her to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who is now a first vice president of investments at
Salomon Smith Barney, and Meg Greer, a financial consultant for the
company, joined forces with the Girl Scouts and created the summer
camp last year.
</P>
<P>
   Though O'Brien, a mother of three, said that more women are
getting into financial planning, the assumption by many that it is
a highly technical field prevents more from joining the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this in an environment that is overwhelming for some
people, but it's a wonderful area for women,'' she said. From her
experience, O'Brien said, clients will often prefer a woman broker,
and the job offers a lot of flexibility for raising a family.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Lama listened eagerly during the camp sessions. The
enthusiasm she and her partners in APA Brokers showed after
unanimously calling the stock market ``boring'' is exactly what
organizers of the camps hope to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the future I'd like to get a job trading,'' Lama
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years after a landmark antitrust action led Ma Bell to
give birth to seven Baby Bells, some industry analysts think Ma
needs some grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As squabbles heat up in Massachusetts and New York over whether
Bell Atlantic has gone far enough promoting local calling
competition to merit approval to crack the lucrative long-distance
calling market, some Bell foes say only another breakup will do the
job.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of splitting regional telephone companies
from AT&AMP;T to level the playing field for long-distance competition,
these critics are arguing that Baby Bells should be ordered to
divest their local telephone networks from their retail operations
to promote wide-open local competition.
</P>
<P>
   Their theory goes like this: The only reason AT&AMP;T rivals like
MCI WorldCom and Sprint ever made real headway in the long-distance
market was that in 1984, an antitrust settlement separated AT&AMP;T
from its regional operating companies, the seven (soon to be four)
Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   After that breakup, local monopolies like Bell Atlantic and the
former Nynex had no incentive to steer long-distance customers to
AT&AMP;T, so rivals thrived and average long-distance costs plunged 70
percent in real dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, proponents say, if Bell Atlantic no longer owned a key part
of the physical telephone network in Massachusetts _ the 200
``central offices'' and ``local loops'' serving some 4.8 million
customers _ the new network owner would have no reason to thwart
Bell rivals seeking to hook up to local customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's viewed as radical, but the reason it has legs as a
theoretical matter _ politics aside _ is that it is what worked,
big-time, in long-distance competition,'' said Lee L. Selwyn,
president of Economics and Technology Inc., a Boston consulting
firm. Selwyn advises the Massachusetts attorney general's office
and has worked as a consultant to Bell Atlantic foe AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed Elena French of MCI WorldCom, one of the most aggressive
proponents of the plan: ``It worked once in the past. It would work
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea some call ``Divestiture II'' has been floating around
for a few years. It was voiced during the 1996 federal
telecommunications bill debate, and has made fitful progress in
Connecticut. The idea has regained some altitude in Massachusetts
this summer as Bell Atlantic presses for state backing to enter the
$2 billion Bay State long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts utility regulators last month began a series of
public hearings around the state, including sessions in New
Bedford, Pittsfield, and Worcester and a Newton City Hall meeting
set for Wednesday night, on Bell Atlantic's record allowing local
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Bells have been forbidden to offer long-distance calling
under terms of the 1984 AT&AMP;T breakup. They would love to get back
into it because of the millions of consumers who would prefer
one-stop shopping for all calls and one-stop bill problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 federal telecom act, for Bell Atlantic and others
to win the huge prize of long-distance entry, they must persuade
state regulators they have met 14 standards for promoting local
competition. The checklist includes setting up smooth
administrative systems for linking rivals' customers to the local
network and services like 911.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a war of words and dueling statistics has erupted
between Bell and its foes.
</P>
<P>
   Bell accuses the ``AT&AMP;T-MCI-Sprint cartel'' of launching ``phony
front groups'' to denounce its record and insists anyone who wants
to compete for local service can, and says 250,000 customers in
Massachusetts made the move to other carriers. The rivals contend
Bell has a lucrative 99 percent monopoly on local service and is
stalling them to death to save it.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has also pushed to enter the long-distance market
in New York. There, consultants KPMG Peat Marwick have been
conducting intensive audits to determine whether Bell rivals are
getting fair, speedy treatment signing up local customers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, however, officials have been sorely disappointed
that local competition has been so slow to develop since the 1996
federal act. Texas is the only other state besides Massachusetts
and New York where a Baby Bell now formally claims it has enough
local competition that it can plausibly seek long-distance access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate at which local competition has been established in
this country is too slow,'' the Federal Communications Commission
chairman, William Kennard, told a wireless phone industry
convention earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Divestiture II is seen by some as the silver-bullet
approach to creating local competition quickly, Tom Tauke, Bell
Atlantic's senior vice president for government relations, said
Bell has ``no company view.'' But he said Bell Atlantic officials
have considered it seriously and concluded ``it isn't workable
given the law and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, this MCI idea is another one of their
ideas thrown out on the table to delay our entry into long
distance,'' Tauke said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Tauke said, a major, possibly unresolvable,
question is economics. He flatly declared: ``Network companies as
stand-alone entities would go bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauke compares the current telephone network to a personal
computer purchased last year for $4,000 that is worth $2,000 now
and could be replaced for $1,000 next year. How much, he asks,
should it therefore cost to use it?
</P>
<P>
   Either Bell Atlantic shareholders would suffer a huge writeoff
for network construction costs regulators have not allowed Bell to
recoup, or ``competitors would have to pay more for using the
network than they do now. Everybody can't get a good deal. That
can't be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   Divestiture II proponents contend a model for their plan already
exists in the Massachusetts electric market, where utilities have
been forced to spin off their generating assets and run the power
grid as a regulated monopoly with a guaranteed rate of return.
Someday, when real competition develops, people will sign up for
power providers (many big businesses and nonprofits already do) as
they do long-distance companies and pay their local utility a
regulated charge for bringing them power.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts regulators do not see the Bell breakup idea
going anywhere fast. Paul Vasington, the telecom commissioner with
the five-member Department of Telecommunications and Energy board,
said the effort by cable television companies to roll out phone
service would delay any decision to separate Bell Atlantic from its
network.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, except for systems built to pick off high-end
business customers in areas such as downtown Boston, Bell
Atlantic's network was the only real way to reach homes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, MediaOne has launched a $1.3 billion
upgrade of its cable television network in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire that is helping it offer local telephone service in 41
Bay State communities and high-speed Internet access in more than
100.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Edison, through a $500 million joint venture with RCN, is
also making moves into the local telephone market in metropolitan
Boston. Last week RCN signed a citywide franchise agreement with
Boston city officials that promises competitive local phone service
by 2003. And as wireless costs come down, using a cellular phone
full-time is becoming an alternative to Bell Atlantic for some
heavy, or especially mobile, callers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not really clear that the side of the business that is
supposed to be a monopoly would stay a monopoly,'' Vasington said
of Bell Atlantic's once-dominant position as owner of the ``last
mile'' to customers' home phones.
</P>
<P>
   DTE chairwoman Janet Gail Besser said, ``If the part of the
system that is separated is competitive or likely to be
competitive, the benefits you get are much less clear.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few states with anything like experience trying to
split up a local phone company is Connecticut, where three years
ago regulators approved a plan by Southern New England Telephone to
split into wholesale and retail operations.
</P>
<P>
   However, the key step, having everyone in the state sign a
ballot choosing SNET or another company for long distance, has been
delayed from an initial March 1998 deadline until at least July
2001 under a law enacted earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   SNET rivals, notably including MCI WorldCom, contend the
Connecticut plan failed to go far enough because it did not require
SNET to spin off the wholesale network operation into a truly
independent company, and potential competitors to SNET have balked
at seeking local customers as a result.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does seem clear is that a Bell Atlantic spinoff
of its $8 billion Massachusetts telecommunications network would be
a full-employment bonanza for investment bankers and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   As MCI and others envision it, everything Bell Atlantic owns
from its 200 ``central offices'' in Massachusetts to the ``local
loop'' serving individual customers, plus vast investments in
trucks and service centers, would be spun off to a new company. The
new unit _ call it Network Co. _ would be run like an electric
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding just what to spin off and how much that company would
be worth to Bell Atlantic shareholders could be nightmarishly
complex and controversial and prone to years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument in favor is that the Network Co. would have no
particular incentive to rent local loops to any particular company.
If anything, backers say, it would seek to maximize fairness and
competition in hopes of increasing the overall number of phone
lines people buy.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic would continue to exist as a retail company
seeking customers and would continue to own interstate wires and
lines connecting central offices, along with competitors such as
AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint, a provision that could draw fire
from newer competitors without existing investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loop divestiture is not simple to implement, but it certainly
can be implemented,'' said MCI's local competition director Carl
Giesy, who compares the unfairness of the current system to having
United Airlines manage gate assignments at O'Hare Airport in
Chicago, one of its major hubs.
</P>
<P>
   But others think local network divestiture will develop major
support only if no Baby Bell has met the 14-point state-level tests
proving they are open for local competition, leading national or
state antitrust litigators force them into divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   Selwyn, the analyst and AT&AMP;T consultant, ``I just don't see this
happening unless the Bells go along with it, and right now there's
no reason for the Bells to go along with it.''

SENIORS BEING ABANDONED BY HMOS FED UP WITH MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Joseph R. Sicotte turned 65 last year, health insurance
companies peppered him with brochures beckoning him to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Like most seniors, Sicotte was aggressively courted by health
maintenance organizations rushing to get a piece of the
fast-growing Medicare HMO market.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, however, the former Army sergeant will no longer
be wanted. His HMO, Kaiser Permanente, is pulling out of the entire
Northeastern United States as of Jan. 1, and no other Medicare HMO
will be doing business in Berkshire County, Mass., where Sicotte
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm high and dry,'' Sicotte said. ``I don't know what the
problem is. We're human, we're people just like everyone else. Why
don't they want to insure us anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs that have sought senior citizens with zeal _ sponsoring
free lunches, phoning seniors at home, and deluging them with
inch-thick marketing materials _ are steadily exiting the market,
leaving hundreds of thousands of seniors across the country in the
lurch.
</P>
<P>
   On their way out, HMOs are loudly blaming cuts in reimbursements
from Medicare, the federal health insurance program that pays HMOs
to cover 6.2 million Americans, or roughly 16 percent of all senior
and disabled citizens on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is in serious crisis,'' said Karen Ignani,
president of the American Association of Health Plans, a
Washington, D.C. group representing HMOs. ``Unless Congress acts,
beneficiaries are going to see'' higher premiums, fewer benefits,
and fewer choices.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors in Massachusetts are already seeing signs of turmoil. On
Jan. 1, Aetna U.S. Healthcare dropped its Medicare program in six
states, including Massachusetts. The move left 17,000 Bay State
seniors scrambling to find another insurer. And next year, Tufts
Health Plan, which runs the biggest Medicare HMO in the state, said
it will charge higher prescription drug copayments and raise
premiums for seniors in certain counties. At the same time, Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care said it plans to pull its Medicare HMO out of
Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, HMOs cite cuts in Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of health plans found themselves in a situation where
costs rose faster than premiums,'' said Patty Blake, vice president
in charge of Tufts' Secure Horizons HMO for seniors. ``That's the
main thing driving the instability within the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts, enacted by Congress in 1997 to help balance the
federal budget, meant HMOs would receive $33.2 billion less than
they would otherwise have gotten over a five-year period, according
to AAHP.
</P>
<P>
   But the hit isn't felt evenly across the country. Some parts,
particularly rural areas such as Berkshire County, are hit harder.
That's because payments to rural counties are relatively low,
making them less attractive places for HMOs to do business. For
instance, Medicare pays HMOs a base rate of $507.78 a month for
each senior in Berkshire County, but $676.30 per senior in Suffolk
County. The difference can lead financially strapped HMOs to drop
coverage in rural areas, Ignani said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone buys the HMO industry's argument for
higher reimbursements. The US General Accounting Office, a
Congressional watchdog organization, in June concluded that
Medicare payments continue to exceed the health plans' costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial excess payments persist,'' the GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail R. Wilensky, chairperson of the Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission, which advises Congress on Medicare reimbursement, said
the problem is not in the amount of money plans are getting, but
how they are getting it. Health plans are reimbursed based on a
complex formula that may not reflect their true cost of providing
medical care to chronically ill patients, or to patients who live
in high-cost areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My recommendation is to really try to deal with it on point,
as opposed to just paying more,'' Wilensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, HMOs feeling the financial pinch have tried to put
the squeeze on doctors to charge them less for taking care of
seniors. Many doctors are refusing. In Massachusetts, hundreds of
physicians this year are declining to sign up with HMOs to care for
seniors, saying the payments they get from HMOs are inadequate.
Only last week, physicians at Brigham and Women's Hospital
announced they would sever their contract with Harvard Pilgrim's
First Seniority HMO for seniors, forcing hundreds of seniors to
find new coverage or give up their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are saying we won't take this anymore,'' said Stuart
Altman, a health policy professor at Brandeis University. ``These
managed care plans are faced with the need for more revenue.
Something has to give. Either we come up with a better payment
structure from the government, or health plans are going to be a
lot less generous and/or individuals will have to pay a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all agree seniors will continue to bear the brunt of
the market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   For Sicotte and many others losing their HMO coverage, the
options are limited. Many will have to return to traditional
Medicare coverage, which pays only 80 percent of doctor visits,
requires members to meet an annual deductible, and does not pay for
prescription drugs. To make up the gap in coverage, Sicotte may
have to pay nearly $300 per month for supplemental insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a frighteningly destructive impact on seniors,'' said
Geoff Wilkinson, who heads the Massachusetts Senior Action Council,
a consumer advocate group in Boston. ``HMOs have lured people in
with heavy marketing and now they're dumping them. It's very
disrupting for seniors to have to choose a new doctor, to cut off
relationships with doctors they've seen for years.''

WWF, STEWART GO TO THE MAT WITH IPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could happen: Stone Cold Steve Austin versus Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc., an enterprise
that boasts the likes of Austin and The Rock among its roster of
more than 100 televised performers, filed registration papers
Tuesday for an initial public stock offering of up to $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF filing came days after Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. registered for an IPO of its own, seeking to raise up to $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Which would you choose if they both hit the market on the same
day?
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, there is an amusing irony in the stock market's
latest cartoonish turn. Martha and the wrestlers are much better
business propositions than many of the hot dot.com IPOs hitting
Wall Street every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many other stocks come to market that
shouldn't even be public companies,'' said David Menlow, publisher
of the newsletter IPO Frontline. ``But wrestling is huge business
and Martha Stewart is one of the preeminent names out there.''
</P>
<P>
   They pull in big money, they make a profit and they have serious
help. In the WWF corner: Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., Credit Suisse First
Boston, and Merrill Lynch, among others. Martha's bankers include
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   You attract that kind of bench strength with money and
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF reported revenue of $251 million and made $56 million in
its latest fiscal year, ended April 30. Profits look better than
they would have been if the WWF was a public company because of its
``S'' corporation tax advantages. But the same business would have
earned $33 million as a public entity.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling business was booming on every front in the WWF's
last fiscal year. Revenue from the company's dozen pay-per-view
events increased by $37 million, the gate at wrestling events
jumped by more than $20 million, and merchandising soared by $48
million.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all good news inside the ring, and beyond. Owen
Hart, a wrestler known as Blue Blazer, fell to his death in May
during an event in Kansas City, Mo. Sable, a former women's
champion wrestler, has sued the WWF over claims she was degraded by
being asked to participate in a lesbian story line and appear in
titillating photos.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart has confined her wrestling to the likes of Time
Warner Inc., a former business partner she bought out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her company pulled in $180 million and earned nearly $24 million
last year, a profit that would have been deflated to $13 million by
the tax consequences of public ownership. Business is up 111
percent in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both World Wrestling Federation Entertainment and Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia are working Internet angles, but don't even have
to play that up.
</P>
<P>
   In an environment where every kind of business, including stock
markets themselves, is seriously considering the prospects of going
public, a cast of wrestlers and a domestic perfectionist may fit
right in.
</P>
<P>
   But here's one note of caution: four different IPOs hit the
market Tuesday and finished the session below their initial
offering price. Menlow said that, by his recollection, it was the
first time in four or five years so many brand-new stocks were
under water in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Menlow and others will point out that the IPO market is still
driven by powerful optimism for the Internet and how it can
transform business. By our count, there were 22 companies with
names ending in .com in registration to sell stock Tuesday. Another
10 went by names starting with ``Net.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as we could tell, there was only one company of
wrestlers. Say uncle, somebody.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all worked so well on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   As the price of Internet stocks soared, so did the stock prices
of the Internet brokerage firms _ places like ETrade and
Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't so pretty on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   The share prices of Internet brokerage firms tumbled Tuesday
when an influential analyst reported that trading volume could be
weak in the third quarter. Bill Burnham of Credit Suisse First
Boston, the guru in the field, said in a report that daily average
trades at the Internet brokers rose only slightly in July and were
below the record levels reached in April.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit? Weak Internet stocks. Prices in the sector have
plunged in recent months _ Amazon.com is down 54 percent from its
high, eBay is off 60 percent _ and so apparently has investor
enthusiasm to trade the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Among Tuesday's losers were ETrade, which closed at 24 11/16,
down 4 5/16; Ameritrade, which closed at 21 1/4, down 2 3/4; and
Charles Schwab, which closed at 37 7/8, down 4 9/16.

INJUSTICE ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child growing up in tiny Christiana, Del., Jacqueline Jones
wondered why the two black girls who integrated her third grade
class in 1955 had not attended her school before.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls lived closer to Christiana's elementary school than
the segregated school they had attended in a neighboring town. Both
were bright, and one, a quiet girl who kept to herself, was a
serious contender for the position of smartest in the class, a
position Jackie Jones coveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that year vividly,'' recalled Jones, a labor
historian who was awarded a five-year, $350,000 John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation grant in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two girls who came to our class had been bused to another
school in Newport,'' Jones said in an interview. ``The unfairness
of that seemed so obvious to me, even at 8. I didn't know it at the
time, but that was de jure segregation supported by the state
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   That year, as the battle against Jim Crow escalated in the
South, Jones forged a friendship with Patsy, one of the newcomers
in her class. Patsy wore the same barrettes as Jones, liked the
same clothes, and played the same games after school. In an era
marked by unequal, and uneasy, alliances between blacks and whites,
the two created a relationship that centered around the things they
liked rather than their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were differences. Patsy attended another church,
lived in an all black section of town and, until a US Supreme Court
ruling forced the state to abandon its segregationist school
policies, had traveled many more miles to school. Patsy's parents
could not stay in a hotel, buy property in certain areas, or bid
for the same type of jobs as their white working class or poor
peers. Patsy's world was circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, says Jones, it was that recollection, of her
friendship with Patsy as well as the racial, religious, class and
cultural differences that had separated people in her rural,
working class town of 400, that prompted her to study the
contrasting work histories of American blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a sweeping body of work that explores the
transition from slavery to free labor as well as the impact social
transformations, economic changes and public policies have had on
blacks, whites, women and new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at the University of Delaware, near the town where
she grew up, Jones helped start a tutoring program for inner city
children. She says her introduction to historical research began in
her college years, with a senior thesis on the education of
African-Americans in Delaware during the Civil War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids were curious about segregation, but many outgrew
their curiosity,'' said Jones. ``They came to accept the way things
were. I never outgrew my curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, while teaching privileged girls at
Wellesley College who considered work self-fulfilling and
liberating, Jones began delving into the history of black women's
labor in America. ``I felt my students ought to know that not
everyone saw work as intrinsically liberating, that there were
women who had no choice, women who yearned to stay home but could
not,'' said Jones, 51.
</P>
<P>
   Her research resulted in the 1986 publication of ``Labor of
Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work and the Family from
Slavery to the Present,'' which won the Bancroft Prize in American
History and was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jones is the Truman Professor of American Civilization at
Brandeis University. Her most recent books include ``American Work:
Four Hundred Centuries of Black and White Labor,'' which was
published last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Work'' provides page after page of historical data
woven together with stories about the lives of blue collar and
low-wage workers, and offers vivid details about the racial
divisions that relegated African-Americans to ``bad'' jobs, poor
schools, and deteriorating neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   With the demise of Jim Crow and the appearance of new laws aimed
at increasing educational and employment opportunities,
African-American workers began moving into jobs that were once
reserved for whites, resulting in the expansion of the black middle
class. But even those changes have been overshadowed by the
devastating impact class divisions have had on nearly every aspect
of low-wage workers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Work,'' Jones reasons that although Americans now
support _ in principle and in law _ the ideal of equality, little
has been done to challenge invidious distinctions based on class.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good job is the key that opens the way to quality health
care, a home in a good school district, and a life free of the fear
of poverty in old age,'' she wrote. ``(But) despite the elimination
of legal barriers to certain kinds of workplaces, Americans of
African descent are now likely to find their employment
opportunities dependent upon whether or not they attend a school
rich in computer resources, and whether or not they live in a
neighborhood where substantial numbers of adults hold good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds that although labor exploitation is now colorblind, the
``legacy of slavery and other enduring forms of racialized labor
practices reach their most concentrated form in poor places, urban
and rural, where good jobs have all but disappeared and where a
history of oppression is not a textbook abstraction but a bitter,
everyday reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Another book, published this year, examines workers, and the
rise of unions from their pre-Civil War trade shops to major cities
like Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in an office that overlooks the Brandeis University
campus, Jones says she was caught off guard by the MacArthur award.
She was among 32 writers, academics and artists to receive a
stipend. The no-strings award gives the most creative among us time
to innovate without the burden of financial worries.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a mother of two whose husband also teaches at Brandeis,
has not decided what she will do with the grant. She notes,
however, that she is working on a memoir about her friendship with
Patsy, her large family and growing up in Christiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones still has relatives there, Christiana has changed
from a town where local kids spent their summers wading in a creek
and swimming in the river to a community of strip malls and
fast-food chains. And many of the people Jones went to school with
have since left, including Patsy,

PATRIOTS FELT CLAY WASN'T UP TO SPEED IN THE NEW NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ NFL defenses, like everything in life, must
change with the times, or the faces of the men designing them will.
That, in the opinion of the Patriots organization, is why there has
been a change in Willie Clay's role in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, in their collective mind, Clay had no role any more,
and so he is gone into the night.
</P>
<P>
   There is an assortment of theories as to why the three-year
starting safety is without a job and the Patriots are without a
veteran presence in the middle of their secondary, some of them
personal and others professional. But the one yet to be explored is
how recent changes in offensive thinking around the league altered
the safety's role and Clay's future in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Spread formations with four and five receivers and the ``empty
set,'' in which running backs are sent wide like receivers, have
changed the safety's job in a way that New England's coaching staff
did not believe was suited to Clay's skills. Once that
determination was made, his days were numbered despite the other
important roles he filled as the team's defensive quarterback and a
calming force on younger teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Clay is a highly intelligent player who made plays as much off
his savvy as his physical skills. It is ludicrous to suggest, as
some in the organization have, that he is not a good athlete,
because if he were not, he could not have averaged 95 tackles and
four interceptions a season. Nor would the team have reached the
playoffs three straight years with him in the middle of their
defense. But the Patriots came to believe last season that their
opponents in the AFC East had gone more and more to offensive sets
that spread the defense wide with extra receivers or running backs
like Marshall Faulk or Thurman Thomas being turned into wide
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   What that change creates is open space, the kind of space that
puts a premium on pure speed over intelligence or anticipation in a
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Safeties today are far less often left to their own devices.
They are seldom free anymore, even when designated as the free
safety, and hence what players like Clay and, to a lesser extent,
Denver's eight-time All-Pro Steve Atwater, did best has now been
negated to some degree by offensive strategical alterations.
</P>
<P>
   What defenses now demand of their safeties is speed first, speed
to cover half the field or to cover receivers one-on-one in space.
Whether young Chris Carter, rookie Tony George, and veteran Larry
Whigham are equipped to do that is a debate that will be answered
this fall, but what the Patriots' staff decided was that the game
had changed enough that it was time to change the approach to it.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, a good player like Clay is let go in hopes of adding
speed that may or may not produce more plays than he did or the
desired results of Pete Carroll and his defensive staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a great deal of time on (spread formations) on both
sides of the ball in the offseason,'' Carroll said Tuesday. ``You
have to be attentive to it because all the teams are doing it,
especially in our division.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some guys who can become limitating to you. If you
have four wide receivers or backs wide, do you cover them with
cornerbacks or linebackers? If you have safeties who are averse to
(covering man-to-man in space), you're limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these spread formations now, a guy can become a
liability. Defense is becoming more of a nickel-type game. A more
athletic game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clay believes he is still fit to play that game _ and
many personnel men and coaches in the NFL who were mystified by his
release agree _ Carroll and his staff did not. Or at least they
convinced themselves of that.
</P>
<P>
   They made a decision that they needed more speed deep in their
secondary to combat the spread formation and sacrificed a reliable
player who ran their defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some also felt Carter's development after two years had been
slowed by Clay's presence, which kept him on the bench. Clay was
not only an intelligent player but also a resilient one who had not
missed an NFL start in five years, since he first won a safety job
in Detroit in his third NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Carter would continue to sit and watch the more
experienced Clay play with little chance of beating him out in any
head-to-head battle because Clay is far more experienced and
knowledgeable in how defenses work.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation and the belief that Carter could
improve only by playing, New England decided to bet on youth over
experience and on speed, athleticism, and size over intangibles
that are hard to measure until they are no longer on display, as
the Lions found out the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit let Clay walk as a free agent in 1996 and has spent
three seasons trying to replace him. The Lions, too, said at the
time they wanted to add speed and athleticism to their secondary,
and they did _ a different speedy, athletic safety every year who
has not played as well as Clay did.
</P>
<P>
   What the men who made the decision in New England have to hope
is that their experience will not mirror Detroit's because if they
learn that speed and athleticism are not all a safety needs or that
the safeties they have lack too much of what Clay brought to the
job, those who made the decision to jettison him will not survive
it either.

METERPAREL HOPING HER SKILLS FIND A WAY IN SAN JOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynne Meterparel has a confession: she is not neat.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Meterparel, her father, has a warning: that's an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as leaving stuff around, whoa baby!'' said the elder
Meterparel when asked to elaborate on his daughter's admission.
``We used to close her door, off limits, enter at your own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But neatness apparently didn't come up in the chance
conversation in 1995 with Jonathan Kraft, whose family owns the New
England Revolution, that led to an impromptu job offer. Tidiness
was not part of the job description when Kraft, blown away by
Meterparel's success at attracting spectators to soccer games in
Foxborough, Mass., tapped her last winter to become general manager
of the newly-purchased San Jose Clash. At 30, she became the
youngest GM in Major League Soccer and one of the few women to head
a men's professional sports team of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it would have mattered. In three years of leading the
Revolution to the highest attendance in the league and six months
of laying the groundwork to revitalize a moribund San Jose
franchise, the dynamic Weston native has shown that clutter is the
only thing she has any trouble managing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not work,'' said Meterparel (pronounced
mee-ter-puh-RELL). ``When you work at something you love, it's
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   She fell in love with the game not so much on the field _
although she has played in camps and clubs since high school, she
played field hockey and lacrosse at Weston (Mass.) High _ but
through the lens of a camera. As with most things in her career, it
came about by talent-induced accident.
</P>
<P>
   Working in southern California as an assistant cameraman for a
production company after graduating from college, Meterparel got a
call from a high school friend asking if she would hang out with
some guys who were coming to town and didn't know anybody. Those
guys turned out to be soccer players, including Alexi Lalas, trying
out for the 1994 US World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   A film, photography, and history major at Northwestern
University, Meterparel started bringing her camera to their games.
Almost immediately, she was enthralled with the nuances and the
grace she saw each time she lifted the camera. Conveniently so,
because soon she was asked by the organizing committee if she would
be the tour photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of fell into that one,'' she said. ``It was kind
of right place, right time, and it continues.''
</P>
<P>
   So it does. The photography stint segued into a position as
national director of the Legacy Tour, a grass-roots campaign that
introduced international soccer to major cities across the US as
the 1994 World Cup approached.
</P>
<P>
   It was what she learned there about the strength of community
involvement that broke the ice in 1995 when, at a party that kicked
off the birth of the Revolution, she got boxed in by the crush of
revelers and found herself face-to-face with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember what she said,'' said Kraft when asked what
impressed him so quickly. ``I just remember how she said it. She
glowed, she had passion, she had energy. When you're trying to
build something from the ground up that involves a lot of meeting
people, motivating people, she clearly had the ability to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she had been ready to depart on a three-month trip to
South Africa, she cut that to three weeks and took the job. As
director of crowd-building, Meterparel was charged with filling the
seats of Foxboro Stadium for a team that did not yet exist in a
sport that was not, at least at the professional level, especially
popular. Under her supervision, the Revolution finished third,
first, and second in attendance in the MLS's first three years,
averaging more than 20,000 fans per game despite the league's worst
record. Her efforts earned her a Commissioner's Award in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is as much responsible as anybody if we've had any success
in the past four years in getting established,'' said Kraft.
Besides her tireless efforts in the community, he said, ``the
people who worked with her at the Revolution just loved her to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Aframe, director of media relations for the Revolution,
explained why: ``She just has incredible energy, and it's really
contagious. As a manager, she's very adept at helping empower
people and making them feel involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Added her father: ``She'll never ask anyone to do more than
she'll put in herself. I'll bet she's the first one in and the last
one to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   After three seasons with Revolution, Meterparel felt it was time
to move on. ``The goal was to get the Revolution up and running. We
did that. I was done,'' she said. She planned an extended trip to
the Middle East before deciding what to do next in a lifetime that
has included such varied projects as whale research in Hawaii and
working with at-risk Native American youth while a member of ``Up
With People.'' Again, her travel plans changed when the Kraft
family bought the Clash and slyly asked Meterparel to go out to San
Jose for a few weeks to check out the operation before she departed
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of hoping in the back of my mind she would take the
job,'' said Kraft. ``If we could have said, `who do you want out
there?' it would have been her right from the start. We have no
worries with her there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meterparel fell for the bait, moving to Los Gatos and the new
challenge of trying to resurrect a franchise in which interest was
falling. The Clash, she said over a lunchtime burrito on a recent
visit to Boston, has tremendous potential but needs work on its
image and needs to make the community feel invested in its success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to a political campaign,'' she said. ``It's one
person at a time. We're out in the community daily: myself, the
team, our mascot. You name it, we're there. Our goal is to make it
a hometown team. We've got a long way to go, but that's part of the
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Meterparel's age appears to be one more tool with
which to build a following. ``Every time I go speak, I always have
to address it, `I know I look young, but I really am 30,' '' she
said with a laugh. ``I'm not going to be a 50-year-old man with
gray hair. I'm still finding my way in who am I as a general
manager, to figure out how to use that to our advantage to help the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find anyone more impressed than Brian
Quinn, the Clash coach, who said Meterparel has ``created a
vibrancy'' since her arrival just five weeks before the season
began last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's empowered me to make the decisions I need to make to
build this into a successful team and successful franchise,'' he
said. ``Age is irrelevant. She's got talent. It's a super time.''
</P>
<P>
   That it's not an especially neat one is meaningless. ``The thing
is,'' Meterparel's father said, ``she can find everything. It's a
huge mess, but if somebody moves a piece of the mess she says,
where is that thing? I'm not sure that's a fault.''

DOW DONATES PLASTICS PATENTS TO UNIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Typically, patents flow from university scientists
who do the research to corporate labs that develop the products.
</P>
<P>
   But in a reversal that is becoming more common in industry, the
Dow Chemical Co. has donated four patents valued at $4 million to
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the patents grant RPI all U.S. rights to a film
technology that protects outdoor plastic products like house siding
from the elements. The fourth gives the university U.S. and foreign
rights to a similar technology that protects indoor appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Dow, which is based in Midland, Mich., determined that the
patents, which are about four years old, no longer fit into the
company's long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't rely on a lot of altruism on their part,'' said
Bruce Nauman, an engineering professor at RPI who handles much of
the university's patenting and licensing. ``Big companies often
wind up with lots of patents in areas they are not going to
develop. It's a great opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. of Wilmington, Del., sparked the
trend in February with gifts of $64 million worth of technology to
the University of Iowa, Penn State University and Virginia
Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations generally receive a tax break worth one-third the
assessed value of the patents for their charitable contributions.
Universities can use the technology for research, create spin-off
companies or _ as is the case with the most valuable patents _ look
for companies to license the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wintermyer, global intellectual asset manager for Dow,
approached Nauman and the two believed the four patents would be
particularly valuable to RPI. The university has a strong
contingent of professors who deal in polymers, including profitable
areas like plastic recycling.
</P>
<P>
   RPI is looking internationally for companies interested in
licensing the Dow patents while it maintains the core technology in
Troy. The $4 million value was calculated by an outside auditor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be thrilled if we made $4 million,'' Nauman said. ``Of
course, we could make half that. We could make double that.''

   1. THE JUNIOR LITERATI They're too young to rent a car. In some
cases, they're too young to buy alcohol. But these kids have good
reason to feel like grown-ups in the literary world. That is, if
you call a six-figure book contract a good reason. Meet the writers
of Generation Y. Gen-Xer's younger brothers and sisters, who have
already infiltrated Hollywood and the music industry, are now being
courted by book publishers in search of marketable young literary
talents. And when the publishing executives come calling, they
don't skimp on the red-carpet treatment usually reserved for more
seasoned celebrity authors. By Anne d'Innocenzio. From Women's Wear
Daily. 1,300 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________ 2. MANY
GHASTLY RETURNS : ALFRED HITCHCOCK TURNS 100 Even if today's film
audiences rarely see the work of Alfred Hitchcock, master of
suspense, they are familiar with his style. His signature stylistic
touches, such as jump-cutting, overlapping sound and unorthodox
camera angles, are the hallmarks of many of today's hottest young
directors. (Hitchcock would have been 100 this year, on Friday
August 13.) By Tom Soter. From Diversion Magazine. 1,300 words +
photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
MICHELLE WILLIAMS INTERVIEW In ``Dick,'' a madcap, 1970's satire,
18-year-old Michelle Williams plays a teenager who is thrilled to
meet President Richard Nixon, only to find herself swept up in the
emerging Watergate scandal. (She develops a crush on the president
after she and her best friend are hired as presidential
dog-walkers.) But don't expect anything like the Monica Lewinsky
affair to ensue .... By Jeanne Wolfe. 1,000 words + photo. (N/A
England and Australia.)

TWICE-TOLD TALES : HOLLYWOOD'S ONGOING ROMANCE
</P>
<P>
   WITH REMAKES Why bother with a remake when the original film was
so good? Hollywood's track record with recycling is shaky. A remade
classic does not guarantee a hit. Some people argue that a remake
is justified to make an older film accessible to contemporary
audiences. This is the line taken by Leslie Dixon, screenwriter for
the new ``Thomas Crown Affair,'' starring Pierce Brosnan - best
known these days as James Bond - and Rene Russo. (The original 1968
film starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.) By Ivor Davis. 1,300
words + photos. N/A UK and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   5. RENE RUSSO INTERVIEW Lusty sex is merely one aspect of the
1999 remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway thriller ``The
Thomas Crown Affair.'' In the remake, actress Rene Russo plays
insurance investigator Catherine and she is not afraid to show the
character's vulnerability. ``Stripping down emotionally was much
harder than taking my clothes off,'' says 45-year-old Russo. By Ian
Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
JESSICA ANDREWS' COUNTRY 'WORLD' Though she is only 15, Jessica
Andrews' performance on her debut album, ``Heart Shaped World,''
sounds like the work of an older, more seasoned country singer.
Andrew says her love of country music, which began at a young age,
along with her battle with scoliosis (an abnormal curvature of the
spine,) has made a significant contribution to her gift for song.
``Sometimes when people think of a young artist,'' says Andrews,
``they think that you haven't lived long enough to sing about what
you've experienced. But my music is not a bubblegum-pop kind of
deal. It's got a lot of depth to it.'' By Michael A. Capozzoli Jr.
BPI. 600 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
THE GREAT EQUALIZER There's a revolution going on at Atomic Pop, an
Internet start-up company in Santa Monica, California. There are no
outward signs of impending struggle. If there is a coup being
plotted, it's a virtual one, orchestrated by pony-tailed
programmers and idealistic executives who embrace technology with a
sort of religious fervour. Atomic Pop, which bills itself as ``the
21st Century Music Company,'' is trying to create a new business
model for the recording industry by aggressively using the Internet
to market, promote, sell and distribute pop music. By Patti
Hartigan. From The Boston Globe. 2,000 words + photo.

A YEAR-ROUND BUSINESS: AT CAMP, FUN STOPS BUT WORK NEVER DOES

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For Tommy Ferguson and his wife, Kathy, running an
overnight summer camp isn't just a seasonal job, it's their life.
</P>
<P>
   The couple are camp directors at Camp Olympia, where Tommy has
lived since he took over as director in 1973, when he was 23 years
old. The appeal of the job endures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to enjoy being with children and you've got to want
to be here,'' he said. ``I felt like God really said, `Hey this is
really something you are good at.'''

<P>
   Ferguson comes to work at the East Texas camp about 65 miles
north of Houston wearing khaki walking shorts, a polo shirt and a
good pair of sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   But running the camp in Trinity _ about 15 miles northeast of
Huntsville _ comes with a lot of work that would challenge an
entrepreneur in Houston. Directors must deal with constantly
recruiting and motivating workers, marketing on a shoestring
budget, and entertaining hundreds of children without parental
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Torn was a Houston attorney for nine years before becoming
owner and director of Camp Ozark in Mount Ida, Ark. He liked the
change but says running the camp is the most challenging thing he's
ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're running a city for 700 people, except 500 of your
residents are under 17 years of age and the other 200 are college
students,'' Torn said. ``With that entire population, you have to
house them, feed them, dispose of their waste. You have to parent
them, make sure they have an absolutely great recreational
experience. You have to keep them safe, which is a primary thing.
Plus, we're in a rural area with absolutely no city services. It's
a fairly complex task.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Olympia, it's a job that engages Ferguson's entire
family, with his wife working as a camp director and the
college-age children working summers as counselors. They and a
staff of 30, including housekeeping, maintenance and food service,
work year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as one year's over, you start for the next year,''
said Dawn Koenig, marketing director of Camp Olympia. ``There is a
lot of administrative behind-the-scenes work to keep the place
going for the next fun summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Business for the overnight summer camps has been been good,
growing with enrollment increases of 8 to 10 percent each year
since 1992, according to the American Camping Association. Cost of
private overnight camps range from $500 to $2,000 per week
depending on the camp, but the profits for the camp are not
astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private camps are mostly mom-and-pop type operations and
they probably would make more after selling their land than they
probably would make running their camp,'' said Chris Gilbert,
president and owner of Camp Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert doesn't take any profits out of the camp and has little
to do with day-to-day operations, which have long rested on
Ferguson's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people move from job to job,'' Ferguson said. ``I feel a
strong commitment There aren't too many things you can do where you
see that you've really made a difference. There's no amount of
money that can give that kind of satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, about 6 million young people will attend overnight
summer camp at the 5,500 residential camps nationwide, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of campers increases, so must the number of
college-aged counselors, and finding good help is a major issue for
the camps and the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative to have quality counselors,'' said Lorin Mayo,
a Houston mother who has sent two of her sons to Camp Ozark.
``They're very pulled (motivated) in what they do and they're very
interested in this work. They've got to be or I don't think my son
would connect with them the way he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Camps are not only competing against one another for counselors,
but they also are fighting against the many other summer
opportunities college students have, ranging from jobs that
frequently pay more to glamorous alternatives such as study abroad
or internships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets harder every year to find the quality staffer,'' said
Torn, who has been in the business 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem in recruiting is low pay. For instance,
counselors at Camp Olympia are paid about $140 a week, plus room
and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking for people that want to work with kids since we
don't pay them a whole lot,'' Koenig said. ``We look really hard
for them. They don't just come knocking on your door.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Ozark, which draws about 30 percent of its campers from
Houston, has six full-time employees who recruit counselors at more
than 35 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities. The camp sifts
through about 1,400 to 1,500 applications and personally interview
the finalists before they hire about 250 as counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Some counselors were campers at one time and see the job as
something that was a treat as a child. Koenig started at Camp
Olympia when she was 9 and moved on to being a counselor before
becoming marketing director. Ferguson's children, both in college,
attended the camp growing up and then both worked as counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Once the counselors are selected, they are given extensive
training. They are taught the basic camp routines and jargon, and
need to be ready to deal with issues such as homesickness and
attention deficit disorder. Some also go through added courses so
they can supervise activities such as water sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with man's most precious possession _ a
person's child,'' Ferguson said. ``There's not a lot of room for
error.''
</P>
<P>
   Like counselors, the camps are competing with school or
sports-related summer activities youths can join.
</P>
<P>
   While the camps constantly are updating activities, the key
selling point remains the same _ there aren't many programs where
children can enjoy the outdoors, Torn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids have never gone swimming in a spring-filled
lake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a long list of other activities to entertain them _ from
water skiing to archery and snorkeling to karate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking at those activities and thinking, `When can
I go?''' said Mayo, adding that some years it was difficult to get
the money together to send both sons to Camp Ozark. ``It has been
worth the money every year in my mind. It was important enough for
me to do whatever I needed to do to give them that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of long-term bond is the key marketing tool for summer
camps.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Camp Olympia's business comes from repeat
campers, and now they are starting to see a second generation of
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mother and father met at Camp Olympia,'' said Ferguson as
he put his hand on a young girl's shoulder during a walk around the
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations from those mothers and fathers to other parents
are better than advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Word-of-mouth is the No. 1 recruiting tool for new campers, said
Kathy Henchey, manager of professional development at the American
Camping Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are going to send their child where someone else
has told them it was a safe, positive experience,'' Torn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the camps also send out brochures, videos and use Web sites
such as Camp Olympia's (www.campolympia.com), which has expanded
its business to other states and countries _ far from the days when
the Fergusons went door-to-door with slide shows.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recruiting occurs once all the campers are back in
school and the kid-filled grounds are empty. For a business that
thrives during the summer, it must find ways to keep itself running
during the other seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the off season at Camp Ozark, they have a small collection of
weekend groups that use the camp. Camp Olympia leases its
facilities to Houston Independent School District during the
off-months for an outdoor education program for fifth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   While the fifth-graders are romping around the camp during the
winter _ the Fergusons and staff are planning the next summer's
adventures, running online forums and recruiting counselors on
college campuses _ getting ready for another year at summer camp.

BEWARE OF DINOSAURS IN THE BUSINESS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The next time you think you have this whole
career thing figured out, rent a copy of ``Jurassic Park.'' Even an
intriguing idea, careful planning and lots of money don't always
protect you from chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Careful planning is important to your career _ and life, for
that matter _ but there are going to be times when chaos takes
over. No amount of preparation will make everything right, but here
are a few things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch for the supernova.
</P>
<P>
   My father and I flew to Los Angeles a dozen years or so ago to
see a hockey game. The Edmonton Oilers were in town, and we figured
it was the best chance we'd ever get to see that great young
player, Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's brilliance changed the world of hockey. Tiger Woods
has already done a lot of that for golf, with the potential for
much more.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has dozens of examples. Look at all what happened a
few weeks ago, when the eBay on-line auction site crashed for a day
or two. America had lived without on-line auctions for around 220
years, but suddenly a few dozen hours without eBay was cause for
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because eBay is a supernova.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have the talent to be a supernova, look around. Is
your chief executive brilliant? Are there rising stars at your
company? Is anybody revolutionizing your industry? Is any industry
a supernova? What's happening in the world that you could take
advantage of? What would you need to do to get there? It could be
anything from attaching yourself to a rising star to creating a Web
search engine to buying a fast-food franchise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn the difference between flashes of brilliance and a flash
in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   I started writing a home computing column 10 years ago at
another newspaper because I was convinced that this new on-line
service was going to change the world. It was simple enough that
the masses could use it without getting lost in the technobabble
that plagued its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The service was Prodigy, which is still around _ and still
staggering. Some upstart named America Online took that good idea
and made it better, then moved quickly enough to survive when the
Internet blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy was ahead of the curve, but it couldn't handle the
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   You might get only one brilliant idea in your life, so jump all
over it. But also realize that if it is truly brilliant, others
will try to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   That's why insecurity can kill a corporate executive. If you
surround yourself with ``yes'' people instead of talented ones,
your company will have only one source of brilliant ideas: you. A
more secure competitor will have lots of smart people's ideas to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   The more secure executive will also have people willing to
challenge the company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Realize that sometimes even a brilliant idea will fail. If
you've done all you can, let it go. Analyze why it failed, and
learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand that some things are beyond your control.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that physical therapy should be a hot
career. As baby boomers get older, they get more ailments. As they
get more ailments, they want more physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But physical therapists are in an industry that is subject to
the whims of government and insurance companies. When Medicare and
HMOs look to tighten expenses, physical therapy often gets hit.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's important not only that you evaluate your career
at least once a year, but that you evaluate what's happening in
your industry. Look for the deadly meteors as well as the
supernovas, and try to think a couple of moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Networking is critical for this. If you know more physical
therapists who are unemployed than are employed, you need to
consider shifting careers, changing the funding setup or looking
for better ways to recruit patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recognize when tragedies occur and when they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Next time something truly horrible happens in your career, think
about rock singer Eric Clapton. In 1991, he had a real tragedy: His
4-year-old son died in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton was devastated, of course. But his work was also his
passion, and his therapy. The tragedy led to one of his most
popular songs, ``Tears in Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Did that make everything right? Of course not. Some things can
never be fixed. But you have to move on.
</P>
<P>
   The same character who talked about the chaos theory in
``Jurassic Park'' also said that ``life finds a way.'' Even a
dinosaur can appreciate that.
</P>

 &HT;    COLLEGES, PUBLIC SCHOOLS LAG IN Y2K PREPARATIONS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add. Eds: optional add can be used as sidebar or graphic.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 40 percent of colleges and 30 percent of
school districts in the United States admit they won't finish
protecting essential computer systems against the Y2K bug by Oct.
1, according to a U.S. Department of Education survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned, because that doesn't leave a lot of time for
them to correct their mission-critical systems this year if they
fall behind schedule,'' said Bob Davidson, chief of the
department's Year 2000 project team.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a software flaw that can cause some older
computers and electronic equipment to misread the date 2000 as
1900, potentially causing them to misfunction.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only about 30 percent of colleges and school districts
say that all key systems are Y2K-compliant, according to the
Education Department survey, which promised confidentiality in
order to encourage candid responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news that 99 percent say they will be ready by the
turn of the year,'' Davidson said. ``At the same time,'' he added,
``it's right to call attention to the large number of educational
institutions that are behind the pace set in other fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools will face the first real-world test of their Y2K
bug protections as early as Sept. 9, when some older computer
programs will interpret 9-9-99 to mean ``date is unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   But the primary concern of most educators is the potential
disruption in January. Critical systems help conduct such
activities as cooling or heating buildings, registration and
preparation of class and bus schedules, report cards, transcripts
and payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools also may have an additional burden on New Year's
Day: use as emergency shelters if a Y2K emergency interrupts their
community's supply of water, electricity or fuel.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 38 percent of colleges and 76 percent of school
districts admit that they haven't completed a contingency plan that
spells out what they will do if faced by the failure of their own
systems or systems beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lack of money is less of an issue than lack of
organizational will power or organizational urgency,'' said Michael
Casserley, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools are quite far along, he pointed out. For example,
some have adjusted their schedules to allow only staff and faculty
in their schools for the first three or four days of next year, so
that they can test all systems for safety and reliability before
the children come back.
</P>
<P>
   Others have purchased generators or battery backups for their
computers or hallway lights, or arranged to either drain or pour
antifreeze into their non-drinking water systems on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, the Department of Education mailed a copy of the
council's Y2K compliance guide, ``Squashing the Millennium Bug,''
to each of the nation's 15,000 school districts. The guide is also
available on the Internet (http://www.cgcs.org/y2k12).
</P>
<P>
   The department's Y2K survey had a margin of error of less than 3
percent. It was answered by districts and schools that serve 38
percent of the nation's 45 million elementary and secondary
students, and by 35 percent of the nation's 5,900 colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that can be used for sidebar
or graphic follows)
</P>
<P>
   Asked when their ``mission critical systems'' would be Y2K
compliant (safe from damage by the Y2K bug), school districts and
colleges replied:
</P>
<P>
   _ They already comply. (districts, 28 percent; colleges, 30
percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ They will comply by Oct. 1. (districts, 72 percent; colleges,
60 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ They will comply by Jan. 1. (districts, 98 percent; colleges,
99 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ They will miss the Jan. 1 deadline. (districts, 2 percent;
colleges, 1 percent)
</P>
<P>
   Asked how far along they are on the recommended five-step
process for protecting essential and non-essential systems from the
Y2K bug, school districts and colleges replied:
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed none of the steps. (districts, 23 percent; colleges,
20 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed step 1, identify all problems and assign someone to
deal with them. (districts, 77 percent; colleges 80 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed step 2, assess solutions. (districts, 44 percent;
colleges 63 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed step 3, fix or replace problem systems. (districts,
20 percent; colleges, 28 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed step 4, test and validate changes. (districts, 16
percent; colleges, 21 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Completed step 5, use the revised or new system. (districts,
14 percent; colleges 18 percent)

 &HT;    `Time' is on Los Lobos' side
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heads or tails? Rock 'n' roll's answer to magic realism or the
last great party band standing? The satisfying thing about Los
Lobos is that the Mexican-American outfit from East Los Angeles
manages both without pretense. While it's hard to believe they've
been around for two decades, what's more remarkable is that the
musicians continue to push the creative envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Even this new disc, the band's first since leaving Warner Bros.
for the Latin division of Hollywood Records, comes as a surprise.
The two most visible Lobos _ guitarists/vocalists David Hidalgo and
Cesar Rosas _ both released solo efforts this year, as did the
Latin Playboys, the group's experimental offshoot with producers
Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. Apparently, the musicians were in a
prolific mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Time,'' however, doesn't so much advance Los Lobos'
agenda as consolidate it. It's not a breakthrough, such as ``Kiko''
or the first Latin Playboys disc. Instead, it reveals how the group
has reached a point where even seemingly casual gestures take on a
rich sonic complexity. Mixing up distorted blues guitar and Latin
rhythms, sweet Memphis soul and the sly, syncretic pulse of West
Africa, the band has reached a place where no sound is alien to it.
Three Spanish-language tunes look back to the Los Lobos roots,
while fuzzed-up guitars and assorted bangs and rumbles reconcile
garage-rock energy with art-music ambition. Underneath it all,
lyrics that offer concise blueprints of romantic longing, evocative
character studies and incitations to the dance are evidence that
any time is the right time for Los Lobos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Time''
</P>
<P>
   Los Lobos. Hollywood Records. 11 tracks. Grade: B

 &HT;    Mini CD reviews

</P>
<P>
   ``The Verve Pipe''
</P>
<P>
   The Verve Pipe. RCA. 12 tracks. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Drum loops, spacey keyboards, backward vocals _ Michigan's Verve
Pipe tries every trick it can on its second major label release to
prove that it's not just another post-grunge alterna-rock group
(see Goo Goo Dolls, matchbox 20, etc.) Surprisingly, it works about
half the time _ far more than one should expect from a band that
gave us the quintessentially generic alterna-rock ballad ``The
Freshmen.'' The album opens with the Verve Pipe glam-slamming its
way through the fuzzed-out stunner ``Supergig.'' Hot producer of
the moment Michael Beinhorn (Hole, Marilyn Manson) keeps the sonic
gimmicks coming, even when the group lapses into blandness on
rockers such as ``She Loves Everybody.'' Of course, there's the
requisite ``Freshmen'' follow-up ballad: ``She Has Faces'' should
provoke many a slow-dance clinch at high school functions this
fall.

<P>
   ``On How Life Is''
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray. Epic. 10 tracks. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Here lies another example of unsubstantiated buzz surrounding a
CD. It entered the world with so much promise: an alluring video
for its first single, ``Do Something''; prominent placement in
music and newsweeklies alike; and lots of ``next Billie Holiday,''
``next Erykah Badu'' touts. All of which is intended to get you to
pick up this debut, which _ granted _ is kind of hard to put down.
Macy Gray's pinched growl is incomparable and instantly engaging.
If its novelty ebbs, the live organs, guitars and horn sections
prove to be steady, well-arranged companions along this twisting
journey through funk (``Sexomatic''), blues (``I Can't Wait'') and
island sway (``Murder''). But along the way you realize those two
pluses are all being used to get across _ and possibly disguise? _
the deadbeat of the bunch, the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Macy Gray will perform Aug. 18 at the Tabernacle in Atlanta.

</P>
<P>
   ``Remedy''
</P>
<P>
   Basement Jaxx. Astralwerks. 15 tracks. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   In a year already blessed with several exceptional
dance-oriented releases, this London duo's debut holds its own with
the Chemical Brothers and Underworld. It may not be quite the
reinvention of house music that some pundits have claimed, but it
is brimming with invention. The pair deconstructs the past decade
of dance music, throwing it all back together in unexpected ways
while never sacrificing melody to the gods of technology. An
obvious affection for early Detroit techno pioneers such as Juan
Atkins and Derrick May and the cut-and-splice sound collages of
Coldcut is evident, but what really sets this apart is the
frenetic, punky energy. Even in the disco-fied bass line of ``Red
Alert'' or the Latin rhythms of ``Rendez-Vu,'' the music seems
infused with the passionate power of a garage band.

 &HT;    Going gourmet is easy with these saucy sites
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   People tend to be intimidated by sauces. Perhaps it's the
French, who have made their sauces a point of national pride and
aren't at all shy about telling the rest of the world. Or maybe
it's the sauciers, that culinary elite that gives the rest of us
the idea that sauces are beyond our reach. Whatever the source of
this inferiority complex, the truth is that sauces aren't all that
difficult to make.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that most sauces are made of just a very few basic
ingredients that most people already have on hand. Butter, flour or
other thickening agents, spices and maybe wine are the simple basis
for scores of sauces. Yes, there are blending and thickening
techniques that you'll have to master, but compared with some other
culinary procedures, those are fairly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can transform the ho-hum into the unforgettable more
quickly than a sauce. And to deprive your repertoire of sauces is
to miss out on one of the most creative things you can do in the
kitchen. Remember, too, that the French haven't cornered the market
on sauces. Nearly every nation and region in the world has a
signature sauce, making the creative opportunities nearly
unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   If you're moved to give up those powder-filled envelopes you've
been relying on to jazz up your cooking and are game to enter the
creative world of sauces, check out these World Wide Web sites for
an informative overview.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At www.gumbopages.com/food/sauces/ you will learn, in simple
language, about such things as ``mother sauces'' and their
derivatives. For example, you'll learn that hollandaise is the
mother of bearnaise, maltaise and mousseline. There are easy
instructions on thickening techniques and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other sites at which to learn the basics of sauces and get
your vocabulary up to par are ``a compendium of sauces and dips''
at www.flavorweb.com/sauces.htm and a ``glossary of sauces and
condiments'' at azstarnet.webpoint.com/food/cksauces.htm
</P>
<P>
   worcestershire.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An article by Naomi Cutner at Homearts at food.homearts.com
</P>
<P>
   /cookings/basix/36basa16.htm takes the mystery out of those
French sauces by simply explaining the preparation of white sauces,
brown sauces, hollandaise, mayonnaise, gravy-type sauces and
vinaigrette _ the basic French sauces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At www.cs.cmu.edu/(tilde)mjw/recipes/sauces/index.html you'll
find a mind-boggling index of sauces and marinades that will give
you an idea of just how many choices you have. From flavorful
Japanese dipping sauces to Greek gyro sauces to endless nuances of
our very own barbecue sauces, along with the full contingent of
French sauces, it's all there.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You didn't think Cyberspice had forgotten your homework
assignment, did you? See the Association of Dressings and Sauces
site at www.dressings-sauces.org/ for a history of dressings and
sauces. You'll learn that many authorities believe the first batch
of mayonnaise _ a mixture of egg yolks, oil and seasonings _ was
whipped up to celebrate the 1756 French capture of Mahon, a city on
the Spanish island of Minorca, by forces under Louis-Francois-Armad
de Vignerot du Plessis, duc de Richelieu. Boring, you say? Well,
get this: The duke, who was widely known as a bon vivant, had the
odd habit of inviting his guests to dine in the nude. Think about
that the next time you're spreading some Deep South on a BLT.

 &HT;    Chill with pineapple concoctions
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pineapple Sherbet made with buttermilk is what my
mother turns to when it's too hot for anything else at her Florida
home. She has adapted a recipe that her mother took from a booklet
accompanying a refrigerator many decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when Mary Custar asked for such a recipe, I knew where to get
one. In fact, when I called Mom to discuss it, she and Dad had just
polished off a batch.
</P>
<P>
   But because I also knew Mom's recipe calls for uncooked egg
whites _ which can be risky for young children, older folks and
those with immune system disorders _ we published Cus-
</P>
<P>
   tar's request hoping for a less-risky version.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the few that came in included raw egg whites. But dining
critic John Kessler came through with one that does not _ Pineapple
Freeze.
</P>
<P>
   We're including both because they are both colder than ice cream
on a hot day, and neither requires an ice cream maker. If you
decide to make the one with eggs, you might consider substituting a
pasteurized egg white product.

 &HT;    `Forget About It' _ Krauss lacks fire without band
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the Dixie Chicks became the darlings of country by
stitching fiddles around pristine mountain vocals, Alison Krauss
</P>
<P>
   yanked bluegrass into the mainstream with early '90s albums that
are still landmarks in fusing traditionalism with pop.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this new CD from songbird Krauss doesn't advance the
style she so perfectly set in pre-Chicks Nashville. Maybe part of
the problem this time is that her band, Union Station, isn't
mentioned here, and Krauss as a solo artist lacks the fire and
spirit of the group's plucky, acoustic contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Though her voice is as beautiful as ever, Krauss sounds like a
jukebox stuck on ``melancholy,'' with tunes that never stray from
being as safe and predictable as a house salad. Even a cover of
Shenandoah's haunting ``Ghost in This House'' sounds like
background dinner music. Bluegrass Sade.

 &HT;    Two block district long on small-town charm
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBURN, Ga. _ Trains still chug through this tidy town of
about 4,000 residents several times a day, but they don't stop here
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The little depot where passengers once waited to board the
trains now houses a law firm and an antiques store. That's just one
of the many changes the South Fulton community has experienced
since it was incorporated in 1854.
</P>
<P>
   Fairburn _ a place of church bells, friendly faces and fuchsia
crape myrtles _ claims that in 1861 the town unfurled the first
flag of the Confederacy and that its citizens erected the first
monument honoring World War I veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched this town sink and now start to come back to
life,'' says longtime resident Shirlee Grantham, who owns Carousel
Designs floral and gift shop. Like many of the residents, she
thinks that the secure, small- town atmosphere is a strong drawing
card to Fairburn.
</P>
<P>
   To call Fairburn's downtown walker-friendly is an
understatement; its business district covers a two-block area. If
you're on a shopping expedition, you won't have far to go in any
direction before you stumble upon a small specialty shop. Most can
be found in a prominent two-story building that once housed a
variety of businesses including a harness factory.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Alice Alford and her partners Nancy Blanton and
Jennifer Johnson established their shop For Friends in Fairburn two
years ago is because they wanted to get in on the ground floor of
local redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta flight attendant who flies a London route every week,
Blanton scouts out items for the shop while she's there. On a
recent trip, she picked up a pre-abdication commemorative box
adorned with a small painting of the Prince of Wales. Another piece
that might entice Anglophiles is a coronation brooch with a sketch
of Queen Elizabeth II on the face.
</P>
<P>
   Those who collect dolls should have a field day among porcelain
brides, Princess Di swathed in green satin and Richard Simmons'
parade of big-haired debutante dolls. Meander through the dolls in
the front section and you pass antique sideboards, an old
vaudeville trunk, a mirrored wardrobe and some new framed shadow
boxes. Oh, and don't miss the food case where you can pick up that
jar of Habanero Salsa From Hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the shop's back room you'll find handmade quilts, antique
kitchenware and embroidered tablecloths. But what commands a good
deal of attention are the bears, from Annette Funicello bears in
vivid colors ranging from aqua to cranberry to more traditional
Steiff collectibles from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If you make the trip to Fairburn _ located about 10 miles south
of Hartsfield International Airport _ don't miss a visit to the
Whimsical Rabbit. Owner Sue Grisham paints baby pink swirled roses
on furniture, as well as on her walls. The exterior brings to mind
a wedding cake with shells and scrolls softened with layers of
thick ecru paint surrounding the pink double door.
</P>
<P>
   Along with hand-painted furniture _ most of which is intended
for the ultimate baby nursery _ Grisham offers lavender wicker
pieces, festive bonnets, pink-and-yellow chenille stuffed elephants
and needlepoint rugs scattered with teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my cottage look,'' she says. ``Nonserious furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   For devout shoppers and friends May Compton of Auburn, Ala., and
Lindal Coston of New Orleans, the drive to this pastel wonderland
is never too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a shopper,'' Compton says. ``One day I saw the Fairburn
sign and just followed it. That's when I met Sue. I love this
darling shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton purchased a white step-stool/ironing board combination
covered with Sue's painted flowers and ivy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to buy it when you see it because it'll be gone if
you wait,'' she said, as she loaded the treasure into her trunk.
</P>
<P>
   You might not think of Fairburn as a bastion of Victorian
manners, but then maybe you haven't been led Down the Garden Path,
where owner Lila Huggins gives tea parties and lessons in Victorian
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out to be just for young girls,'' says Huggins.
``They'd come and dress up in vintage clothes with hats and gloves,
and we'd give them a tea party that included games and lessons in
Victorian etiquette. But now we get people from 3 to 85 years
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins also sells antiques and has a gift shop in her cottage.
</P>
<P>
   For Barbara Gowen, a resident since elementary school, Fairburn
has just about everything one could want.
</P>
<P>
   Gowen, who works for her son and former husband at Gowen's
garage, is eager to share Fairburn's charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, our bank has a front-yard banking atmosphere,''
she says. ``You're not a number there, you're a person. They know
your first name. And that's true when you walk into any of the
shops in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have parades every year, and the whole town comes out.
There are floats, and folks throw candy out to the kids. How could
you get more American than that?''
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Take I-85 south to the Union City exit (Exit
13). Turn right and continue until you see the Fairburn sign (about
two miles) and follow the signs until you reach Broad Street
</P>
<P>
   (U.S. 29).

   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Casablanca Cafe: Southern California transplants Richard and
Ursula Hilley came to Fairburn three years ago to follow the motion
picture business to the East Coast. The couple used to cater film
productions and found that feeding show biz folks also is big in
the Atlanta area. At Casablanca Cafe, you'll find a scattering of
requisite movie posters _ yes, the eatery's namesake Bogey pic
poster graces the walls _ along with an enticing lunch and dinner
menu. Luncheon salads range from California Cobb to fried chicken
salad, and sandwiches include Casablanca pecan chicken salad,
classic Reuben and sloppy Joe burgers. Dinner offerings include
Cajun meatloaf and grilled chicken. Lunch prices range from
$2.25-$6.95; dinner from $3-$10.95. Open for lunch 11 a.m.-3 p.m.
Mondays-Saturdays; 5 p.m.-8 p.m. Fridays-Saturdays. 19 W. Broad
St., Fairburn. 770-306-9448.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Green Manor Restaurant: At this lovely mansion, amid 5 1/2
acres of pecan and magnolia trees and gardens, you can enjoy a
lunch buffet of traditional Southern fare that includes fried
chicken, pork chops, fried green tomatoes and a slew of homemade
breads and desserts. Built in 1910, the house features 10
fireplaces and several staircases. Luncheon buffet, $9.95; dinner,
$10-$25; Sunday brunch buffet, $12.95. Open for lunch 11:30 a.m.
-2:30 p.m. Mondays-Fridays; dinner 5:30-9:30 Fridays; Sunday brunch

 &HT;    Where can I find it?

   Q: I am looking for Orville Redenbacher's caramel popcorn. I can
find it occasionally but not regularly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Solis, Suwanee
</P>
<P>
   Another popping-good question: Does Orville Redenbacher still
make microwave caramel popcorn? I can't find it and I sure do miss
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Myeshi Adams, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: For more than 40 years, Orville Redenbacher has been
perfecting his gourmet popcorn. His Microwave Caramel Popcorn
($1.99 for one box containg two 2-ounce bags and two 4-ounce
pouches) is not as readily available as his other products. If you
put in a special order request at Publix, the store will order it
for you. We found the popcorn at Publix in Snellville, 1905 Scenic
Highway (770-978-5800).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can no longer find Krusteaz Muffin Mix, in the cranberry
orange flavor. Do you think it is still around?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Miller, Roswell
</P>
<P>
   A: For more than 60 years, Krusteaz has been turning out baking
goodies for people in the Northwest. It started in 1932 with the
women of a Seattle bridge club who came up with the idea for an
easy-to-make pie crust. They called their company Krusteaz, a mix
of ``crust'' and ``ease.'' Later they branched into other bakery
items including muffin mixes. We found the cranberry orange muffin
mix at Publix in Ansley Mall, 1544 Piedmont Road N.E.
(404-898-1850). A 1 pound, 1.5-ounce box is $1.50. Not only is this
mix fat-free but all you need to add is one cup of water to the
other ingredients. We've also seen the mix at some metro Kroger
stores and at Wal-Mart Supercenters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am searching for P.Shine, a liquid buffing agent that gives
fingernails a luminous, hard shine in a very short time. This
product has no equal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan T. Trammell,
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another nail inquiry: Could you find a buffing cream called
P.Shine?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bella Kopman, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: We chewed our nails over this one but eventually found the
product in California, where Motoo Kammie imports P.Shine from
Japan. For more than 400 years, Japanese women have used a secret
manicure process that gives their nails the luster of a rare pink
pearl _ a healthy shine without polish. P.Shine mimics this process
with Twinkle, a lotion that, when applied and buffed into nails,
helps prevent splitting, chipping and peeling. It also keeps nails
from yellowing after a prolonged use of regular nail polish. Shown
here is the P.Shine Nail Buffer Kit ($30) containing Twinkle;
cushioned emery pads and emery board; a buckskin buffer; cuticle
pusher; vitamin E nail cream and sponge. You can also order a
.5-ounce bottle of Twinkle for $9. To order: 323-969-8685.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a '70s yuppie and am looking for Lacoste knit shirts that
have the little alligator on them. I have noticed a number of
tennis players wearing these shirts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Davis, Lilburn
</P>
<P>
   A: These preppie tennis shirts have been around for more than 60
years. During the late '20s, French tennis player Rene Lacoste was
known as ``Le Crocodile'' because ``he never let go of his prey on
the court,'' according to his family. First Lacoste embroidered a
crocodile on his blazer, then, in 1933, he set up a knitwear firm
and started manufacturing shirts with his signature logo.
Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy wore these shirts
with the croc _ Americanized as the ``alligator shirt.'' Today,
these shirts are recognized worldwide and are highly prized among
sportsmen. H. Stockton stores stock croc knit shirts ($69 each) in
a wide range of colors. For more information, call the Peachtree
Street store at 404- 523-7744.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a perfume called Galanos. I purchased it
about 10 years ago from a shop in Europe. I have since checked
various duty-free shops while traveling and no one seems to have
it. Could you please research this on my behalf?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Podber-Faagan, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: This hard-to-find fragrance was introduced in 1979 by
Californian James Galanos, one of Nancy Reagan's favorite fashion
designers. The fragrance is a blend of wood notes (cedar), floral
blossoms (geranium, jasmine, gardenia, red rose, carnation) and
mosses, enhanced with musk, vanilla, coriander, bay and clove. We
sniffed out your scent at House of Versailles in Charleston, S.C.,
a shop specializing in perfumes no longer carried by department
stores. A 2-ounce eau de parfum is $59; a 4-ounce eau de toilette
is $79. To order: 1-800-264-2506.

 &HT;    Video of the week
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. The movie's plot combines two
traditional genres: the haunted-by-his-first-wife theme from
``Rebecca'' and the city girl/country guy motif embraced by ``The
Horse Whisperer'' and ``Six Days, Seven Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   After finding a bottle with a love note inside, a vacationing
Theresa (Robin Wright Penn), a date-deprived divorced mom with a
young son, returns to her job working for a Chicago Tribune
columnist (a boisterous turn by Robbie Coltrane).
</P>
<P>
   When she tells him her story, he turns it into a column, which
in turn elicits loads of reader response. Theresa uses the feedback
to piece together the letter writer's identity and where he lives
(the Outer Banks of North Carolina, played rather unconvincingly by
Maine). The next step is to find him. As we all knew coming in, the
writer is Costner, playing a mourning fisherman-boat builder who's
pestered by his rascally dad (Paul Newman, having a fine time doing
his Judge Roy Bean, ol' coot thing).
</P>
<P>
   When Penn and Costner meet, the rest of the movie is pretty much
will-they-or-won't-they stuff. For a good while, it lets us
luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment, and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. Grade: B-

<P>
   &QR;  ``Blast From the Past'' (PG-13) _ In the latest of his
fish-out-of-water comedies, Brendan Fraser plays a fellow who has
lived all of his 35 years in a fallout shelter. Surfacing in '90s
Los Angeles, he has to acquaint himself with adult bookstores and
unmarried couples living together. Fraser is game and unafraid to
look goofy. But ``Blast'' doesn't give him a character he can play
with. And it thrusts him into a spark-free romance with Alicia
Silverstone in a sullen and dull performance. Grade: C-

<P>

<P>
   &QR;  ``Cruel Intentions'' (R) _ Last decade's ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan
Phillipe as a couple of desultorily rich teens manipulating the
romantic lives of everyone around them, purely for their own
amusement and without a whit of concern about whom may be hurt in
the process. It practically guaranteed that ``Cruel Intentions''
would become a runaway hit with the teen audience at whom it is so
obviously aimed. Grade: C+

   &QR;  ``20 Dates'' (R) _ This faux documentary about a young
filmmaker's dating life in Los Angeles may not be a total love
connection, but it has its charms. Writer-director-star Myles
Berkowitz sets out to make his first feature by combining his two
greatest failures: ``My personal life and my professional life.''
Like Berkowitz himself, the movie is never as adorable or clever or
original as it thinks it is. But it does touch a few raw nerves
about the dating game. Grade: C+

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Tango'' (PG-13) _ It's the dance-film answer to Fellini's
``8 1/2.'' Miguel Angel Sola plays Mario, a Buenos Aires
filmmaker-choreographer shooting a definitive film about the tango.
As he falls for young dancer Elena (Mia Maestro), we wait for
inevitable retribution from her gangster lover. The plot is almost
secondary to the self-conscious but gorgeous theatricality of the
film's design, the steamy elegance of its dance numbers. In Spanish
with English subtitles. Grade: B+

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``La Sentinelle'' (unrated) _ A French medical student tries
to solve some Cold War mysteries when he discovers someone has
placed a mummified human head in his luggage. This slow-moving
thriller is longer on mood than plot. But it creates a fascinating
world of well-heeled students and young politicos, steeped in a
chic sort of dread that Hitchcock might have approved. In French
with subtitles. Grade: B-

EXECUTIVES PUMP BIG MONEY INTO MEASURE ON GAY MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Supporters of an initiative to ban gay marriage
in California have amassed an early fund-raising advantage, partly
by tapping the wallets of a small clique of multimillionaire
conservative businessmen from Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the campaign for the initiative had taken in
$840,000 in donations in six months, four times as much as the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The money was raised from about 650 contributors in California.
But $200,000 of that came from four donors who together form one of
the state's most powerful and conservative political action
committees, the California Independent Business PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The group has rallied behind state Sen. William J. ``Pete''
Knight, a Republican from Palmdale, who is the leading proponent of
the measure to affirm that only heterosexual marriages are
recognized in California.
</P>
<P>
   The same group, under a different PAC name, was instrumental in
helping elect two dozen conservatives to the Legislature in 1994.
Last year, its members spearheaded the drive to get the gay
marriage initiative on the ballot on March 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for these three or four guys and Sen. Pete
Knight, Californians never would have even thought about an
initiative'' on gay marriage, said Mike Marshall, the San
Francisco-based consultant who is managing the campaign against the
ballot initiative. ``It wasn't a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is led by Howard Ahmanson, heir to the Home Savings
and Loan fortune, who now dispenses millions in charitable and
political donations through his Irvine-based Fieldstead &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmanson is also a benefactor of the Christian reconstructionist
movement, whose followers wish to turn certain tenets of the Bible
into national law, according to Jerry Sloan, a former minister who
heads Project Tocsin, a nonprofit organization that tracks the
conservative Christian movement.
</P>
<P>
   The group also includes Edward Atsinger, owner of dozens of
Christian radio stations; Roland Hinz, publisher of magazines such
as ``Dirt Bike'' and ``Motorcross''; and Richard Riddle, an
import-export businessman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the four men formed the Allied Business PAC, which
contributed $4 million to conservative candidates for the state
Assembly and Senate between 1992 and 1998. The group also backed
anti-abortion and Christian programs, as well as a school-voucher
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth co-founder of the PAC was Rob Hurtt, owner of a
container manufacturing company in Garden Grove. Hurtt has taken
firm stands against abortion and homosexuality, and has been a
generous donor to the Christian Coalition, the Traditional Values
Coalition and Focus on Family, a conservative ministry in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 24 of the 34 Republican legislative candidates
supported by the group won. Hurtt, who won a special election to
the Senate in 1993, staged a coup a year later, ousting moderate
Sen. Ken Maddy, a Republican of Fresno, to become the state Senate
Republican minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Hurtt also drew gay rights protesters to his Sacramento
office when he told the Los Angeles Times that gays were to blame
for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a plague on this Earth that they're responsible
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the group's power has waned somewhat. Hurtt resigned
his leadership post in 1997 and was defeated for re-election last
year. Ahmanson, Atsinger, Hinz and Riddle renamed their political
action committee California Independent Business PAC and pumped
money into it. One of the top items on their agenda is getting the
Knight initiative passed.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports filed with the secretary of state's office,
Ahmanson gave $210,000 last year to the campaign and Atsinger gave
at least $162,500. The money paid for an expensive
signature-gathering drive which helped the measure qualify for the
March 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   According to finance reports filed Monday, Ahmanson, Atsinger,
Hinz and Riddle each gave $50,000, in contributions or no-interest
loans, to the campaign in the first six months of this year. The
group's contributions equal a little less than one-fourth of the
campaign's total haul.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Stutzman, spokesman for the pro-initiative campaign, said
Tuesday the few large donations shouldn't overshadow the smaller
donations made by hundreds of people who support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the report, you'll see that there's well beyond
a handful of people'' who have made contributions, Stutzman said.
</P>
<P>
   John Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College,
said he can envision the opposition campaign using the Allied
Business PAC to energize liberals to oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see attack ads, where opponents could show a rogue
gallery of unpopular figures they have supported in the past that
say, `Look at who they supported in the past, and look at what
they're bringing us now,''' Pitney said.

Greenwich Village, Upper East Side _ this area is conspicuously
gray. Historical-minded people may refer to it as Rosehill, after
the 18-century farm belonging to John Watts, a Tory sympathizer,
that covered roughly the same acreage. George Trescher, the

can be designed without the usual constraints and without the

   HUGUENOT-HOUSES There was no Home Depot in the 17th century when
the French Huguenots settled along the fertile banks of the

French Protestants built a street of stone houses with
deeply-furrowed rooflines and heavily-timbered ceilings. The quiet
treasure, called Huguenot Street, is tucked away from college-town
burger joints and other modern tumult _ ``a whole village of

GEN X AT CROSSROADS; LITTLETON REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be hard to sympathize with Generation Xers, particularly
those amassing wealth from wildly successful Internet ventures, but
after reading Xer Tim Halstead in this month's Atlantic Monthly, I
actually came close to empathizing with this (I want it now!)
generation. And I understand better why Xers are the most
politically apathetic generation to come down the pike this
century.
</P>
<P>
   Halstead (who seems to be an exception to this rule) argues that
many Xers are so fed up with the lack of political leadership on
issues they care about _ like their fiscal woes (did you know that
Xers as a group may be the first generation to earn less than their
parents?) and the disturbing environmental legacy we're leaving
them _ that they have ``tuned out'' of the political arena, for the
time being at least. After detailing the challenges his generation
face, Halstead issues an impassioned call to arms: ``Today's young
adults will be remembered either as the late-blooming generation
that ultimately helped to revive American democracy...or as another
silent generation that stood by as our democracy and society
suffered a slow decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question remains: as Xers canyon down swollen rivers in
pursuit of extreme thrills and make the Internet their own private
playground, are any of them out there listening?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  While few of the Atlantic's offerings this month could be
considered light summer reading, the magazine does provide a number
of meaty and surprisingly tasty morsels. Max Singer (of the
conservative Hudson Institute) weighs in on the issue of population
growth and manages to make what sounds like good news -- in 50
years, the world's population may take a nosedive -- into something
quite ominous. His basic argument, that as more and more countries
become modernized, the fertility of their women will drop, makes
sense, but Singer never bothers to explain why, on a planet with
such strained resources and rapidly shrinking biodiversity, he
should be so concerned about this eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   Claude M. Steele's essay on why black college students
underperform academically is more satisfying. After studying the
issue for years, Steele, a sociologist at Stanford and twin brother
of conservative essayist Shelby Steele, has come up with a
commonsensical answer that skirts the handwringing of the left and
the racial genetics of the right: middle-class black students don't
perform as well as their white counterparts on academic measures
because their constant fear of being stereotyped as underperformers
wears them down to the point where they try too hard on
standardized tests or stop caring enough to succeed. Steele argues
that men and women of all races don't do well in situations in
which they expect others to have negative stereotypes about them,
even when they know the stereotypes do not apply. And he backs up
his argument with some proof: When in the course of an experiment
he and colleagues told white male students who were strong in math
that a difficult math test they were about to take was one that
Asians generally did better on, those students did worse on the
test than similarly ranked white male students who were not told
that. To his credit, Steele does not leave readers shaking their
heads at this all-too human reaction to ``stereotype threat;'' he
offers some innovative solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  It's late in the summer, but a few magazines are still
trying to come up with explanations for the tragedy in Littleton,
Colorado, and it's amazing how different their theories are. In the
surprisingly readable current issue of Family Networker, which
bills itself as a magazine on psychotherapy and family life, social
worker Garry Cooper, a family therapist and contributing editor to
the magazine, says what a lot of folks have been thinking but don't
dare say: that ``disconnected parents'' have a lot to do with the
current spate of violence among suburban youth. Cooper argues that
some ``parents have left a big vacuum in their kids' lives, and the
vacuum has been filled with a second family of angry, disconnected
and confused peers who are often virtually raising themselves in a
toxic media culture of violence and materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! That sounds mighty persuasive, but if you read this
month's Ms magazine, you'll get an entirely different take from
Gloria Steinem. She states an unarguable fact _ that ``white males,
usually intelligent, middle class and heterosexual or trying
desperately to appear so, account for virtually all the serial,
sexually motivated, sadistic killings'' _ and then goes on to argue
that that's because they are ``the group most likely to become
hooked on the drug of superiority.'' Dominating others is so
important to this group, Steinem opines, that ``a mere insult can
justify lethal revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   What Steinem fails to mention is that nonwhite males can be just
as murderous over mere insults and that white guys may simply be
more likely to get away with murder, if only because they look and
act like the people charged with arresting them.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps both Steinem and Cooper's theories, as
oversimplified as they are, are part of the complicated mosaic that
gave us Littleton, and now, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  On a somewhat lighter note, Salon magazine, which is
published on the Internet at www.salonmagazine.com, delves into the
debate over whether ``girl talk'' on the Web is encouraging teenage
sexuality or helping young women deal with sexual pressures in a
positive way. Janelle Browning, of course, has a bias (clue: she
makes her living off the Web), but she does her homework, and the
best part of the piece (which can be found in Salon's Technology
section) is that it provides parents and other interested parties
instant access (with a click of the mouse) to the sites where their
chatting girls are most likely to be found.

   CLASSIC FLAMING BAKED ALASKA
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1 half-gallon brick ice cream, any flavor, soft enough to cut,
but not drippy
</P>
<P>
   12- to 16-ounce pound cake, about 7-by-4-by-2 inches
</P>
<P>
   4 egg whites, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons high-proof rum or flammable liqueur of choice
</P>
<P>
   Cut ice cream to exact dimension of cake. (There will be some
ice cream left over.) Cut cake in half horizontally and place
ice-cream brick in center, making a giant ice-cream sandwich. Put
sandwich on an ovenproof platter and cover lightly. Place in
freezer long enough to refreeze ice cream until ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, preheat oven to 450 degrees. Beat egg
whites and salt until frothy, and gradually beat in sugar until
whites are thick and glossy. Remove frozen brick of ice cream and
cake from freezer, and cover it with the egg whites, whirling them
festively. Bake 4 to 6 minutes, or until meringue is lightly
browned. Watch carefully so as not to burn meringue.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the liqueur. As soon as the baked Alaska is pulled out of
the oven, set liqueur on fire and pour it all over the meringue.
Blow out flames when meringue begins to singe.

POSTWAR AFFLUENCE EXPANDS U.S. PALATES, LAUNCHES AGE OF CONVENIENCE
FOODS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1950s, America likes Ike and just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The conquering heroes had come home. With the help of the GI
Bill, they earned educations. They found wives, they had babies,
and with more help from the GI Bill, they bought 3-1-1 homes in the
sprouting suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   When the decade opened, 21.6 percent of wives worked outside the
home. By 1960, that number hit 30.5 percent. The reason for the
jump? There was simply so much to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and refrigerators and TV sets and washing machines cost
money. And after a couple of decades of doing without _ with a
depression followed by a war _ America was ready for the good life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Love Lucy'' was the sweetheart of the country _ introducing
Middle America to ``Babalu'' and situation comedy. It was a
good-feeling show for a good-feeling time. Another TV series
reflected the darker side of the decade. ``I Led Three Lives'' was
the tale of Herbert A. Philbrick, a Boston ad man by day, a member
of the Communist Party by night and an FBI agent in his remaining
work hours.
</P>
<P>
   TV was pervasive. A recipe for clam dip appeared on ``The Kraft
Music Hall,'' a variety show. Within 24 hours, the grocery shelves
in New York City were stripped of canned clams.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of television led to the introduction of the TV
dinner in 1954. The first production order was for 5,000 dinners,
thought to be a big gamble at the time. The company sold 10 million
dinners that year. When the dinners were introduced, few people
owned freezers. Most dinners were bought and eaten the same day.
</P>
<P>
   And to relieve Mom further of some of the stresses of
homemaking, Dad often took to the back yard to match meat with
flame. Back yards became the public squares of the suburbs. June
and Ward would come over with the kids, and while they played with
their Hula Hoops and shot cap pistols, Dad burned dinner.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough help for Mom, the supermarket was nearby.
By 1952, the average U.S. grocery stocked 4,000 items, a leap from
about 870 in 1928. By the mid-1960s, that number was up to 8,000
items.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies Home Journal'' Food Editor Poppy Cannon lent a hand
with her ``The New Can-Opener Cookbook.'' Canned, frozen and jarred
foods were still the cutting edge of technology.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath, something else was brewing. American men had
traveled, and although it wasn't under the best conditions, it
exposed them to a world of food beyond Mom's meatloaf and the
dinners of like-minded neighbors. And Americans were mobile in
their new cars, taking vacations and relocating for jobs away from
farms. That, too, led to exposure to new experiences and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   There was money for vacations, and that often meant money for
restaurant meals. Certainly, many of those restaurants were the
Howard Johnson's of the dining world, and certainly, few of them
were the restaurants of the elite _ Le Pavillon in New York, the
Pump Room in Chicago. But the average Joe was seeing the world, and
he was hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   Yessiree, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1950: Francis X. McNamara found himself unable to pay for a
restaurant meal in New York because he'd forgotten his money. This
spurred him to create Diners Club. For $3 a year, card holders
could charge their meals at any of 27 restaurants in the city. By
the end of 1951, more than $1 million had been charged on the new
cards.
</P>
<P>
   1950: The rest of America (outside of California, Hawaii _ then
a U.S. territory _ and Florida) starts catching on to using
avocados in salads.
</P>
<P>
   1951: ``I Love Lucy'' debuts on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   1951: The first Jack-in-the-Box opens in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   1951: Former Marine Glen Bell, 28, introduces the first
fast-food taco at his hamburger and hot dog stand in San
Bernardino, Calif. The town is home to orchards, railroad yards, an
Air Force base _ and the original and very popular McDonald's.
Bell, looking for a unique product, spots tacos at an area
restaurant. He comes up with a contraption that will hold tortillas
in hot oil to form the now-classic U-shaped taco shell _ enabling
him to pre-fry tortillas and offer fast Mexican fare.
</P>
<P>
   1951: S&AMP;H Green Stamps get their start at the Denver store chain
King Sooper.
</P>
<P>
   1952: Colonel Sanders sells the first Kentucky Fried Chicken
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   1952: Powdered nondairy coffee cream is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   1952: The Lipton food company rolls out a dehydrated onion soup
mix that will earn its fame as a base for onion dip _ 2 envelopes
of mix plus 1 cup sour cream. Lipton eventually prints the recipe,
``California dip,'' on the package.
</P>
<P>
   1952: Mrs. Paul's introduces fish sticks.
</P>
<P>
   1952: George Stephen, frustrated with barbecuing on an
open-broiler grill, decides to develop a better barbecue grill. He
works for a metal works in Chicago, so he has experience shaping
metal. His sales to friends and neighbors go so well that by the
end of the decade, he buys out the barbecue division of Weber
Brothers Metal Works and creates Weber-Stephen Products Co.
</P>
<P>
   1952: All things western are the rage, from coonskin hats to
cowboy-theme chenille bedspreads to Roy Rogers Family Restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   1953: Swift begins an aggressive program to develop a better
turkey. (Turkey has been marketed since 1900, but it's a dark,
chewy bird with tough tendons and a lot of pin feathers.) The
company, through the help of genetics, develops a broad-breasted
bird without the tough tendons and uses a hot-water bath to remove
feathers. The following year, the Butterball brand and the
self-basting turkey are introduced.

NIXON SPOOF RESIGNS ITS SATIRICAL MISSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two sweet, high-spirited teen-age girls bring a ray of sunshine
into a mean, lonely old man's life. Sounds like a Hallmark Hall of
Fame drama starring several of Melissa Joan Hart's younger sisters,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Except in the what-if comedy ``Dick,'' the mean, lonely old man
is Richard Nixon (Dan Hedaya). The two girls, played by the dimply
Kirsten Dunst and the equally dimply Michelle Williams, set into
motion events that lead Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein
(Bruce McCulloch) and Bob Woodward (Will Ferrell) into breaking the
Watergate story.
</P>
<P>
   The girls inadvertently bake marijuana into the cookies that
they bring to the president (''No wonder he's so paranoid,''
someone says) and stumble into the Watergate break-in while mailing
a fan letter to Bobby Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst and Williams are best friends who find a new pop icon,
Nixon, to replace Bobby Sherman. Before long, the fatherless
Williams is daydreaming of being Mrs. Richard Nixon. (She even
records a love rap to him on one of the tape recorders at the White
House, the beginning of a joke that explains the infamous 18
1/2-minute gap.)
</P>
<P>
   The sweetness of ``Dick'' comes from the innocent, unstinting
loyalty these two girls have to each other. You may end up wishing
more had been made of the loyalty theme, with the two girls
sticking with each other while everyone in the Nixon White House is
busy selling one another out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, director Fleming sets another tone, in which the
politics are unimportant _ presumably, because everyone already
knows the Nixon story. What he and his co-writer come up with is a
movie that fails as both character study and spectacle. It isn't
small enough, and it lacks grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ferrell and McCulloch, ``Dick'' is populated with
comic actors, including Teri Garr, Dave Foley, Jim Breuer, Harry
Shearer and Ana Gasteyer, who specialize in sketch comedy.
Unfortunately, ``Dick'' often plays like a sketch, with broad
moments _ several using the title for obvious jokes _ that don't
give the picture any momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A revisionist comedy about the fear and loathing simmering in
the Nixon administration is filled with potential. True, there are
a few funny moments. Ferrell's pettiness _ Bernstein's vain,
desperate presence sends him into a whining tizzy _ is funny here,
but he does the same thing every week on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's fatuous strutting _ he constantly throws his hair
back as if he were starring in a shampoo commercial _ is a
particularly smart idea from McCulloch. To its credit, ``Dick''
uses the Wood/Stein distaste for each other throughout; they never
soften into a hard-working pair, as they did in ``All the
President's Men.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Nixon White House has been the subject of satire ever
since he was elected to the office in 1968. Probably no politician
has been targeted as often as he, so there has to be more at stake,
even though ``Dick'' isn't about Nixon as much as it is about the
two girls, who are perfectly likable. That they're both so naive
makes them so indistinct they could be the same person (Williams is
the one who gets the puppy-love crush on Tricky Dick.)
</P>
<P>
   The period setting offers nothing beyond a '70s fashion show and
an excuse for a '70s soundtrack. With the lone exception of the
surprisingly effective use of Carly Simon's ``You're So Vain'' as
Nixon leaves in disgrace, ``Dick'' doesn't go far enough.

CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT, AD NAUSEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 8)  
 Commentary   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One year from now the Republicans will have chosen
their presidential nominee in Philadelphia and the Democrats will
be journeying to Los Angeles to select their standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it will be another 12 months before the anointed candidates
of the two parties are ready to begin slugging it out with each
other rather than with challengers within their own party. That is
when the real contest will begin.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, therefore, that the presidential campaign,
in its noisy and seemingly endless incipient stages, has spawned
cynicism in some Americans and boredom in others.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise began much too early. Nearly two years before
Election Day, when the successor to Bill Clinton will be chosen,
presidential hopefuls were lining up support, soliciting campaign
funds, polling voters, sharpening their arguments and preparing for
the battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Each has by now learned the basic lesson of the campaign: big
money is the great leveler. The candidates who do not have big
money are at a distinct disadvantage and probably will be forced to
bow out of the campaign early in the new year, if not before.
</P>
<P>
   One, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, has forsaken the
Republican Party to run for the presidency as an independent.
Another, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, has bowed out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose bank accounts are bulging with greenbacks are like
generals who have been allocated all the ammunition, artillery and
troops needed to fight a major battle. But big money alone does not
guarantee victory in a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher, is
spending as much of his own money as is necessary to make him a
serious contender for the Republican nomination. Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas had raised millions for his campaign even before he
began campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Although only two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, are vying for the nomination, each
has raked in millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   If the presidency can be bought, one of those four should take
up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But big money, for all its benefits, does not guarantee
capturing a party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors _ leadership, personality, intelligence and
persuasiveness _ also are important.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is cognizant of the fact that millions of dollars alone
cannot win him the GOP nomination. The last two of his fellow Texas
Republicans _ John Connally in 1980 and Phil Gramm in 1996 _ to
seek the party's nomination were wallowing in money, but it wasn't
enough to assure them the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After squandering a fortune, Connally, the former Democratic
governor of the Lone Star state who became a Republican after
serving as Richard Nixon's treasury secretary, found that lavish
spending only won him only one delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, also a former Democrat, was able to parlay his money into
a tie with Bob Dole for first place in the quadrennial Iowa straw
poll in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But while Dole won the party's nomination, Gramm fell from
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes likewise had a vast fortune to toss into the campaign in
1996 but found it wasn't enough to beat Dole.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, progressives and populists urged that
presidential nominees be chosen by the people in primary elections
rather than by political bosses in hotel rooms reeking of cigar
smoke and bourbon. It was a noble idea.
</P>
<P>
   But in the intervening years, much has changed. Television and
jet travel have made running for president, primary after primary,
a very costly venture.
</P>
<P>
   The days when a William McKinley or a Warren Harding could sit
on his front porch in Ohio and let the voters come to his home to
hear him ``bloviate'' (Harding's word for florid political oratory)
are long past. So are the days when an Adlai Stevenson could win
his party's nomination after declining to declare his candidacy
until delegates to the 1952 Democratic convention had begun
assembling in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, 1952, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower did not
officially announce his candidacy until he had resigned his
commission and his role as supreme commander of NATO on June 1. But
even while he was in uniform, his name was entered in the New
Hampshire primary where he defeated Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio,
the pillar of Republican conservatism and isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   Under today's system, with many of the major primaries falling
prior to the ides of March, a candidate can't wait as long as
Stevenson and Eisenhower did to declare his or her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, there is speculation that some popular figure _
a general, a statesman, an industrialist _ will make a last-minute
entry into the race and stampede the convention. But it never
happens because it can't happen. The candidate who wins the
primaries wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There probably is no way to change the system that now tends to
anesthetize voters months before they actually select a president.
Each state has a right to set the date for its primary election and
the Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to overhaul campaign spending are made each year in
Congress, but the ruling Republican hierarchy wants no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   So we will just have to resign ourselves to seeing the same
faces saying the same things night after night on television month
after monotonous month.
</P>
<P>
   That is democracy in action.

<P>
   Steeped in seedy, cross-cultural voodoo and the sorrow of a lost
way of life, N'awlins has roots stretching back to Napoleon's
attempt at a new world order. To this day, the Big Easy stands for
a long-lost way of life full of magnolia mystery and genteel
depravity, the magnificent biblical inevitability of civilizations
afflicted with hubris, doomed to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too. New Orleans remains a delightful anachronism in
a country beset by cultural uniformity and corporate branding. You
want McDonald's? Not a problem: New Orleans happily caters to
trepidatious conventioneers and casual visitors alike. Want a
genuine Cajun witch, replete with spooky incantations and bags of
bones, to cast a spell on your unfaithful wife? Better yet, on her
shifty-eyed lover? This hyar's the place, y'all.
</P>
<P>
   And once you've taken your revenge against life's inevitable
betrayals, why not settle down at Felix's with a dozen freshly
shelled, icy oysters and order up a Dixie beer? The delightfully
anachronistic green and white paper label, with ``DIXIE'' in proud,
bold lettering, says it all: ``Slow-brewed, purity, pride, aged in
Louisiana cypress wood barrels, brewing since 1907.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't stop there. After a half-dozen oysters, move up to
Dixie Blackened Voodoo, the latest Louisiana bad boy. Dixie is a
pretty basic American lager, with a decent malty palate, but Voodoo
is darker and maltier, although not nearly as rich as the color and
the name might make you believe. But hey, when you're kickin' back
in the French Quarter, who really cares?
</P>
<P>
   Is Dixie good beer? Yes. Is it great beer? No. Would I drink it
all the time? No. Would I drink it on a weekend bender in New
Orleans, along with eats at Felix's and Commander's Palace and
Galatoire's? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable question arises: In a world of conglomerates, who
really brews this stuff? Wish I could tell you: Web site-wise, I
noticed that Heileman's owned Dixie a few years back, then sold off
various brand names like Lone Star and Pearl, to Stroh. Pabst then
bought up the Stroh line and other venerable brands, but I couldn't
find a trace of Dixie. I assume Pabst owns it, but frankly, I don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

PC 101: SOME TIPS FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Back-to-school checklist:
</P>
<P>
   Tattoo? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Piercing of unusual body part(s)? Check, check.
</P>
<P>
   Computer? (Choke.)
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that some people agonize much more over the choice of
a new computer, which they know will be obsolete in a few years,
than they do over getting a tattoo that they will wear until it is
obscured by liver spots?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is because so often it is the parents who do the
agonizing. Computers are easier to use than they used to be, but
they are still confusing. They are cheaper than they used to be,
but they still cost a lot, especially on top of a tuition payment.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it is because parents are getting the message that it
is increasingly difficult to succeed in college without a computer.
``I don't see how anyone could get a degree from us without having
access to a computer,'' said David Cook, manager of training
services at the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At a growing number of campuses, students need a computer to
register for classes, get class assignments, file homework and
handle other administrative chores, as well as to do research. In
some classes, the first assignment is to send an electronic-mail
message to the instructor, because all future course work will be
done electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But some students may be able to get by without having to buy a
computer. Many larger schools offer students free access to
computers on campus, which is less convenient but less expensive
than buying a PC of one's own. For students short on cash, it may
make sense to wait a semester to see if it is possible to succeed
on borrowed machines.
</P>
<P>
   For those fortunate enough to be able to afford a personal
computer, and even for those who already have one at home,
decisions abound.
</P>
<P>
   The first big decision is whether to buy the computer before
heading off to school or to wait until the student is settled into
the school routine. My strong advice would be to wait, for several
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the school, or more likely a specific department or
discipline within the school, may recommend a particular type of
computer. At Dartmouth College, for example, both Windows and
Macintosh computers are supported, but incoming freshmen who do not
have a strong preference are urged to buy Apple Macintoshes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Windows-based computers are increasingly preferred in
engineering, science and business classes, and the school
recommends Dell computers for those students, said Larry Levine,
Dartmouth's director of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the requirements are even more specific: graduate
business students at the University of Texas are urged to buy IBM
Thinkpad 600E laptops, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many schools sell computers, software and peripherals to
students at attractive discounts, sometimes hundreds of dollars
below the prices at local computer stores. In some cases, the
computers also come with special bundles of software that are
recommended by the school.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the cost of the computer is the same as one could find
at an Internet discounter, the value of the software may give the
school an advantage. A school may create a standard around a
particular brand of software _ Texas, for example, offers special
deals on Microsoft products _ which means the student could be at a
disadvantage if another program has been bought before leaving
home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the schools sell computers loaded with special
software needed to connect to the campus network. Or, the student
may buy an antivirus program, only to find that the school offers
the same program free.
</P>
<P>
   Another basic decision is whether to get a desktop computer or a
portable computer. Desktop machines are cheaper. On the other hand,
most dorm room desks are small, and a portable will give the
student more usable desk space.
</P>
<P>
   Portables have a much higher coolness quotient than desktop
machines, and students will argue that they will take better notes
in class and at the library with a portable PC.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, most classes lack convenient power
outlets, batteries are rarely good for more than one lecture at a
time, and students will quickly grow weary of lugging a seven-pound
paperweight around in their backpacks the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Portable computers are also much easier to steal, drop, forget
or otherwise abuse. If you do choose a portable, make sure you have
insurance and a good security cable. Many homeowner's insurance
policies cover the loss or destruction of a child's computer at
college, but some do not.
</P>
<P>
   Most portable PCs have a standard slot for attaching a security
cable, which can then be looped through a desk leg or other heavy
object and locked. My favorite is the Kensington Master Lock
Notebook Security Cable ($39.95).
</P>
<P>
   What about all the ``free PCs'' we have been reading about?
America Online's Compuserve division, for example, offers a $400
rebate on any computer if the buyer agrees to pay $21.95 a month
for the next three years for Internet access. Since some computers
today cost less than $500, the rebate makes the computer even
cheaper than a pair of fancy sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies are offering similar free or low-cost
computer deals, almost always in conjunction with a long-term
Internet service contract.
</P>
<P>
   I think these free-PC deals are a bad deal for students for a
number of reasons. Many schools offer students free access to both
the Internet and to a campus network, where course materials and
administrative services are made available.
</P>
<P>
   So the student would end up paying more than $700 to Compuserve
for a service that is, at best, redundant. Some schools do not
permit students to gain access to the campus network through an
outside Internet service provider, or they restrict some parts of
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Also, many dorm rooms and other campus buildings offer
high-speed network connections that are vastly more efficient than
the dial-up modem connections offered by commercial ISPs.
Downloading a music file on a campus network takes just a few
seconds, for example, but a virtual eternity through a dial-up
account.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of advice: Most students are much more likely than
their computers to make it through four years of college. Buying
the most expensive and most advanced computer today is not a
guarantee that it will still be useful when the Class of 2003
graduates. Plan to upgrade or replace the computer in two or three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, urge your children to study computer science, and
maybe they will launch an Internet company in their dorm room, get
filthy rich and buy you a computer.

   Getting Icons Off the Screen
</P>
<P>
   Q. AOL's Instant Messenger program automatically installed
itself when I upgraded my Netscape browser. How can I remove the
icon for it from my PC's taskbar?
</P>
<P>
   A. America Online's Instant Messenger, or AIM, started out as a
personalized, private chat program for AOL users. It is now a free,
stand-alone application that Macintosh and PC owners can use for
Internet chat, even if they are not AOL members.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what platform you use, the icon for the program
will usually show up as a small, walking yellow figure and can be
found in the PC's System Tray or the Mac's menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   If you have installed a new Netscape browser and have decided
not to use the AIM program (or want to get rid of screen prompts
that ask you to sign on or register), click on the Setup button on
the Sign On screen. Go to the tab marked ``Misc.'' and uncheck the
box next to ``Start Netscape AIM when Windows starts.''
</P>
<P>
   If you use a Macintosh and don't want to see the AIM icon in the
menu bar, click on the Setup button, and under the General
category, uncheck the box next to ``Show utility menu in the menu
bar at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   On either platform, restart the computer after unchecking the
appropriate box. This should remove the AIM icon from sight, and if
you decide later that you want to try the program, it is still on
your machine and can be opened manually.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ground with a steep pitch or slope can become a problem area if
it is often eroded by runoff water from heavy rains. One way to
contain the erosion is by leveling the slope with a terrace, then
building a retaining wall to hold back the earth at the edge of the
terrace. Retaining walls must be strong to hold back the pressure
of the earth and water behind them. They may be built of stone,
poured concrete, concrete block or rot-resistant lumber. Do-it-
yourselfers will find it easier to build a retaining wall of either
stone or rot-resistant lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is a relatively cheap building material, if you have an
abundant source of natural stone on your property.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, homeowners may find it easier to build the wall with
rot-resistant lumber, which falls into two categories. The first is
wood with natural resistance to rot, such as Cedar and redwood,
which have natural organic oils and resins within the wood cells
that resist decay. The second, less expensive option is
pressure-treated landscape timbers ( railroad ties are ideal).
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated lumber is impregnated with chemicals that make
the wood impervious to rot. Manufacturers and government agencies
claim that the chemicals in pressure-treated lumber do not pose any
threat to the environment, but some environmentalists disagree with
these claims and feel that more testing is required. Whatever type
of lumber you choose, it should be thick at least eight inches
square in cross section and four to six feet long.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning the project, check the local building codes to
see if a permit is required or if there are any building
restrictions. Many codes require you to obtain a permit for any
retaining wall more than four feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Start by defining the area that you want to grade. Use stakes
and stretched cord to establish the dimensions of the wall, then
excavate the hill to create a vertical earthen wall with a slight
backward slope. Next, dig a trench about eight inches deep along
the base of the wall. The trench will anchor the base of the
retaining wall in place. You can place the first layer of timbers
directly on the ground in the trench, but it is better to lay down
a two-inch thick layer of coarse stone or gravel first. This will
provide a path for rain and ground water to drain away from the
wood.
</P>
<P>
   Place the first course of timbers on the stone base. Dropping a
heavy timber on your foot can cause a serious injury, so protect
your feet by wearing work boots that have steel-reinforced toes.
Also wear heavy-duty work gloves to protect your hands from
splinters when handling the wood.
</P>
<P>
   Once the first course of timbers are in place, you can start
building the second. These timbers must be secured to the base
course with barn spikes. Barn spikes (also called log home spikes)
are about 8-inches deep large nails, available in 8- or 12-inch
lengths, with either a bright steel or zinc-coated finish. Use
zinc-coated spikes because they resist rusting.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a dealer who stocks the building timbers also carries
barn spikes; if not, you can write to; Maze Nails, Dept. FH, Peru,
Ill. 61354 to find the name of the nearest dealer. You will need a
heavy sledgehammer to drive the spikes through the thick wood. The
job will be easier, however, if you drill pilot holes first.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to stack rows of timbers until the wall reaches the
terrace. Be sure to secure each timber with barn spikes. Some of
the timbers are bound to be too long. The easiest way to cut them
is with a chain saw. You can rent one for this, but be sure you
understand how to use this tool before making any cuts. Another way
to cut thick landscape timbers is with a circular saw. This saw
cannot cut through the wood on one pass. You have to set the blade
for a deep cut and cut around the four sides. Whichever saw you
work with, be sure to wear appropriate safety gear when operating
it.
</P>
<P>
   A well-constructed retaining wall could still tip forward as the
ground pressure increases. The way to prevent this is by installing
a ''dead man.'' A dead man is made of two pieces of landscaping
timber in the form of a cross. The first piece is nailed to the
retaining wall timbers and extends at a right angle directly into
the earth behind. Another piece is nailed across the end of the
first piece. Both pieces are buried in the earth so they can anchor
the retaining the wall and help it to resist the outward pressure
of the earth.

REUNION WEB SITES ON INTERNET STRENGTHEN OLD SCHOOL TIES

<P>
   Living in London, Carolyn Band Mehta did not attend her 20th
high school reunion in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Internet, though, she stumbled across her reunion
Web site. It was almost as good as the real reunion _ in some ways,
even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Ms. Mehta, who graduated in 1978 from
Newton South High School, outside of Boston. ``I made it a favorite
site. I read every single entry. It was the perfect medium for a
reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, www.nshs78.org, was set up by a classmate, Charles
Strange, who runs a computer business. One day he received an
e-mail message from the reunion chairwoman, Lily Chou, who was
doing an Internet search to turn up lost classmates. The two
decided to create a Web site for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   They put up a message board, a list of ``lost people,'' a
directory of e-mail addresses and a link to the school newspaper.
After the reunion, held last October, they added photographs, a
post-party message board, and a transcript of the E-reunion _ a
live chat session held during the reunion so that people there
could communicate with those who couldn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Strange was not able to go. But he was on his
computer for more than five hours that evening, as the host for the
E-reunion from his home in Tampa, Fla., while about a dozen people
logged in from as far away as California to write things like,
``Whatever happened to ...'' and ``I always had a crush on ...''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of schools and colleges have Web sites, many of which
include an alumni page or some basic information on upcoming
reunions. Several sites purport to let people look up their
classmates by state, city and high school, but these tend to come
up practically empty.
</P>
<P>
   There are few of the less formal sites, like the Newton South
site, but it may be that these slapdash, homegrown endeavors are
the ones that strike the deepest chords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was completely accidental,'' said Strange. ``Its success
was not a function of anybody sitting around planning. It's not
high gloss. There are no graphics on this thing. The pictures are
non-professional. If you didn't go to Newton South, it's a
meaningless site.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site with a serendipitous origin was set up for the
class of 1979 at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas, which held its
20th reunion in late June. A few years ago, Lorri Crossno Nevil, a
Web designer, bumped into her class president, Bucky Eacret, at Six
Flags Over Texas. They talked about the forthcoming reunion, and
Ms. Nevil suggested hosting a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It began as a message board and evolved into a planning tool.
Finding missing classmates no longer necessitated hefty postage
costs or long-distance phone calls to people's parents. Ms. Nevil
had hoped to set up a Web cam to broadcast the reunion live over
the Internet, but decided it was too technologically complex.
``Maybe for the 25th,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bryan Adams site, at www.bryanadams-hs.org, includes a
section for lost people, directions to the reunion hotel, a list of
attendees, a way to send E-greetings to classmates, and a selection
of 1970s background music. ``May the force be with you,'' the home
page intones. (Star Wars was hot at the time.)
</P>
<P>
   The reunion committee did most of its planning on line, with
software to allow conferencing. ``The meetings were really
effective,'' said Camille Shipes Garner, the reunion's chairwoman.
``You didn't have to pick a place and worry about a babysitter. It
was a lot of `Let me go and put my child to bed and I'll come back
on line.' The meetings ended up going four or five hours, and
people would just come in and out as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garner herself took full advantage of the board. When she
asked whether anyone could lend the reunion a karaoke machine, a
classmate responded within hours, offering hers.
</P>
<P>
   At the reunion, the organizers collected up-to-date e-mail
addresses and took pictures with digital cameras. These are now up
on the site, protected by a password. Nevil plans to add captions.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Adams High School, like Newton South, ran an E-reunion. It
had its share of technical problems. A router wasn't working.
Somebody stepped on the phone line and disconnected it. People had
been looking forward to typing to a classmate who lives in Africa
but, because of electrical and time-zone problems, she never made
it to the E-reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Nevil received universal accolades for her effort.
``About 20 people said to me if it hadn't been for the Web site,
they probably wouldn't have come,'' she said. ``They said, `When I
saw so-and-so was going to be there, I decided I was coming,
too.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even as such Web sites foster more participation, they have
the curious ability to let people partake of their reunion without
actually going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a voyeur at your own reunion,'' said Ms. Mehta of
Newton South. ``A lot of people don't want anyone to know what they
look like now. You can hear what other people are doing without
letting them know what you are. You could never hide like that
before.''

 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fashionistas are on the move, this time to a
neighborhood so anonymous it hardly has a name. On the maps in city
taxis that show Manhattan neighborhoods _ Chelsea, Greenwich
Village, the Upper East Side _ this area is conspicuously gray.
Historically minded people may refer to it as Rosehill, after an
18th-century farm belonging to John Watts, a Tory sympathizer, that
covered roughly the same acreage. George Trescher, a fund-raiser
who lives in the area, calls it Curry Hill, because of the many
Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants. Others call it NoMad, for north
of Madison Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood, which extends from 23rd Street to 34th Street,
between Madison Avenue and Second Avenue, possesses history.
Stanford White designed the Madison Square Garden that once stood
on Madison Avenue at 26th Street. (In 1906, he also died there,
shot on the roof garden by the husband of Evelyn Nesbit, the
showgirl who was his lover.) Herman Melville wrote ``Billy Budd''
at 104 E. 26th St.. The 69th Regiment Armory, at Lexington Avenue
and 26th Street, was the site of the scandalous 1913 Armory Show,
where Marcel Duchamp showed ``Nude Descending a Staircase,'' and
which introduced Picasso, Cezanne and Matisse to this country. (``A
bunch of lunatics,'' Theodore Roosevelt called the European
artists.) To the average New Yorker, though, the neighborhood is
unnamed, unmemorable.
</P>
<P>
   To its newest residents _ who include Marin Hopper, the fashion
director of Elle magazine, and John Bartlett, a fashion designer _
it's NoMad. Six months ago, Jason Weisenfeld, a vice president of
Barneys, and Greg Winkelman, a vice president of Tommy Hilfiger,
bought an apartment there. Antonio Prieto, an of-the-moment
hairstylist, and Eva Lowell, an apprentice jewelry designer, moved
into a place last month. Hamish Bowles, the European editor at
large for Vogue magazine, is looking in NoMad.
</P>
<P>
   What brings the fashionable folk to an unfashionable
neighborhood, where an occasional prostitute still hovers around
the corner of Lexington and 27th Street? (At least the prostitutes
are chatty, Weisenfeld said. ``It's always nice,'' he said, ``to
come home late and get a compliment: `Love your shoes!''')
</P>
<P>
   What the fashion set has discovered is the real estate
equivalent of a sample sale, in an enclave that Peter Lobo, a
deputy director of the City Planning Department, called ``primarily
middle-class.'' In an area where the last census found a per capita
income of $38,590, co-ops, condos, and rentals are about two-thirds
the price of those in the West Village, SoHo or TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   At 140 E. 28th St., a co-op building, owners have the real
estate equivalent of an Armani suit at a discount. For the
label-conscious, this 1931 structure is a Bing &AMP; Bing building,
which places it among the city's finest prewar properties,
according to real estate agents. A 900-square-foot one-bedroom
apartment sells for around $300,000, said Nathaniel Siegel, a
broker with Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, who found co-ops in the
building for Messrs. Bartlett, Weisenfeld and Prieto. An identical
layout at 45 Christopher St., also a Bing &AMP; Bing building, is
$500,000, Siegel said. He sighed, then murmured, ``I almost don't
want to tell anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of Bing &AMP; Bing, a real-estate company founded in
1906, put money into each apartment ``because they wanted it to
last for the least amount of maintenance,'' said Christopher Gray,
director of the Office for Metropolitan History, a research company
in Manhattan. Many apartments have 20-foot-long living rooms with
working fireplaces and coat closets with built-in umbrella stands,
a tray for keys and a mirror inside the door.
</P>
<P>
   Lofts are being noticed, too. Last month, Mitchell Speer, a
broker at William B. May, sold a 2,000-square-foot loft at 117 E.
24th St. to Antony Nagelmann, a photographer, and his wife, Helen
Faraday-Young, a fashion designer, for $700,000. ``A
2,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa or Greenwich Village would sell
for $800,000 to $1 million,'' Speer said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To the fashion set, NoMad has splendors besides affordable rents
and purchase prices. For Ms. Hopper, who lived in West Village
apartments until two years ago, NoMad possesses secret treasures.
First, there is the 2,700-square-foot 1910 town house that she
rents for around $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a house,'' she said as she scampered around in
delicate turquoise mules with hand-beaded red and white straps. ``I
wanted to entertain designers, people in the industry, friends.'' A
diffuse golden light spilled through the the floor-to-ceiling
windows on the first floor. On the pale cream walls were identical
French mirrors, flanked by cream-colored silk Fortuny lamps shaped
like cones.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The second floor has double living rooms, each with a fireplace
and each furnished with a melange of mid-century modern chairs by
Alvar Aalto and Hans Wegner, some woven of leather, some made of
bentwood, all inviting languor. Every room has at least one mirror,
usually antiqued so the reflected light shimmers but doesn't
dazzle. The bedrooms are on the third floor. Throughout, the
original floorboards are wide and burnished _ balm for bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, on a hot summer day, the city vanishes. Shade trees
shelter the front of the house; ivy tumbles down brick walls in
back.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To hear Ms. Hopper talk about her neighborhood is to hear a
rhapsody on food. Todaro Brothers, on Second Avenue near 30th
Street, inspired a shopping litany: ``Amazing cheese, fresh fish,
great roast chicken, fantastic bread and spiced tuna which I love,
from Spain!'' Enthralled by the tuna$ she ran to the kitchen and
darted back, holding a glass jar as if it were a jewel. ``Ormaze
white meat tuna,'' she said. ``The most delicious tuna _ in a glass
bottle.''

</P>
<P>
   Kalustyan's, a Middle Eastern food shop on Lexington Avenue near
28th Street, elicited another squeal of joy: ``It makes the best
falafel!''
</P>
<P>
   And the restaurants. ``I love I Trulli, I love Tabla, I love Les
Halles, which has great meat and a great free-range turkey for
Thanksgiving,'' Ms. Hopper said. ``I order it to cook myself. It's
the most juicy, amazing turkey, and they'll even make the gravy for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants of such variety as Pongal, which serves vegetarian
Indian dishes, and Eleven Madison Park are no small part of the
allure of NoMad. Park Bistro got there in 1989, and Les Halles in
1991, but Trescher, who has lived at 111 Lexington for 10 years,
put it succinctly: ``God bless Danny Meyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Meyer, a co-owner of Union Square Cafe and Gramercy
Tavern, opened Tabla and Eleven Madison Park. He chose the
neighborhood for the same reason others want to live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's green space, in this case Madison Square Park,'' he
said. ``There is gorgeous historic architecture, and the rents are
below value compared with the rest of the city. If you were trying
to get a retail space on Union Square Park today, you'd be paying
$80 to $90 per square foot, and around Madison Square Park it's
closer to $40 to $50 a square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a neighborhood that is slowly gentrifying. The City Parks
Foundation, a nonprofit group devoted to restoring parks, has
raised $2.5 million for projects in Madison Square Park. Statues
will be cleaned and waxed, more benches will be installed, and what
is mud will become grass. Meyer contributed $60,000 toward the
foundation's $6 million goal.
</P>
<P>
   As in any area with an influx of upscale homesteaders, there are
conflicts. The men's shelter at 29th Street and First Avenue is a
cause of complaint from some residents, said Stuart Osnow,
president of the Rosehill Community Association. ``That leaves a
lot of people hanging around the neighborhood,'' he said. He is
also badgered about trash on the streets. ``If you go to Murray
Hill, the streets are spotless, but here they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, for one, likes being anonymous in an anonymous
neighborhood. ``It's not chic, it's not high-end, there's no draw
here,'' he said. ``In the Village, it was very social. I'd walk
out, and there'd always be someone I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he and Mark Welsh, a writer, drew up a wish list
of the perfect apartment: top floor, terrace, fireplace. Months
later, they moved from a rental place at Fifth Avenue and 10th
Street to a penthouse at 140 E. 28th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In homage to the neighborhood, they and their interior designer,
Alan Tanksley, painted the walls the warm, muted yellow of curry.
The apartment is furnished with low-slung seating, without a single
straight-backed chair in sight. In the glass-covered greenhouse
that extends off the living room, cushions surround a hammered
copper table. This year, they asked Eric Walton, an American
designer who lives in London, to create a Japanese-style terrace,
where a bamboo teahouse is set on a path of pearly beige stones
bordered by larger black river stones. A tiny grove of bamboo trees
is clustered in a corner. Sweetie, their black, tan and wite
mongrel, uses the meticulously designed terrace as a dog run, her
paws clattering on the pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where you live,'' Welsh said. ``It's how you live.''
</P>
<P>
   If they need a design consultation, Tanksley is a few blocks
away, in his 17th-floor aerie at 88 Lexington Ave. He pays $1,800 a
month for a 600-square-foot corner apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have big sky,'' Tanksley said. ``Straight out my window is
the golden crown of the New York Life Insurance building, and
golden light bathes this space at night. South is the World Trade
Center. From one corner, I see the Empire State Building, and each
night, I do a ritualistic good night to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State isn't the only building rising above the
neighborhood. The Madison Belvedere, a luxUry apartment building at
10 E. 29th St. that says it is ``just off Fifth Avenue,'' begins
accepting occupants in October. Studios of 443 to 609 square feet
are renting for $1,820, one-bedroom apartments of 583 square feet
for $2,345, and two-bedroom apartments of 833 square feet for
$3,054, said Jackie Dixon, a secretary in the rental office. Last
month, 25 of the 400 units were rented.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Belvedere bulking large, the neighborhood has a
sense of community and shopkeepers who provide old-fashioned
courtesies.
</P>
<P>
   At Gurell Hardware and Supply Co., a 30-year-old family-run
shop, Arthur Greebler takes deliveries for his neighbors. ``I
accept UPS, Fed Ex,'' said Greebler, a lawyer who took over the
business when his father died. When a customer needs him as a
notary public, he doesn't charge a fee. ``He takes house
accounts,'' Weisenfeld said. ``How genius is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Greebler has heard that the neighborhood is getting more
fashionable. ``There's a rumor that Heidi Klum, the bikini model,
moved in,'' he confided. ``The UPS guy said he delivered something
to her.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 18-year-old Eamon Walsh and two of his high school friends
get together, they chat about summer concerts, the heat and _ more
often than not _ their marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rising at noon and heading to the pool, Walsh backs
his car out of the driveway before 7 a.m., picks up his friends _
Tamara Metz, 18, and Thomas Purtell, 17 _ and heads to work at
Evolve, an Internet company in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Evolve hired the students to create a company to market a new
piece of software that allows users in different locations to work
on one document at the same time. In August, Evolve is sending them
to England for a week, all expenses paid, to learn from other
companies. ``We thought that was pretty cool,'' Ms. Metz said.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work, if you can get it. Yet, Walsh and his friends are
hardly the only teen-agers with computer skills to take summer jobs
that often come with an hourly wage well over the federal minimum
and lavish perks.
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, computer-savvy students in high school or
their first few years of college are landing summer jobs that look
a lot like professional, full-time employment. Some are making
enough money to cover most of their tuition at private colleges.
Others are receiving signing bonuses simply for accepting summer
employment. Many are treated to lavish parties, weekend outings and
offices of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, the pool of students that companies look at is
creeping back, is becoming younger,'' said Mark Oldman, co-founder
of Vaultreports.com, an online publisher of internship and job
information. Companies are desperately seeking young people who
know their way around computers, Oldman said, and they know they
are missing out on talent if they focus only on college juniors and
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the students receive job offers before they even
start looking for them, receive raises before the summer is over
and are asked to stay on part time throughout the fall and winter.
Some are taking home more money than they know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mostly just sticking it in a mutual fund now,'' said Xan
Charbonnet, 18, who has been working at Vtel, a digital
video-conferencing company in Austin, Texas, for the last two
summers.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has emerged over the last few years, employers
say, as Internet start-up companies have proliferated and
established software and hardware companies have grown. Finding
enough people to do the technical work _ whether it is programming
or network administration _ has become a primary concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if they have a high-school diploma or a
college degree,'' said Raj Goel, chief technology officer at Brain
Link, an Internet-service provider in Queens. ``It just depends on
whether they have the skill sets and the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If the students work out, many employers say, the risk of hiring
such unproven workers can be well worth it. Teen-agers generally
accept less pay than college juniors or seniors or graduates, yet
are often able to do the same work.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the 20-somethings with computer skills are often not
available, employers say: they are either starting their own
companies, looking for an equity stake, or have already priced
themselves out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, teen-agers are a bargain. Walsh's wage, $8 an hour,
is at the low end for some summer positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting paid a lot of money because the company is
helping us start up our company and letting us go with it,'' he
said. ``There's another high schooler here who makes $12 an hour
doing HTML,'' the code behind Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Some students have fared even better. When Brain Link, for
example, hired Tugrul Galatali, a 1999 graduate of Stuyvesant High
School in New York, and Jason Lee, a Stuyvesant senior, it agreed
to pay them enough to cover a substantial share of their first
year's college tuition. For Galatali, the total will come to about
$7,000 this summer. With the $10,000 scholarship that he has
already won, his tuition at New York University will be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Goel, his supervisor, said he is more than willing to offer good
money for ``true geeks'' _ people who ``breathe computers,''
instead of those who haVe decided to take a battery of college
computer classes because they were told to do so. He is a fan, he
said, of those who ``haven't gotten their heads screwed up by
useless classes in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is legendary among computer-programming interns for
its pay. The company will not disclose how much it offers, but
former interns report the pay to be between $6,000 and $10,000 for
the summer, depending on experience.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, potential interns are first interviewed on campus,
then flown out to Redmond, Wash. for follow-up discussions. They
are encouraged to make the trip into a weekend getaway, with their
rental car, meals and lodging covered. Once an intern is hired, the
company helps pay for some housing and rental-car costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in a pretty privileged environment,'' said Nolan Myers,
a Microsoft intern who is a junior at Harvard University.
``Inasmuch as I've seen, this is pretty much standard for technical
positions right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For some teen-agers, the perks of a technology-related summer
job can outweigh the pay.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fabian, 16, and Shamarrah Broadus, 18, both have their own
offices with windows overlooking Wall Street. They work at
Marketing Technologies Group, a small software-training company in
Manhattan's so-called Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is amazed'' said Fabian, a junior at Washington
Irving High School in Manhattan, sounding pretty amazed himself.
</P>
<P>
   At Intel, the chip-maker based in Santa Clara, Calif., interns
receive health insurance and vacation days. At Microsoft, interns
rave about what one called Barbecues with Bill G. _ informal
dinners at the sprawling, waterfront home of Bill Gates,
Microsoft's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The other lure of the internships, of course, is real business
experience. Unlike interns in other industries, who might spend
their summers filling coffee urns, high-tech employees are expected
to work, no matter what their age.
</P>
<P>
   17-year-old Alex Pakhomov, for example, is responsible for sales
and marketing at Mondosoft, a New York start-up company that
develops search-engine technology. A month ago, Pakhomov was one of
four Mondosoft representatives sitting around a conference table
during a sales meeting with Random House, the publishing company.
Sandy McCarron, director of online production for Random House,
said she was hardly fazed by his presence. ``Frankly, with all
these young programmers we have here, I didn't even notice that he
was an intern,'' Ms. McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring teen-agers _ who, whatever their skills, cannot be
expected to have fully matured _ for positions of responsibility
does pose risks. At Barnes Wentworth, a network and engineering
company in Manhattan, one teen-ager became more of an embarrassment
than an asset after falling asleep during a meeting with a client.
The client took a picture of the snoozing teen-ager, posted it on
an internal Web site and then sent the student's supervisor a link
to the site via e-mail. Maia Aron, Barnes Wentworth's company's
chief operating officer, fired him soon after.
</P>
<P>
   But even that experience has not kept Ms. Aron from hiring other
young people. She gave a raise to another summer employee, Calvin
Tan, 16, after finding out that the student she had fired easily
got another job at a higher salary. ``We were outraged,'' she said.
``We asked Calvin, `That kid is making more than you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students given valuable internships have been the
beneficiaries of advanced high-school programs or internship
programs coordinated by industry associations.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and his friends learned most of their software-programming
skills at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology
in Fairfax, Va., and got their jobs with Evolve after winning a
contest that the company sponsored last spring.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Many students in New York got their internships through the New
York New Media Association, a nonprofit group designed to provide
professional services to local Internet companies. The group
started its internship program last year, directing technologically
proficient students to Silicon Alley companies. It has placed
nearly 80 students this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has taken advantage of the program is
Doubleclick, an online advertising firm. ``It is so incredibly
competitive out there,'' said Laura Ianuly, Doubleclick's vice
president of human resources. ``People know they can walk across
the street and get another job at the competition in an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ianuly said she sees the company's interns as prospects for
permanent employment _ and tries to make it worth their while to
stay and then come back next year. Many of Doubleclick's interns,
who this year are all college students, get signing bonuses of
$2,000 to cover relocation to New York. And an additional bonus of
several thousand dollars may land in their laps by the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will evaluate our summer interns and be bonusing our top
performers,'' Ms. Ianuly said.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies do not even wait until the next year: they ask
the teen-agers to stay on through the fall and winter, working
part-time after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies keep the kids, they don't want to get rid of
them,'' said Ted Nellen, a teacher of a class called Cyber English
at Murry Bergtraum High School in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the rare stories of the teen-agers who, by
summer's end, are offered lucrative full-time jobs without even
stepping foot in college.
</P>
<P>
   One such student is Ariye Shater, a graduate of the High School
of Telecommunications, Arts and Technology, in Brooklyn. Shater was
offered a full-time job at a company in Forest Hills, Media Linx,
after working there last summer. At age 18, Shater said, he was
offered a salary of more than $50,000 a year, if he would forgo
college and stay on as a full-timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tempting,'' Shater said. ``My parents weren't
happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   They were relieved, he said, when he chose to go to college,
instead, at the State University of New York at Stonybrook. He has
continued to work for Media Linx part time, telecommuting from his
dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, many companies would happily settle for that.
Even part-time high school students are in demand. Just a few weeks
ago, Nellen, the Bronx high school teacher, said, he received an
e-mail request from an internship program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't fill the spaces,'' the note said. ``Do you have any
other kids on your end?''
</P>
<P>
   Don Hyatt is a 52-year-old high-school teacher, but lately his
job is starting to resemble that of a high-powered sports agent. He
gets phone calls from some scouts looking for fresh talent. He gets
e-mail from others hoping to tap into his contacts. He has parents
coming to him for advice.
</P>
<P>
   No, he's not his school's basketball coach; he teaches computer
science at the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and
Technology in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The public school is known for its aggressive recruiting of
students and its advanced courses in, among other subjects,
artificial intelligence, computer architecture and supercomputer
applications. Hyatt often gets calls from executives at Internet
and computer companies that have job openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get quite a few phone calls,'' he said last week. In the
last school year, nine of his students earned credit toward an
independent-study course by working for high-tech firms, Hyatt
said, ``but I could have placed three times that many.''
</P>
<P>
   He also coaches teams of students for national technology
contests; he is coaching 23 of them this summer alone. His teams
are often finalists or grand-prize winners _ and as coach, he has
personally reaped more than $14,000 in reward money, which he has
donated to the school for technology upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   One team won a $1-million supercomputer in 1988 that became part
of Thomas Jefferson's computer laboratory. Another will spend a
week in England this summer as one of the rewards for winning a
contest sponsored by an Internet company called Evolve. The company
is also paying for Hyatt to accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-science teachers at other high schools also offer a
channel to high-tech jobs. Mike Zamansky, a teacher at Stuyvesant
High School in New York City, has opened what he called ``a little
pipeline to Goldman Sachs.'' Nearly half a dozen of his students
are working as technology interns at the Wall Street investment
house. At school they are referred to as ``Zamansky's Geek Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Nellen, a teacher at Murry Bergtraum High School in the
Bronx, has contacts at several companies in the area of New York
known as Silicon Alley. He teaches English, not computer science,
but his class focuses on publishing Web pages and using the
Internet for research.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, Nellen said, have offered his students salaries
of $40,000 to $50,000 to stay on as full-time employees instead of
returning to school or going to college. ``They aren't lured
away,'' he said proudly. ``We are guiding these people. We aren't
taking advantage of them like professional sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Once students in a high-school program attract corporate offers,
many parents start paying attention. After one of Hyatt's students
was featured in an article in The Washington Post, the teacher's
phone starting ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden,'' he said, ``I had calls from all over, with
people saying, `Can you get my kid a job?'''
</P>
<P>
   Starting this fall Hyatt is pulling back from his teaching
duties. He plans to teach a few classes this fall and then retire.
After 30 iears in the classroom, he wants to do some gardening and
paint watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if that doesn't pan out, Hyatt will always have his
students, several of whom have started their own companies. Two of
them approached him this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me a job,'' he said. He turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Unlike many students who take other office internships, interns
for computer companies should be ready for real work _ not just
making photocopies. What else are high-tech recruiters looking for?
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SYSTEMS EHPERIENCE &LR;  Knowing how to set up a computer or install
software, employers say, can improve your chances of snagging a
job. Many 17-year-old network managers got their start installing
computers and networks at their high schools.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROGRAMMING &LR;  Software programmers _ who usually have the most
lucrative employment options _ know the C++ programming language.
Being able to create applications using Java and PERL helps too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANALYTICAL SKILLS &LR;  These are the most critical, employers say _
especially since some programming languages may become obsolete.
Employers often screen for analytical prowess in interviews. Aaron
Gavios, vice president for sales at Mondosoft, a software company,
said he asked applicants how they would tackle hypothetical
business problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE INTERNET &LR;  ``Those students who are on the Internet all day,
they are in tune,'' said Laura Ianuly, vice president of human
resources for DoubleClick, an Internet advertising agency. And your
mother said you were wasting your time playing Doom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTACTS &LR;  Sometimes, it isn't what you know. ``I don't know how
you can get these jobs if you don't know someone,'' said Bobby
Impollonia, a 17-year-old programming intern at Goldman Sachs.
Several interns suggest getting to know your high school
computer-science teacher and looking for internship programs run by
local industry associations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RIGHT ATTITUDE &LR;  As with any job, certain rules apply. ``One
student didn't show up for a week,'' said Raj Goel, chief
technology officer at Brain Link, an Internet service provider.
``She said it was too much work.'' Goel was happy to let her go.

ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING GETS NOVICE AUTHORS INTO PRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephenville author Luther Butler has had two novels published
over the course of his 14-year writing career, and so far he's lost
more money than he's made.
</P>
<P>
   But Butler, 69, may be in for a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the first novel, ``Preacher,'' on bookstore shelves cost
Butler $7,000 through a ``subsidy publisher'' in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The second time around, Butler turned his manuscript over to
toExcel, an electronic vanity press that uses the cutting-edge
technology of print on demand. Butler doled out $300 in December,
and ``Red Heifer'' was on electronic store shelves in a matter of
weeks. And unlike ``Preacher,'' Butler's latest novel will probably
never go out of print. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Print on demand, or POD, is revolutionizing the publishing
industry, especially for authors such as Butler. The technology
allows publishers to create a book as it is ordered, eliminating
all sorts of overhead, including warehouses full of books that
never sold.
</P>
<P>
   POD relies on digitized manuscripts that are downloaded and
printed as soon as an order comes through. The computers (which
look like a few copy machines lined up side by side) can print,
bind and trim a 300-page novel, and produce its cover, in under a
minute. And the digital version of a book can be stored and
available for publication forever.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does POD save time, but it also lowers printing costs
significantly, meaning that publishers are freer to take chances on
novice authors without fretting so much about the bottom line.
ToExcel need sell only 100 copies of some titles to turn a profit,
says Kenzi Sugihara, company publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology has struck a chord with the electronic
publishing industry, which has already eliminated the book as we
know it. Companies such as toExcel and 1stBooks, already outfitted
with the computer infrastructure to take advantage of POD, have
done so eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowed us to open the doors to authors who might not
have had the opportunity to publish,'' says Sugihara, whose company
also works with Harvard University and Columbia University presses.
``It's completely revolutionized the business model of what is a
printable book.''
</P>
<P>
   For just over $700, 1stBook will electronically publish any
author's potential Great American Novel, design a four-color cover
for it, and send a digital version of the book to the POD company,
Lightning Print. After only a year of operation, Lightning Print's
250-plus client list includes top U.S. publishing firms such as
Random House and Time-Warner and smaller operations such as Lone
Star Park in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   A division of Ingram, the world's largest book distributor,
Lightning Print makes its database accessible to booksellers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   1stBook made first-time novelist Howard Olsen a local celebrity.
When his neighborhood Barnes &AMP; Noble came across Olsen's thriller
``Diplomatic Immunity,'' it invited him to host a book-signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a godsend,'' says Olsen, a 55-year-old machine-shop owner
in Salem, Mass. ``Being a complete unknown, it's very difficult to
get an agent, and without an agent, you can't find a publisher
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen is seven chapters into a sequel to ``Diplomatic Immunity''
that he hopes to have to 1stBooks by midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   And Butler plans to publish two more novels with toExcel in the
next few months. He hasn't seen any royalties yet from sales of
``Red Heifer,'' but then again, who knows where Oprah might be
looking for her next literary discovery?

SOME OF THESE TRENDS ARE ABOUT TO HAPPEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM BARLOW 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can consistently predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, predict the futures. The difference? Instead
of ``this is going to happen'' it's ``here are a number of things
that can happen. Some will. Some won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at them is fun. It also can be very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Salzman and Ira Matathia make their livings looking at
trends. Major corporations base future spending decisions on their
work. They have a new book out that contains some of their
predictions. It's ``NEXT. Trends For The Near-Future'' (Overlook
Press, $26.95).
</P>
<P>
   Some of their predictions are obvious. With globalization,
companies must make decisions on brand names and messages. Can they
be universal like the Nike swoosh symbol? Or must they tailor to
individual cultures. Other predictions are obscure. With the growth
of bilingualism in this country, we'll see less writing on signs
and more pictographs common on European road sides.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of what Salzman and Matathia refer to as Big
Nexts _ the kinds of things companies must consider to thrive in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customer satisfaction no longer comes from quality. That's
expected as a given. Immediacy is now the answer. They want it now.
Any wait is intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   _ They also want it customized for them. Or as the T-shirt
slogan says, ``I only ask that you treat me no differently than the
Queen.'' It's why GTE Telesystems in its call centers around the
country rates every customer's records with three symbols: calendar
pages for longevity, sticks of dynamite for past problems and money
bags for call volume. That allows their employee to respond more
appropriately to the customer problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers trust no one. They assume no one is telling them the
truth. That means what could have been a slight problem in a more
trusting age can rapidly escalate into a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customers want products of the future clothed in references to
the past. That's why Microsoft sold Windows 95 using music from the
Rolling Stones. Nissan hires Van Halen to sell its products.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROMISING NEW PRODUCTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some products the authors believe will soar in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   _ Automatic gift transmission. Florists, wine merchants and
specialty food stores will offer personal shopping in advance. Once
a year, fill out the form and all your loved ones receive gifts on
the appropriate day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dial-A-Geek. With the explosion in home computers, they will
be needed for emergency diagnosis and repairs _ either on-site or
via the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Triple Play Care. The same day-care centers caters to
children, the elderly and pets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleep machines that use electronics to promote deep sleep and
even dreams. They also can wake you up immediately after the dream
so you may write it down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Male beauty salons. Already common in Paris, they provide
manicures, chest-hair dying, anti-stress sessions, facials and
waxing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better fashion options for larger women. We aren't getting any
smaller in these United States and apparel designers are finally
started to accept that fact.
</P>
<P>
   And here are some changing mindsets Salzman and Matathia predict
will occur.
</P>
<P>
   _ Geek-chic. Modern-day heroes in popular fiction will rely more
on brain and computer power and less on muscles.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a related move, smart becomes more sexy. Look for unisex
fragrances called ``Brainy'' or ``Intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   And here are some cities the authors think will benefit from
trends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Music meccas. Chicago and Bristol, England, will both grow as
music centers _ based upon their music clubs and record labels,
which will spawn new talent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Port cities. Sydney has long been the trendsetter capital of
Australia, but its role as Olympic host next year will spread its
delights over the globe. Other port cities to watch are Genoa,
Italy; Marseilles, France; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and Hamburg,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cities with an edge. Hardier travelers will flock to Moscow;
St. Petersburg, Russia; and Naples, Italy. The two Russian cities
will give travelers the experience of advanced, industrialized
European country living in the raw. Naples presents a similar
experience _ but with better weather.
</P>
<P>
   And in a major cultural trend, U.S. museums spent $5 billion on
infrastructure in the past few years. That growth is being driven
by aging baby boomers looking for slower, more intellectual
adventures for themselves, their children and grandchildren.

TEXAS MONUMENT GENERATES A FOUNTAIN OF PASSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ The TV reporter positions Denton Councilman Carl
Young near the shade of the Courthouse-on-the-Square, a stone's
throw from the drinking fountains on a monument inscribed: Our
Confederate Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is rolling. ``Do you think the fact that the drinking
fountains don't work anymore is symbolic somehow? Do you think that
leaving them in disrepair shows that the water doesn't flow the
same way anymore?'' asks Robbie Owens of The Texas Network.
</P>
<P>
   Young shifts and looks uncomfortable. He has spoken against a
proposal to fix the formerly whites-only drinking fountains on the
Confederate memorial. The reporter's question is a good one, but
how do you fit the answer into a TV-size response?
</P>
<P>
   Because, no, the water doesn't flow the same way anymore.
</P>
<P>
   African-American youths are no longer chased away from the two
whites-only fountains, the way Young was as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Policemen don't pull black children off of a swing set in a
nearby playground, the way they did when Young was a boy and the
playground was whites-only. And students don't graduate from
segregated high schools anymore, the way Young did before he went
off to fight in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, built in 1918, is topped by a soldier carved in
marble. He is grasping a rifle and standing atop a granite archway
that holds the two broken drinking fountains. The soldier wears
regular farm clothes. He is slightly built and short. He looks very
young.
</P>
<P>
   For many of Young's neighbors, the monument is a respectful
tribute to ancestors who died fighting to defend their homeland. To
them, it does not represent all that is perfect in life. In fact,
it represents much that is sad. But Young sees the monument as a
reminder of all the things that shouldn't have been, yet were.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over fixing the broken water fountains started simply
enough. Mary Evelyn Blagg Huey, chairwoman of Denton County's
Historical Commission, told Denton County commissioners that
restoring the fountains to working order remained on her wish list
as she prepared to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Young was angered by her comments. Some of it felt like old
anger, like the way he felt when he got back from Vietnam,
suffering from what he says is an Agent Orange-inflicted skin
disease and post-traumatic stress syndrome. He started a chapter of
the Black Panther Party in the rural town. Back in those days, he
said, he drank too much and used his fists to try to change the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he said, he came around. He quit drinking. He ran
for City Council, and is now in his third term.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fountains still bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want our children to drink under this symbol of
slavery,'' Young told a reporter. ``Would you want to bow your head
to this guy who enslaved your ancestors and fought to keep it that
way?''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks created a ripple of debate, with some accusing him
of creating racial tension in the city of 73,000, 5 percent of whom
are African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Burt, a Flower Mound grocer, visited the monument last week.
He put silk flowers in the broken water fountains. Burt's
grandfather was a Confederate soldier.
</P>
<P>
   About 620,000 Americans were killed or died of disease during
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should respect them. My grandfather didn't own slaves. He
didn't want to own anybody. He was a dirt farmer,'' Burt said after
arranging the flowers. His hands shook slightly. His emotions ran
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Denton County didn't own slaves. They were poor
farmers who planted just enough for their own families to eat,
according to E. Dale Odom, a University of North Texas history
professor and author of ``An Illustrated History of Denton
County.''
</P>
<P>
   Slave-owning enterprises were primarily in the southeastern part
of the county near Lewisville, where most of the 250 slaves noted
in the 1860 Census lived, Odom said.
</P>
<P>
   Denton County was split on whether Texas should leave the union.
When Texas did secede, about 1,000 or more Denton County men chose
to fight for the Confederacy. The records aren't as clear on how
many returned home.
</P>
<P>
   The monuments across the South stand for many things, but mostly
they are what Charles Wilson, director of the Center for the Study
of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, calls
``melancholy marks on the landscape.'' The monuments remind us that
American culture is an evolving thing, the result of struggle,
Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   About mid-July, Young surveyed his constituents about the
monument.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't find anyone, except his friend Willie Hudspeth, who
wanted the monument removed.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-year-old African-American neighbor said that the soldier
on the monument never shot at him, so why worry? A few white
neighbors said that, to them, the monument represents respect for
ancestors who lived through highly charged times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine everyone being happy with it. If we took it
down, a lot would say we have amputated our history. If we leave it
up, it's a reminder of a very bitter time. We all have lots of
memories, some good, some bad. I am not going to go in and cut out
the bad ones,'' said Bullitt Lowry, a University of North Texas
history professor and longtime chairman of the Denton County
Landmark Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hudspeth led three folks in a minimarch around the
memorial. Hudspeth is African-American; the other marchers are
white. Hudspeth called it a unity march, one that respects the
sadness on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He carried a sign that read: ``God loves us all.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the TV reporter asked Young whether the broken drinking
fountains are symbolic, he had to say yes, why yes, they are. Water
does not flow the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Young tells the reporter, ``I don't think we should
fix the drinking fountains. We shouldn't take down the monument. We
ought to just leave it be.''

<P>
   CHINA-SECT (Beijing) _ China's fierce-looking crackdown on Falun
Gong, the spiritual movement that claims tens of millions of
followers, is turning out to be far less severe than it first
looked, with more propaganda than action. Although the authorities
are detaining tens of thousands of people and spewing a barrage of
anti-Falun Gong publicity, they are handling offenders in a
relatively soft way, releasing most of those detained within a few
days and sending them home with little more than a slap on the
wrist in contrast to the harsh sentences given to pro-democracy
campaigners. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ After months of often hostile
bickering, leaders of Mexico's two main opposition parties are
reporting surprising progress in negotiations to join forces in an
alliance against President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party in
next year's general elections. By Sam Dillon.
</P>

   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   DEBT-BUYBACK (Washington) _ Like a family that suddenly finds
itself with enough cash to pay off both its credit cards and its
mortgage, the Clinton administration moved today to take advantage
of projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling the way the
government handles its finances. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
Summers said the government would change its strategy for handling
the $3.6 billion it owes to the public in the form of Treasury
bonds and other securities. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Congress prepared today to approve
two big spending bills that contained ``emergency'' measures to aid
farmers and conduct the 2000 census, provisions that would consume
almost all of the projected surplus in next year's budget. By Tim
Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   LOGGING (Seattle) _ Five years after the Clinton administration
hammered out a landmark plan to settle legal and environmental
disputes over logging across the Pacific Northwest, the region's
timber wars are flaring up again, as the same federal judge who
once issued rulings to protect the northern spotted owl has now
blocked nine major logging deals and imperiled dozens of others by
declaring that federal officials have failed to take proper steps
to ensure that other species are being protected as well. By Sam
Howe Verhovek.
</P>

   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, Kevin McGuire, a computer consultant in
Lombard, Ill., designed a new computer system for a client. After a
break from the project, he sat down at the computer to start up the
system but couldn't get into the server. He had forgotten his
password.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of panic gripped him as he rapidly typed in variations
on his favorite passwords. Two days later he gave up and rebuilt
the system from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything can be recreated, though. Also lost in password
purgatory is a year's worth of personal journal entries he kept in
a Microsoft Word document on his personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the password to be different so that people wouldn't
be able to get to my journal,'' McGuire said. ``Unfortunately,
neither can I.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that McGuire would drop a password or two.
On a regular basis, he must remember three dozen passwords to gain
access to computer networks, software programs, e-mail, voice mail,
fax mail, Web sites, ATM's and even the security system for his
house.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten passwords are an inevitable consequence of the
digitization of everything from money to mail. Twenty years ago,
people had to remember only their Ssocial Security number and maybe
a phone number or two. But since the introduction of the automated
teller machine, people have accumulated an arsenal of passwords,
access codes and personal identification numbers to use everything
from answering machines to office bathrooms. A result is lost
computer files, inaccessible accounts and a lot of banged-up
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is nightmarish is that we rely so much on information
that comes from different sources,'' said Alessandro Piol, a
managing director of Investco Private Capital in New York, who has
been locked out of his e-mail account while conducting
coast-to-coast venture capital negotiations. ``If you are locked
out of a system, it's like losing a limb.''
</P>
<P>
   The exponential growth of Web sites creates an exponential
growth in forgotten passwords. Almost all password-protected sites
either encourage people who have forgotten their passwords to
reregister or provide a mechanism where they can automatically
retrieve their password.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on the Web site estimates that more than
1,000 people forget their password to the site each week, and 10
percent to 15 percent of its registrants are duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many computer users simply do what computer security
experts warn them not to: use the same password for everything. But
even that strategy is becoming more difficult because various
computer systems have different requirements for the rendering and
length of the passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dilley is an extreme example of the password problem.
Dilley, a network administrator for Applied Digital Access in the
San Diego area, maintains 129 active passwords, 37 personal ones
and 92 for work. He sees himself as the archetypal wired citizen of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that we will be totally inundated with passwords of
one form or another in the next 10 to 20 years and possessing 129
passwords will be the norm,'' he said. Dilley began to use a Palm
organizer to track his passwords. Every few weeks, he forgets to
take his Palm when he leaves home and makes a 50-minute round-trip
back home to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten passwords cost millions of dollars annually in
help-desk costs and lost productivity _ incidents like McGuire's
rebuilding of the computer system from scratch. Industry estimates
say 20 percent to 50 percent of all calls to company help desks are
from people needing their passwords reset.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gartner Group, an organization with 2,500
desktop computers can spend more than $850,000 a year resetting
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   The requests for password help ``are considered to be noise and
nuisance by help-desk staff, because they are so highly
repetitive,'' said John Jacobs, president of Network Support
Technologies, a company in Burlington, Mass. that provides
help-desk services.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten passwords are a product of the computer's ability to
store more information than the human brain can. ``In the old days
you just had to yell out, `Zog, it's me,' and he would let you into
the cave without clubbing you,'' said Professor Irving Biederman, a
cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Southern California.
``Now you need all these passwords to get access anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Research confirms the intuitive: the more we are asked to
remember, the more likely we are to forget. The brain's capacity
for remembering is indefinite as long it has associations for the
memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design of human memory and the design of computer
architecture is at a crossroads,'' said Steve Pinker, a cognitive
neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``A
computer password must be arbitrary enough that people can't guess
it, but human memory is designed to remember things that are not
arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas short-term memory usually holds between five and nine
items, scientists say there are no limits on long-term memory
capacity _ as long as people have associations for those memories.
That is why people have a natural impulse to choose passwords based
on familiar things _ children's birthdays, spouse's name, favorite
sports team _ rather than incomprehensible strings like 3B(NU)$Ir
or 7(star)$3fg.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pinker, there is no neurological reason that given
strong enough associations, people shouldn't be able to recall 129
passwords, ``like you can remember an indefinite number of names of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Like muscles, neural pathways are strengthened by frequent use.
But scientists believe that infrequently recalled memories may be
overlaid by more frequently used ones, which make them harder to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The rampant growth of passwords has spawned various strategies
for handling scattered bits of information. Some people keep lists
of passwords taped to walls or to the underside of their keyboards,
much to network administrators' dismay. Others keep lists in small
notebooks or in files stored on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some high-security institutions like financial companies and
hospitals assign passwords instead of letting users choose, or
force users to change their passwords every 30 or 60 days, which
results in periodic spikes in reset calls to technical support
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Resetting of passwords has become so costly to companies that
some are choosing to automate the process. Password reset software
eliminates the need for harried users to depend on help desks by
allowing them to maintain their own user profiles. Merrill Lynch
and Boeing both recently purchased such systems from the Courion
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Koszenski, a computer technician in Lexington, spent
2,000 hours of his own time creating a password database software
for his PC after being disappointed with various password tracking
programs. ``It basically goes back to if you want something done
right, you have to do it yourself,'' said Koszenski, who has 30 or
so passwords and access codes to manage. For protecting his
password program, there is yet another password that he keeps in
his head.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of passwords and the propensity to lose them
has helped fuel a cottage industry of companies and consultants who
recover passwords using computer programs. While most password
recovery requests come from people who are trying to retrieve
passwords of dead relatives or disgruntled former employees,
recovery businesses estimate that between 15 percent and 25 percent
of requests come from people who have forgotten their own passwords
on documents.
</P>
<P>
   Tax time is a popular time for people to forget passwords,
particularly those on old financial files. So, too, are the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``For about a week after New Year's people call up saying, `I
got drunk over the holidays, I changed my password on a whim and I
can't remember it,''' said Amber Schroader, general manager of
Access Data in Provo, Utah which sells about 600 password recovery
software packages a month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common requests involve passwords for documents
created with Microsoft Word or Excel, which are easy for the
companies to recover because those programs do not have strong
encryption. The majority of popular software applications produced
in the United States and distributed internationally have
intentionally weak encryption since this country has strict
controls on the export of encryption tools and products, said Bob
Weiss, president of Password Crackers, a Web-based password
recovery consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are surprised by how many software products listed on
our site are not secure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some emerging high-tech solutions to the password
deluge. Biometric devices that recognize fingerprints, faces and
voices, and smart cards that are embedded with computer chips are
gaining in popularity. Matchbox-size fingerprint recognition
devices for the PC are now available for as low as $99.
</P>
<P>
   So-called smart cards, which carry digital signatures and are
used for phone calls and purchases, are growing at a rate of 30
percent a year, predominantly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Piol, the venture capitalist, once taped a piece of paper
listing his passwords on the wall by his desk, but a few months ago
he started using a fingerprint scanner, U.are.U, to help manage the
passwords. Impressed by the device, Piol tore down the paper and
led a $9 million dollar venture capital investment in the company,
Digital Persona.
</P>
<P>
   But until fingerprint scanners and smart card readers become as
standard on desktops as computer mice, people will still have to
struggle with the chore of password management. The University of
Michigan is teaching its students a hygienic, low-tech approach to
the problem. Treat passwords like underwear, the university says:
Never let friends borrow them and never leave them lying about. And
as anybody's mother would say, change them often.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users can be a predictable lot, especially when
choosing passwords. Surveys show that names of loved ones, birth
dates and sports teams are the most frequently used passwords,
while hacker folklore says some of the most popular individual
passwords are sex, love, god, password, secret and qwerty.
</P>
<P>
   A good password, security experts say, must balance between
being intuitive enough to remember and being too difficult to
guess. Passwords should be at least six characters long and consist
of a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and
non-alphanumeric characters. Here are some strategies for creating
memorable but not easily guessed passwords:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take two short words, capitalize one or more letters, and run
them together with punctuation marks or numbers in between.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose a line or two from a favorite song or poem and use the
first letter of each word.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create words that mimic easily remembered sounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use letter combinations based on shapes on the keyboard, like
spirals or zig-zags.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use at least two passwords for Web sites and networks: a
complicated, relatively obscure password for opening more important
accounts and a less difficult password for tasks like common Web
site registrations.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Seashore Plantings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live at the beach. Can you help me with some plants that
will survive in a very sunny garden with very poor soil that is
mostly sand?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before I help out with the plants, please promise you will
help out your soil. No amount of amendment will turn your place
into English border territory, but if you choose a few planting
pockets (or build raised beds) and add lots of organic matter to
them, everything you plant in those favored spots will show its
deep gratitude. Since it's much too hot and dry right now to plant
anything, you've got time to add compost and composted manure
before cooler temperatures and autumn rains usher in the next
planting season.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're at the shore, it will be easy to add seaweed to the
mix. Just rake up that storm-delivered eelgrass and spread it for
mulch. You don't need to dig it in or wash the salt off. Plan to
use a balanced fertilizer at planting time. Compost, manure and
seaweed are wonderful soil builders, but they use nutrients while
decaying and are not themselves rich in primary plant foods.
</P>
<P>
   Next, do some rubbernecking. Your neighbors all have conditions
like yours, so the things that are thriving for them will probably
thrive for you, too. Finally, start your wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa rugosa should probably be near the top. These seashore
classics thrive in dry, sandy soil and salt air, putting out a
fragrant billow of magenta, pink or white flowers in spring,
flowering intermittently in summer and holding their big,
orange-red hips well into fall. The crinkled, medium-green leaves
are resistant to most rose diseases, and the plants themselves
quickly grow into handsome shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   You can stop with just one, but rugosas look best when planted
in sweeping drifts that lead the eye toward a focal point: a garden
folly, an elegantly contorted pine or of course, the deep blue sea.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your eye on the silver; gray-leafed plants like artemesias,
sages and lavenders are usually drought-resistant. And don't forget
succulents. Their water-storing leaves are designed for situations
like yours. Sedums offer strong shapes that look good surrounded by
sand and stone, and portulacas willingly spread mats of blazing
color over soil so poor and dry even dandelions won't grow.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Takeover Specialist &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've always had milkweed around the fringes of the garden for
butterflies. Lately, it has become rampant, even invading the
vegetable plot. Has the lack of a deep freeze the last few winters
caused this? The roots are too deep to dig out. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A. Fringe is not a meaningful concept to the common milkweed,
Asclepias syriaca. Once a stand is well established, its deep,
eagerly spreading roots and multitudinous seeds make it a takeover
specialist, and since milkweed is hardy to about 50 below, I
wouldn't count on help from a freeze if I were you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, mow the perimeter of the garden so the nearest milkweed
is at least 10 feet away. In the garden itself, pull all shoots as
soon as they appear. Wind-sown seedlings won't have a chance to put
down strong roots, and although the roots that are already there
will keep sending up new plants, depriving them of top growth will
eventually starve out the network.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Bonus Crop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We planted scarlet runner beans to attract hummingbirds. Now
they're making beans. Can these be eaten? They look almost like
regular beans, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   A. Scarlet runners, Phaseolus coccineus, are close relatives of
regular (P. vulgaris) beans, and are like them, edible at every
stage from flower to dried seed. The wrinkled pods are tastiest and
least fibrous when comparatively small, about six-inches long and
still completely flat. The beans inside have the best flavor when
very large, about an inch wide, but not yet starting to dry out. At
this stage, they will have leathery, slightly bitter,
purple-splotched pink skin. Peel it away to reveal the bright green
beans underneath; steam or stir-fry them only long enough to heat
through, and get ready for a treat.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in early June on New York's Long Island, I was
thunderstruck by the big pink roses climbing up a pergola in a
Bridgehampton garden that's like a second home to me. The luminous,
satiny double blossoms hung like lush petticoats from the crossbar
over my head, and I gaped up at them, chanting: ``I want that rose.
I want that rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Meltesen smiled the smile of a sorcerer working his spell
and said, ``That's Mme. Gregoire Staechelin.''
</P>
<P>
   The high, dome-shaped pergola is made of steel (the wood one
blew down in a hurricane), and all this voluptuousness dangling
over hard edges was, well, stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Three other roses climbed the other three supports of the dome:
Zephirine Drouhin, a fragrant bourbon rose with loose, bright pink
semi-double blossoms; New Dawn, a perpetual-flowering workhorse
with small silvery-pink flowers as softly blushing as a morning
sky, and Sparrieshoop, a modern shrub rose that _ wait a second! _
didn't quite make it all the way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a climber,'' Chris said a bit balefully, staring up
at the quarter space of open sky in his magnificent dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I insisted it was,'' said his wife, Tina, coming through the
gate of the formal parterre, which she designed some six years ago.
``I'd seen it on a garden tour, climbing up the front of a house,''
she said. ``And I loved it because it blooms all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbers are really just shrub roses with long canes that can be
wound up trellises and such, but Chris, who had begun to study
these things _ ``He's much more thorough that I am,'' Tina said _
knew that Sparrieshoop, a light pink that fades to white, didn't
have what it takes to get up that pergola.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I let it go,'' he said, his eyes crinkling. ``Now I say,
`It's really nice how that space shows off the structure.'''
</P>
<P>
   We looked up at the patch of blue sky showing through the frame.
``It's nice,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a marriage,'' Chris said. ``You look on the
positive, so you don't kill your partner.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner is actually my ex-sister-in-law, Tina Raver, and
when she and my oldest brother were divorced years ago, we remained
friends and sisters. Now she is a garden designer, and over 20
years, the old potato field surrounding this 1865 farmhouse has
evolved from the proverbial impatiens around the front porch to
meandering mixed borders, a pond and woodland walk to a wildflower
meadow. (``We had a choice between paying off the national debt and
planting a meadow,'' Chris said.) If you know how to read the
trees, the birdhouses, the pond, the peonies, you can chart the
episodes of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris planted the peonies, I thought, `Maybe he could
stay,''' said Tina, who married him shortly after. But one day,
when she started to sketch out a rose parterre, complete with
boxwood hedges, a pergola and fountain, he balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was too formal,'' he said. ``And my lawn was
being encroached on. How was I going to play softball? None of
which she paid any attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was all those gardens they had visited together:
Sissinghurst, Hidcote, Vaux-le-Vicomte, the Peggy Rockefeller Rose
Garden, designed by Beatrix Farrand in 1916 for the New York
Botanical Garden. Where she took all those courses. Or the weeding
she did as an intern at Madoo, Robert Dash's ever-changing
masterpiece right down the road in Sagaponack. Anyway, it all
landed on the old potato field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a formal parterre,'' Tina said. ``We needed some
bones.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to make sketches: four rectangular beds edged in low
box, with a high pergola in the center. Another low double row of
box frames the central beds, providing space for more shrub roses,
as well as giant alliums, Siberian iris, purple sage and tall white
lilies for those dog days of August, when the roses slow way down
(saving energy for another burst of bloom in the fall).
</P>
<P>
   Gooseberries and red currants, which remind Tina of her
childhood, and which make such good jelly, line the south side of
the parterre, and a gnarled rose of Sharon, more tree than shrub,
arches over an old moss-covered bench, hanging its big crimson
hibiscus-like flowers over the hedge.
</P>
<P>
   The inner paths are simply red-brown gravel, with a circle of
beautifully laid old brick planted in creeping thyme beneath the
pergola. An old ceramic pot with a spouting fish sits on a bed of
thyme, and the sound of trickling water adds to the deep sense of
peace to be had on the old moss bench in the misty morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chris had plunged into the complicated world of
roses: sorting out the species, the bourbons and damasks, the
gallicas and musk roses, the rugosas, the modern shrub roses
developed after 1867. And he soon discovered Heirloom Old Garden
Roses in St. Paul, Ore. (503-538-1576).
</P>
<P>
   ``They grow them on their own roots, so they're a lot hardier
than the grafted roses,'' he said. A grafted rose may succumb to a
harsh winter, leaving its hardy rootstock to send up its own shoots
and flowers. Which is why Dr. Huey, that hardy red rose, might
bloom on a bush you thought was the pale pink Cecile Brunner.
</P>
<P>
   The Heirloom company also grows the modern English roses
developed by David Austin, which Chris loves: ``They're fragrant,
they're hardy, they're disease-resistant. They grow.''
</P>
<P>
   So now these formal beds are filled with English roses like
Abraham Darby, a large, cupped apricot rose touched with gold;
Graham Thomas, a vigorous yellow climber, named after the venerable
English plantsman; musk roses like Buff Beauty, a double deep
apricot, and Felicia, a silvery pink with a gold center; bourbon
roses like Souvenir de la Malmaison, a full blush-pink; gallicas,
like Cardinal de Richelieu, a reddish-purple; and portlands, like
Jacques Cartier, a fragrant pink rose with a button eye.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of these old shrub roses will bloom again come fall. But
not Mme. Gregoire de Staechelin. Like some bewitching lover, she
shows up in June and then is gone. So you spend all year longing
for her.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad Tina decided Chris should stay. He doesn't exactly look
like an old shrub rose, but he's just as steady. Who else would
replant a wildflower meadow five times? These summer weekends, as I
slip out to Bridgehampton for a swim in the ocean, I sit under the
old rose of Sharon (which came here years ago as a seedling from
Shelter Island) making up my fall order. Already, my favorites may
be sold out, but I'll be first in line for spring.

<P>
   TIPS ON ROSE GARDENING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ANNE RAVER &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning a rose garden, or just adding roses to the
landscape, get to know the specimens in your local botanical
garden. Seeing how they do through the summer _ how they stand up
to this year's extreme heat and drought, for instance; if, indeed,
the repeat bloomers bloom again _ can help you order the right
varieties for your soil and climate.
</P>
<P>
   I've been keeping tabs on my favorites at the Peggy Rockefeller
Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden, where gardeners have
started pruning their roses back hard _ all except some of the
shrubs and climbers that don't rebloom _ for a fall bloom that
could be, weather permitting, as boisterous as June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prune the David Austin roses first, about Aug. 4, because
they take longer to come back,'' said Michael Ruggiero, the senior
curator of the botanical garden and an expert on roses. ``The musks
and the hybrid teas take only about four weeks,'' so these get
pruned later in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to keep good records,'' he added. ``It
doesn't matter what the books says. This is what really happened.
You know your own garden better than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rose gardeners here _ Ken Molinari and Doris Straus _
are always willing to share their expertise on anything from the
importance of good drainage and soil preparation to fertilization
routines and the performance of a given rose.
</P>
<P>
   And since there are 230 types of roses blooming here, including
more than 100 old garden and shrub roses, that's a living resource
you will never find in a book. The garden also tests the
All-American Selection winners _ new hybrid teas that are tested in
gardens around the country _ and sometimes they flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AAS awards are for the whole country, so they don't
account for regional differences,'' Ruggiero said. ``Sheer Bliss, a
pale pink pastel, was one of my favorites when I saw it in Texas,
but it died here. It's not hardy to this climate.''
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid teas and grandifloras, the floribundas, modern shrub
roses and English roses are all evaluated yearly, and you can pick
up the report card at the garden.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Gertrude Jekyll, a vigorous, bright pink double
English rose I've been lusting after, got a superior rating, and
the shrub rose Sparrieshoop, a light pink that fades to white, got
a good. Unfortunately, the old roses are not rated, but the
gardeners can tell you just what they think of them. And I always
consult ``The Graham Stuart Thomas Rose Book'' (Sagapress, 1994),
my rose bible.
</P>
<P>
   If this heat and drought ever lift, you will see wonderful roses
here this fall, from the fragrant hybrid musk rose Felicia, which
has an apricot-pink bud that fades to silvery pink when open, to
that never-say-die climber New Dawn (though I must say, the heat
did it in; the perpetual bloomer has stopped blooming), to Rosarium
Uetersen, a shrub rose used as a climber, with deep pink flowers
that smell like citrus. It's closed up shop for August, but it will
bloom again in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   You also get the word straight from the horse's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Opening Night, the 1998 AAS winner,'' Ruggiero said,
staring down at a deep red hybrid tea. ``It smells like
cardboard.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jardins de Bagatelle, a pale pink hybrid tea
with a wonderful clove scent and vigorous, bluish foliage, is the
only rose Ruggiero has never had to replace. ``It's the best hybrid
tea in the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm drawn to the old roses, like Othello, a blue-red pillar
rose that grows about as tall as you'll ever see, and it was
actually blooming last week in the heat. So were Graham Thomas, a
yellow David Austin; Zephirine Drouhin, a rose-pink climbing
bourbon, and Dortmund, a deep red kordesii rose with a white edge.
It doesn't have a scent, but it's hardy to 30 below, so don't
complain.

TEXAS MERCHANTS BRACE FOR LOUISIANA CONSUMERS LOOKING TO SAVE
MONEY

   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Merchants are hoping that this weekend's
back-to-school sales tax holiday lures Louisiana shoppers across
the state line just like word of a $100 million Powerball Lotto
draws Texans to the Pelican State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had them in here for the past two weeks, just checking
to see when it's going to be,'' said Scherry Becker, assistant
manager of Beall's Department Store in Orange, one of the closest
clothing stores from the Texas-Louisiana line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of shoppers from Vinton, Starks and even Lake
Charles,'' she said. ``We expect to see a lot of them in here
during these three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many department stores near the Louisiana border, her store
will open three hours early (at 7 a.m. CDT) on Friday and Saturday
to help accommodate the extra shoppers. Technically, the exemption
begins at 12:01 a.m. Friday and ends at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants haven't reported specifically targeting advertising
toward Louisiana, but much of the advertising is done in
newspapers, radio stations and television stations that get wide
distribution in western Louisiana, said Betty Harmon, executive
director of the Orange Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Orange, which calls itself the ``first taste of Texas'' for
westbound travelers and ``the last taste of Texas,'' for eastbound
travelers, has always drawn shoppers from the western edge of
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes in Texas cities are already a half-cent lower than
the 8.75 percent rate in southwestern Louisiana, said Lewis Cain,
publisher of seven community newspapers in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our gas tax rate is higher too,'' he said. ``Gasoline is
always several cents per gallon cheaper on the Texas side.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Charles, 30 miles inside the Louisiana border, has shopping
malls, but many back-to-school shoppers from the area also shop at
Beaumont's Parkdale Mall and Port Arthur's Central Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know what it's going to be like,'' said
Parkdale's marketing director Kathy Chessher. She said merchants
are expecting something between the usual back-to-school rush and
Christmas, and past research has shown that many of the shoppers
will be from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   As an added bonus, Chessher said, shoppers at Parkdale who spend
at least $100 in three different stores will be able to get a $10
gift certificate to spend in any mall store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when we have free gift wrapping,'' she said. ``We
don't advertise it, but people find out about it anyway and they
come in here for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stores at Central Mall are opening early and staying open
late to handle the expected crowds, said Jill Langston, marketing
director there.
</P>
<P>
   Local state legislators who were planning a news conference on
the tax holiday at Central Mall on Thursday may be able to clear up
some of the confusion that has been generated by the new holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants and marketing directors have the erroneous
impression the holiday only exempts the state sales tax of 6.25
percent. In fact, the law implementing it exempts all sales taxes,
including local and regional.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption covers most clothing and shoes costing $100 or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other states, New York and Florida, have tried a sales
tax holiday, and retailers in those states say shopping in some
border areas was significant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Louisiana publisher Cain remained philosophical about
merchants in Southwest Louisiana losing business to Texas: ``We'll
get it all back at the gambling boats.''

INTERNET SHOWING ITS VALUE IN REMOTE ALASKAN VILLAGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KOTZEBUE, Alaska _ From this remote town about 30 miles north of
the Arctic Circle, six doctors serve a dozen villages in an area
the size of Indiana. With the help of the Internet, diagnosing
problems has become just a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Janette Shackles, the medical director of the Maniilaq Health
Center here, remembers phone calls before the advent of
Internet-based images during which she played twenty questions with
physicians' assistants in the villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `Where did this person get shot?' and they'd say
`Back behind the school,''' she said. ``The images really help a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, the state with more caribou than people, has widened its
entrance ramp to the Internet. Until February 1999, one fiber-optic
cable owned primarily by the AT&AMP;T Corp. served the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was running with every photon burdened,'' said Ronald
Duncan, president of General Communications, in Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   With two fiber-optic cables working and one more to follow soon,
Alaska will soon be better connected than ever to the lower 48
states, with enough capacity to let every one of Alaska's 600,000
residents make a phone call at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In Kotzebue, where the ocean freezes over in October or
November, pricey phone calls and faxes that used to bounce _ slowly
and shakily _ from tundra to satellite and back again are now local
calls, using extra bandwidth from the new connections.
</P>
<P>
   And Kotzebue residents this year found it easier and quicker to
join the 9 million people who saw and heard live video and audio
feeds from the Iditarod dog sled race on Dogsled.com in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone from being like the Long Island Expressway at rush
hour to a major interstate across Nevada in the middle of the
night,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiber optic advances will reach a population that is
unusually Net-savvy. Alaska has relatively young residents, as many
older people retire to warmer climates. According to 1998 figures
from Fort Nocs, an e-commerce company in Anchorage, 40 percent of
the homes in the lower 48 states have computers, and about a
quarter of them are on line, while 73 percent of Alaskans have
computers, and just over half of them are on line.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskan Internet service providers have complained about
seasonal fluctuations, with use plummeting in the summer when, as
in Kotzebue, there are at least 36 days when the sun doesn't set,
and rising dramatically in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remote, and when it's really cold, there's not a lot to
do, so a lot of people will jump on the Internet,'' said Ben
Phillips, head of OTZ Telecommunications in Kotzebue, an Internet
service provider for 150 to 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hendrix works for the Northwest Arctic Borough School
District, where every classroom has an Internet connection. His
responsibilities include 1,500 users and 600 uniform work stations
that have been configured to protect the operating system from
people fiddling with it either inadvertently or maliciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make it so they can't get to where they can mess stuff
up,'' he said of the teachers and students who use the system. ``If
something goes down and all you need to do is type a few things,
you've got to fly there'' to fix it. The nearest of the region's 11
villages is 60 miles from Kotzebue, and no roads connect them.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes flying isn't an option, even with medical
emergencies. Bad weather and high costs can maroon a patient in the
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we would take an X-ray of a person with a broken
leg, and send it by courier to Anchorage,'' said Eugene Smith,
information manager for the Maniilaq Health Center. ``There was a
big delay in the process. There would be times when the bone would
set before a diagnosis could be made. Now we digitize the film, and
it's in Anchorage the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ed Carns, a temporary doctor at the clinic, said he has
never seen an emergency room in the lower 48 states that is as well
wired as the one in Kotzebue. On his first night on call, a
clinician from Point Hope phoned at 2 a.m. about a toddler who had
possibly been sexually abused. The clinician sent along pictures of
the girl and Carns, though initially skeptical of the new
technology, was able to determine that her injuries were not
related to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a believer at that moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Telemedicine, made possible by the new lines, is also proving to
be a money-saver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical medical paradigm is when in doubt, evacuate, but
that can cost $25,000 a pop, for a jet to Anchorage and a small
plane out of the village,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can help address one of the biggest problems for
professionals in rural Alaska: isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the only teacher in town, with no one to share
issues with, or if you are a doctor trying to get continuing
education, it's very, very difficult,'' Duncan said, pointing out
the value of the camaraderie that can develop through e-mail and
training materials available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, increased bandwidth from the new cables will enable
Alaskans to use the Web for entertainment as well as research.
</P>
<P>
   So while John Clark, a student in Kotzebue, used the Internet to
research the differences between tap water and filtered water for a
class project, Gordon Foster, the system administrator at OTZ
Telecommunications, uses it to play cribbage and hearts and to keep
in near-daily touch with his father in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At Surf City, an Internet cafe in Anchorage, Andrew Stevenson of
Sydney, Australia, and his fiancee, Katherine Moore, stopped during
their eight-month tour of Europe and the United States to send
e-mail. They were pleased with the speed of the 10 computers there,
especially after traveling in Eastern Europe. (``They had an
Internet cafe, but no computers,'' Ms. Moore said.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has reached even the state's remote coastal
villages, where a women's cooperative produces and sells knitted
goods like scarves made from the soft underhairs of the Arctic musk
ox. The co-op's three-year-old Web page, (www.qiviut.com) accounts
for about 1 percent of its business, including at least one order
from Iraq, said Sigrun Robertson, executive director of the
cooperative, which is called Oomingmak, a word that translates to
``the hairy or bearded one.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen R. Crane, the state's director of libraries, archives and
museums, found how small the world could be when a patron at one
library asked for information about Russian monasteries, a task
that would have taken researchers weeks, she said, before the
libraries came on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Internet, the citizen in rural Alaska can be as tied
in to what's happening in the world as a person in Anchorage or New
York or Seattle or any place else,'' she said.

`FOREVER ENGLAND': YES, THERE'LL ALWAYS BE ONE _ OR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the differences between the North and the South in
the United States, one might find it hard to believe that similar
disparities are thought to hold true in relatively compact England.
Yet that is the subject of Beryl Bainbridge's quirky new book,
``Forever England.''
</P>
<P>
   As the author explains in her preface, the book is based on a
television series ``which, in an attempt to examine the roots of
that evergreen assumption, the notion that England is two nations,
focused on the expectations and attitudes of six families, three in
the North and three in the South.'' Much of the perceived
difference is based on myth, according to the introduction by Ms.
Bainbridge, who grew up in Liverpool and is best known as a
novelist. ``In the South they rode to hounds and went to Ascot; in
the North we kept pigeons and raced greyhounds. When we had our
tea, people in London sat down to their dinner dressed up as if
they were off out to a Masonic hot-pot supper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the same,'' she continues, ``these simplistic myths,
matters of manners and money and location, never for one moment
obscured the real differences that separated us, hid the severing
wound that well-nigh cut us in half and could never be healed, for
hadn't we been plundered by the South, laid waste, bled white? It
was not just industrial. They had drained away our talent and our
brains; who had ever heard of anyone once they got on in the world,
from William Gladstone to Thomas Handley, who had been content to
stay in the North? We learned this from our parents.''
</P>
<P>
   To test both myth and parental lore, Ms. Bainbridge interviewed
people on the dole in Liverpool, fishermen in Hastings, descendants
of coal miners in Barnsley, the extended family of a financier in
Bentley, sheep farmers in Northumberland and a multiracial family
in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   A few arresting generalizations emerge. ``Up here in the hills
we have crisis after crisis,'' says the wife of a tenant farmer who
keeps 2,000 sheep. ``There's no time to consult with anyone else.
It could make you very self-opinionated, this sort of life. If you
were in the South, you wouldn't need to be so determined, so
dogged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a softer life down here in the South,'' Ms. Bainbridge
concludes after visiting with the fishing family in Hastings.
``They're not given to self-analysis, and perhaps the so-called
southern reserve is not so much a matter of unfriendliness as a
detached complacency born of comparative affluence.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the people she visited with seem selected to
illustrate her various points, one finds it hard to put much stock
in them as a sampling. Their main value is to fix in our minds the
geographical distinctions of various regions in England.
</P>
<P>
   Far more diverting are the autobiographical tangents on which
the interviews inspire Ms. Bainbridge to take off. Her return to
Liverpool triggers memories of her parents, of her father's
contradictory ways _ he lamented the loss of the empire yet always
voted for Labor _ and of her mother, whose hands were always full
``painting the furniture and rearranging the ornaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to Hastings reminds her of a novel she once wrote in
which she had to send her protagonist on vacation somewhere. ``I
didn't think he should go to Brighton _ Brighton was too flashy for
him. So I chose Hastings. The name came out of my head like a
number out of a hat. I say that, but then nothing is ever as random
as it appears. In my opinion there's no such thing as imagination _
in the sense that we have the power to form images of our own
making _ for unless we've already acquired images in the first
place, from somewhere, how can we possibly summon them into
existence, reformed or not?''
</P>
<P>
   A discussion of politics reminds her of the Cuban missile
crisis, when she was picked to go and protest to the U.S. consul
but was ``struck dumb with admiration'' because he looked like ``a
cross between Gregory Peck and Rasputin.''
</P>
<P>
   What emerges from these musings besides the portrait of an
amusing, original, opinionated individual? Because Ms. Bainbridge
rarely wastes a word in her fiction _ the most recent of her novels
are ``Master Georgie,'' ``Every Man for Himself'' and ``The
Birthday Boys'' _ you look for a hidden pattern here, some
subterranean message that helps you to see beyond easy
generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   But in vain. Instead what you get is the story of one unusual
individual. ``If you come from the North as I do,'' she writes,
``and you left it, as I did, you have ambivalent feelings towards
the old working communities. It's an uneasy mixture of pride and
irritation, sentimentality and mistrust, for you broke away from a
narrowness of outlook and a lack of expectation which well-nigh
crushed you. And yet _ the heart lies back there in the past, and
everyone longs to return and find things just as they were, the
arguments in full spate and the home fires still burning.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Forever England,'' Ms. Bainbridge doesn't find the home
fires still burning. But she manages to set a few on her own.

TAKING A SWING A THE 3,000 CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the way it will happen, if the baseball
gods have any sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Devil Rays third baseman Wade Boggs will get there
first, and he'll get there fast. Boggs will plant his flag at the
top of a mountain that only the most dependable and determined
players dare climb _ preferably by fouling off a half dozen
two-strike pitches before stroking a single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   His 3,000th career hit will come in front of the hometown fans
of Tampa, thus allowing some good to come out of a master craftsman
plying his trade in the baseball equivalent of a clown's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers for Boggs will fade just in time for Tony Gwynn to
step up to the plate in another city and another league. Gwynn, who
has spent his entire career following the lead of Boggs, will
promptly guide a seeing-eye single just out of the reach of two
lunging infielders. Being a member of the 3,000-hit club means
never having to say you're sorry for the way you did it.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, even two, all but the most essential baseball
business will stop. Boggs and Gwynn will bask in the shared glow of
having earned passes that will gain them admittance into the front
door of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll scatter to safety.
</P>
<P>
   It's best, after all, to give Mark McGwire a wide berth. McGwire
is on another rampage, one that puts him on a collision course with
his 500th career home run. Wasn't it just last year that McGwire
was reaching the 400 plateau?
</P>
<P>
   And we all know how much chicks dig the long ball. Of course, so
do children, and grown men and just about anybody who doesn't
belong to the pitching fraternity. This is the age of the shrunken
strike zone and the swollen earned run average. Even shortstops
have been known to clobber 40 home runs in the course of
accumulating 200 hits during a season. Cal Ripken Jr., who has
spent most of his career at shortstop, is only 32 hits short of
3,000 and one homer away from 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we came in, there was such a home run mentality,''
Boggs said. ``Tony and I had to put line-drive hitters on the map.
We made it OK for Little Leaguers to hit line drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Mac and Sammy (Sosa), here we go again. We get washed
to the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Life should be a day on a tropical beach for the few, the proud,
who own 3,000 hits that nobody can ever take away from them. Boggs
and Gwynn entered Tuesday night five hits apiece from reaching that
milestone. Twenty-one players in major-league history have 3,000
hits, and 17 of them are in the Hall of Fame. Pete Rose locked
himself out with what amounted to a nolo contendere plea on charges
that he bet on baseball. The doors to Eddie Murray, Dave Winfield
and Paul Molitor should open as soon as they're eligible for the
Hall of Fame vote.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the 500-home run club is even more privileged.
McGwire entered Tuesday needing two homers to become the 16th
player to reach 500. It's not his fault he makes it look
ridiculously easy by going deep 14 times in 18-game stretches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' McGwire said. ``It's not easy at all. You
know it, everybody in the game knows it. And I think people take me
for granted because I hit them in such streaks. They don't realize
how difficult it is.''
</P>
<P>
   How hard is it to hit 500 home runs? Lou Gehrig didn't hit 500
home runs. Willie Stargell didn't hit 500 home runs. Stan Musial,
Carl Yastrzemski and Johnny Bench. They all had their reasons,
ranging from fatal illness to military service to simple wear and
tear.
</P>
<P>
   Power draws the oohs and awe, be it the 100-mph fastball or the
500-foot blast. The changeup and the ground-ball single are about
as sexy as Rush Limbaugh in Speedos. Still, anybody who would turn
a nose up at 3,000 hits should consider this: The feat was beyond
the reach of Rogers Hornsby, who had a .358 lifetime batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, Frank Robinson, Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio all
settled for less than 3,000 hits. Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex
Rodriguez led the American League with 213 hits last season. A guy
could keep up that pace for 14 seasons and still not get to
3,000.Don't make the mistake, then, of taking any of this for
granted. These things don't happen every year, even if it seems
like it lately.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, Tris Speaker and Eddie Collins became the fifth and
sixth players to reach 3,000 hits. More than 17 years passed before
the club welcomed its next member, Paul Waner. Nearly 16 full years
passed before Stan Musial became the next player to reach 3,000.
Seven players joined the club in the 1970s, but only one in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs entered the majors in '82. He batted .361 the next year,
lashing 200 hits for the first of seven consecutive seasons. Gwynn
entered the majors in '82 but needed a little more time to
establish himself as a hitman. He became a regular in '84, batting
.351 and producing his first 200-hit season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of hitter I wanted to be like,'' Gwynn said.
``He became the hunted. He's the guy you had to chase. He became
the guy I wanted to be like. I wanted to emulate what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   While Boggs made the rounds in the American Leauge, Gwynn
entrenched himself as a San Diego Padres lifer. They've had the
luxury of admiring each other from afar, fellow artists rather than
competitors. Boggs never won a batting title at Gwynn's expense, or
vice versa.
</P>

VIVID COLORS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND

   The display on your cell phone or palmtop organizer may be a
rigid, black-and-white affair now, but that's going to change, some
experts say. Portable displays of the future will be both brightly
colored and flexible, with screens pliant enough to roll up like
place mats.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the dream of many in the world of flat-panel
displays, who say that within the decade the simple read-outs of
devices like cell phones and car navigation systems, and the more
complicated displays of palmtop organizers and laptops, are going
to slim down and brighten up.
</P>
<P>
   How might this be? As the businessman counseled Dustin Hoffman
in ``The Graduate'': plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Some plastics, or polymers, as they are known technically, can
be made to emit visible light. Scientists have been doing this in
laboratories for the past 10 years, applying electricity to certain
plastic substances and watching them shine.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as with the liquid crystal technology that now
dominates flat-panel displays, the polymers can be made to glow
blue, green or red, depending upon their particular structure, and
when combined can re-create all the colors in nature.
</P>
<P>
   But where liquid crystal displays require a light source and are
still relatively bulky and quite rigid, plastics that emit color
can be made into very thin sheets cheaply, and can be shaped into
an endless variety of forms.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by early successes in laboratories, dozens of alliances
have developed between research groups and companies to exploit
these properties to improve flat-screen products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polymers have many advantages,'' said Dr. I.D.W. Samuel, a
lecturer in physics at the University of Durham in England and head
of the light-emitting polymer research group there. ``The materials
can roll up. They are robust and won't shatter when you drop them.
And plastics are remarkably easy to manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts are predicting an enormous market for the new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like a display that gives off its own light, rather
than a liquid crystal that is using light from the room or
backlit,'' said David E. Mentley, vice president of Stanford
Resources in San Jose, Calif., a marketing research firm that
specializes in electronic displays. ``Just imagine replacing liquid
crystal displays with a thin plastic sheet that is emitting light
in full color spectrum that is the same as you see on your TV
screen _ without a bulky cathode ray tube.''
</P>
<P>
   The first applications of light-emitting polymers are likely to
be in devices that display relatively little information, like
mobile telephones, which now have simple monochrome displays, said
Dr. Bill Barnes, senior lecturer in physics at the University of
Exeter in England, and a researcher in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phones of the future, though, will probably not only
deliver brief messages but also show movies and Web pages. For
these applications, users will want a display with color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobile phones will have color displays, and be much thinner,''
said Mentley. ``The trend is relentlessly toward designs that fit
into the pocket without bulge or weight. They will most likely be
as disposable as a used credit card, and about the same size.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Resources estimates that the overall market for plastic
and related light-emitting devices, known generally as organic
light-emitting diodes, will be $716 million by 2005, with a total
flat-panel display market of $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 research labs and companies are developing
technology in the field, using not only polymers but other, smaller
organic molecules that emit light in response to electrical
stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   The companies include Philips Electronics, Pioneer, Cambridge
Display Technology, DuPont, the Dow, IBM, Eastman Kodak, Covion
Organic Semiconductors, and Hewlett-Packard, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be three to five years before light-emitting
polymers move from small displays to the notebook computer market,
Mentley predicted. But they are likely to be well-suited to the
market: because they are self-illuminated, they reduce the number
of components like polarizers, backlights and color filters
necessary in the manufacture of liquid crystal displays, lowering
not only the size of the monitor but its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, notebook computers that are about an inch thick are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the display takes up about a third of that inch,'' Mentley
said. ``Organic light-emitting diodes can take away a lot of that
heft.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther away are other applications like thin, pull-down,
wall-sized screens that descend to show football games, rock
concerts and advertising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most polymer light-emitting displays being developed in
prototype or in pilot plants now apply the plastic onto glass
substrates, but within a few years the foundations may be plastic
too, permitting the possibility of rolling and unrolling the
displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polymer substrates are important not only for flexibility, but
for their low cost in manufacturing'' and their resistance to
breaking said Dr. Alan Heeger, a professor of physics at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, and founder and chief
technical officer of the Uniax company there.
</P>
<P>
   Uniax has developed a technology for using light-emitting
polymers for flat panel displays and has licensed it to Philips
Electronics. Heeger has demonstrated plastic substrates both in the
university and at his company, but says that the plastics currently
available still pose problems, because they are permeable to oxygen
and water vapor. Glass can be hermetically sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polymer substrates are still a few years from coming to
reality,'' Heeger said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though products using color-emitting organic molecules are
still in their infancy, the new technology is about to transform
the electronic display industry, Mentley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when the industry appeared to have settled down and
liquid crystal displays had wrung all the uncertainty out of the
flat panel display business, a disruptive technology comes along to
reshape thinking,'' said Mentley. ``That is what organic
light-emitting diodes are doing now.''

   There was no Home Depot in the 17th century, when the French
Huguenots settled along the fertile banks of the Wallkill River in
what is now New Paltz, N.Y. Only willpower, combined with clay,
sand and stone.
</P>
<P>
   From these materials, the French Protestants built a street of
stone houses with deeply furrowed roof lines and heavily timbered
ceilings. This quiet treasure, called Huguenot Street, is tucked
away from college-town burger joints and other modern tumult: ``a
whole village of virtually undisturbed prerevolutionary
18th-century dwellings,'' in the words of Morrison Heckscher, the
curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The historic stone houses, seven in all, hark back to 1677, when
the land they sit on was purchased from the Esopus Indians and paid
for in kettles, axes, adzes, stockings, knives, needles, blankets
and bars of lead. The charm of these age-old places, where waffles
and applesauce were cooked on open hearths, endures. But their
chimneys don't.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat in desperation that the Huguenot Historical
Society, the street's longtime steward, decided to repair the
crumbling chimneys of Huguenot Street, the oldest street in America
with original houses and a National Historic Landmark, by
resurrecting 17th-century brick-making techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted many brickmakers all over the U.S. who specialize
in historic brick,'' said the society's assistant director, Stewart
Crowell, who comes from a Hudson Valley family of brick-mold
makers. Even Colonial Williamsburg could not come close to
duplicating the size, color and texture of the original Wallkill
River bricks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the society has enlisted volunteers to replicate the Hudson
Valley thins, as the inch-and-a-half-thick bricks were known, using
Wallkill River clay dug out with a nonpre-Colonial dump truck and
backhoe and then mixed with local sand and water.
</P>
<P>
   On 100-degree weekends last month, a motley array of three dozen
volunteer brick enthusiasts shunned the beach in favor of tromping
around barefoot in squishy clay.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard they were going to play with a lot of clay, I
just had to come over and help,'' said Betsy Gilson, 40, a teacher.
``Occasionally the clay would hit someone. It reminded me of ``I
Love Lucy,'' she added, alluding to the landmark episode in which
Lucy stomps grapes and throws punches in a wine vat.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley has a long brick-making tradition. Between
1815 and the 1940s, nearly 150 brickyards lined the banks of the
river, ferrying bricks made from its clay deposits to New York,
where they became buildings. Today, only one brick plant is left _
Coeymans, just south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clay is magnetic,'' said George W. Pixley, 74, a retired brick
maker from Newburgh, who was on hand one weekend to cheer on the
troops. ``Once you touch it, you have to touch it again.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers have so far made about 1,300 hand-wedged thins,
and counting. The bricks will spend the next couple of months
lolling about in the sun, drying. Each brick is perfectly
imperfect. They are slightly crooked and eccentric, befitting the
days when bricks were made by hand and varied from region to
region.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this fall, the bricks will be fired and then take their
place atop the ancient roofs, laid with high lime mortar, a more
forgiving material than modern portland cement.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a festive air has enveloped Huguenot Street,
where 300 years of history is molded into every brick. The annual
Stone House Day, with period cooking, sheep shearing, harpsichord
music and other arts and crafts, will be held on Saturday, Aug 21.

BRAZILIAN CHEMISTRY: A SAMBA BEAT FOR `CARMEN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Carmen herself is still recognizable as
the tragically alluring Gypsy, but the toreador has been
transformed into a soccer player and all the famous arias are sung
to a syncopated 2/4 beat. There have been many productions of
Bizet's ``Carmen'' over the last 125 years, but never one quite
like Augusto Boal's samba version.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is Brazil's most renowned theater director, Boal
studied chemical engineering at Columbia University in the early
1950s, and when asked to describe what he set out to do, resorted
to the language of science. His ``Carmen,'' he said, is an amalgam
of two genres of music that until now had been thought of as polar
opposites. ``You mix two substances and get a third, but the
original identity of the two substances is still there,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The result is what he calls a ``samb-opera,'' defined as
``neither samba nor opera but something that attempts to
incorporate the best elements of both,'' the swing and informality
of samba and the drama and grandeur of opera.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, theatergoers in Rio, where Boal's funkified
``Carmen'' is scheduled to continue through Aug. 22, initially seem
uncertain how to react, smiling and nudging each other when they
hear the first bars of the overture performed as an undulating
samba.
</P>
<P>
   But Boal and those working with him emphasize that their
production is not intended as a spoof, and after a few confused
moments the audience seems to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view this project as a tremendous homage to Bizet,'' said
Marcos Leite, the production's musical director and arranger. ``If
we didn't admire him, we wouldn't have been able to do this. With a
French author writing about a main character who is a Gypsy and a
story that takes place in Spain, this was a multicultural work to
begin with, and that's what makes it so adaptable to a Brazilian
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Boal and Leite have left Bizet's melodies almost intact,
preferring instead to Brazilianize the opera with an injection of
home-grown rhythms and instrumentation, including the cavaquinho, a
ukelele-like string instrument essential to samba. Nearly every
style of music developed here over the last century is represented:
not just samba but also the frevo, choro, maxixe, baiao and even a
tango that wandered up from Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, though, the seeds for the production were sown not in
Brazil but in the homeland of Bizet, where Boal lived in exile for
eight years and which he still visits regularly. He recalled that
as part of a festival he organized in Paris in the early 1980s, two
Brazilian men in the program decided to sing ``La Habanera''
dressed as Carmen Miranda. ``It was a joke, but I felt right away
that it could develop into something really cool,'' Boal said in an
interview at the Rio apartment that he shares with his wife,
Cecilia, an actress. ``It seemed perfectly sensible to me to
appropriate this opera and try to adapt it from a Brazilian point
of view.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the sort of thing Boal, 68, has been doing throughout
his career, which began in Sao Paulo nearly 45 years ago. At the
Teatro Arena there, he made his name both by encouraging Brazilian
playwrights and actors to find their own themes and styles of
expression and by ``nationalizing the classics,'' as he puts it,
giving Moliere, Shakespeare, Lope de Vega and Euripides a Brazilian
flavor and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to choose just one phrase to explain Augusto's
importance, it would be that he decolonized or de-Europeanized the
Brazilian theater,'' said Fernanda Montenegro, the Brazilian
actress who was nominated for an Oscar this year for her
performance in ``Central Station'' but is better known here for
decades of work in the theater. ``He put Brazil on the stage and
dedicated himself to Brazilian authors, Brazilian speech and a
Brazilian esthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   In revamping ``Carmen,'' Boal was also able to draw on a long
fascination and familiarity with Brazilian popular music. His
theater company introduced the Tropicalist movement to mainstream
Brazilian audiences in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in tone and theme Boal's ``Carmen'' is a change of pace
from much of his other work, which has been heavily politicized. He
is the author of ``Theater of the Oppressed'' and many other
theoretical treatises and often conducts theater workshops abroad,
including a three-week program at New York University in July. The
workshops focus on what he calls ``the use of theater to help bring
about social transformation'' and break down barriers between
performers and what he has renamed ``the spect-actor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater cannot be imprisoned inside theatrical buildings, just
as religion cannot be imprisoned inside churches,'' he wrote in
``Legislative Theater: Using Performance to Make Politics,'' his
most recent manifesto, published in English last year. ``The
language of theater and its forms of expression cannot be the
private property of actors, just as religious practice cannot be
appropriated by priests as theirs alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such theories did not make Boal popular with the generals who
ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. In 1971, at the height of the
repression here, he was arrested, tortured and in his words
banished from the country. Freed partly as a result of protests by
playwrights and actors in Europe and the United States, he spent
the next 15 years in exile in Argentina, Portugal and France.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Paris that Boal met Claudia Ohana, whom he recruited
to play Carmen. She was visiting France for the premiere of
``Innocent Erendira,'' the movie version of the Gabriel Garcia
Marquez novella in which she played the title role, and Boal
happened to be directing a stage version of the same work. They hit
it off and resolved to work together someday. ``I was very young
then, 18, much too young to do a Carmen,'' Ms. Ohana said. ``But
Carmen is an outsize personality, a mythical character who is a
fetish in the head of any actress. It was a challenge, but one I
couldn't refuse when Augusto presented it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boal remains involved in leftist causes. He was a city
councilman here for the Workers Party in the mid-1990s, but he said
during the interview that much of his earlier work suffered from a
tendency to deal with abstractions and not real people, to talk of
the proletariat or women and not individuals. He paused, then
restated the idea in the style of his writing: ``The we is made of
many I's, and I am not we, I am I.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The language and concepts are sometimes opaque, but actors and
authors who have worked with him say that Boal's theoretical side
never gets in the way of a good show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work with him, you never feel overwhelmed by the
presence of a guru,'' said Ms. Montenegro, who was directed by Boal
in a production of Racine's ``Phaedra'' in the 1980s. ``He is
someone who binds things together, who doesn't neuroticize the
group, who comes in with a lot of humanity and recognizes that the
complex can be made simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ohana said that when she was offered the role of Carmen, ``I
was afraid at first'' because of a lack of professional singing
experience but that she was gradually calmed and given confidence
by Boal. ``He is very psychological in the way he approaches
things, in the way he works with the characters and the cast,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The success that ``Carmen'' is having here has led Boal and
Leite to plan samba treatments of perhaps ``Il Barbiere di
Siviglia'' or ``La Traviata,'' though ``Le Nozze di Figaro'' is
also appealing because they consider Mozart's music the supreme
challenge. ``We realize we are creating a new genre here, and we
know you can't do that with just one work,'' Leite explained. Boal
added: ``I want to understand what samb-opera is so that I can
continue to do it.''

SERVICE OFFERS HIGH-SMOG ALERTS THROUGH PAGERS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Aguilar, a gym teacher in Southern California, once used a
rough method to check the smog level before taking his students
outside: If he could not see the hills two miles away, he kept them
in.
</P>
<P>
   Now the local environmental agency sends Aguilar smog alerts by
pager. The service started as a pilot project this spring and if it
catches on, any Southern California resident will be able to
subscribe to smog alerts through pager companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
distributed pagers in March to 70 people, most of them athletes,
coaches or parents of asthmatic children. The agency's computers
receive data from 30 air monitoring stations in the region. When
smog increases, an alert is sent by e-mail to pager companies.
Daily smog forecasts are also sent.
</P>
<P>
   Such speedy notification can make a difference in Southern
California, which has the most reliably unhealthy air in the
nation. In the summer, the ozone level rises and the sky becomes a
brown soup of minute particles. In the first six months of this
year, ozone reached unhealthy levels on 13 days. For most people
the smog means nothing worse than headaches, scratchy throats and
stinging eyes. But others suffer worse consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Alberts, 12, of Alta Loma, Calif., once passed out at
recess during a smog episode. Catherine and her brother, Michael,
have asthma, so their mother, Roxana, volunteered for the pager
program. During the school year, with the daily smog forecast sent
by pager at 11:30 each morning, she can plan whether to send a note
to school to have the children excused from gym class. If
conditions change during the day, she can call the school. In
recent weeks, the pager has sent smog alerts two or three times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a little bit more time to plan ahead,'' Ms.
Alberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The air quality agency offers several other ways for the public
to check air quality. Daily forecasts go to media outlets, an
automated telephone service and a Web site provide constant
updates, and faxes are sent to schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pager just takes it one more step and delivers the message
instantly,'' said Sam Atwood, a spokesman for the air-quality
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The service is a far cry from how the agency notified the public
of smog episodes 10 years ago, Atwood said. At that time, agency
interns would be assigned to call dozens of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For Aguilar, the gym teacher, the information by pager takes the
guesswork out of whether to hold class as usual at his middle
school, in Pico Rivera. It also gives students fewer excuses to get
out of gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids say, `It's a smoggy day today,''' Aguilar said, ``and
I can say: `Nope. According to my pager, it's not.'''

 IT'S SOSA VS. McGWIRE ALL OVER AGAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROSS McKEON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Another riveting home-run race is brewing. But
are we ready? Are we excited? It's Big Mac vs. Slammin' Sammy II.
Mark McGwire vs. Sammy Sosa. The great long-ball chase of '98
redux.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to one word of McGwire's claims that his '98 record
of 70 homers can't be achieved again. The numbers are as glaringly
obvious as his bulging biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Through Tuesday night's games, Chicago's most popular Cubbie,
Sosa, and St. Louis' favorite son, McGwire, were locked atop the
major-league home-run lead with 41 apiece. Because he has three
more games remaining than McGwire, Sosa is on pace to hit 64, while
Mac is right behind at 63. A hot streak here or there and the 70
barrier might be within reach.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule appears to be in Sosa's favor. The Cubs play a
majority of their remaining 58 games at homer-friendly Wrigley
Field. McGwire's home and road schedule is split nearly right down
the middle, but his shots go out anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has some catching up to do to match his '98 pace.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his 42nd homer in Game 89 last year. Then again, he set
an NL record with 16 homers in July. Sosa, who finished with 66
long balls last year, hit No. 42 in his 106th game.
</P>
<P>
   Fans seem to be dialed in, even though the media hysteria has
yet to hit '98 proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are the No. 1 road draw in the National League _
attracting an average of 35,734 fans as visitors _ and the Cubs are
not far behind at No. 2 (33,232).
</P>
<P>
   When St. Louis made its most recent visit to Candlestick Park in
San Francisco for a three-game series July 26-28, 101,014 were on
hand even though two of the games were midweek afternoon affairs.
The 33,671 average crowd to see the Cardinals dwarfed the average
throng of 23,767 for all other Giants home games this season.
</P>
<P>
   When the fans turn out, they're expecting a show whether it's in
batting practice or in the game. There are no Y2K glitches in
Sosa's or McGwire's swings.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire told the Associated Press, ``Getting hits is a little
bit easier than hitting home runs, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the big bopper's numbers suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has more homers than singles (38) this season. That was
the case last year, too (70-61), and during the two months he was a
Cardinal in 1997 after getting traded by the A's (24-17).
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's numbers, like last year's (112 singles, 66 home runs),
are more balanced.
</P>
<P>
   He has 20 more singles than homers. Then again, he's drawn far
fewer walks (88 for McGwire, 42 for Sosa) and the powerful
outfielder has struck out more than the first baseman, 108-88.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe pressure or media attention will bother
either player. They went through more intense daily scrutiny last
year, when they both topped Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit 10 homers last August and 15 in September. Sosa
swatted 13 in August and 10 in September.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire openly admits his distaste for the added attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa just grins and bears it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fascination with numbers started when Rotisserie baseball
became big, probably 10 years ago,'' McGwire was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's stats coming out of the woodwork that nobody ever knew
about that I think sometimes blow things way out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but it's hard to ignore another big-numbers home-run
chase.

ELEMENTAL AS WATER: THE POOL HOUSE AS MUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pursuit of delight, especially in the garden, has been an
architectural commandment since the Roman architect and engineer
Vitruvius set down his own Mosaic laws in the first century B.C.
(The goals were to include ``commodity, firmness and delight,'' he
declared.)
</P>
<P>
   Architecture history is well endowed with pavilions that deliver
their occupants to panoramas of nature; designers shaping garden
rooms are often hypnotized by the prospect of adding another
chapter to this rich tradition. Unencumbered by the functional
demands of kitchens, closets and bedrooms, pavilions can be
designed without the usual constraints and without the safety net
of excuses. Designers do not toss them off lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Pool houses in suburbia, though, are another matter. Working
cousins of the more aloof garden follies _ with their ancestral
pedigrees _ these chlorine-perfumed repositories of musty towels,
Ping-Pong tables and teen-agers have been overlooked as a serious
genre.
</P>
<P>
   In one backyard in West Hartford, Conn., however, the New York
architect David Kriegel elevated the pool house from its status as
a common utility structure to a true garden pavilion. A plywood
shanty had existed next to the kidney-shaped pool belonging to
Joseph and Sonia Gerber. ( Gerber had designed and built the
plywood pool house himself.) After demolition, all that remained
was a concrete pad and a back retaining wall, both of which would
be integrated into a new building.
</P>
<P>
   Kriegel offered four designs for the small structure, but
Gerber, an inventor and industrialist who won the National Medal of
Technology in 1994 (awarded by President Clinton), had an
engineer's sense of economy. He encouraged the architect to use as
few elements as possible. ``He was an excellent critic,'' Kriegel
said of Gerber, who died three years ago, shortly after the pool
house was built. ``The first designs were complicated, and I
stripped elements away until I was left with only what was needed.
It was an exercise in reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kriegel finally drew inspiration from the simplicity of the
surrounding garden, whose serpentine stone walls complemented the
curves of the pool. ``I wanted to integrate the pool house with the
landscaping,'' he said. The architect extended the idea of the low
garden wall with a spiral of stone that encloses an outdoor shower,
open near the ceiling. A few steps away he built two changing
cabins, sheathed in redwood. ``Redwood doesn't rot outdoors, and
it's dimensionally stable,'' Kriegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The cabins look very much man-made, in contrast with the
naturalistic shower wall. Steel columns carry a carefully designed
assembly of redwood beams and rafters, supporting a corrugated
fiberglass roof, whose aqua coloring and wavy profile echo the
water in the pool. The structure, which is 100 square feet, cost
about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was rational. ``That appealed to my clients,''
Kriegel said.
</P>
<P>
   But the design went beyond the rational. ``I love the contrast
in textures,'' said Mrs. Gerber, who was trained as an artist. ``I
like the openness to the out-of-doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The lyricism of the spiral and the naturalism of the materials
are tempered by a quirky asymmetry: on one side, a single steel
column holds a pair of beams, and on the other, a pair of columns
supports a single beam. ``It does have a sense of humor,'' Kriegel
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The elemental quality of the wood and stone is contradicted by
the aqua-colored columns and the translucent fiberglass roof, which
tints the interior blue-green. ``I've never done anything this
small before,'' said Kriegel, who designed the vast, hyperkinetic
Virgin Mega Store in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Small, perhaps, but packed with mixed messages. Nesting against
the old retaining wall, and built of stone and natural wood, the
pool house recalls Frank Lloyd Wright's simple Usonian houses, odes
to democratic building and nature that often intensified the
landscape. Kriegel throws a swerve at the idyllic harmony with the
corrugated fiberglass and aqua paint, and with the puckish humor of
the columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the components has a different personality that speaks
to the others,'' Kriegel said. The simplicity of the straight-lined
structure with the floating roof is also related to Mies van der
Rohe's pavilions. But Kriegel's structure, with its diverse
elements, has a complex simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   An object of contemplation across the pool, the pool house is an
object lesson in his practice, influencing his subsequent designs.
``In many ways, it was architecture without interference, without
compromises,'' he said, ``which is unheard of. The pool house
remains one of my favorite projects, as tiny as it is.''

<P>
   A scientific powerhouse is assembled. Physicists from Oxford and
Cambridge, MIT and Berkeley are put to work, coordinating their
efforts with research teams in Helsinki, Montreal and India. Pure
mathematicians clock thousands of man-hours. Millions of dollars
are invested. High-powered computers on three continents are
strained to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the quest for cold fusion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an ivory tower attempt to hack Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   It's a company called Mathengine, whose sole purpose is to make
video games appear to adhere to Newton's laws of motion, so that
rope bridges can wobble realistically and bullets can ricochet
accurately and the pneumatic heroine of Tomb Raider can jiggle as
she runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Lara Croft today, she's solid,'' said Alan
Milosevic, Mathengine's chief executive. ``Her arms and legs move,
OK, but the rest of her doesn't ripple or move or anything. And it
should. When she runs, her breasts should move and her clothes
should move. And underpinning that will be some really hairy
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game programmers have woken up to the fact that that means
physics. And you need research physicists and mathematicians to do
it. It's no good, a game programmer dusting off a few high-school
textbooks and saying `Hey, I'm now going to do these really complex
calculations with differential equations to solve all this stuff,'
because that guy isn't going to have a clue. You wouldn't expect a
game programmer to build a rocket, and exactly the same applies to
physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathengine's challenge is to engineer a software tool kit that
allows game designers to specify the qualities of three-dimensional
objects and see those objects behave in a real-world fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' Milosevic said, ``if you want a ball to bounce
off a table, you have to get a good physicist to work out Newton's
laws of motion in software, then apply a whole bunch of other
complex physics to make the ball behave realistically. And so far,
you've just solved this particular problem. You haven't solved any
of the problems to do with fluids or particle systems or joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, there would be an environment in your
computer that would allow you to simply enter what type of ball it
is, to say that it's a squishy rubber ball, to give the
characteristics of the table. And then without any programming, the
ball will behave exactly as it should do if you dropped it.
Everything would happen automatically. The world is such an
environment. The world knows what to do with squishy-squashy
objects. Mathengine is an environment that is similar to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to simulate physics so well that game developers will
never need to improvise their own gravity ever again. As projects
go, this one is ridiculously ambitious. And to accomplish it,
Mathengine has had to create a halfway house between academia and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, it sort of reminded me of grad school with
money,'' said Bryan Galdrikian, who did research in theoretical
solid-state physics at the University of California at Santa
Barbara before he got into the video game industry. Like many
recent PhD graduates, his decision to leave the cloisters of
academe for the cubicles of game development was driven by a dearth
of teaching positions and a booming job market in the software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the laboratory, he was just another postdoctoral researcher
with programming skills. In the video game industry, he was a
hero-champion supergeek who could make objects dance in space. ``I
could write down a mathematical equation that would work for them,
and they thought that was great. They said, `Bryan, we need
something that will allow us to know how far this point is from
this wall.' And I gave them an equation. They're like, `And that
just (italics)works?'''(end italics) In the land of the blind, the
one-eyed man has very hot employment prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Galdrikian's graduate school colleagues have left
academia. ``It's amazing how many people jumped ship,'' he said.
``My girlfriend was one. She works at Autodesk. We have other
friends who are working at Internet start-ups, friends in L.A. who
are working on physics software for scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   In research, talent follows money. During the Cold War,
government money paid for military technology. In the new world
order of global telecommunications and digital media, corporate
money pays for commercial technology, and the talent follows. Stock
options trump tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just pulled a guy from Oxford University,'' Milosevic said.
``He was a senior lecturer. He was a fellow of one of the
university colleges, which means he had tenure. He had tenure at
Oxford, and now he has share options at Mathengine and the
opportunity to do some really amazing research. And we're about to
pull another two. The reality is, we're decimating the numerical
computing laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate the university for poaching its PhDs, Mathengine
has offered to bankroll academic research that might be useful to
the company. ``I could happily spend 250,00 pounds, a million
pounds, to put a chair in place to do research in fast numerical
methods, fluid dynamics, interactive humans,'' Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, corporate funding is prevalent in academia, if you
look at institutions like the MIT Media Lab. But a Quake
professorship at Oxford would be something new.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the prospect is less noble than secret Cold War
research. On the other hand, it does restore a certain glamour to
the scientific undertaking. Fifty years ago, kids wanted to be
rocket scientists because they were inspired by space exploration
and by the exciting possibilities of amateur pyrotechnics. Now
they're inspired by virtual space and the exciting possibilities of
custom-level design.
</P>
<P>
   The best and brightest minds of 2020 are peering at
computer-generated galaxies, wondering what's out there and how can
it be made to explode more realistically. If we figure out how to
teach them that way, we might even get them to finish their
homework.

NEBRASKA STUDENTS GETTING A LOOK AT THE INNARDS OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cables, circuits and switches that make up the Internet are
invisible to most people. But starting this fall, engineering
students at the University of Nebraska at Omaha will get a
firsthand look at exactly what route those Web pages and e-mail
messages travel before appearing on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   All they will have to do is look up.
</P>
<P>
   Above them, in classrooms and hallways, they will see dozens of
shiny red cables snaking along thin, stainless steel tracks hanging
from the ceiling. And if they walk past the glass walls of the
wiring closets, they will see bundles of red cables hanging from
black hooks, looking like giant, rubbery _ and relatively untangled
_ spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed lines are not the result of a bungled floor plan or
unfinished construction. They are there by design to show students
how buildings are engineered in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the building _ including its ducts and
plumbing _ are exposed as well. They are all part of the Peter
Kiewit Institute of Information Science, Technology and
Engineering, a $26.5 million building that opened this summer.
Peter Kiewit Sons is a large engineering company in Omaha that has
donated millions of dollars to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great desire to build something that wouldn't simply
house programs,'' said Winnie L. Callahan, the institute's
executive director. ``The idea of a building as laboratory came
immediately to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Integrated
Teaching and Learning Laboratory was built in 1997 using the same
philosophy _ its structure serves as a teaching tool for
engineering students _ but with less of an emphasis on cables and
networks. And in the past few decades, other buildings _ most
notably the Pompidou Center in Paris _ have been designed with the
purpose of exposing their insides, often for esthetics more than
education.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiewit institute carries the concept into an age in which
Internet connections are considered to be nearly as important to
the mechanics of a building as running water. Computer-engineering
students, educators say, must have a hands-on understanding of how
they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books are nice, but all the technical information in the world
doesn't give you the feel of a fiber-optics connection,'' said Dr.
Bing Chen, co-chairman of the computers and electronics engineering
program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. ``It doesn't give
you the sense of how all the networks are really distributed in a
building.''
</P>
<P>
   The students will be expected to do more than simply look at the
wiring, however. Professors at the institute say they will be
giving students a chance to manipulate the networks, working from
wiring closets and other areas where network traffic is routed.
Chen said he planned to have students literally watch the
electrical impulses flying over the wires using Hewlett-Packard
analyzers that help managers monitor networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like students to track it down, almost to the electron
level,'' Chen said, referring to Internet traffic. ``We aren't
interested in black boxes, where it just goes out into the ether.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democratic Leader Thomas A. Daschle
challenged the news media Wednesday to check out rumors of cocaine
use by Texas Gov. George W. Bush and accused reporters of letting
Bush _ the Republican presidential front-runner _ off the hook when
he refuses to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also accused the news media of having a double standard.
Reporters relentlessly question Hillary Rodham Clinton about
private aspects of her life, Daschle said, but the news media
``seem to accept'' Bush's evasive answers to questions about
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media in general seem to be respecting far more his
privacy and his lack of willingness to discuss his past than you
might have been with others,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has repeatedly declined to discuss cocaine or deny that he
used the drug when asked by reporters about rumors of drug use in
his past. He frequently seeks to end the discussion by saying,
``When I was young and crazy, I was young and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, as part of a massive seven-day series on
Bush, reported last week that Bush again declined to deny cocaine
use, saying only that he has ``learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game where they float rumors, force a person to
fight off a rumor,'' Bush told the Post. ``And I'm not going to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, asked by reporters if he thought it was fair to ask
political candidates if they have used cocaine, said, ``Sure, it's
a legitimate question. The second question is, if that person
denies it, how many press people _ investigators _ do you put on
his tail to find out whether he is telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota, said Bush is trying to
walk the fine line between his public and private life and ``may or
may not be successful at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle was quick to add that he himself has never used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say for the record: You have a right to ask me and
the answer is no,'' he said. ``I'm not sure I've ever seen it,
personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle expressed sympathy for Mrs. Clinton who is campaigning
in New York state where she's expected to announce her candidacy
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time she gets out there, somebody's asking
her private questions,'' Daschle said. ``If it isn't Tina Brown,
it's someone else who will keep pressing her for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Lady set off a firestorm of criticism this week when
Brown's new magazine, Talk, quoted Mrs. Clinton as blaming the
president's philandering on ``abuse'' he endured as a child when
his grandmother and mother fought over him.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, both the president and his wife sought to soften
the impact of the magazine interview by denying that she was trying
to make excuses for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be ``no holds barred'' in the media's pursuit
of stories about political candidates, Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases the media has been too invasive,'' he said.
``There comes a time when people who are considering public life
should be held to a higher standard. But you can't put it so high
that it's impossible to achieve that level of propriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also slammed the media for focusing on the internal
turmoil of Vice President Al Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, overall, we're satisfied that organizationally,
financially and personally that this campaign is coming together,
he said. ``Part of his problem is you all don't give him a break.
You don't let him up from the mat.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle also praised former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,
another presidential contender, as ``intellectually one of the most
potent candidates... on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats are having trouble rounding up good
candidates to run for office, largely because they balk at raising
the vast sums of money required to pay for a campaign. He pegged
the chances that the Democrats would gain control of the Senate in
the 2000 election as ``not quite 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle winced when asked whether he would support Jerry
Springer, the former mayor of Cincinnati who hosts one of
television's most popular and raunchiest entertainment shows, in
his possible run for the Senate in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of trouble with Jerry Springer,'' Daschle said.
``I don't want him to run, I think he's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Ohio is the one state in which Democrats haven't
recruited a candidate, partly because the race will inevitably be
quite expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer will never join our caucus,'' Daschle said.
``I'll tell you that.''

   BELLSOUTH _ For the fourth consecutive year, BellSouth has
checked in at the top slot in the JD Power ranking of local phone
companies _ only this time it has company. Tied for first with
Atlanta-based BellSouth is Southern New England Telephone (SNET),
which can offer long-distance _ an advantage that BellSouth still
lacks. SNET is now a subsidiary of SBC Communications, the San
Antonio-based regional Bell. Last week, JD Power ranked SNET the
best long-distance company for consumers spending less than $50 a
month on the service. Sprint was named the best long-distance
company for those spending more than $50 on the service. (Kanell,

   PILOTS _ ATLANTA _ Years of record pilot hiring by big airlines
has lowered the talent pool, prompting some smaller carriers to use
new means of finding qualified applicants. Help wanted ads, for
instance. This week ASA, the Delta feeder, ran a classified ad

like that for pilots,'' said Kit Darby of AIR Inc., which tracks
pilot job trends. ``We've eaten pretty deeply into the pilot
supply, although there are still a lot of people who want to be
pilots.'' In addition to advertising, smaller airlines also are
trimming minimum experience requirements and scrapping the practice
of making new hires buy their own initial training, which can cost
upwards of $10,000. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, PBS is under attack, this time for sharing its list
of donors with (horrors!) Democrats, among others. It adds more
fuel to the fire that public broadcasting is too liberal, and
shouldn't be funded with public money. I always thought that was
kind of silly, but now I'm beginning to see the light. Take, for
instance, the PBS flagship program Sesame Street. It's a veritable
hotbed of liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   First off, it's set in a big city _ traditionally a Democratic
stronghold. ``Roommates'' Bert and Ernie are obviously proponents
of alternative lifestyles. Big Bird is a big tree-hugger. Kermit is
a member of the Green Party. Grover brings to mind Grover Cleveland
_ a Democrat. Crayon artist Elmo is an NEA grant waiting to happen.
And just how long has Oscar been living in that garbage can,
abusing the welfare system?
</P>
<P>
   It's all so insidious. Take a look at some of PBS' other
programming:
</P>
<P>
   Teletubbies: Yeah, yeah, there's Tinky-Winky and the purse. But
those TVs in the Teletubbies' tummies are also a blatant reminder
of Hollywood _ another Democratic stronghold. And those pinwheels
on the farm look suspiciously like an alternate energy source.
</P>
<P>
   Barney and Friends: Dinosaur advances the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood: Trolley car endorses public
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Wishbone: Cute doggie advocates animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom: ``We're gonna zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom!'' What is that,
some sick drug reference?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nye the Science Guy: All science guys want to do is spend,
spend, spend.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur: Finally! A show about a traditional family. Except that
they're aardvarks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the humanities.

By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Grasshoppers have this annoying habit of
jumping up in your face just as you walk past them. There's no
warning _ one second they're on the ground minding their own
business, and the next they're careening past, around or straight
into you.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth has been crawling with grasshoppers since early July.
They're not just hiding in the grass, either: They are downtown,
hopping around on the hot sidewalks and hanging onto buildings.
</P>
<P>
   And although grasshoppers may be just icky
yellow-green-and-brown insects to some of us, to kids they're cool,
with educational potential. Here's what you need to know to turn
the summer plague into an entomological experience.
</P>
<P>
   FAST GRASSHOPPER FACTS
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY GET HERE:
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers don't like to hang out in the city. They'd love to
be munching on grass in an empty field in the country. But when
there's a drought, they can't get enough grass in those country
fields and are forced to commute. (That's when the more misguided
ones end up in parking lots and city streets.) When they realize
they need to find food elsewhere, grasshoppers fly; they hop up
into the wind and it carries them along.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll see an area _ say, Fort Worth, Texas _ that is green
and luxurious and has lots of food and water,'' said Tarrant County
extension agent Dotty Woodson. ``They'll choose to land in that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get here, they start laying eggs. Suddenly, we have a
new generation of city grasshoppers, born and raised in our own
back yards.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THEY LIKE TO BE
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers like tall grass; it's their favorite food. They
like to lay their eggs in a weedy patch of grass _ this makes it
easy for the baby grasshoppers to find food when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   To distract grasshoppers from the yummy plants and flowers in
your garden, try keeping one area of your landscape unmowed and
weedy. The grasshoppers will pack in like sardines in that grassy
patch.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN THEY'LL GO AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers and their damage will persist through August,
Woodson says. The natural biological balance gets out of control
when the grasshoppers invade, and for a while there aren't enough
of the natural predators and parasites that keep grasshoppers in
check. But those predators and diseases will build up eventually,
and then the grasshoppers will go away ... for now.
</P>
<P>
   TYPES OF GRASSHOPPERS:
</P>
<P>
   There are 150 species in Texas, but five species are responsible
for 90 percent of the damage:
</P>
<P>
   Differential grasshopper, ``Melanoplus differentialis:'' found
mostly in crops, not grassland. 1 1/8 to 1 3/4 inches long, with
black marks on the hind femur.
</P>
<P>
   Red-legged grasshopper, ``Melanoplus femurrubrum:/) also usually
found in crops. 7/8 to 1 1/4 inches long; hind tibia are red.
</P>
<P>
   Migratory grasshopper, ``Melanoplus sanguinipes:'' destructive
to grass as well as crops. 7/8 to 1 1/8 inches long; they are
strong fliers and can swim long distances.
</P>
<P>
   Two-striped grasshopper, ``Melanoplus bivitattus:'' Usually
found in weeds. 1 to 2 1/4 inches long; two light stripes from eyes
to wing tips.
</P>
<P>
   Packard grasshopper, ``Melanoplus packardii:'' Found in
grassland _ they prefer sandy soils and light grass cover. 1 1/8 to
1 1/2 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   FUN THINGS TO DO WITH GRASSHOPPERS:
</P>
<P>
   Watch them eat. Grasshoppers are chewing insects, so they have
very large mandibles, or jaws. If you stand still long enough, you
can see the grasshopper chomping on the leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out what they like to eat. In Denton County last year,
county extension agent//horticulturalist John Cooper started
observing which foods the grasshoppers in his area preferred. Among
the plants Cooper found grasshoppers eating ``with relish'': roses,
daylilies, irises, bush honeysuckle and cannas. They didn't like
crape myrtles, forsythia, moss rose, dwarf Mexican petunias or
lilacs.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson says grasshoppers are ``pretty doggone finicky eaters.''
Do a survey and check out what grasshoppers are eating in your
yard.
</P>
<P>
   WEIRD GRASSHOPPER FACTS:
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers lay eggs in the ground a couple of inches below the
surface. They die long before their young have hatched, so there
are no grasshopper families _ only generations.
</P>
<P>
   Chickens love grasshoppers; they're one of the best grasshopper
controls. A hungry cat, in fact, is also a decent grasshopper
control, but most people won't keep their cats that hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Adult grasshoppers can fly incredibly long distances by letting
the wind move them along. They travel for miles looking for food,
gliding along in the direction of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers molt five or six times in their lives. It takes
about two months for a grasshopper to mature.
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers breathe through 10 breathing pores on the sides of
their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers have one large compound eye on each side of their
head, so they can see in the front, back and sides. They also have
three single eyes, but scientists aren't sure about the purpose of
these eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Grasshoppers are making a worldwide appearance in pop culture. A
first-division Swiss soccer team and an Austrian baseball team are
both called the Grasshoppers (does the baseball team have a chance
against the Vienna Lawnmowers?). Grasshopper is also the name of a
pop music group in Hong Kong and an ``acoustadelic groove'' band
from Seattle, popular in the Northwest and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   EATING GRASSHOPPERS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Early man ate grasshoppers every time he got a chance,'' says
Armin Karbach, aquarium and insectarium curator at the Fort Worth
Zoo. Eating bugs is officially called ``entomophagy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Food Insects Newsletter'' July 1996 issue,
grasshoppers are high in protein but also high in fat _ a large
grasshopper can have more than 6 fat grams. Find full insect
nutritional information is available at

Institute, no less, at

DON'T BUG THE BUGS, GARDEN EXPERT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bugs. A lot of people see them and respond with the bottom of
their shoe. John Howard Garrett, a local gardening expert on all
things organic, sees them as a positive byproduct of a
chemical-free way of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Garrett's eyes, very few bugs are bad, most are beneficial,
and several, wasps for example, are downright gorgeous. Garrett,
who tends to vault onto his soapbox at every chance, teamed with
Malcolm Beck, a like-minded soul, to write the definitive work on
regional insects, the ``Texas Bug Book'' (University of Texas
Press, $24.95, soft cover).
</P>
<P>
   The book is a hit. Bugs, it seems, are much more attractive than
``Plants of the Metroplex,'' another Garrett tome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is outselling my others,'' he says. ``It appeals to
groups I never even considered. Children are fascinated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the subject may be off-putting to some, those who open the
cover are almost immediately captivated.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks haven't spent much time looking at bugs since their
roller-skating, scabby-knee days. This book takes readers back to
the time when a stick and a bug meant hours of summertime
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The authors beguile their readers with homey stories about their
bug observations, satisfy the scholarly with all the scientific
names and descriptions, and tempt the bookstore browser with a
multitude of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A useful appendix lists beneficial insects, the reason they make
the good-guy list and their preferred habitat. Garrett includes his
basic organic program and some of his most-requested organic
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The road to publication was rough for Beck and Garrett. The way
was littered with the objections of several doctorate-wielding
entomologists who kept the presses from running for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general philosophy of the book is: If you have healthy
soil, plants can resist diseases and insects as well. Some
entomologists don't believe plants have an immune system. We do,''
Garrett says.
</P>
<P>
   Writing the book changed some of Garrett's notions about what
were acceptable gardening methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have completely changed my recommendations on pesticides,''
he says. ``I don't like the organic pesticides any more than the
chemical ones. They kill beneficials. So Malcolm and I have
switched over to biological things or use repellents. Garlic, for
example, is a systemic, it's a cleansing kind of thing, and it
works as a repellent, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes more and more apparent, if you understand how it
works, that we need all these bugs. Nature is in balance. We are
the ones who have created the imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``We have to stimulate life, we've got to stop
killing and we have to stop trying to dominate the systems. By
eliminating the chemical pesticides and fertilizers, we'll see
better results and more bugs. But that's a good sign.''

MYSTERY WRITERS PICK THEIR FAVORITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No two mystery buffs could probably agree on an all-time list of
best mystery writers and books. Nonetheless, we've asked a few
prominent mystery writers to share their five personal favorites
with the ``Star Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker is best-known for his classic ``Spenser''
mystery series. In September, ``Family Honor'' will introduce Sunny
Randall, Parker's first female protagonist. He picks:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Big Sleep'' by Raymond Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Maltese Falcon'' by Dashiell Hammett.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Elmore Leonard, any and all of his books. They're all
equally good.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Rex Stout. All his Nero Wolfe books seem equally good from
the very beginning of when they appeared, I think in the 1930s.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Friends of Eddie Coyle'' by George V. Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley Pearson's ``The First Victim'' is the latest of his Lou
Boldt novels to receive critical raves for its painstaking research
and, in particular, detailed descriptions of forensic
investigation. He picks:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Crime and Punishment'' by Fyodor Dostoevski: ``This is the
benchmark psychological suspense novel of all time.
</P>
<P>
   2: ``All the Sherlock Holmes works by Arthur Conan Doyle. I
can't pick one above the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   3: ``Woman in White'' by Wilkie Collins. ``I know others cite
`Moonstone,' but this book has so many great twists and turns.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The entire body of work by John MacDonald. If I had to pick
one, I guess it would be `The Dreadful Lemon Sky.' ''
</P>
<P>
   5. Dave Barry's ``Big Trouble.'' ``It's his first full-length
novel. You're going to see him step right in with a book that's
very funny, a very legitimate entry into the genre of the caper
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Evanovich, whose current Stephanie Plum mystery, ``High
Five,'' ranks high in every national bestseller list. She picks:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``True Crime'' by Andrew Klaven.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Black Ice'' by Michael Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Brazen Virtue'' by Nora Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The Godwulf Manuscript'' by Robert B. Parker.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Free Fall'' by Robert Crais.
</P>
<P>
   Kinky Friedman, whose next novel, ``Spanking Watson,'' will be
published in September: He picks:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``A Study in Scarlet'' by Arthur Conan Doyle: ``All the
Holmes stories are special for their unique, oddly comforting
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Widows of Broome'' by Arthur W. Upfield: ``This
Australian series of books featuring half-aborigine Napoleon
Bonaparte is as wild and varied as the country in which everything
takes place, and scary as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Big Sleep'' by Raymond Chandler: ``Philip Marlowe is
the spiritual pioneer in the American hard-boiled detective
genre.''
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The Green Ripper'' by John D. MacDonald: ``MacDonald's
whole series of books reflects sympathy for the ecology of this
planet, and empathy for the rare enough triumphs of love and
life.''
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The League of Frightened Men'' by Rex Stout: ``Nero Wolfe
is one of my all-time favorite characters. Rex Stout was
unappreciated in his day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Guinn's picks:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``The Maltese Falcon'' by Dashiell Hammett: Hammett did it
first and did it best. Without Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler and
Philip Marlowe might never have seen print.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold'' by John le Carre: Ian
Fleming's James Bond got most of the early publicity, but no spy
novel was written then or since that can top this book by le Carre.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'' by Agatha Christie: Hercule
Poirot in an early incarnation, and absolutely the best plot twist
in the long, honorable history of the whodunit genre.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``The First Deadly Sin'' by Lawrence Sanders: The ``Deadly
Sin'' series featuring Edward X. Delaney was hard-boiled literary
gold, especially this first adventure with Delaney pursuing a
serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Quiller Memorandum,'' by Adam Hall: His ``Quiller''
series was written for the intellectual fan and segued nicely over
two decades from Cold War shenanigans to more modern international
turmoil.

can help. The giant toy maker announced this week that it will
release desktop computers with Barbie- and Hot Wheels-themed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are increasingly very early adopters,'' said David
Haddad, president of Mattel Media. ``Our marketing research reveals
that 4-year-olds are very active computer users.''
</P>
<P>
   For $599, the computers, which will be available in September,
will come with a 3 gigabytes hard drive, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
15-inch color monitor, CD-ROM drive, educational and entertainment
software, and a 333 magaherz Intel Celeron processor, which is a
lower-end version of the Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it has a kids' target audience doesn't mean it's
not every bit as adultlike in terms of its functionality.'' Hadda
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hot Wheels computer will have a steering wheel for video
games and the Barbie model have a pink digital camera. And both
will have a 56K fax/modem, for those important toddler documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a key feature to the lineup,'' Haddad conceded. ``I
don't know that we expect kids to fax themselves.''

   Online Medical Information Does Poorly on Accuracy Exam
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning field of online medical information was recently
given a physical exam, and the prognosis was not good. According to
a study published this week in the journal Cancer, more than a
third of the medical sites scrutinized had not been subjected to
peer review. And at least 6 percent of them contained information
that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Sybil Biermann, an orthopedic oncologist, and three
colleagues at the University of Michigan conducted the study. They
reviewed nearly 400 Web pages retrieved by four search engines
after they searched variations of the words ``Ewing sarcoma,'' a
form of bone cancer that occurs in children and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   A few sites, for example, overstated or understated the
disease's survival rate, which experts estimate to be 70 percent to
75 percent. The researchers found that the site of Encyclopaedia
Britannica said the mortality rate was 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such information could lead a parent away from worthwhile
therapy, Dr. Biermann wrote. ``The devastating effect these
postings would have on vulnerable patients is incalculable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Panelas, a spokesman for Encyclopaedia Britannica, said that
the company planned to fix the problem by posting a new article or
deleting the passage about the disease's mortality rate. He added
that Britannica would update its entries on cancer this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Dr. Biermann said in an interview, is changing the
dynamics of traditional medicine. ``It used to be that the
physicians deliver the information, the patient accepts it, and
that is that,'' she said. Now, ``in many cases physicians are not
even the primary information provider.'' To avoid disastrous
consequences, or confusion, Dr. Biermann recommends that patients
ask doctors for their interpretations of what shows up on line, and
that doctors refer patients to reputable, peer-reviewed sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can put information on the Internet about any medical
condition,'' Dr. Biermann said. ``There are no guarantees.''

   Skipdoctor Cures What Ails Scratched and Scraped CDs
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought you could identify all the gadgets in your
favorite consumer electronic stores, here comes a challenge. At
first glance Digital Innovations' Skipdoctor looks like a hand-held
vacuum cleaner, or perhaps an industrial-sized tape measure. At
second glance, a Salad Spinner.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the oddly good looks of this gray and lime green,
injection-molded, hand-cranked plastic device is the promise of
usefulness for anyone who has scratched compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   The Evanston, Ill., designers of the $34.99 Skipdoctor say it
will repair most kinds of abrasions, scratches, dust and
fingerprints that keep CDs from playing clearly and smoothly. CDs
are inserted into a slot perpendicular to the circular cleaning
wheel. Then you simply turn the crank (hence the Salad Spinner
comparison).
</P>
<P>
   The Skipdoctor's patented technology is being applied to repair
other optical disks including CD-ROMS, DVDs, CD-Rs and disk-based
computer games like those used in Playstations. While sold under
appropriately named Datadoctor, DVDdoctor and Gamedoctor, the
devices are basically the same, said Collin Anderson, president of
Digital Innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology works for all the media,'' Anderson said.

   Ergonomics Study Finds Hazards in Browsing Web
</P>
<P>
   Can Web browsing be hazardous to your health? A recent
ergonomics study suggests that it can be, even more than other
computer tasks.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study of 24 surfers by the ergonomics specialists
Anthony D. Andre and Jeff English, surfing can be particularly
dangerous because it tends to be more of a leisure activity and
people are less aware of their posture and the position of their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, surfers tend to lean away from the mouse, which
puts extra strain on the wrists and elbows. Web page scrolling
forces users to keep constant pressure on the mouse-click button,
which can strain the fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that few participants took advantage of the
natural waiting periods of page downloads and instead kept their
hands on the mouse, a position the report called a ``mouse
freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, which will be presented at the Human Factors and
Ergonomics Society's annual convention in September, recommends
that surfers move closer to the mouse, change position during
downloads, use a scrolling mouse and not lean on their nonsurfing
arm.
</P>
<P>
   And until there is an ergonomic study on the hazards of turning
pages, they could always read a book.

which the site visitor downloads in a few seconds. LiveManuals is
designed to permit new and prospective product owners to sample
features and learn how to use them.

</P>
<P>
   The products, including car stereos, cell phones and home

   Reading Mac Disks On Windows Machines
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Brian Landwehr was trying to sell software
that enabled PCs to read Macintosh floppy disks, people probably
thought he was crazy. Here was a product based on two technologies
that surely would soon vanish: Apple computers and floppy
diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Apple has resurged, floppies are still around
and Landwehr has a new version of his product called MacDrive 98
Version 3. ``Trading files via removable media isn't going away any
time soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   MacDrive is software that can be installed on any Windows PC to
prevent incompatibility problems with removable disks that were
formatted on an Apple computer, including floppy and Zip disks.
</P>
<P>
   Landwehr said the software, which sells for $64.97, is already a
hit with parents who have children using Macs at school and PCs at
home.

   INTERNET SPEED The quest for the LAN-speed record continues.
Last week, computer scientists at Duke University announced that
they had developed a system for standard Internet communications
over a local area network, or LAN, that moved at a rate of more
than one gigabit (one billion bits) per second.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeff Chase, an assistant computer science professor
at Duke, that's about twice the speed of the current fastest LAN
and about 20,000 times faster than communication through a
telephone modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is provide the software support that's
needed to allow others to achieve similar speeds on other networks
that will arrive in the future,'' Chase said. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There must be something in the air or water in the
Northwest, given the number of imaginative choreographers and dance
troupes the area has produced. The latest company to suggest that
is the Oregon Ballet Theater, which made its New York debut on
Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 and based in Portland, the company performs with
the distinctive classical purity and hint of rambunctious attitude
that identified its artistic director, James Canfield, during his
career with the Joffrey Ballet in the early 1980s. And the opening
program, one of two to be presented during the Oregon Ballet's
weeklong season at the Joyce, was fresh, smart and canny.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine company personnel sitting around the marketing
director's desk and analyzing the works performed on Tuesday.
Canfield's ``CQ'' would probably pull in young audiences, given its
central hip-hop dancer, club atmosphere and driving, multifaceted
pop score. Trey McIntyre's ``Like a Samba'' might attract the
parents and everyone in between, with its easygoing music and
pretty ballroom look.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a calculated or self-conscious moment in either
work. One of the great charms of the repertory as a whole is that
the program's five dances seem to come from somewhere other than a
drawing board, with lives and personalities of their own. As sleek,
fresh and unassuming as the dancers who perform them, the pieces
look strangely and invigoratingly new. In most of them, youthful
nose-thumbing and a respect for ballet's classical past blend with
remarkable smoothness.
</P>
<P>
   ``CQ (Charmed Quark),'' which opened the evening, is a perfect
introduction to the company style and point of view. Set to a score
that incorporates music by D.J. Shadow and Tranquillity Bass with
bits of rap and talk for a sound that suggests radio dialing,
``CQ'' opens with a silhouetted figure seated like a goddess in the
stage's back wall niche. A ballerina walks toward the figure in a
soft-edged rectangle of white light on the dim, smoky stage.
Obliterated for a moment, the goddess is then suddenly revealed as
a hip-looking dancer who remains serenely still as light grows and
smoke billows. And the ballerina tears into a kicking, stretching,
strutting solo that is decidedly unserene.
</P>
<P>
   The setting could be a dance club, but Canfield does nothing to
heighten or diminish that impression. Instead he allows the dance
to build and flow through the swirling, sometimes half-seen danced
encounters that are linked together to form the piece. He does not
belabor the implied juxtaposition and blending of the new and the
old, the new represented by an carefree little hip-hop soloist
(Mariecella Devine) and the old by more limb-thrusting ballerinas
and ballet partnering that is inventive and sometimes startlingly
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The stage picture created toward the end is just as beautiful as
dancers manipulate six hand-held white spotlights to create soaring
shafts of light and a jaggedly enclosed space at center stage.
Flashing white and colored lights are an important part of ``CQ,''
as is the frequently and occasionally comical bursts of smoke. But
light is used here almost architecturally, like set elements,
rather than for atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pace seems a little haphazard at times. A bit of editing
might not be amiss. And the women's black stirrup stockings do
strange things to the line of their toe shoes. But the piece
suggests, unusually, that youth-driven dance need not look
market-driven or insubstantial.
</P>
<P>
   There is a total shift in tone with the program's next piece,
``Singe,'' choreographed, lighted and costumed by Ashley Roland.
Set to Indian-flavored music by Talvin Singh, the duet would look
right at home on a Pilobolus stage given its imaginative visual
effects and acrobatic movement. It is not surprising to learn that
Ms. Roland performed with the Pilobolus-influenced Momix and ISO
troupes. But she has her own quirky imagination and sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singe'' opens with what look like projected flames rising from
dark mounds on a stage that seems empty. The mounds are actually
reclining dancers, however, and their arms curl up to create brief,
zany shadow play scenarios involving two couples of beaked
creatures and a third couple made up of a man and a woman in fancy
turn-of-the-century dress.
</P>
<P>
   Light rises as the dancers stand. The men (Christopher DeMellier
and James Thompson) engage in ingeniously choreographed, playful
combat of the sort that delights monkeys in a duet as goofy and
full of unexpected moves as their shadow creations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also a playfully combative edge to ``Speak,'' a dance
by McIntyre, resident choreographer of the Oregon Ballet and the
Houston Ballet. Set to rap by Tracie Morris and the Bloodhound
Gang, the piece opens with a spunky solo (Vanessa Thiessen) and
continues with a duet (Matthew Boyes), both of which are
intricately laced with fleeting, seemingly casual correspondence to
the lyrics of the two songs. Intriguingly McIntyre captures the
tone of blithe, muted violence of the rap to which the duet is
performed in dance that is cheerfully feckless.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield's ``Anaeis,'' set to the familiar second movement of
Ravel's Piano Concerto in G, is an elegantly stylized, sensual
distillation of the charged relationship of Anaeis Nin (Tracy
Taylor) and Henry and June Miller (Eric Roberts and Alison Roper).
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable amount of their story and personalities is
suggested in this evocative little piece. Most interesting,
however, is the fact that at heart this dance is a knowing gloss on
the romantic ballet pas de deux so popular in the 1970s and '80s,
here a triangle with a literary theme. David Heuvel designed the
stylish costumes. The lighting was by Gene Dent.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre brought the evening to a breezy close with ``Like a
Samba,'' set to familiar bossa nova music by Astrud Gilberto that
sounded in this setting like high-class elevator music. McIntyre is
a whiz at getting dancers on, off and across the stage in fluid,
surprising ways, and ``Like a Samba'' spools out like silk.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in white summer casuals, the five carefree performers
look like ballroom dancers, though the odd but exquisite lifts and
flow of the piece could be achieved only by a ballet choreographer.
One highlight was a tricky solo (Alexandrous Ballard) filled with
turn-on-a-dime shifts from tethered flight to dogged returns and
back again, amusingly accented by nonplussed pauses. Another was
McIntyre's witty response to ``The Girl from Ipanema,'' with Ms.
Roper sexy and hilariously impassive in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was completed by Ms. Taylor, Thompson and Boyce. The
company also included Kristin Bacon, Anne Mueller and Katarina
Svetlova. Michael Mazzola and Janet R. Elam are the company's
resident lighting and costume designers.

CHILDREN LEARN TO BE THRIFTY IN SUMMER'S LABOR OF LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
I heard something so unusual, unexpected and delightful last week
that I have yet to recover from the experience. It involved my
youngest son, and it was one of those moments of motherhood that
leaves you thinking, ``Yes, someday I really might be able to turn
his bedroom into a home gym.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know that sounds callous, but I think our job as moms and dads
is to prepare our children for life after parental welfare. As much
as it will cause me great sorrow when he moves away from home, I
know that eventually, somehow, I'll get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm enjoying the journey to that point when our
common paths will diverge. Last week, one sentence from his
10-year-old mouth moved us in that direction faster than the
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   It all began innocently enough at the beginning of summer break,
when my husband and I decided that the boys should work this
summer. No more lying around all day watching television and
playing video games. Of course, they embraced the news with an
enthusiasm usually reserved for goldfish funerals and meatless
dinners. But for the past two months, they have gone to work every
weekday with their dad and done the duties of stock boys and
janitors.
</P>
<P>
   They hated it.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, my youngest boy made a frantic call to my
office. When I got to the phone, he was breathless and distraught.
Immediately, I assumed the worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, is your brother calling you names again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he wailed between hiccups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need more batteries for your Game Boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I did, but I borrowed some from the remote patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, I quit this job yesterday and Dad is making me work
anyway!''
</P>
<P>
   I put my hand over the receiver and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Then I said, ``Honey, you can't quit. You need to work so that
you can buy your school clothes, remember?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wear my old clothes from last year. I hate it here. You
have to get up too early, and it's boring just cleaning and
unloading boxes every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your clothes from last year are too little. You need new
clothes. I know it's not fun being a stock boy, but your dad needs
your help and you need the money. Besides, we're not quitters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't you just buy my clothes like you always do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to understand the rewards of work and the value of
money. You can't do that if we just keep giving you everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 10. Can't I learn that later? It's summer. I'm
supposed to be having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 24 hours in the day. You sleep for eight, and you
work for four; that leaves you 12 hours to have fun. Now back to
work for both of us. Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   So he worked, reluctantly and slowly, but he worked. We saved
his money _ minus a little spending change _ and he accumulated a
nice nest egg for a kid. Meanwhile, the bitter complaints every day
worked my nerves to the point that I almost gave in and let him
quit. I'm so glad I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   We went shopping last week. He had his own money and a list of
things he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was the athletic shoe store. Instantly, he and
his brother raced over to the ``new arrivals.'' They didn't like
any of those, so they went to look at the shoes lining the walls in
neat, colorful rows.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it happened. My little one stood on his tip toes to
reach a pair of Nikes up on the
if-you-have-to-ask-you-can't-afford-them row. He admired them from
every angle with a contemplative gaze. Then he turned to the
salesman and issued a string of words that it took me a moment to
recognize and comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   I believe he said: ``How much are these?''
</P>
<P>
   Wow.
</P>
<P>
   Not ``Can I have these, Mom?'' or ``Do you have these in my
size?''
</P>
<P>
   He was interested in the cost, for a change. A welcome change.
Then, upon learning the exorbitant price, he immediately put them
back on the shelf!
</P>
<P>
   Well, enough said about that. I'm sure you can understand my joy
and hope. We found some nice shoes at a good price, but, even
better, my son learned a second language this summer: financial
English, the language of the self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know it yet, but we've given him something a lot
better than school clothes this summer.

 &HT;    OFFICER BALKS AT MISSILE SILO DUTY WITH WOMEN
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Air Force lieutenant urged his commanders
Wednesday to honor his religious convictions against serving alone
with a woman officer in an underground missile silo with only one
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``mandatory isolation'' is a temptation to sin and against
the ``traditional teachings'' of the Roman Catholic Church, said
First Lt. Ryan Berry, a 26-year-old West Point graduate stationed
at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my church. I love being in the military. I love my
wife. I love my child,'' said Berry. ``But I'm not being able to
combine these loves,'' he said, because the Air Force will not let
him serve with men only during 24-hour shifts in a silo the size of
a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has been reassigned to other duties on the base, and the
Air Force plans to retrain him for new duties elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared Wednesday at a Capitol Hill news conference with his
wife, church officials and some of the 77 members of Congress
supporting his cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to those Congress members, Gen. Michael Ryan, the
Air Force chief of staff, said Berry's request to ``accommodate
religious beliefs'' had been considered and rejected.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months in which Berry worked in silos only with other
male officers, his commanders ``determined that his personal
convictions could no longer be accommodated without creating an
unacceptable impact on the unit's ability to accomplish the
military mission,'' wrote Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider it a good order and discipline issue,'' said Lt.
Col. Don Miles, an Air Force public affairs officer. Accommodating
``one individual'' was affecting the morale of the more than 700
other officers performing similar duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Hamilton, Berry's lawyer, said the Air Force could
easily accommodate his client's religious convictions. Upon
request, officers who are married to each other are scheduled to
work the same shifts so they will be off at the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementation of a feminist agenda'' has been put ``above all
other values'' in today's military forces, he charged. ``If the Air
Force persists'' in its position, ``we will bring suit,'' he warned
at a Capitol Hill press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said that until he was stationed at Minot, he was unaware
that men and women worked together underground. After discussing
the issue with his wife, Jill, he said he asked to work only with
men in the silos, which are equipped with a bathroom, a bed and
electronic missile control consoles.
</P>
<P>
   The silos have only one bed because one officer is supposed to
be at the console at all times, ready to launch up to 10 nuclear
missiles should the fateful order come, said Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Having a silo crew composed of one young male officer and one
young female officer defies human nature, said Rep. Roscoe
Bartlett, R-Md., one of Berry's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy is stupid,'' he said, charging that some commanders
``have been worshipping at the altar of political correctness for
so long that their minds are warped.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Holding their 6-month-old daughter, Juliana, Jill Berry said she
had talked extensively about the situation with her husband, and
``I support him fully in every decision he has made.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, William Donohue, president of the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said Berry's stance
``is completely consistent with the Catholic faith.'' New York
Cardinal John J. O'Connor has written a column promising to crusade
on Berry's behalf all the way up to the president ``if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters distributed a list of Bible verses, including
admonitions to ``abstain from all appearance of evil'' and to
``flee also youthful lusts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an April job performance review, Col. Ronald Haeckel, Berry's

<P>
   Ram is good. As is the case with friends, you can never have too
much random access memory, that magical substance that allows us to
process our words, calculate our spreadsheets, surf the Web and
destroy invading alien nations.
</P>
<P>
   But RAM isn't as simple as three letters. It can be DRAM, SRAM
or VRAM. This alphabet stampede can seem a little overwhelming for
new users. What do all these acronyms mean, and what is the best
kind of RAM to use? The typical PC uses all three of these major
kinds at once. The main kind of memory, DRAM, has dozens of subsets
all to itself, and newer, faster types are in development. (You may
have heard of ``virtual memory,'' which is basically the operating
system convincing itself that it has more RAM than it actually
does, but nothing beats the real thing.)
</P>
<P>
   RAM chips live on your computer's motherboard and their
collective capacity is measured in megabytes. As your machine's
central processing unit, or CPU ( the ``brain'' of the computer),
handles the actual computing business, it refers to information
stored on the hard drive. The CPU follows your every command, but
to work faster and more efficiently, it stores temporary data and
instructions needed to complete the job at hand in the speedy RAM
chips, instead of going all the way back to the hard drive for the
data. Think of RAM as a kind of short-term memory. Having that
short-term memory speeds up the process, and that is what RAM does
for your computer.
</P>
<P>
   When you want to use a program on the computer, the operating
system will copy the program into your RAM from the hard drive,
since working in RAM is faster. Of course, many programs won't fit
all the way into the RAM, so the system selects the parts of the
program it needs as you work. The more RAM you have installed on
your machine, the more programs you can have open, the faster your
computer will be able to deal with those programs and the faster
you can get done with what you're doing. Getting a ``not enough
memory'' error is the computer's polite way of telling you that
you're asking it to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   Information stored in RAM, however, is vulnerable. If the
computer crashes or you lose power, whatever information is stored
there goes away. Who out there hasn't lost at least a few hours of
work because the computer froze before you could hit the save key
and safely store the changes you just made to your file on the
long-term memory of the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   Most discussions of basic RAM in computers are really referring
to DRAM _ dynamic random access memory. This, the most common type
of computer memory, is called ``dynamic'' because it can only hold
the information for a short time, as long as it is continually
refreshed with power.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those little green and black computer chips sold in
plastic boxes in stores or by mail-order companies are DRAM chips.
Some computers can use EDO DRAM, (EDO standing for extended data
out), which can work up to 10 percent to 20 percent faster than
regular DRAM.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rule of thumb, though, is that more RAM is better. A
computer with 128 megabytes of RAM installed will have a far easier
time handling today's memory-hungry software than a machine with 32
MB on board.
</P>
<P>
   When you decide to add memory to your computer, most of the time
you are adding some form of DRAM, but the choices and requirements
involved can be overwhelming. Depending on the type of machine you
have, you may have to add the memory modules in certain slots, or
upgrade with pairs of modules. Mixing certain types of DRAM just
won't work.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that the RAM itself won't work. If you buy
memory, install it properly and your computer begins to crash,
there's a chance you might have a defective chip.
</P>
<P>
   The number of slots on your computer's motherboard will limit
the amount of RAM you can actually install _ some older computers
will not take more than 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find your computer's manual (or find it too
mind-numbing to read), computer catalogs, particularly online ones,
are a good place to explore your options. Not only will you see
current prices, (a 32 MB upgrade sells for around $160 these days),
but the catalogs often have extensive charts that let you find your
computer's model on a list and match it up with possible upgrade
options.
</P>
<P>
   Online catalogs, like www.warehouse.com or www.zones.com, also
have interactive RAM ``configurators'' that let you click your way
through a checklist of models and modules until you find the chips
that meet your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of memory is SRAM. This is static random access
memory, called that because it doesn't need to be refreshed like
DRAM does. It is faster, but also much more expensive. SRAM is
mainly used in the memory cache cards that are favored by users who
need a lot of processing power. Most PCs these days have the SRAM
built right in, but cache cards are popular add-ins for many
Macintosh systems. Computers that need to run a lot of multimedia
applications or programs that require a great deal of processing
capacity benefit from as much SRAM as possible.
</P>
<P>
   VRAM is video random access memory. Many computers need a few
megabytes of VRAM installed to support larger monitors with the
``millions of colors'' option or to properly process large graphics
such as those found in image-editing programs or computer games.
VRAM is commonly found on video cards, and some high-end cards
favored by PC gamers have more memory just for video use _ 32 MB _
than some PCs used to have for overall system RAM.
</P>
<P>
   Many home systems that are being sold today have a combination
of DRAM, SRAM and VRAM already installed. The average user may be
perfectly comfortable with what came in the box, but there are
always upgrade options for those who want to rev up their machines.

   For technoheads on the cutting edge, there is some hot new DRAM
coming out this fall. These latest memory chips, called
direct-Rambus RAM (RDRAM or Rambus for short), are designed to work
with newer processors being developed by Intel and will make
computers even faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the past, the speed of the microprocessors was
expanding so rapidly, and memory was kind of lagging behind that,''
said Stuart Atkins, a programmer manager for Kingston Technology, a
company that makes memory products for computer systems, ``Rambus
is an example of an advanced, high band-width technology that can
start to catch up with the speed of processors.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been thinking about adding more RAM to your
computer, check your manual for the type and maximum capacity of
chips you can install in your machine. If you're squeamish about
taking the top off your machine, or if you have a computer with a
tower-style case where the motherboard can be hard to reach, you
may want to put your machine (and your peace of mind) in the hands
of a professional.

<P>
   Tips on Purchasing Ram &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RAM, exorbitantly expensive a few years ago, has become
bountiful and much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy, though, check with your computer's manual or
manufacturer to make sure you know exactly what kind of RAM your
particular system needs, as well as how many chips you will need to
upgrade properly and how much your computer can hold.
</P>
<P>
   You can purchase RAM at computer retail stores like CompUSA and
Circuit City. If you have ever ordered anything from a computer
mail-order catalog like the Micro Warehouse or PC Zone (or their
Macintosh counterparts, Mac Warehouse and Mac Zone), odds are
you're on a mailing list and getting several issues a month. Most
catalogs have a section devoted to RAM upgrades, complete with
lists and charts to help you along.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is also an excellent source of RAM (providing your
computer has enough RAM installed already to connect to it), as
well as more detailed information about choosing the right kind.
Two memory makers, Kingston Technology (www.kingston.com) and
Viking Components (www.vikingcomponents.com) have guides for
finding the right RAM, as well as links to distributors. The online
editions of the popular catalogs also sell RAM and provide
interactive pages to help you choose your chips. Try a visit to the
electronic version of Micro Warehouse (www.warehouse.com), PC Zone
(www.zones.com) or any of your favorite catalog sites if you prefer
shopping from home.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to read more detailed information about the various
types of RAM and how they work, try the PC Guide (www.pcguide.com)
and Tom's Hardware Guide (www.tomshareware.com). They are excellent
sources of RAM information as well as overall computer reference
information.

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher, a successful businesswoman
turned congresswoman, was named Wednesday to act as the political
liaison between the House Democrats and the business community as
part of the Democrats' drive to win back control of the House next
year.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., made the
appointment of Tauscher to head the new business forum for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm
for House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher, 47, a second-term Democrat from Pleasanton, said in an
interview that she has been meeting for six months with hundreds of
business groups, trade associations and CEOs of companies to
prepare for her appointment to the post. Tauscher was appointed in
November as one of three co-chairs of the DCCC, along with Reps.
Charles B. Rangel, D-.N.Y., and Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., to serve
under chairman Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The objective of the business forum, she says, is to ``provide
the business community with a direct link to the leadership in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this as a tent, there's now an entrance with a
big neon sign that says to business `Come on in,''' Tauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said Democrats want to court those business leaders who
Democrats believe are alienated from the Republican party because
of their view that GOP leaders have stalled or sacrificed
pro-business legislation to accommodate the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher cited as an example the delay in Congress last year in
funding the International Monetary Fund to shore up weakening Asian
economies. At the time, conservative Republicans tried to attach
unrelated abortion language to the bill. She also cited the
Republicans' decision to delay funding the Food and Drug
Administration and Department of Agriculture because they wanted to
block the approval of RU-486, the French abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher says her own business experience helps her understand
the challenges facing other business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed both sides of the paycheck, the front and the
back,'' says Tauscher, a millionaire who was one of the first women
to hold a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and who later founded
three companies that register and screen child-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would need a net gain of six seats to take control of
the House in 2000, assuming that the lone independent, Bernard
Sanders of Vermont, continues to vote with the Democrats.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tropical moisture will continue to flow northward into the
Rockies from Old Mexico and the Gulf of California in concert with
the broad, clockwise circulation around an upper-level high
pressure system over Texas. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
will develop from Arizona and New Mexico northward to parts of
Idaho and western Montana as moist air rises in response to the
uneven heating of mountains and valleys. Excessive rains from
storms will raise the possibility of flash flooding in a few areas,
with the greatest risk in parts of western Colorado, New Mexico and
Arizona, where the supply of tropical moisture is richest.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms, some heavy, will erupt from the
panhandle of Texas to the western high plains and front range of
the Rockies as moist winds from the southeast ascend the sloping
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will flare across parts of
eastern Washington and eastern Oregon as a sluggish, upper-level
low pressure system over the Pacific draws the plume of tropical
moisture in the Rockies northwestward. Low-level moisture will
continue to flow onshore in Washington and Oregon, setting the
stage for stubborn areas of low clouds and fog west of the
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop in
the Northeast as a cool front and a trailing upper-level
disturbance advance across the region. Farther south, widely
separated thunderstorms, some with heavy rain, will bubble up
across the southern half of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lightning Statistics
</P>
<P>
   A man was struck and injured by lightning while pruning a tree
Tuesday evening near Reno, Nevada. It is commonly believed that
proximity to a tree, particularly an isolated one, poses the
greatest danger from lightning. This notion is false. According to
statistics on lightning fatalities in a recent year, more than 80
percent of the 69 fatalities occurred in the open, while only four
percent occurred near a tree. By far, more men are killed by
lightning than women, with statistics from a recent year revealing
that more than six times as many males as females were victims of
lightning. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Dessert lovers can turn the dazzling and colorful
array of luscious and juicy summer fruits _ nectarines, peaches,
plums, berries, melons and more _ at markets and produce stands now
into a versatile array of delectable finales. The best part is that
no baking is required for these inspirations that beat the sticky
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   While a few require some fast stove-top cooking, most go
together effortlessly with a minimum of ingredients and minimal
preparation time _ and with short ingredient lists. Some rely on
convenience items _ like store-bought prepared cookie or shortbread
crusts or tart shells _ and even pudding mixes, cream cheese,
mascarpone cheese and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Many can be whipped up early in the day, before the heat broils
the cook, and stashed in the fridge, while others can be tossed
together just before serving _ or in between making or eating
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And among the tempting creations are numerous ideas special
enough to serve when entertaining friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nectarine, peach and plum crops are 10 percent to
15 percent smaller than normal this year because of frost and hail
damage in the San Joaquin Valley in early April, Gary Van Sickle,
field director of the California Tree Fruit Agreement, said
consumers will still find adequate supplies. Despite the season's
two-week-late start, due to the cold winter, production is
currently at its peak _ and will continue through Labor Day. The
good news for consumers is that nectarines will be available into
early October, while peaches and plums will be around even later
that month.
</P>
<P>
   When purchasing, select peaches and nectarines that have a
little bit of give and a yellowish background color, advised Van
Sickle. Red does not mean maturity.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of plums, the color is characteristic of the
variety, so choose by the amount of give. ``The best way to measure
`give' is to put the fruit in the palm of your hand and gently
squeeze it. It should give a little,'' noted Van Sickle.
</P>
<P>
   Once home, put the fruits in a brown paper bag (which traps
ethylene gas given off by the fruit) and leave them at room
temperature for two to three days to ripen. Once ripened, store the
fruits in the fridge and use within a week. If the fruits don't
ripen in the paper bag, it means the fruits were picked too early
and are immature.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to summer fruit desserts, be flexible. If
necessary, substitute staples you have on hand in the pantry or
cupboard. Most pies will work well in prepared graham cracker,
cookie crumb or shortbread crusts from the market, for instance.
For a shortcake on short notice, you might substitute cookies for
the base and layer with fruits and billows of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits can also be interchanged. Choose them with an eye to
color and the flavor of the dessert you're preparing. Be sure to
use top-quality ingredients, especially when you're using so few
ingredients in each dessert. Go the extra mile to purchase a
good-quality cake, the ripest fruit and premium ice cream or
sorbet, for example. Keep sweetened whipped cream in a pressurized
container in the fridge to gussy up even the plainest fruit finale
on the spur of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a wide variety of in-season fresh fruits to whip up some
of the fruit-friendly recipes that follow, which were designed to
help you keep your cool.

NUPTIALS ARE A TRUE MICKEY MOUSE AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE GULLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uncle Walt would have been proud _ and probably at least a
little surprised. After all, who would have believed a Mickey
Mouse-themed wedding could be so ... fancy? Karen Simmons, for one.
Her love for her fiance, Jim Gammage, and for the famous mouse was
apparent in a recent formal ceremony at Northeast Wedding Chapel in
Hurst, A Fort Worth-Dallas suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The first hint of the rodent reverence to come was just inside
the chapel door. A white satin-covered guest book embossed with the
Disney character lay open for guests to sign. Another clue sat in
the front pew: a 2-foot-tall stuffed Mickey doll, visible from the
back of the chapel only as a silhouette of the familiar ears.
</P>
<P>
   As the service began, the groom emerged in a black tuxedo with
tails (think orchestra conductor in ``Fantasia),'' followed by
groomsmen sporting black tuxedos with vests in a white satin Mickey
brocade. Each also sported a Mickey Mouse watch.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan called for 2-year-old Dylan McCartney, also in
tails and the only human wearing mouse ears, to carry the rings
down the aisle atop a black pillow in the familiar shape of
Mickey's head and ears. Plan B had to be implemented at the last
minute, however. McCartney was escorted to the front by two flower
girls, one of whom carried the pillow along with her flower
basket..MDBR/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   The bride's four attendants followed, dressed in floor-length,
sleeveless black gowns accented with white satin scarves that
gathered at the back in a bow and flowed into a slight train.
Mickey earrings and hair clasps adorned each of the women and
matched a choker worn by the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons wore a traditionally styled white gown with an extended
silk train. She took the arm of her 11-year-old son, Andrew, and
proceeded down the aisle, followed by her father, George Gordon.
Both escorts wore tuxes with vests, and bow ties in white silk
printed with black Mickeys in tiny red bow ties.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony continued in traditional fashion, culminating with
the presentation by the minister of the newly married couple.
Formalities completed, the bride plucked Mickey from his front-row
seat and, tucking him under her arm, took her husband's elbow
before the happy trio made their way down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives then were invited to gather for the
reception. That's where the real Mickey mania began.
</P>
<P>
   A cloud of helium-filled silver balloons, black ribbons
streaming down, greeted guests. Mickey and Minnie wedding snow
globes and picture frames decorated some of the tables, and a china
plate decorated with a raised impression of Mickey and Minnie in
wedding regalia topped still another. Chocolate Kisses overflowed
from a Mickey-head mug.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, chocolate-covered strawberries and edible
chocolate golf balls cascaded down the side of a two-tiered groom's
cake, on top of which sat a Mickey-as-golfer figurine. A small
Minnie in putting stance stood at the base near a pool of
strawberries and golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   T.MDNM/he bride's cake was.MDNM/ a four-tiered creation iced in
white with black silhouettes of Mickey heads. Flowers topped the
second and third tiers, both of which were ringed with strings of
small black-and-white beads, hung in scallops gathered by black
Mickey silhouettes. A wedding-themed Mickey and Minnie stood among
the flowers on the third tier. The fourth tier was an edible
replica of the famous Mickey Mouse-ears cap, iced completely in
black.
</P>
<P>
   When asked later what he thought of the Mickey theme.MDNM/ when
first presented with it, Gammage .MDNM/replied simply: ``I know
her. I'm used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I told him I wanted (a Mickey Mouse wedding),
he'd say, `Let's just run off and get married,' '' Simmons said.
``But he didn't. He did say I could do whatever I wanted _ to just
make it fun.''

`THOSE WHO LOVE ME CAN TAKE THE TRAIN': DEATHTRAP ON WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aboard a train from Paris to Limoges, the jumble of characters
in Patrice Chereau's new film can be found literally bumping into
one another, captured by the hand-held camera as they break up and
make up to the accompaniment of an eclectic (from Nina Simone to
P.J. Harvey to Gustav Mahler), busy soundtrack. There are those who
admire French films just for the way they avoid such things, but
stylishly diffident soap opera is on the rise in France, too. In
lovelorn ensemble stories like Arnaud Desplechin's ``My Sex Life
(Or How I Got Into an Argument)'' or Olivier Assayas' ``Late
Summer, Early Autumn,'' friends mix and match with nonstop
complications. Chereau means to one-up that formula by having his
characters do that on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train'' watches a big,
initially bewildering array of travelers en route to a funeral.
(This is ``a film that says a lot about the positive side of
funerals,'' Chereau told one interviewer.) They have been drawn
together by the death of Jean-Baptiste, a bisexual painter whose
tangle of amours could have kept these characters busy for a full
ride on the Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Louis Trintignant appears as both Jean-Baptiste (in
remembered glimpses) and his twin brother. And by the time either
becomes a strong presence in the film, there has been opportunity
either to sort out their webs of relationships or to start asking
``Who  &UR; are  &LR;  these people?'' The film is deliberately indirect in
its exposition. ``How's Lorette'' followed by ``She'll never know
if she's really cured'' is the kind of offhand exchange meant to be
more enticing than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Chereau, described in production notes as ``already a national
treasure in France'' and known here for the gaudy excesses of
``Queen Margot,'' stirs up turmoil in virtually every passenger
headed for Jean-Baptiste's funeral. (The same interviewer asked
him: ``Why are the lives of all the people who attend, and who have
competed for the love of the deceased, going through such crises?''
His reply: ``Because the film wouldn't be interested in them if
they weren't.'') So it develops, for instance, that Jean-Marie
(Charles Berling), one of the film's stronger characters, was once
close to Jean-Baptiste and is now in the midst of a painful breakup
with Claire (played with compelling intensity by Valeria
Bruni-Tedeschi). Meanwhile, he is also close to Louis (Bruno
Todeschini), who has distressed him by becoming enraptured with a
pretty, waifish boy named Bruno (Sylvain Jacques). ``I love him,''
Louis declares. ``Has it been going on long?'' he is asked. His
answer: ``Just since the station.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's truly frightening when, after much coffee drinking and
smoking, the train reaches Limoges and the film ushers in a whole
new group of relatives. Based on what has preceded this, it seems
entirely possible that Chereau will be coaxing something histrionic
out of each and every one of them. Fortunately, the only major
addition to the cast is Vincent Ward as Viviane, ne Frederic, in
the midst of sex change. A scene between Trintignant and Ward
manages to link this with the family's shoe business with the
meaningful use of red high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Who Love Me Take the Train,'' written by Chereau with
Daniele Thompson and Pierre Trividic, takes its title from the dead
man's final wish and his lingering power over the other characters.
That power is meant to be felt by the viewer too. And it would have
been more palpable if the film were not filled to the gills with an
oversupply of sudsy, contrived crises.
</P>

favorite ice cream. Top with a jigger of liqueur or whiskey.
</P>
<P>

cream or raspberry or orange sorbet. Drizzle with a little Fresca
or other lemon-lime soft drink for a refreshing finale that is good
enough for guests.

<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Raspberries or sliced strawberries and a little drizzle of
hot fudge sauce are grand over dark chocolate ice cream.

milk specified on the package directions. Then fold in a cup of
whipping cream, whipped. Layer with berries or cut-up fresh fruits
in stemmed dessert glasses and top with whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Whip up an orange dip to serve with fresh in-season fruits
by combining an 8-ounce package of cream cheese with orange juice
and a little powdered sugar until smooth and blended and of a
slightly runny consistency. Spoon some of dip over fruits on
dessert plates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Another good topping or dipping sauce for fresh fruits can
be whipped together in a jiffy by mixing softened cream cheese with
raspberry, lime or orange yogurt (use 8 ounces of each).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; You also can serve fresh fruits over pound cake slices and
drizzle with prepared or homemade caramel sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fruit salsas made by mixing cut-up fresh fruits with a
little orange juice are good spooned over shortcakes, pound cake or
angel food cake slices. Top with a sprinkling of nuts and whipped
cream. Fruit salsas are also nice accompaniments with assorted soft
cheeses and bread or cracker slices for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Blue cheese spread is another favorite that makes a
delectable go-along to fruits. Extend the blue cheese with a little
cream cheese and mix with some whipping cream for a special treat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Here's a weird sounding Italian-inspired cool creation that
really works. Mix rinsed, hulled, sliced fresh strawberries with a
tablespoon or two of sugar and let stand a few minutes. Then stir
in a couple of teaspoons balsamic vinegar (go easy) and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Mix sour cream with some whipped cream and a little liqueur
or any flavored extract. Stir in plenty of cut-up fresh fruits. Add
a handful of shredded coconut, if desired. Serve immediately or
refrigerate until serving time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Layer fresh in-season fruits in trifles in clear large
bowls. Make three or four layers of chocolate or butter pound cake
slices, prepared lemon curd or tapioca and cut-up fresh fruits. Top
with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles, chocolate shavings,
raspberries or coconut. Keep refrigerated until serving time. For
best results, make only two to three hours in advance of serving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; When time is really short, arrange cut-up fruits on skewers,
kebab style. Drizzle with an instant hot fudge sauce made by
melting semisweet chocolate chips with a little milk or cream in
the microwave oven a minute or so until smooth when stirred. &QL;

<P>
   &LR; Here are some fast ideas using fresh summer fruits that might
stimulate other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Fill champagne glasses or flutes with cut-up fresh fruits
and pour asti spumante or champagne over the fruits. Another time
try red or white wine.

<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Cut up your favorite fresh fruits and sprinkle over your
favorite ice cream. Top with a jigger of liqueur or whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Toss cut-up fresh fruits or raspberries over vanilla ice
cream or raspberry or orange sorbet. Drizzle with a little Fresca
or other lemon-lime soft drink for a refreshing finale that is good
enough for guests.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Raspberries or sliced strawberries and a little drizzle of
hot fudge sauce are grand over dark chocolate ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Combine cut-up fresh fruits with a little orange juice and
some Fresca and serve ``as is'' or over frozen yogurt or sorbet.
</P>

cream whipped with powdered sugar and a little vanilla. Sprinkle
cookie crumbs in between the layers, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Whip up some vanilla pudding mix with half of the amount of
milk specified on the package directions. Then fold in a cup of

   DICK HYMAN'S CENTURY OF JAZZ PIANO
</P>
<P>
   (JSS Music; $49.95, Home version; $99.95, Pro version; Windows
3.1 and later, and Macintosh 7.0 and later.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BEN RATLIFF
</P>
<P>
   Dick Hyman, the jazz pianist and historian, has produced an
educational CD-ROM, Dick Hyman's Century of Jazz Piano, is a little
more autobiographical than consumers may have bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Through his own work and as producer of the Jazz in July
concerts at New York's 92nd Street Y, Hyman has spent his career
educating audiences about the great figures of prewar jazz. As a
result, the videos, etudes, biographical nuggets and diabolically
difficult quiz on this two-disk set are weighted toward the giants
of jazz piano _ Jelly Roll Morton, Art Tatum, Fats Waller, Earl
Hines, Teddy Wilson. Oh, yes: and Dick Hyman.
</P>
<P>
   The project tries to be comprehensive (it covers 63 pianists),
though it shouldn't need to; presumably, no aspiring pianist is
going to learn everything from one source, and since Hyman has more
to say on the prewar styles, he might have done better simply to
devote both disks to the first half of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Century of Jazz Piano is full of valuable and
specific knowledge. Hyman isn't offering beginner piano lessons
here. But for pianists or even vaguely interested casual musicians
with a bit of jazz knowledge, Hyman gracefully, if a bit too
self-referentially, connects the dots of a historical line that can
be hard to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the features reviewed here, like the MIDI files, the
quiz and the video lessons, are included only in the Pro version.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman has studied every period of jazz piano. That works in his
favor where permission fees are concerned: for Chick Corea, Keith
Jarrett, Cecil Taylor, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner and others of the
last 50 years, he often supplies his own etudes based in their
style or plays a standard in their style. His imitations are
skillful and useful, but sometimes they amount to parlor tricks
pushed a bit too far. In the Chick Corea section, for example, he
presents improvisations rooted very generally in Chick Corea's
style, although, as he puts it, his improvisations ``are in no way
based on any of Chick's.'' Something this far removed from the
source really belongs in the Dick Hyman section, if it belongs at
all in a history of jazz piano.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the disks, in a MIDI application (MIDI being the
computer language used for musical notation), the user can see all
these tunes _ originals and Hyman's imitations _ played on a
digitized keyboard seen from above, with red dots lighting the
appropriate keys as the music moves along. That is helpful, though
not for sight-reading; even better would have been an added
application where one could read notated transcriptions of the
tunes and improvisations, with staff-notes lighting up along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few dozen Quicktime video lessons, each one lasting
a few minutes. Hyman plays stylistic examples as he talks. He's
comfortable in this role, and good at it. One large section is
given over to Art Tatum, where Hyman details runs and intervals,
analyzing Tatum's style; in ``Ragtime to Stride'' and other
segments, he emphasizes how successive styles built on what came
before, such as how the role of the left hand gradually changed
from ragtime (a basic oom-pah) into stride (richer or leaner bass
accompaniment) to the sophisticated post-stride of, say, Teddy
Wilson and finally to the jabbing bebop minimalism of Bud Powell.
</P>
<P>
   On the other disk, an image of New York's 52nd Street clogged
with 1950s cars and giant nightclub marquees offers you eight genre
options, including Harlem, Kansas City, Ragtime, Greenwich Village
and, yes, Dick Hyman.
</P>
<P>
   A click on Greenwich Village yields two options: the Village
Vanguard and the Knickerbocker Bar &AMP; Grill. Click on Knickerbocker,
and you're presented with five artist choices, among them Teddy
Wilson and Dave McKenna. Click on Dave McKenna and you get either a
McKenna tune or a Hyman tune in the style of McKenna; a short,
generalized analysis of it written by Hyman; a few still
photographs, and in some cases, a short film.
</P>
<P>
   And for each artist there is a link to the MIDI function, so
that you can see the keyboard fingering of the songs as they move
along; while that happens, you can change the tempo, create a loop
to repeat a section of the piece, or transpose its key.
</P>
<P>
   There are some bugs in the disks. In some of the MIDI files,
ghost keys seem to be held down for long periods, making you wonder
if Tatum actually had three hands.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz quiz is the most flummoxing part of the tutorial; it
will reduce almost everybody to the status of jazz moron. I headed
straight for the advanced questions and was quickly humiliated.
``Why did Dave McKenna develop a powerful left hand when he started
playing for money at age 13?'' Among several plausible answers, the
correct choice is ``D: A lack of bass players in Milford, MA.'' (Of
course!)
</P>
<P>
   In the easier questions, I learned some interesting things about
interventions into the careers of Oscar Peterson and Thelonious
Monk by their mothers and the various nicknames under which Dick
Hyman has performed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a short audio interview with Art Tatum from the 1950s.
What do you suppose Tatum talked about _ technique? His own
history? Actually, he was asked to name some of his favorite
contemporaries. ``Well, ever heard of a kid by the name of Dick
Hyman?'' he said. He's a very good pianist.''

   Country music fans have long had an ambivalent attitude toward
technology. The Grand Ole Opry banned the use of electric guitars
and plug-in drums for decades. In the 1980s, while pop music was
embracing the synthesized, Nashville continued to tout the
acoustic. And well into the 1990's, country consumers lagged behind
other music buyers in adopting the compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   So, for those technophilic country fans, the arrival of
Country.com's Century of Country CD-ROM seems reason enough to
cheer. Billed as ``the world's first interactive country music
encyclopedia,'' the disk is a joint venture of Dreamworks Records
Nashville; Starworks, a Yonkers-based software company; The
Nashville Network (TNN), and Country.com, TNN's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The developers purchased the electronic distribution rights to
``Definitive Country,'' an encyclopedia by Barry McCloud, and
supplemented it with 900 photographs, a few dozen audio interviews
and a handful of video clips. The result, they say, should appeal
to casual and academic fans.
</P>
<P>
   They may be half-right. Once the program is installed (it took
me two tries), users will find down-home graphics _ designers seem
to think Nashville enthusiasts require these _ and trivia questions
that pop up on every screen. (``Did you know that Kenny Rogers took
the official photograph of the 1988 Olympics U.S. gymnastics
team?'' Um, no.) They will also find a calendar with beefcake shots
of stars and 45 interview clips. If you want to hear Sleepy LaBeef
discuss his debt to rock-and-roll, this is the place.
</P>
<P>
   If you want Hank Williams, you will be disappointed, as is the
case for almost every other major star. None of the 23 performers
who have won the industry's top prize, the Country Music
Association's Entertainer of the Year, are included among the
clips.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus of Century of Country is its encyclopedia.
Here, too, the results are mixed. One outstanding feature taken
from McCloud's book is a searchable database of awards, record
labels, management companies, birthdays, even fan clubs. Fans who
want to send Alabama's lead guitarist, Jeff Cook, a card for his
50th birthday on Aug. 27 will find both a postal address and an
e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   The biography entry for Alabama, however, displays many of the
frustrating characteristics found among the 1,300 artist profiles.
It begins with an important historical point, noting that bands had
been popular in the early days of country music but had lost their
popularity by the 1970s, until Alabama began its remarkable run of
more than 40 No. 1 hits (though that last detail is curiously
absent). Quickly, though, the entry descends into a bland
capitulation of the group's chart positions and record sales. A far
too typical sentence reads: ``In 1997, the 1996 seasonal album cut,
`The Blessing,' just made the Top 75, but in the early spring, `Sad
Lookin' Mama,' the first regular single of the year, reached the
Top 3.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no sense of the rhythm of artists' careers here and no
discussion of the artistic aspects of their music. I spotted not
one comment _ favorable or unfavorable _ from a music critic Still,
having so many facts and figures in one place can be valuable. To
test that side of ``Century of Country,'' I asked some music lovers
to send me relevant questions by e-mail. My plan was to compare the
CD-ROM with the old-fashioned reference books on my shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM performed so admirably on the questions that I
quickly forswore the competition. ``How many kids does Loretta Lynn
have?'' Five living, one deceased. ``Who else died in the plane
crash that killed Patsy Cline?'' Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   It also performed well on trickier questions like ``Did Shel
Silverstein write `Queen of the Silver Dollar?''' and ``Whatever
happened to Juice Newton?'' The disk replied that in 1976 Dave &AMP;
Sugar had a hit with Silverstein's ``Silver Dollar,'' while ``The
Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia'' (Times Books) didn't
have an entry for Silverstein.
</P>
<P>
   As for Juice Newton, the CD-ROM again trumped the paper
encyclopedia, reporting that since her last hit in 1989, Ms. Newton
``plays arena polo at Rancho Sante Fe Polo Club, watches the news
and weather, and enjoys being a wife and mother.'' The image of Ms.
Newton, an '80s folk-country icon, sitting around the polo club
watching the Weather Channel may be worth the $29.98 list price.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM, however, failed on questions of taste. For example,
which is the best George Jones collection? Its discography lists 26
albums but offers no recommendations. ``Country: The Music and the
Musicians'' (Abbeville Press), by contrast, recommends
``Anniversary: Ten Years of Hits'' (Epic).
</P>
<P>
   But these criticisms pale in comparison with the CD-ROM's
overriding weakness: its silence. For a multimedia disk about one
of America's great indigenous art forms to have absolutely no music
(other than an offensive ``sampler'' by three Dreamworks artists)
is unforgivable. Even if royalty issues prevented the disk's
producers from including clips of hit songs, surely they could have
asked one of Nashville's many out-of-work songwriters to write some
background tunes.
</P>
<P>
   To assess this compact disk in the critical tradition it so
assiduously shuns: Century of Country is a promising debut, with
lots of room for improvement.

FOR AN UNHEARD-OF OPERA, IS THERE A BALD SOPRANO IN THE HOUSE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: this is a spoof of opera and pharmaceutical
advertising)

</P>
<P>
   From dusty piles of manuscripts in the basements of European
libraries, forgotten Baroque operas continue to emerge. The newest
discovery, made by the husband and wife musicological team of
Johnson and Johnson, is Otto von Bismarck Merck's ``Titus
Pharmacoligus.'' The libretto by Franz Xavier Squibb, after a
fragment by Seneca, confirms the early 18th century's continuing
fascination with classical mythology and history. It bears
examining.
</P>
<P>
   Propecia, Princess of Bare Headlands, languishes in the tower of
her castle, to which she has been confined by the evil sorceress
Turandot.com. Propecia's brother, Rogaine, has suffered a similar
fate, being banished to the province of Bald Mountain, where he
passes the time in experiments to grow grass from rocky and
forbidding soil. Indeed, Turandot.com has enslaved the entire
populace of Bare Headlands by sending out plagues across the land.
They include such possible side effects as nausea, diarrhea and
muscle pain or weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Act I, Scene 1 finds Propecia with her handmaidens Allegra,
Zocor and Ecotrin. She is pining for her lost lover Flonase (the
aria: ``I have that hot, burning, itching sensation called love'').
The handmaidens in charming three-part harmony urge their mistress
to consult her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   In Act I, Scene 2, Flonase, King of Sinusitis, is preoccupied
with his life's work: digging channels to the sea in his swampy,
lowland kingdom. Flonase also longs for Propecia, but his
lieutenants urge caution, asking their master in the powerful
chorus, ``Is Propecia right for you?'' He responds with a da capo
aria, ``I labor with each breath I draw,'' the central section
being a musically artful, onomatopoeic wheeze, similar in vividness
to Handel's buzzing flies in the oratorio ``Israel in Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Turandot.com has an ally: the warlike Richard of Viagra, who has
massed a formidable army and powerful weapons of war to suppress
resistance by the people of Bare Headlands. In Act II, Scene 1,
Richard expresses his unrequited passion for Propecia, and his
anger at her rejection of him (the aria: ``A bitter pill to
swallow'').
</P>
<P>
   Act II, Scene 2 finds Propecia desperate for the rescue of
herself and her kingdom and deep in consultation with her plump
childhood playmate, Fatty Acids, who will be sent on a clandestine
mission to Flonase. They reminisce in the duet ``Eat a lot of
breakfasts; feel better all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Act II, Scene 3: Fatty Acids arrives in Sinusitis having lost 30
pounds in just 90 days, thus changing his appearance and assuring
his disguise. Flonase expresses his amazement and urges a regimen
of exercise and sensible eating. The wizard Zocor, in one of the
opera's few moments of comic relief, cautions against the
overtaxation of the blood vessels, singing in merry 12/16 time the
aria ``With heart in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Flonase is not soothed. Resentful of Viagra and baring a heart
burning with love for Propecia, he rallies his allies from the
principalities of Gas, Indigestibus and Malaisia and mounts an
invasion by sea. Quanterra, another counselor, urges calm in the
bass aria ``Your talents need emotional balance.'' End of Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Act III, Scene 1: Three navies _ with the admirals Gaviscon,
Prilosec and Mylanta at the helm _ are assembled. They pray to the
gods of good wind for safe passage (the chorus: ``Blow us out from
here and into the nostrils of our enemies''). They set sail across
the choppy Sea of Zantac (here an orchestral interlude featuring
the prominent use of trombones).
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of stomach-churning seas, Flonase's armada lands on
the beaches of Bare Headlands, and after fierce fighting (and, some
historians claim, below-the-belt tactics) succeeds in driving
Viagra's vanguard force from the field. Its general, Flomax, Regent
of Greater Prostate, returns to his throne to sit and brood (the
aria ``My tears are uncontrollable'').
</P>
<P>
   Act III, Scene 2 marks the beginning of the fierce and vicious
siege at the walls of Propecia's castle. Cannons roar and drums
roll in the orchestra part. Flonase's chief lieutenant, Ditropan,
appears breathless onstage to announce that direct assaults have
failed. Flonase calls on Titus Pharmacoligus, God of Normal Blood
Pressure and Correct Metabolism, for succor (the aria: ``Hear me,
oh mighty druggist'').
</P>
<P>
   The enemy's weakness is revealed in a dream: it is the neuralgia
and lower back pain suffered by Viagra's soldiers and their
families as a result of everyday stress and tension under siege. Is
it a stroke of luck that a secret shipment of analgesics has been
seized outside the castle? Without them, Viagra's men are
demoralized (the double chorus: men: ``Come to us, wives''; women
in response: ``Not tonight, we have a headache'').
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the losing tide that sweeps over him, Viagra sends a
last desperate call for help to his comrade in arms, Robert of
Dole, but not even his friend's ministrations can shore up his
defenses (Viagra's mournful aria, ``My manhood deserts me''). After
two days of combat, Flonase accepts Viagra's broken sword as the
chorus sings, ``May we all breathe easier in victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Act III, Scene 3: Finale. As courtiers from the various kingdoms
assemble, Titus Pharmacoligus descends from the heavens to bless
the virtuous, punish the wicked and distribute the necessary
prescriptions. His gifts guarantee happiness, when used as
directed. Dragged before the Assembly in chains, the disgraced
Turandot.com is condemned to a lifetime of dry mouth, constipation
and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Flonase's maritime allies, now freed from biliousness, are
rewarded with great stores of tacos, hot peppers and curry. At the
curtain, Flonase and Propecia are pronounced man and wife by Titus,
who promises them children possessing both hair and clear nasal
passages.

A LOOK BACK AT A FUZZY PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It's a burning question, as traditional as
the never-ending procession of stars ascending the red-carpeted
steps to confront the nation's TV critics each day: How does this
season's batch of new series compare with last year's, with the
ones of the year before that, with the ones of the year before
that?
</P>
<P>
   The ritual response, even before the TV industry's annual
fall-season presentations stumbled to a conclusion Sunday, was
distressingly inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that there was so much talk of diversity, of
exclusion, of institutional racism, that few of us bothered to
watch enough new programming to forge a discussion of intellectual
substance.
</P>
<P>
   We merely counted the number of African-Americans and Latinos in
each cast and went in for the kill. And the stars merely countered
with rehearsed answers given them via network briefings.
</P>
<P>
   You know a subject is well-worn when someone asks ``The West
Wing'' co-star Martin Sheen ``how long'' he has been Hispanic, and
the hotel general manager greets you by joking, ``What, no
diversity questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Television has never accurately mirrored the society it serves,
and it probably never will, and that's not a racially loaded
statement. Of the scores of pilots that make it across the desks at
the six networks, executives will pick what they think will work _
and that's usually something that worked last year or the year
before that or the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   That's not diversity. It's creative paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when audiences are fleeing network television in
droves and critics view it as a medium devoid of artistic merit,
the mandate is survival. And survival means playing not to lose;
that is, doing what's safe.
</P>
<P>
   How else can you explain why so many of the 38 new series this
fall sport familiar patterns and themes, if not out-and-out
ripoffs, spinoffs or the transfer of proven commodities to
desperate networks. (Case in point: UPN's two-hour wrestling block
titled WWF Smackdown!)
</P>
<P>
   Hourlong comedies like ``Ally McBeal?'' Got 'em, plus a new
half-hour Ally that's nothing more than a cleverly disguised rerun.
And what about that series about a high-powered career woman who
trades the big city for her small Northeastern hometown and ends up
living at home with a parent? Last season's ``Providence'' on NBC
is this year's ``Judging Amy'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   There's a matched set of new series about single
twentysomethings in New York City. The WB has ``Jack &AMP; Jill'' _
she's Jack, he's Jill, wink-wink _ and ABC has ``Wasteland,'' in
which a 26-year-old female character purrs in the pilot: ``I'm a
virgin. Take me.''
</P>
<P>
   There's CBS' ``Ladies Man,'' about a guy living with a house
full of women, and ABC's ``Odd Man Out,'' about a guy living with a
house full of women.
</P>
<P>
   There's ABC's ``Oh Grow Up,'' not to be confused with UPN's
``Grown Ups.'' And ABC's ``Once and Again,'' which shouldn't be
mistaken for CBS' ``Now &AMP; Again,'' or better yet, ABC's ``Then Came
You,'' a romantic comedy about an older woman, a younger man, and
lines like these:
</P>
<P>
   She: ``I feel like Mrs. Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Oh, I graduated Northwestern, too. What year?''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``May.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Love Hewitt showed up for a panel discussion of her new
series, ``Time of Your Life,'' but her producers, Amy Lippman and
Chris Keyser, spent most of the hour explaining why they'd tanked
the pilot and were starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Us: The pilot was terrible, and Fox hated it.
</P>
<P>
   Them: The series was moved in front of ``Ally McBeal,'' and
therefore needed to lose the woe-is-me attitude the
producer/writers have become known for with ``Party of Five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha'' begot ``The Parkers; Law &AMP; Order'' begot ``Law &AMP;
Order: Special Victims Unit; Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' begot
``Angel;'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' begot a slew of dramas about high
school kids who talk like adults.
</P>
<P>
   Trends? More dramas, fewer comedies, younger characters (even
younger than usual), lots of high school shows, and, up until the
frantic, last-minute hiring of black and Latino talent, more gay
characters than people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the preoccupation with race, TV violence is a nonissue
this season, unless you count Chris Carter's ``Harsh Realm,'' so
confusing it might last three episodes, or the spirited exchange
between reporters and UPN CEO Dean Valentine over the amount of
blood allowed during the 7 p.m. wrestling show.
</P>
<P>
   Badgered over whether UPN would edit the more vicious scenes, a
visibly upset Valentine finally barked: ``Look, I don't know that I
can outlaw bleeding!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' the CBS mob series held off the fall schedule to
let the memory of Columbine High dissipate, didn't get the
attention it was probably hoping for, despite a vicious stabbing
scene and the execution of three mobsters at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the pilot, featuring Jason Gedrick
as an undercover agent infiltrating the mob, was flat and dull. It
also suffered from lousy timing, following in the footsteps of the
critically adored ``The Sopranos'' on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Action isn't violent, but it will generate the most buzz, partly
for its wit and irreverent comedic style, and partly because the
lead character spews profanity that's bleeped out.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Chris Thompson developed the series with cable in mind,
which might explain why a prostitute (Illeana Douglas) stuffs her
hand down the pants of a stranger next to her in a movie theater.
When negotiations broke down with HBO, Thompson took the project to
Fox, which wanted it as it was.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, Douglas and Jay Mohr, the ruthless film executive with
the nasty mouth, seemed ready to walk off the interview stage as
the discussion heated up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch Cops,'' Mohr said, ``which is on Sunday _ the Lord's day
_ and guys are getting arrested and looking right down the barrel
of the camera, saying (bleep) and (bleep) and (bleep) right into
your living room. I'm confused as to where the line is drawn, and
if it's drawn to cut us out, that would be a shame, because this is
a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the dead-on Action screened here was a good one,
and would still be good without the gimmicky foul-language tease.
</P>
<P>
   Others worth sampling, based on pilots alone: ``Once and
Again,'' with Sela Ward and Billy Campbell as 40-ish divorcees
navigating a relationship; NBC's ``The West Wing,'' a White House
workplace drama with Martin Sheen and Rob Lowe; the WB's
``Roswell,'' about high school aliens trying to fit in; NBC's
``Freaks and Geeks,'' an hourlong comedy about high school
outsiders, set in the '80s; Pax Net's ``Hope Island,'' about a
quirky seaside town near Seattle; and Fox's ``Malcolm in the
Middle,'' about the life of an above-average kid and his
below-average family.
</P>
<P>
   Even though PBS ended the 19-day siege by presenting such
multicultural fare as documentaries on inequalities for women,
Africa, Pope John Paul II, life with an interracial family, and a
concert special featuring the Afro-Cuban salsa of Celia Cruz, it
wasn't spared The Diversity Question.
</P>
<P>
   It came to the creators of ``Dragon Tales,'' a new animated
series for children ages 3 to 6, who looked a bit dumbfounded when
someone asked why the two animated characters frolicking with the
dinosaurs were white.
</P>
<P>
   Said one: ``Uh, well, to tell you the truth, we hadn't thought
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth? It's clear they hadn't been briefed. .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit

 &HT;    MEXICO'S OPPOSITION HOPES FOR ALLIANCE TO END ONE-PARTY
PRESIDENCY IN 2000
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's opposition parties struck a significant
agreement Tuesday night that could produce a powerful alliance
candidate to run for president in this country's historic July 2000
election.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a coalition candidate uniting conservatives and
liberals would have a very good chance at defeating the candidate
of Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, which
has held a lock on the country's presidency for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the slightest doubt that an alliance could win,''
said Vicente Licona, director of the Indemerc-Lou Harris polling
organization in Mexico City. ``But the big problem will be how they
would divide the pie and govern afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The political groups involved in the alliance negotiations
include six minor Mexican parties and two parties with much greater
national clout: the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, and
the left-leaning Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN is generally pro-free trade and more conservative
socially, while the PRD tends to favor more protectionist policies
and programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   However, both are united in their condemnation of the PRI,
accusing Mexico's dominant political entity of corruption and
ineptitude. The PRD and the PAN have joined forces before to
challenge electoral fraud and even to defeat the PRI at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In July, for example, a coalition candidate representing a
PRD-PAN ``Alliance for Change'' captured the governorship of
Nayarit state on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Tuesday's agreement, the opposition parties
acknowledged they wouldn't be able to bury all their political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said in a statement, they are seeking a united
opposition alliance for the purposes of ending the PRI's
stranglehold on the presidency and widening ``genuine democratic
political competition'' in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The parties' agreement calls for negotiations to design a
national referendum in which voters would select a candidate as the
alliance's nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   The parties will also negotiate to create an electoral platform
for the alliance, as well as a legislative agenda and a plan for
governing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Indemerc-Lou Harris poll in Mexico found that if an
alliance were established between the PRD and the PAN, 51 percent
of voters would choose the alliance candidate in the July 2000
election. Only 43 percent said they would vote for the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5 percent of respondents said they wouldn't vote for
either, and 1 percent said they didn't know who they'd vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, governor of Guanajuato state and the likely
presidential nominee of the PAN, scores especially high in polls.
If a referendum were held to select a nominee for an alliance, the
same Lou Harris poll showed Fox would capture 60 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, mayor of Mexico City and the PRD's likely
nominee, would only receive 23 percent of the vote. Thirteen
percent of respondents said they wouldn't vote for either and 4
percent said they weren't sure who they'd vote for.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward the formation of an opposition coalition for
2000 poses a new threat to the PRI, which kicked off its first ever
primary election race this week to select its nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals within the PRI attempted to show unity during a televised
event on Sunday. But Mexicans are now being treated to an
unprecedented array of television campaign ads and speeches in
which PRI aspirants are attacking one another.

<P>
   Q: I have been told that when nailing up sheets of drywall on
bare studs (while finishing a new room in my basement) it would be
easier to make the cutouts needed for electrical outlets and
switches, as well as window openings, before actually nailing the
panels in place. However, because each sheet has to be raised
slightly to allow for an inch or two of space at the bottom, the
task of holding the sheet at the proper height off the floor
becomes a problem when working alone. Is there an easy way to
support or raise a sheet of drywall to the proper position while I
drive in the first few nails when I am working alone?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most pros use a flat metal bar or length of 1-inch-thick flat
molding and a short length of pipe (1 or 1-1/2 inches in diameter)
as shown here to create a miniature ``jack'' that makes it easy to
raise and hold the panel in the proper position. Pressing down on
the raised end of the metal bar with your foot will support the
panel at the right height and leave your hands free to drive in the
first few nails.

   Q: A sizable part of my house has a flat roof that is coated
with tar and gravel. Since this flat section has no pitch, water
tends to pool on the roof without running off. Local roofers tell
me that the only way to correct this problem is to tear off the old
roof down to the wood sheathing and then build up a new roof with
the proper pitch. So far we have had only two leaks, but I would
like to correct this problem if possible without going to the
expense of building a whole new roof. Can you offer any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid there is no easy answer to your question _ the
only way to really correct the drainage problem is to install a
whole new roof. However, if there is no serious leakage remember
that there are many commercial buildings and some residences that
do have flat roofs which pose no serious problems if properly
built. These usually have a raised parapet around the edges with
openings or gutters to get rid of water that accumulates. A good
contractor may be able to modify your existing roof in this way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our house is built on the side of a hill and three-fourths of
it has a brick foundation. The other part has a daylight basement
and between this and the brick foundation of the rest of the house
there is a large ditch that frequently fills with rain water.
During very heavy rains this ditch gets so full that the ground
gets completely saturated and some water seeps into the daylight
basement. What can we do to drain this ditch and keep water from
seeping into the basement?
</P>
<P>
   A: I am not quite sure what you mean by a ``daylight basement.''
I assume that it is a part of the basement that has windows and
thus lets daylight in, though I can't quite envision its position
and relation to the house. But it seems the builder apparently left
some exposed ground on the side of the hill above the basement and
excavated the ditch you speak of to trap water and keep it from
seeping into the basement. Without seeing the premises the only
thing that I can think of is to extend the ditch at each end so
that it goes past the brick basement on each side of the house. At
each end dig out a sump or ``dry well'' of some kind to trap the
water that flows in until it can safely seep into the ground on
each side _ away from your house walls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The bare concrete hearth in front of our fireplace has
several stains that were left when wax from a holiday candle
dripped onto the cement. Can you tell me how to get these stains
out and what we can do to prevent future staining of this kind?
</P>
<P>
   A: A good method is to cover the stains with a thick layer of
dry powdered Portland cement. Pour some paint thinner (mineral
spirits) over the powder to saturate it, then cover with a piece of
plastic and tape this down to seal out as much air as possible.
Allow this `paste' to soak for at least three or four hours (while
the paint thinner dissolves the wax the powdered cement absorbs it)
then peel off the plastic and vacuum up the now dry powder. You may
need to assist the drying process with a hair dryer on LOW before
you vacuum. To prevent this happening again, clean the concrete
thoroughly and cover it with two coats of a clear masonry sealer.

<P>
   Hey, boys and girls: Seventeen magazine says that if you're a
teen, San Francisco, an ``attitude-free zone'' (guess they haven't
met  &UR; Willie &LR; ), is the best place in the country to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to great shops and restaurants and the best urban
schools in the country,'' says the magazine, which doesn't quote a
source for the last, ``San Fran has natural beauty galore, tons of
character (think of all those candy-colored Victorian houses) plus
loads of stuff for teens to do.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Gelila Berkele &LR; , 15, tells the magazine, ``The weather's never
extreme here, so you can be outside year-round _ bike riding,
skateboarding, sitting around at the Pier or on Haight Street.''
The story is illustrated with a stock photo of a cable car working
its way up Hyde Street, with Alcatraz in the background, but it
doesn't include a colorful shot of some of those teens sitting
around on Haight Street.

Largent.

   PBS spokesman  &UR; Tom Epstein &LR;  said the massages cost the network
$3,200 per year (each employee pays $8; PBS kicks in $11) and ease

field,'' Epstein said, in remarks quoted in Electronic Media. ``We

 &HT;    Clinton urges passage of House hate-crimes bill
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton urged the House of
Representatives on Wednesday to follow the Senate's lead and pass
the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on the House of Representatives to meet its
responsibility in combating violence that is fueled by hate and to
complete what the Senate has begun,'' Clinton said in a statement
issued prior to Wednesday's House Judiciary Committee hearings on
hate-crimes legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have it within our grasp to enact a bill that will take a
very strong stand against those who perpetrate crimes based on
prejudice and hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the hate crimes bill two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House committee, Deputy Attorney General
Eric Holder recalled the dragging death of James Byrd., Jr., a
black man, in Jasper, Texas, and the beating death of Matthew
Shepard, who was gay, in Laramie, Wyo., as examples of the
``devastation that hate crimes can bring to a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes are particularly heinous because their message has a
broader impact, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just individual attacks but attacks on the group
that the person was a member of,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a hate crime can be federally prosecuted only
if the victim was targeted because of race, religion, color or
national origin, while on federal property or while exercising a
federally protected right, such as attending a public school or
while working.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has proposed that the law be expanded
to include sexual orientation, gender or disability and that
federal intervention be allowed when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said forming federal partnerships with state and local
authorities will greatly assist the effort against these crimes.
Problems with the current law include inadequate reporting,
inefficient training of law enforcement officials, and
jurisdictional limitations, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said effective legislation must attack such limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any bill that does include these three elements falls far
short of what America needs in our battle against hate,'' Clinton
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Holder, the committee also heard testimony from
various law scholars and victims of hate crimes. Carole Carrington,
the mother and grandmother of two sightseers at Yosemite National
Park in California who were murdered in February, spoke out against
violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have involuntarily become part of a club of families whose
women and girls have disappeared, some never found, some found
murdered and/or assaulted,'' Carrington said. ``We have very
suddenly had our eyes opened to the staggering numbers of families
dealing with the loss of
</P>
<P>
   their wives, sisters and daughters.''

   QUNEITRA, Syria _ From here, only a few coils of barbed wire lie
between Syria and the sliver of its land that Israel has held for
32 years. To Syrians the high-tech observation posts on surrounding
hilltops seem to laugh down at them, a boast about just who
controls the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Quneitra are all but deserted, off-limits to most
Syrians. The buildings are rubble, sacked by Israeli forces years
ago and left that way by the Syrians to rally foreigners' anger and
refresh bitter national memories.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood in Syria today is such that when visitors like
Ahmed Abu Khalid gaze from Quneitra into the middle distance, where
Israeli traffic is plainly visible, they say they see an
Israeli-Syrian peace that may be nearer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in six months everything will be OK,'' Abu Khalid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, particularly those like Abu Khalid, 27, a plainclothes
policeman, are not known for being loquacious with foreign
journalists. But that customary reserve has begun to soften, and
more than just a little, in an atmosphere of optimism and urgency
about peace that seems to begin at the very top.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, President Hafez al-Assad has praised Ehud
Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, as ``a strong and honest
man'' _ a big bouquet from a man who could barely bring himself to
pronounce the word Israel a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's Foreign Ministry has said it is prepared to match any
new peace moves from Israel ``step by step,'' and its former chief
negotiator, Walid al-Mualem, the ambassador to Washington, has gone
so far as to suggest that an agreement with Israel may be possible
within ``a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   A Damascus-based diplomat said a determined Syrian effort to
make peace with Barak's government appeared likely: ``There's a
decision, I think, that here comes the gold ring again, maybe for
the last time, so let's make it a full-court press.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental reasons, diplomats and some Syrians say, are
simple. Syria believes it missed an opportunity in early 1996, when
what had been a promising round of peace talks with Israel was
suspended over a wave of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   And Assad has plainly aged in the three years since. He turns 70
this year, and is looking frail.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by American assurances that Barak's election has indeed
set the stage for a fresh chance, the diplomats and Syrians say,
Assad is eager to secure a peace that would be his crowning legacy
and could help to smooth the way for his son, Bashar, 34, to take
his place someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the single most important factor
driving this is to open the way for his son to carry on,'' said a
Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as eager as Assad may be for a deal, a dramatic Syrian
gesture seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has yet to meet an Israeli leader, and he abruptly
canceled a trip to Morocco nine days ago for the funeral of King
Hassan II after the Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, was
quoting as saying he hoped the occasion would produce the first
handshake between Syrian and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 29 years in which he has held power, Assad has repeated
his basic demand so often _ that the price for peace is a full
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights _ that it is all but
inconceivable that he would lower the bar now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians may be flexible on a lot of issues this time,'' a
Western diplomat said. ``They clearly want this done. But unless
the deal means that every last Israeli withdraws from the Golan
Heights, Assad would be seen internally as weak. And even if he can
stand that, he knows his son could not.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials have said that a key test of Israeli intentions
will come with the arrival of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in the region later this month. Albright is expected to travel to
both Israel and Syria, and Syrian officials have said that unless
she relays the right Israeli words, the current optimism might yet
turn to deep disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to hear from the Americans that Barak wants to
withdraw to the line of June 4, 1967,'' Moallem said in a recent
interview with Middle East Insight magazine. He was referring to
the day before the six-day war in which Israel occupied the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we can start from this point and build a peace based on
mutual respect and security and normalization,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which that bottom line has become imprinted on the
consciousness of most adult Syrians can be heard in ordinary
conversation, including several held at random on a
government-sponsored visit to the Syrian side of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, people referred specifically to U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for withdrawal
to the June 4 lines. And over and over again, people said that
Barak is better than his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, and that
peace is now within reach, but that it will depend on how far the
Israeli leader will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic now,'' said Samira Osman, a 40-year-old widow
who is one of the few people who lives in the town. ``But it all
depends on what Barak will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrians have allowed themselves to grow optimistic about peace
before, and then seen their hopes dashed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and early 1996, before the Israeli-Syrian talks
were suspended, some investors began to buy property on the Syrian
side of the Golan, seeing it as the new gateway to reclaimed land.
</P>
<P>
   This time there has been no such property rush, said Mufeed
Badieh, 28, the spokesman for Quneitra, where 53,000 Syrians once
lived. But hotel and restaurant owners and investors in Damascus
and Aleppo say they have begun to dream again of a post-peace boom,
including a surge in tourism.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Some 14,000 Syrians still live in the Israeli-occupied portion
of the Golan Heights, and only small numbers of them, usually
schoolchildren, are permitted to return to Syria, even for short
visits.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot near here, relatives kept apart by the conflict keep
abreast of news on the other side by shouting across a narrow
valley that divides Syrian territory from the Israeli-held village
of Majdal Shams.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria has left Quneitra empty and in ruins as a reminder of
the past. The city, captured by Israeli forces in 1967, was taken
over again by Syria after the 1973 war, but not before its
churches, mosques and schools were razed by the withdrawing Israeli
forces, the Syrians say.
</P>
<P>
   (Israel has said the damage, still shocking more than two
decades later, was a consequence of the fighting. But a resolution
passed by the U.N. General Assembly in 1974 accused Israel of
having committed a ``grave breach'' in carrying out the
destruction.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What makes the current Syrian push for peace different from any
in the past is the vigor with which Assad has been trying to
present a gentler face. The main target, it appears, is the Israeli
public, where people have been accustomed to denunciations of ``the
Zionist enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Israelis can be persuaded that Syria is a committed peace
partner, according to what diplomats presume to be the Syrian
thinking, Barak may find himself with more room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   And with another round of American presidential elections on the
horizon, there is concern that the Clinton administration, seen by
Syrians as a vital peace broker, will become increasingly
distracted by domestic politics. With Syria's economy sputtering
and unemployment running at 20 percent, the prospect of a
post-peace influx of Western aid and a reduction in military
spending appear increasingly attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria has had to become more realistic,'' said Hamdan Hamdan,
a Palestinian writer based in Damascus, ``particularly after
waiting through three long years of Netanyahu, when there was no
hope for peace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It also seems that a change at the top of Syria's opaque power
structure may come sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is believed to suffer from heart trouble and diabetes,
among other ailments, and although he clearly remains in charge, he
has assigned increasing responsibilities to Bashar, a former
opthamologist and now an army colonel, even dispatching him on
diplomatic trips to Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the succession is not yet certain, and Assad may hope to
convert the euphoria from any peace deal into a wave of acclamation
for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Under Syria's constitution, Bashar is still too young by six
years to become president. He does not yet hold another
prerequisite, a position within the leadership of the ruling Baath
party. His rapid rise is also believed to have caused resentment
among powerful figures in Syria's military and intelligence
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic dividends that could come from a
Syrian-Israeli peace, his chances of overcoming those obstacles
would certainly improve. And as the president looks to the future,
he must also worry that no other Syrian leader, and particularly
his son, can command the kind of authority he has built up during
nearly three decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Only someone with such authority may be in the position to
overcome any internal opposition to peace with a country with which
Syria has been at war for more than 50 years.

FRENCH MINISTER SEES UNREST COOLING IN ALGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Abdelaziz Bouteflika was elected president of
Algeria in April, in a one-candidate vote that hardly seemed likely
to end a civil war that has killed 100,000 people since 1992, the
French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, expressed ``concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Vedrine is singing a different tune since
his return last weekend from an official visit to Algiers.
``Algeria is emerging from its tragedy,'' he told the Journal du
Dimanche.
</P>
<P>
   His meetings with Bouteflika laid the groundwork, French
officials say, for renewing relations between France and its former
colony.
</P>
<P>
   France, which took in nearly a million immigrants after Algeria
won its independence in 1962, feared that in the current conflict
violence between Islamic militants and the previous
military-dominated government could easily spread to French soil,
and terrorist bombings by an Islamic network that killed 8 people
and wounded 160 in France in 1995 seemed only to prove the point.
</P>
<P>
   Having been accused by the Islamic militants of being too close
to the Algerian military authorities, France backed off after the
bombings but cracked down on the Algerian underground here and
ended the threat.
</P>
<P>
   But after all six of Bouteflika's opponents in last spring's
presidential elections in Algeria dropped out, charging ``massive
fraud'' by the government, some French officials thought that the
new president, a former foreign minister, would have little chance
of ending the civil war. It began after the military authorities
canceled an election that Islamic parties seemed certain to win.
</P>
<P>
   The violence is not over in Algeria, where 10 government
soldiers were killed and 5 were wounded over the weekend when
Muslim guerrillas ambushed them in a mountain village 180 miles
east of Algiers. But Bouteflika got the Islamic Salvation Army, one
of the biggest rebel factions, to agree to a peace accord in June
and later freed thousands of prisoners with pardons.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika announced on Sunday that he would hold a referendum
on the peace agreement on Sept. 16. He said in a nationally
televised speech on Monday that the referendum would mark the end
of the insurgency and the return of stability to Algeria. ``Foreign
capital needs security and confidence in order to return,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika is to visit Paris early next month on his way to the
annual U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York City. France's
prime minister, Lionel Jospin, told his cabinet this week that he
hoped Bouteflika would demonstrate improved relations with deeds as
well as words.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine seems convinced. ``Something has happened,'' he told the
Journal du Dimanche. ``President Bouteflika is there, he has made
statements and gestures that demonstrate a real opening, both at
the internal level, with the proposal for national reconciliation,
and on the international level. He has not hesitated to say that,
for him, the relationship with France was a fundamental one, or to
speak French.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the military authorities in Algeria were
trying to eliminate French from public schools there, a sign of the
strains that have persisted much of the time since 1962, when
Algeria became a separate country after a war that took 15,000
French and up to a million Algerian lives.
</P>
<P>
   And as recently as the beginning of 1998, hundreds of Algerian
villagers at a time were being massacred in attacks by the rebels,
and the few Europeans in the streets of Algiers felt dangerously
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a radically different situation,'' Vedrine observed.
``The climate has changed. An atmosphere of freedom has returned to
Algiers. The French people I met in Algeria in the course of my
visit told me, `In recent months, we are no longer afraid.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine said that French consulates in Annaba and Oran would
reopen, as the main one in Algiers had recently, and that France
had increased the number of visas for Algerians from 50,000 to
150,000. Air France is also considering whether it is safe to
resume flights between France and Algeria, which were suspended
after a flight from Algiers to Paris was hijacked in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine also appealed for French business to return to Algeria,
which last year imported $2 billion worth of food and industrial
equipment from France, compared with $960 million from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   French and American oil companies never stopped operations in
the Algerian desert, and Algeria exported $10 billion worth of oil
last year, the largest share going to Italy, France and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only encourage French enterprises that were there to
return, and for others to come,'' Vedrine said. ``Today Algerian
authorities seem to me to be very favorable to their returning.''

   ZITINJE, Yugoslavia _ Half of the homes in this once-mixed
village gape emptily now, purged of all their Serbs in one of the
failures of the U.S. peace-keeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of U.S. troops and armor, ethnic Albanians
from this village and surrounding ones intimidated the Serbs as the
Serbs had intimidated them a few months before, when the Albanians
were forced to leave this village a few miles southeast of
Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, despite U.S. promises of protection, all the 350 or
so Serbs of Zitinje demanded and received an armed U.S. escort to
travel the 35 miles east through the province of Kosovo toward the
border with Serbia, ignoring a plea to stay from Bishop Atanasije
of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it felt like a defeat, and it was perceived as a defeat
by all the higher command,'' said 1st Lt. Ryan Leigh, who commands
the U.S. platoon here. ``We did everything we could to get the
Serbs to stay, but they really wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Zitinje _ Zhiti in Albanian _ had a population of about 60
percent Albanians and 40 percent Serbs. It is a glaring example of
Kosovo's enduring problems, which good will, money and even the
force of sophisticated weaponry cannot easily mollify, remedy or
fix.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, rolls of razor wire surrounded the Serb houses, to
prevent them from being looted and burned; armed U.S. soldiers
patrolled the dirt streets of the village in groups of three in the
searing summer sun, as Albanian kids played with balloons and
showed each other their new Adidas footwear. Windows were broken;
furniture and clothes were scattered about; part of a dress uniform
of the Yugoslav army, trousers and cap, were scattered on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nevrete Emini, 38, who married a native of the village and has
lived here for 20 years, does not pretend to be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched them go, I was thinking of how we were thrown
out by them,'' she said acidly. ``But we left through clouds of
bullets, while they got to go with an escort from the Americans.''
She described how Serbian paramilitaries threatened to cut the
throat of her son, Esat, 17. ``It's better that they're gone,'' she
said. ``They were bad; they know what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-month war, in May, Serb troops and
paramilitaries herded the Albanians out of Zitinje, helped, Mrs.
Emini and others said, by some of the local Serbs. The Serbs killed
no one here, but demanded money from the Albanians _ 100, 200 or
300 German marks, whatever they had _ and sent them off to the
nearby town of Pozaranje.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for no clear reason, 10 days later, after trying to extort
more money, the Serbs let the Albanians of Zitinje return home.
</P>
<P>
   They came back, said Sabit Emini, 56, to find some of their
possessions and livestock looted and a few of their houses burned,
including that of his son, Ismet.
</P>
<P>
   Emini was careful to say he does not know who looted his house
and took one of his five cows, that it could have been Serbs from
the nearby villages and towns, like Kolkot. He had been told the
names of local Serbs who were under suspicion, he said, ``but I
couldn't do to them what they did to us, I can't even think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emini is troubled that the Serbs are gone. ``I was not happy to
watch them go,'' he said. ``It was tragic. Even if the men were
guilty, the women and children were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a failure of the peacekeepers? ``It's not good for us,
either,'' he said, touching his ``plis,'' the traditional white
wool cap. ``For more than a century they lived with us and we never
had real problems with them. But Belgrade's policy did this to
them; Milosevic did it to them,'' he said, referring to the
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who rose to power on the
grievances of Kosovo's Serbs and stripped autonomy from Kosovo in
1989.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, relations changed with the village Serbs,
who became more lordly and distant, pushed some Albanians from
their jobs and would not let Albanian children attend the new
village school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, in the streets, Serbs would say hello and ask for your
family, and sometimes in Albanian. Then, it mostly stopped. Some
older people would still say hello, but the younger ones, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Emini and his younger brother, Ethem, 45, offered soda and
Turkish coffee in their courtyard Wednesday, as 10 children
gathered around to stare at the strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better if only Albanians live here,'' said Ethem. ``There
was no shared life any more. And some of them did terrible
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they admitted, there was an effort by Albanians ``from
outside'' this village to drive the Serbs away. There had been
shooting at night, and in the previous 10 days, four Serbs from the
village had been killed. As the Americans cleaned up two of the
dead, young Albanian children flashed victory signs.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was open about the problems. Originally, the Americans had
a company of four platoons in the village, but after about three
weeks, he and his single platoon took their place.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, his troops had been in a 10-minute exchange of fire
with unknown people who had tried to lure them into an ambush by
setting a house on fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has no doubt that the intimidation of the Serbs was
deliberate, and said it reminded him of events a month ago in
Urosevac, which were ``totally controlled'' by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, ``even though they always denied it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies and Serbs were driven out in a week, he said, ``and then
the houses were looted in order, completely controlled, and then
burned, but of course they said no one controlled it.'' The
Americans caught a lot of looters and arsonists, he said, ``but it
had little effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Americans are trying to save what they can. The
problem was that Albanians gave goods to friendly Serbs to keep for
them when they left, and now that the Serbs are gone, there is no
way to prove who might own what.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a way, the troops are being turned into villagers.
</P>
<P>
   To protect Serbian property and avoid the health hazard of dead
animals, American soldiers gathered together the Serbs' livestock _
horses, cows, goats, ducks, pigs, chickens _ and are feeding them,
Leigh said, laughing. ``It's crazy,'' he said. ``We've tried to get
rid of the pigs, but the Albanians won't eat them,'' since many are
Muslim, ``and the Serbs don't want to come to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone now in this Albanian town is grateful to the Americans
and the rest of NATO for saving them from the Serbs. ``If not for
God, first, then the Americans, maybe we would all be dead,'' Sabit
Emini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never know how the world turns,'' he said. ``Maybe the
Serbs will be back, and it would be terrible for them to return and
find their goods gone, as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in words of praise that might ring ominously to Leigh and
his troops, Emini said: ``The Serbs are 10 million and we are just
2 million. We can never let the Americans and the British and the
Germans leave here.''

BRITISH DEFENSE CHIEF NAMED NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONS, Belgium _ British Defense Secretary George Robertson, who
began his working life organizing whisky workers for labor unions
in his native Scotland, was appointed by the 19 NATO allies
Wednesday to be NATO's next secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, 53, will probably take up his duties as NATO's senior
civilian official in Brussels in October, according to an allied
spokesman. The current secretary-general, Javier Solana of Spain,
is expected to move then into his new job as defense and security
coordinator for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent representatives of the allies reached consensus in
Brussels on Wednesday and agreed that Robertson was the right man
for a job for which British Prime Minister Tony Blair nominated him
only last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the allies were ready to name Robertson on
Monday, NATO diplomats said, but Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg wanted more time. Belgium had also hoped that its former
prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, would get the job, one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got the job because my experience as Britain's
defense secretary has perhaps suited me for some of the challenges
of the future, and the combination, perhaps, of straight talking,
plain common sense, and a dogged determination to get to where I
think is the right place to go,'' Robertson said in London on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His straight talk, through a thick Scottish accent, made him one
of the most powerful proponents of the 78-day NATO bombing
operation against Yugoslavia, which was overseen by the allied
military headquarters here in Mons.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Kosovo crisis, he showed firm and principled
leadership,'' Solana said of his successor Wednesday. He said that
in his new European Union job, he expected to work closely with
Robertson to build what he called ``a stronger European role and
responsibility in NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Kosovo conflict, Blair and Robertson pushed for
European defenses strong enough to allow the countries on the
eastern side of the Atlantic to undertake operations like the one
in Kosovo even when the United States chooses not to become
involved.
</P>
<P>
   It was that support, enshrined in a French and British
declaration last December, that made France decide to back
Robertson for the NATO job as soon as his candidacy was put forward
last week, French officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the United States flew more than 60 percent of the
bombing missions and showed, with satellite-guided bombs and
sophisticated anti-missile defenses, how advanced military
technology could bring an enemy to the point of capitulating even
before a single soldier went in to join battle on the ground. That
made the Europeans realize that they were a long way from the kind
of defense they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent two-thirds of what the United States spends on
defense, but we don't have anything like two-thirds of the
capability,'' Robertson said Wednesday. ``That is because we
compete with each other, we duplicate each other, and that era is
now over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kosovo has brought home to us that we must be much
more cooperative in the way we do things in Europe,'' he said.
``And we must develop capabilities that allow us, when it is
necessary, or when it is desirable, to take action without the full
membership of NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the United States, in other words, because the United
States may not want to get entangled in the next Kosovo, British
and other European military officials say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In NATO, Robertson's judicious qualities, praised by U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen in a letter published by The
Guardian newspaper in Britain early this week, will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   While France and some other allies want to strengthen European
defense abilities so NATO, and U.S. leadership, become less
important and indispensable than they were in Kosovo, the United
States and Britain prefer to talk about strengthening the European
pillar within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Countries on both sides of the Atlantic have paid lip service to
this idea for years, and the Europeans have expended vast
quantities of hot air but not much money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Britain and France are committed to streamlining
armed forces originally intended to defend against a Soviet
invasion. The new mission is to make them more mobile and more
quickly deployable to trouble spots like Kosovo. Britain is well
along in the reorganization process and France has begun it, but
Germany has hardly started to think about change.
</P>
<P>
   Germany backed Robertson after its defense minister, Rudolf
Scharping, made clear that he thought his place was fighting budget
battles in Berlin for his own troops in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also managed, in a little more than two years as
defense secretary, to win the trust of Cohen and other U.S.
officials, leaving the Clinton administration as pleased as
Britain, France, and Germany all say they are with Robertson's
appointment to head the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson differed at the end of the Kosovo bombing with the
S. allied commander here, Gen. Wesley Clark, on a proposal to send
paratroopers into Pristina Airport to stake claim to the territory
before Russian troops could interlope.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson backed the British commander on the ground in Kosovo,
Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, who balked at the paratroop mission and
objected that it could bring on ``World War III.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson could bring on war of words within NATO unless he
shows willingness to use French as well as English in his new job.
``We are deeply committed to that,'' said French Foreign Ministry
spokesman Francois Rivasseau. `` Robertson knows it, and we have
confidence in him,'' Rivasseau said.

RELATIVE OF SLAYING VICTIMS CALLS FOR EXTENDED HATE CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A woman whose daughter and granddaughter were slain
last winter in Yosemite National Park pleaded with Congress on
Wednesday to pass legislation that would expand federal hate crimes
laws to include sexual orientation, gender and disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and grandchild were killed for no other reason
than they were women,'' the woman, Carole Carrington of Eureka,
Calif., told members of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, and her daughter Juli Sund, 15, were killed
while vacationing at the park in Northern California. Silvina
Pelosso, 16, a friend of the Sund family from Argentina, also was
slain.
</P>
<P>
   The chief suspect in the three killings, Cary Stayner, 37, was a
resident handyman at the Cedar Lodge just outside the Yosemite, the
same lodge were the three victims were last seen alive in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say Stayner has confessed to the strangling the
woman and teen-age girls. He said in a recent interview with a San
Francisco television station that he had dreamed about killing
women since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot bring my loved ones back to me, but you can make a
commitment to all families that hate-based violence against their
loved ones will be taken seriously by passing tough legislation
that makes the necessary federal resources available,'' said
Carrington, who appeared near tears several times in her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The current federal law covers crimes based on race, color,
religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the words ``hate crime'' are not used in the federal
statute, the term generally refers to crimes of passion in which an
assailant intentionally attacks a person because of the victim's
race, color, national origin or religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the law requires that the victims of hate crimes be
participating in one of several federally protected activities when
the crime occurs, such as attending public school, voting or
traveling on an interstate highway.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved a bill that would eliminate the six
activities as a precondition for a hate crime to occur and would
expand the law to cover sexual orientation, gender and disability.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told the panel that the
number of hate crimes increased from 4,560 in 1991 to 8,049 in
1998. He added that the true number likely is much higher since
many hate crimes are not reported by the victims or recognized by
police departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the depth of this type of crime is only beginning to
be understood by society and law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder also said extending the federal hate crimes law was
needed because many states either have no such statutes or their
laws do not cover some categories.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia
have passed laws that increase penalties for crimes that are
committed because of race, religion, color, national origin and
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, whether they be women or homosexuals or the disabled,
need to feel that justice can be found anywhere in the country,''
Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Troy, a specialist on constitutional law at the American
Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, told
the House panel that laws on hate crimes ``Balkanize'' American
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes legislation invites political warfare along
racial, ethnic, religious and other lines, with each group claiming
to be more victimized than the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Troy said that hate crimes laws ``imply that one person's life
is more important than another'' by treating the same crime
differently depending on the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of the civil rights movement was that people would
be treated equal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also is opposed by Reuben Greenberg, chief of
the Charleston (S.C.) Police Department, and Sheriff Patrick J.
Sullivan Jr. of Arapahoe County, Colo. Arapahoe, which includes the
city of Littleton, is where two teen-agers killed 13 classmates at
Columbine High School and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he feared the measure would mean a greater federal
presence in local law enforcement. ``What we're not looking for is
a federal takeover of hate crimes law enforcement,'' he told the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said the state and local police are ``willing and
able'' to quickly and effectively deal with hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time, an unenlightened time, when federal
legislation was seen as our only hope ... but that simply is not
the case today,'' he said.

   Sometimes you hit the lottery and sometimes you don't, but you
can always depend on newspapers to print goofy headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Columbia Journalism Review and Richard Lederer,
author of ``Anguished English: An Anthology of Accidental Assaults
Upon Our Language,'' for collecting these classic flubs.

   Grandmother of Eight Makes Hole in One
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what the grandchild did to deserve such harsh
treatment, but you've got to figure that with eight grandkids, one
is bound to be annoying. You might say its par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Two Convicts Evade Noose; Jury Hung
</P>
<P>
   Well, they had the gallows built and everything, so I guess they
had to hang someone. Still, this does not seem like a good way to
get citizens to perform jury duty.

<P>
   Students Hear Reptile Lecture

<P>
   I wonder what it had to say? Probably complaining about the
Hollywood's portrayal of reptiles in such movies as ``Lake Placid''
and ``Anaconda.''

   Services for Man Who Refused to Hate Thursday in Atlanta

   Fried Chicken Cooked in Microwave Wins Trip
</P>
<P>
   This is a heart, not to mention gizzard, warming story as
chickens almost never win anything these days. Still, this seems a
high price to pay for any prize, especially if the trip turns out
to be a visit to Col. Sander's boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   Prison Warden Says Inmates May Have 3 Guns
</P>
<P>
   This seems excessive to me. I can see giving an inmate one or,
at the most, two guns but three is just asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Teacher Talks Very Slow
</P>
<P>
   This seems like a cruel and unnecessary thing for the press to
report. Just because a teacher talks very slowly does not mean he
or she is a bad teacher. In fact, if I were the teacher, I'd demand
an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fossils Said to Back Creationism
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's quite likely, but it should also be mentioned that
there are some middle-aged and maybe even a few young people who
back creationism, too. Besides, in these days of political
correctness, it's considered rude and inappropriate to refer to old
people as fossils, no matter what crackpot views they may hold.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Aid Advocates Worry
</P>
<P>
   I often advocate worry, too, but if I had a problem that
required hiring a legal aid, I'd want him or her to come up with a
more imaginative plan.
</P>
<P>
   Obscenity Should Include Violence
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about the rest of us, but Hollywood filmmakers
certainly seem to think so.

   This would have to be the shortest talk Dr. Ruth ever gave. In
fact, it would consist of only three words: Don't do it.

<P>
   ROME _ The gentleman buying an espresso at The Friends Art Cafe
here looked a bit startled when the male cashier called him
``amore'' as he handed over his change. But the cashier pointed to
the tiny cellular phone in his ear and explained he was talking to
his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it mostly as a toy, for fun,'' Alessandro Sabatino, 35,
said of his cell phone, after he finally rang off. ``I like leaving
little automatic messages and talking to my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that he and his fellow citizens might have taken
cell phone talk to excess. ``We Italians don't respect limits,'' he
said with a laugh. ``But it is a bit exaggerated. I have friends
who use their cell phones just to call their mothers three times a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   This Italian passion for cell phone communication is all too
audible on crosswalks, motorbikes, construction scaffolding, in
restaurants, theaters, school yards and even at the Colosseum,
where actor-centurions startle tourists by talking on cell phones
that clash with their 1st century costumes. The phenomenon
fascinates Italians, who can no more stop theorizing about their
cell phone addiction than they can stop placing calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians just have an unquenchable desire to talk _ we are a
nation of chatterboxes,'' said Paolo Stefanato, a journalist who
has written two books on cell phone etiquette. ``The really
remarkable thing is how unimportant all our cell phone
conversations are: `What did you eat?' or `where are you?'''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Italy crossed a communications threshold: It now has
more cell phones than telephone lines, a feat thus far achieved
only by Finland, the land of Nokia, the big wireless phone
manufacturer. Scandinavians still hold the record for per capita
phone use, led by Finland, where nearly 60 percent of the
population have cell phones as of the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, where about 36 percent of the population have cell
phones, is sixth, behind Iceland (38 percent). But Italians are far
more addicted to them than their Spanish, French or British
counterparts. In the United States, about 25 of the population uses
cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Franco Ferrarotti, a sociologist at the University of Sapienza
in Rome, also believes that the Italian overuse of cell phones
stems from the national passion for verbal communication. But he
said it was abetted by a flair for deception. ``Lying is a
Mediterranean art form, `` he told the Rome daily newspaper Il
Messaggero. The cell phone ``allows us to call from downtown Rome
and say we are on vacation in the Maldives or Paris or London,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists like Ferraroti say the cell phone is no longer a
status symbol in Italy. Rather, they view it as a crutch that has
now spread across social classes and deep into the fabric of
Italian society. Under a headline ``Cell phones: the real story is
the sacred Italian family,'' journalist Beppe Severgnini wrote in a
recent edition of Corriere Della Sera that cell phones had tapped
into the ``the triumph of the tentacled family relations in
Italy.'' He described the cell phone as a ``high-tech umbilical
cord.''
</P>
<P>
   The maternal cell phone grip even infects American expatriates.
Stefania 25, an Italian schoolteacher, says her American-born
mother was initially opposed to her having a cell phone. ``But then
she saw she could call me and feel more secure, and now she calls
me ten times a day,'' she said with a laugh. ``She's become a real
Italian mother, always worried.'' She did not want her last name
used because she does not want her grandmother to know that she is
reachable by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, cell phones are sometimes known as cellulari (a
Neapolitan singer, Franco Moreno, composed a tender ode to the
instrument, called ``O Cellulare,'') but most people call them
``telefonini,'' a diminutive term that carries an underlying tone
of endearment. The latest technology allows people to speak into
tiny earphones attached to the cell phone, freeing Italians to
speak by phone with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has three different cell phone companies, and a fourth one
opening for business next Christmas, and that has driven costs to
as low as six cents a minute at night. The fact that the average
cell phone call in Italy is slightly less expensive than one in
France or England is dismissed as irrelevant by Italian theorists,
who point out that non-Latin societies where average cell phone
calls are almost as cheap use them far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotsmen and Germans cannot imitate us,'' Severgnini argued,
with a touch of national pride. ``They wouldn't know whom to
call.''
</P>
<P>
   But Italians are also interested in how the cell phone has
altered life extramaritally. In July, Genoa police were summoned to
a household to stop a husband from hitting his wife. According to
police, the wife accidently hit the redial button on her cell phone
while with she was with her lover, ringing her husband. He became
suspicious, and went home to discover her infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are also studied intensely by Italian semiologists.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Bartezzaghi, a semiologist in Milan, wrote an esoteric
essay for La Stampa, a Turin daily. He said this of the cell phone:
``Beyond being a status symbol, it has strong quality of a toy and
of a fetish . . . pleasant to touch, reconfigure, personalize the
ring, and care for, by recharging its batteries. The object
attracts the same artificial attentions of the Tamagotchi,''
referring to the Japanese virtual pet toy craze of a few years
back, ``but also the periodic and structured devotion of the
Rosary.''
</P>
<P>
   Peer pressure _ as well as a mother's need to check on her
children _ explains why Italian teen-agers are armed with cell
phones, which they talk into while driving their motorbikes. But
Augusto, a 52-year-old construction worker who had a cell phone
attached to his tool belt as he worked bare-chested in the hot
morning sun, said he had also succumbed to the herd instinct. ``My
colleagues pressured me into getting one,'' he explained gruffly.
``They made fun of me because I was the only guy on the crew
without a cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians have also studied the Italian phenomenon, more
dryly. Istat, the national institute of statistics, recently
published a study revealing that most Italians, men and women
alike, have cell phones in order to chat to friends and family
members. Istat discovered that more pragmatic motives, including
personal safety, were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I find truly irritating about cell phones is
that Italians talk on them so loudly,'' Stefanato, the cell phone
etiquette expert, said. ``They yell into it. It's the biggest
breach of good manners today.''

GUITARIST RAGES AGAINST THE MEDIA OVER WOODSTOCK '99 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 BY NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the highlights of last month's three-day Woodstock '99
festival in Rome, N.Y., was a performance by Rage Against the
Machine, the politically minded Southern California rap and
hard-rock band. The New York Times asked the group's guitarist, Tom
Morello, to write about his reaction to the festival and its
aftermath: four reports of rape to police and a post-festival melee
during which some audience members set fires, looted trucks and
leaped through the flames until hundreds of New York State Police
troopers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Morello writes: ``Hey man, leave the kids alone. I've had enough
of the frenzied demonization of young people surrounding Woodstock
'99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there were fires and the kids danced around them in pagan
glee. Yes, parts of the stage and scaffolding were torn down with
great enthusiasm. But was this just senseless violence or were
these acts of sweet revenge against concert organizers who gouged
the kids throughout the weekend with grossly overpriced water, beer
and food?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the crass commercialism of the event and the greedy
exploitation of these youngsters caught up with the vendors and
promoters. Or maybe it was just a good old-fashioned healthy riot.
One with a killer soundtrack. And while some of the concertgoers
were naked or painted or covered in tinfoil, perhaps they were just
rejoicing in not having to wear their annoying school uniform for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media coverage of the event and the accompanying political
grandstanding have been grossly hypocritical. Indignant editorials
and television broadcasts raving over the `horrific violence' and
`terrifying blazes' were rampant. But, when U.S. Tomahawk missiles
lit a children's hospital outside of Belgrade on fire, killing many
inside, it was not chewed over to this extent. More incredulous
attention was paid to kids setting fires at Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truly inexcusable crime committed at Woodstock is the
reported sexual assaults. During our set we didn't see anything of
the kind taking place and would have stopped the show immediately
if we had. Rage Against the Machine has a great deal of respect for
its audience and demands that they respect one another. We use our
music not only to entertain, but to galvanize and inspire our fans
to fight back against abuse and injustice wherever they rear their
ugly heads _ in the home, in the school, at work or in society at
large. And while most of the other bands at Woodstock '99 have a
more escapist bent, they certainly shouldn't be blamed for this
thuggish behavior. More members of the New York City Police
Department have participated in, watched and laughed at a
broomstick rape than anyone onstage at Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Woodstock was filled with predators: the degenerate
idiots who assaulted those women, the greedy promoters who wrung
every cent out of thirsty concertgoers, and last but not least, the
predator media that turned a blind eye to real violence and
scapegoated the quarter of a million music fans at Woodstock '99,
the vast majority of whom had the time of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps we'll have to wait until these vandals and pyromaniacs
grow up to become the CEOs of media conglomerates, like their
predecessors at the original Woodstock who enshrined and
mythologized that event, to see where this concert fits into our
history.''

   HOLBROOKE-CONFIRM (Washington) _ The way is cleared for Richard
Holbrooke to win Senate confirmation as chief American diplomat at
the United Nations. Holbrooke was all but assured of the post when
the last senator to block the nomination, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
announced he was releasing a ``hold'' that had prevented a final
Senate vote. Senate officials say a vote will be held before the
Senate adjourns for its summer recess, scheduled to begin this
weekend. By Philip Shenon.

   DEBT-BUYBACK (Washington) _ Like a family that suddenly finds
itself with enough cash to pay off both its credit cards and its
mortgage, the Clinton administration moves to take advantage of
projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling the way the
government handles its finances. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said the government will change its strategy for handling
the $3.6 billion it owes to the public in the form of Treasury
bonds and other securities. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   SYRIA-ISRAEL (Quneitra, Syria) _ From here, only a few coils of
barbed wire lie between Syria and its land, occupied by Israel for
32 years. To Syrians, the high-tech observation posts on
surrounding hilltops seem to laugh down at them, a boast about who
still controls the Golan Heights. The streets are all but deserted,
off-limits to most Syrians. The buildings are rubble, sacked by
Israeli forces years ago and left that way by the Syrians to rally
foreigners' anger, and to preserve their own bitter memories. But
such is the mood in Syria today that when visitors look into the
middle distance, they say they see prospects for an Israeli-Syrian
peace that may be nearer than ever before. By Douglas Jehl. (MOVED)

   SCOUTS-GAYS (Trenton, N.J.) _ The New Jersey Supreme Court has

first time they have lost such a case in a state supreme court, say
they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. California's highest
court upheld the Scouts last year, based on the fact that it is a
private club. But the New Jersey court found that the Boy Scouts
are a ``place of public accommodation'' with a broad-based
membership and forms partnerships with public entities and public
service organizations. By Robert Hanley.

<P>
   (italics)The dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov and the
dancer-choreographer Trisha Brown have a lifetime of dance in
common, though his has been in classical and only lately in modern,
while hers has been wholly in modern. They performed together in
Ms. Brown's 1996 duet, ``You Can See Us.'' Since then, among many
projects, Ms. Brown, 62, has directed an opera, Monteverdi's
``Orfeo,'' produced a book of drawings and presented the premiere
of her latest piece, ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' a
collaboration with the composer-trumpeter Dave Douglas and the
artist Terry Winters, at Jacob's Pillow. She will perform in her
own work at Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Baryshnikov, 51 (known to all as Misha), performed in a solo
program at City Center last year and has been touring with his
company, White Oak Dance Project, which he founded in 1990. White
Oak, currently comprising Baryshnikov and five women, will present
a two-week season starting Tuesday at the New Victory Theater in
Manhattan and will perform works by Neil Greenberg, Amy O'Brien,
Lucy Guerin, Mark Morris, Tamasaburo Bando and Karole Armitage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown and Baryshnikov met recently at her studio near
Lincoln Center when he was in town rehearsing a duet, ``Occasion
Piece'' by Merce Cunningham, that he and Cunningham performed at
Lincoln Center Festival '99. The following is excerpted from a
tape-recorded dialogue between Misha and Trisha about dance, life,
photography and golf.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   _Annette Grant
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. When we danced together in ``You Can See Us,'' I
marveled at how you learned the piece. You sort of diagrammed the
air with your hand, writing numbers on it sometimes. I had never
seen anyone do that. How did you work out what came first, what
came next, what came third?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Your dancers hang out for years, sort of like children.
They learn a language and suddenly they start to speak. You cannot
teach this. It's like reaching into water for something and it goes
phfffft between your fingers. I didn't have the luxury of living
four or five months with this piece; I had to simply learn it. So I
looked for a phrase that was familiar and asked, How I can chain
this? What comes next? It's frustrating, because sometimes you miss
one element, and you (strikes the table, bam!) hit the wall, you're
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. What about narrative, emotion, character, depiction in
phrasing, which comes from your ballet background? On this entry
into abstraction, what kind of a song do you create, or do you?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. It has been more than 10 years since I've worked full
time with narrative. Now I'm trying to trust my body and listen to
that silence, or listen to that music, and give my body a chance. I
pretty much know when I'm pushing it, when I'm forcing things to
happen, because I know that the work is not quite at the right
level. Subconsciously, you can muscle it out of your body, but it
comes out not to my satisfaction. With each work _ whether by you
or Merce Cunningham or Mark Morris or Twyla Tharp or Martha Graham
_ I try to decode the choreographic thought behind how it was
created, its purpose. And I ask myself, if I were in the audience,
what would excite me about this dancer-person, this person-dancer?
Seeing perfect execution is not enough; you have to be a bit of a
voyeur and try to find some secrets about this person who is
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   As a dancer, I am instinctively saying what I can say. I'm
always trying to do justice to the piece as a messenger,
interpreter. I work hard to make the material what the
choreographer wants. There comes a moment in the final couple of
days when you ask, What is the actual intent here? Then a few
seconds before the curtain, and you're nervous. All the insecurity
and fear melts in the excitement, and you know finally what this
piece is about.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. It's interesting that you look for the purpose of the
material. I'm very curious about narrative now. I just did an opera
where, in movement, gesture and action, I had to depict a story.
And the one thing I knew to do, since I knew nothing about it, was
to ask, Who is this character? And what is he doing? And then I
could go right to the root of what I had to show. I wonder if that
works for you?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Maybe not for each abstract phrase, but the overall
intent. I'm not trying to act out every phrase by any means. But
sometimes there's a mystery about it that gives it a strange kind
of bouquet, and your body language is affected whether you want it
to be or not, and that makes it more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Preparing to dance with Merce Cunningham in his
``Occasion Piece,'' did he make the shapes and the phrasing on a
computer, out of his head, or on you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I had dinner with him a few months ago, and he said he
was already working on my part on the computer. I think he takes
notes from the computer and he arrives at rehearsal with the
material that he intends to set that day. He works pretty fast,
probably 8, 10 days to make an 8- to 9-minute piece. He did his
homework, I'll tell you. With Merce there is no confusion or trying
this or that. No, no, it's this way exactly. Very precise. He knew
what he wanted and exactly where I would go in space, because, of
course, he knew the position of the Duchamp set by heart. When he
works, he works nonstop and very concentrated for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. What about his part?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. He's putting himself in the piece tomorrow. It's like two
solos that we're dancing together. I can make certain decisions
about what I'm doing, within his basic vocabulary, as long as I
arrive right on time.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. What does it feel like to you physically to dance one of
Merce's pieces?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I rehearsed a couple of his pieces when I was with
American Ballet Theater, and I took some of his technique classes.
And it's tough on my body. But I forgot how much it hurts. Because
I'm kind of very solid in my torso, you know, in a way we are
trained in classical dance. So when he asks for extra curves and
twists, my body screams.
</P>
<P>
   I'm kind of used to it now, but it takes an extra amount of
stretching and really forcing myself. But in this case the pain is
a pleasure. When he asked me to perform with him, I was so
flattered, but I said, ``Merce, you understand that I can't do
certain things. You know, I cannot squat because of my many knee
operations, and I cannot just leap up and down and all that.'' He
said, ``No, no, no.'' He said, ``I saw you dance last year at City
Center and at St. Mark's Church and I know exactly what you can do,
and I will never force you to do anything that would hurt you.''
And, indeed, he understood what I could do, and yet he also posed
physical challenges for me.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Diabolical?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Exactly. You know, I first saw Merce dance maybe 25 years
ago. This means he was in his mid-50s, and he was still amazing. He
did all the floor and all the aerial, and he was much older than I
am now, and in much better shape.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. It was an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. No, no, it was not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. I think you do more for modern dance than anyone else in
the country. You present it, you produce it, you introduce a wide
public audience to young choreographers and to choreographers in
modern dance in general, which validates it and gives prestige to
the choreographers. I know that also you take the proceeds from
some performances and contribute them to another not-for-profit
organization, like a dance foundation or children with AIDS. I
don't think people know about it.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. They don't have to. It's good when there is a certain
human purpose behind something you do or commission, when those
things are connected. It would be fun to spend a few million
dollars to commission a few things to a few people, if somebody
would give it to me. And I have some ideas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. What is the organizational model of White Oak? How is it
different from traditional modern dance companies?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I think it's organized anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. And you get away with it?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Most of the time. Most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Can you describe it?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. First of all, we don't have long-term plans. Which is a
nightmare for our presenters and for theaters where we want to
dance. As you know, when you run a company you have to know what
you'll do a year from now. And we don't know. Right now we're
putting together November.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. I'm scheduled through 2002!
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I know we are going to Europe. But we have no concrete
plans for January and February yet, because that gives us freedom;
if something interesting comes up, we can switch to that project. I
would probably slash my wrists if I had to decide now where and
what to dance a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. How do you make choices about what you and the company
will dance? We have ethnic diversity in modern dance, but we don't
have esthetic diversity so well established. And we tend to lionize
one great choreographer in both ballet and modern as well. This is
the Christian system, you know: there's only one way. But I see you
as a questing spirit. You choose choreographers from across the
spectrum. They are all sorts _ young, midcareer established,
masters, unknown, commissioned, repertory, new work ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Well, because I didn't grow up in this country, when I
started to dance, we knew there were three important American
women: Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham, the three
giantesses of the contemporary movement. And nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   After I arrived in the States, I started to see everything. But
for me, watching an evening was a strange experience, my mind was
split in two. I was trying to figure out who were these people and
how they were dancing and what was the genesis of their movement. I
never saw anything like it. I was so hypnotized by the dancing that
it took me a few years to separate the dancing from the
choreography and to gain enough mental stamina to appreciate the
evening over all.
</P>
<P>
   Some things were easier than others. For example, a Graham was
easier for me because it had a narrative, and that was familiar,
although it was in a very esoteric language. But ``Appalachian
Spring'' is ``Appalachian Spring'' and I knew the story. But with
people like you and Merce or Lucinda Childs, I just ask__
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. What is (italics)this?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Yeah. I was totally mesmerized by the way those dancers
were and how they looked _ how plain a body can be, and how
beautiful at the same time. At that moment I said I want to do this
at some point.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. You've already had a long career with many facets to it:
a celebrity for 25 years since defecting from the Soviet Union, a
career in classical dance with American Ballet Theater and New York
City Ballet, the artistic directorship of ABT, the formation of
White Oak. And then there's the physical difficulty that you deal
with _ the pain from your surgery and the brain space that takes on
a daily basis, especially when you're dancing. Do you ever wonder,
``How can I deal with all this?'' There's your talent, and this
huge construction has been built around your talent. Do you think
about that?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I think I'm fortunate to know so many truly remarkable
people. And I learned so much from them, and even those who didn't
become close friends shared a kind of intense sort of creative
process, no matter how successful it was. I've had my share of
duds, but every experience was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. I don't feel I can have a dud. If I don't make a good
choreography, I think I'll be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Oh, I was in quite a few.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. It gets easy?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. No, not easy. Especially when you work in a big company,
unlike White Oak, and have to dance one piece until the season is
over, sometimes for years. And your heart is not quite there. And
you have to really discipline yourself.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. How do you think we keep going? Are we obsessed?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. We do it because there's nothing better to do. I'm
serious. Because there's nothing more exciting than that. Life is
so boring, that's why we are so driven to that mystery of creation.
Nothing is better than those few minutes before the premiere when
the stage opens, and you put yourself on the spot (sighs).
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. The intrigue of finding your way through making a new
piece, the total newness of it, the unknown-ness of it, the
dedication of all the people around ... It was really wonderful
when my company started performing ``Five Part Weather Invention''
at Jacob's Pillow a few weeks ago. The musicians were improvising,
though certain internal things were precooked _ there was a score.
They're looking at the dancers going fast and hard and all this
richness is coming out, and they get excited because there is a
deep collaboration happening between the dancers and the musicians.
A miracle. Another miracle, Misha.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. It is moving, it is moving. And sometimes everyday life
becomes very laborious vis-a-vis the experience of being part of
the creative process. But of course both are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. In my case I'm asked now, ``Are you still dancing?'' And
my answer is, ``Well, I danced two weeks ago, so you could say I'm
in early retirement.'' Or, ``I'm dancing at Lincoln Center on Aug.
13, so I know that I'm dancing at least until the 14th.'' But that
kind of tenuous relationship to one of the things I do best is very
frightening to me. And I wonder if you deal with that?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Sometimes, over morning coffee, I ask myself how long it
will all last. I'm not a choreographer, so do I still want to be
part of the stage experience when I'm no longer a performer?
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. How do you deal with that predator, fame?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. The press has been really kind to me in terms of leaving
me alone as just a human being. I accept certain realities of the
public interest, but how I live, my private life, I wouldn't tell
them anyway. I really live a boring bourgeois existence. I have a
few small hobbies, but I'm particularly trying to be a good dad. My
biggest fear is that I'm not being good enough. I worship my
children and my family, and try to be 100 percent a father, but
it's just not enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   I remember somebody said people in art shouldn't have children.
I agree and disagree; we are very selfish animals. Stanislavsky
said that art needs sacrifice. Yes, but the sacrifice falls on the
shoulders of spouses, lovers, husbands, everybody around. But the
person who is the artist actually doesn't feel that way. And
sometimes, when the children start to call me Mommy, I realize that
I'm away from home too long.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I am not an orthodox parent _ Lisa (his wife) is an
angel mother. She's phenomenal and I adore her. She gives our
family its structure. I have four children, the oldest is 18, the
youngest one is 5. I worry that my children don't have enough
experience in art. They kind of, like every young person in this
country, get attached to a television.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Can you take the passion and intelligence that has
informed you about one art form and transfer it to another
discipline, like photography?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Well, it's one of my small hobbies. I hit on photography
because I cannot draw, I cannot play instruments (Trisha mimes
playing a piano) well, a little bit. That's about it. I took up
photography probably 15 years ago. I do it on a very, very small
scale; one picture out of 10 rolls is working. I photograph my
children a lot and my friends. I have a little Nikon and a nice
Leica, and they are my companions. On trips I make sure to go out
alone and take photographs.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in my teens, I took all these magazines, you know,
Harper's Bazaar and Vogue, and I saw the photographs of Alexey
Brodovitch, a very famous art director and photographer. Irving
Penn was and still is my idol. And the first Magnum photographers.
I got to know the work of Eve Arnold and Richard Avedon. All these
photographers were such romantic figures; they gave this life to
the images, which is such an extraordinary kind of noble and quiet
work in solitude. And there is, of course, chance and there is a
lot of craft involved, and the result is you have a moment in
history, and a moment in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Do you like the fact that it's a form of solitude?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Of course. I always thought it would be nice to be a
writer or something. Too bad I cannot write. It's nice to be an
artist. Too bad I cannot draw. I can't do what you do, when you're
ready to draw, you can go to your studio and do it. You are a
person who creates all the time. I think about the interpretation
of a piece, but I'm not a choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. I have so little time to draw, but I love it very much.
So, it's curious.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. That's probably sort of where I was when I took up golf
10, 15 years ago. I'm a very high handicapper, like 15, 16.
Sometimes I go at 6 or 7 in the evening to the golf course and hit
golf balls. I'll hit 20 badly and two really well. These two, in a
certain way, clean up something in you. There's a certain feeling
of perfection, and it's not that hard. I mean, certain things could
be figured out in life by hook or by slice, you know? So to speak,
in golf terms.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Do you ever think to yourself _ and this has happened to
me _ I have this amazing body that's become an art machine, an art
object that, well, it's almost like it's not mine.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Funny, I never felt that, because I have always had a
complex about my body, because, until I was 16, 17, I was very
short. I was really working hard on my classical technique, and I
thought why all this work? I wouldn't be able to dance those dances
anyway because I would be too short. I was scared that I would be
5-5 or 5-4, and that would be at the end of it. The only thing
would be character roles. And I looked in the mirror and said,
yecch.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not extremely tall now. That's why I have problems with my
knees. Because I was really pushing; because my hips were kind of
tight, square. And I was pushing my knees to extend, you know. And
I had hurt myself enough when I was in my teens _ 12, 13, 14, 15 _
that I just didn't look and say, oh, how beautifully I dance. My
turnout was not enough. My extension was not. I was really strong,
because I participated in sports. I played soccer. I took
gymnastics. And I was in a way more coordinated and stronger than
my classmates. But my body was not perfect for ballet.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. But how do you feel now? Because you are at the top of
the dance field.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Now I think I look weird, too, for modern dance; I'm not
beefy enough. Traditionally, modern dance is based on big men _
Jose Limon, say, and Paul Taylor and Merce. But I'm grateful that
my body is still there and still allows me to do things. I get a
bit panicked when when I get hurt. I hate to cancel performances,
and for years I haven't. But it's scary.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. How do you deal with that?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. I have a wonderful physiotherapist who works with me
every day. When I perform, it's a minimum of three hours on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. It's a lot.
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. Well, of course, I use the time to read. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA. Do you have to change the way you're dancing to avoid
the injured zones?
</P>
<P>
   MISHA. The choreographers I work with pretty much know what I
can do, that octave that I can go up and down. And in that area I
am 100 percent. I can do anything.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe one day my body will shut down and say I cannot. This
means the work may be more experimental, maybe with the spoken
word, maybe just with movement. I would like to do something with
Richard Forman, perhaps work again with David Gordon and, of
course, have a second chance to collaborate with you. I think I can
contribute something, and it doesn't have to be dance dance. There
are a lot of things I still have to discover, and I'm happy that
this urge is still there.

   QUNEITRA, Syria _ From here, only a few coils of barbed wire lie
between Syria and the sliver of its land that Israel has held for
32 years. To Syrians the high-tech observation posts on surrounding
hilltops seem to laugh down at them, a boast about just who
controls the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Quneitra are all but deserted, off-limits to most
Syrians. The buildings are rubble, sacked by Israeli forces years
ago and left that way by the Syrians to rally foreigners' anger and
refresh bitter national memories.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood in Syria today is such that when visitors like
Ahmed Abu Khalid gaze from Quneitra into the middle distance, where
Israeli traffic is plainly visible, they say they see an
Israeli-Syrian peace that may be nearer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that in six months everything will be OK,'' Abu Khalid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syrians, particularly those like Abu Khalid, 27, a plainclothes
policeman, are not known for being loquacious with foreign
journalists. But that customary reserve has begun to soften, and
more than just a little, in an atmosphere of optimism and urgency
about peace that seems to begin at the very top.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, President Hafez al-Assad has praised Ehud
Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, as ``a strong and honest
man'' _ a big bouquet from a man who could barely bring himself to
pronounce the word Israel a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's Foreign Ministry has said it is prepared to match any
new peace moves from Israel ``step by step,'' and its former chief
negotiator, Walid al-Mualem, the ambassador to Washington, has gone
so far as to suggest that an agreement with Israel may be possible
within ``a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   A Damascus-based diplomat said a determined Syrian effort to
make peace with Barak's government appeared likely: ``There's a
decision, I think, that here comes the gold ring again, maybe for
the last time, so let's make it a full-court press.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental reasons, diplomats and some Syrians say, are
simple. Syria believes it missed an opportunity in early 1996, when
what had been a promising round of peace talks with Israel was
suspended over a wave of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   And Assad has plainly aged in the three years since. He turns 69
in October, and is looking frail.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by American assurances that Barak's election has indeed
set the stage for a fresh chance, the diplomats and Syrians say,
Assad is eager to secure a peace that would be his crowning legacy
and could help to smooth the way for his son, Bashar, 34, to take
his place someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the single most important factor
driving this is to open the way for his son to carry on,'' said a
Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as eager as Assad may be for a deal, a dramatic Syrian
gesture seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has yet to meet an Israeli leader, and he abruptly
canceled a trip to Morocco nine days ago for the funeral of King
Hassan II after the Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, was
quoting as saying he hoped the occasion would produce the first
handshake between Syrian and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the 29 years in which he has held power, Assad has repeated
his basic demand so often _ that the price for peace is a full
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights _ that it is all but
inconceivable that he would lower the bar now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Syrians may be flexible on a lot of issues this time,'' a
Western diplomat said. ``They clearly want this done. But unless
the deal means that every last Israeli withdraws from the Golan
Heights, Assad would be seen internally as weak. And even if he can
stand that, he knows his son could not.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials have said that a key test of Israeli intentions
will come with the arrival of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in the region later this month. Albright is expected to travel to
both Israel and Syria, and Syrian officials have said that unless
she relays the right Israeli words, the current optimism might yet
turn to deep disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to hear from the Americans that Barak wants to
withdraw to the line of June 4, 1967,'' Moallem said in a recent
interview with Middle East Insight magazine. He was referring to
the day before the six-day war in which Israel occupied the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we can start from this point and build a peace based on
mutual respect and security and normalization,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which that bottom line has become imprinted on the
consciousness of most adult Syrians can be heard in ordinary
conversation, including several held at random on a
government-sponsored visit to the Syrian side of the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, people referred specifically to U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for withdrawal
to the June 4 lines. And over and over again, people said that
Barak is better than his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, and that
peace is now within reach, but that it will depend on how far the
Israeli leader will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic now,'' said Samira Osman, a 40-year-old widow
who is one of the few people who lives in the town. ``But it all
depends on what Barak will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrians have allowed themselves to grow optimistic about peace
before, and then seen their hopes dashed.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995 and early 1996, before the Israeli-Syrian talks
were suspended, some investors began to buy property on the Syrian
side of the Golan, seeing it as the new gateway to reclaimed land.
</P>
<P>
   This time there has been no such property rush, said Mufeed
Badieh, 28, the spokesman for Quneitra, where 53,000 Syrians once
lived. But hotel and restaurant owners and investors in Damascus
and Aleppo say they have begun to dream again of a post-peace boom,
including a surge in tourism.

HISTORY OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS UNFOLDS ON FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Take a guess when the first computer graphics were
seen on TV. Go ahead. 1983? 1976? 1968? Nah, it was a lot earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Story of Computer Graphics,'' a handsome new
documentary shot in high-definition video and debuting at 8:30 p.m.
Sunday at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium, the first television
computer graphics were shown Dec. 16, 1951, on Edward R. Murrow's
show, ``See It Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the history of so much else in
technology after World War II, the graphics were created for the
military, then flush with cash in the first fearful years of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics were created by SAGE, ``a computer so big that
people worked inside it,'' according to one person in the film. The
computer was part of the nation's new air-defense systems, and the
graphic was created by an oscilloscope rendering the projected path
and speed of a missile.
</P>
<P>
   From this simple line drawing, we eventually got ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' Maybe it's not that big a leap of
logic after all.
</P>
<P>
   The film itself is well done, the product of three years of work
overseen by about 30 members of SIGGRAPH, the huge
research-oriented special interest group of ACM (formerly the
Association of Computing Machinery) that focuses on computer
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   This week, SIGGRAPH comes to the Los Angeles Convention Center
(the film will be shown repeatedly during the week there, too),
attracting 50,000 graphics wizards of all kinds to show off their
latest bleeding-edge technologies, art, animation and more.
</P>
<P>
   The 93-minute film itself talks to many of the field's true
pioneers, from the men who invented Bezier curves and the computer
mouse to SGI and Netscape founder James Clark and Adobe Systems CEO
John Warnock to the king of ``Star Wars,'' George Lucas, and his
nine-time Oscar-winning visual effects honcho, Dennis Murren.
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by Frank Foster, a vice president at Sony
Imageworks, and he does a good job explaining and illustrating a
lot of sometimes arcane information in a relatively brief time.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, it's not nearly as visually engaging as
you might expect (or hope), given the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   One particular disappointment: The really over-the-top eye candy
of recent times makes up only a small portion of the film. That's a
shame, because many of the graphics are just eye-popping when shown
on a high-definition screen.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the film is devoted to the field's development over
a few decades of time, so what once were revolutionary new visions
now are low-resolution vector drawings up-converted to
high-definition TV from ancient, often fuzzy graphics formats.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, much of the film is talking heads, often engaging
interviews of often aging pioneers who look wonderfully
true-to-life in HDTV but aren't necessarily the most eye-catching
of fellows. There aren't a lot of movie stars here.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have some tremendous moments, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blinn (a former graphics whiz at La Canada Flintridge's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and now with Microsoft Graphics) gives a
wonderful, simple, illustrated explanation of how a colleague's
teapot made for a perfect test of graphic rendering programs.
</P>
<P>
   He then walks viewers through the various improvements that have
been made in graphics technology, showing what wireframes and Phong
shading and radiosity all mean.
</P>
<P>
   That quick segment alone could serve as a five-minute graphics
primer for every school in the country. Blinn, by the way, will be
honored at SIGGRAPH this year for his longtime contributions to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   There are other such moments, and they enrich the film nicely.
But personally, I would have preferred to see more of the creations
of the many pioneers, and less of their faces as they talked about
those creations. As they say in writing class, show, don't tell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``The Story of Computer Graphics.'' &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Lots of computers and nearly 50 graphics pioneers who
have coaxed magic from the machine. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Frank Foster. Written by Judson
Rosebush. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 33 minutes. &UR;  &QL; 
Playing: &LR;  8:30 p.m. Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium, 665 W.
Jefferson Blvd., Los Angeles; then five times a day on HDTV during
SIGGRAPH at the Los Angeles Convention Center, 1201 S. Figueroa
St., Los Angeles. SIGGRAPH runs from Sunday through Aug. 13. &UR;  &QL; 
Our rating: &LR;  2 1/2 stars &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   SIGGRAPH is a can't miss for people interested in virtually any
aspect of computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Registration starts at 6 p.m. Saturday with classes beginning at
1:30 p.m. Sunday and running through Tuesday. A separate series of
gatherings featuring technical papers, panels and sketches on a
wide range of graphics, animation and related topics starts
Wednesday and wraps up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's highlights are an art gallery of digital
creations, the ``Millennium Motel'' of cutting-edge demos that
aren't quite ready for market, a keynote speech by
sculptor/mathematician Helaman Ferguson, evening receptions, a 3-D
Web roundup that's something like a demo-by-fire gong show and an
exhibit hall of vendors specializing in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Registration for the entire event costs $760; $630 for SIGGRAPH
members. But there's also an ``exhibits-plus'' registration of $50
that gives access to the exhibit hall, some speeches and other
goodies, and a ``conference select'' registration of $200 that is
at an intermediate level.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about what each level of registration
provides, go to the SIGGRAPH Web site at www.siggraph.org/s99/,
though it's too late to register online. You'll have to do that on
site. &QL;

 QUNEITRA, Syria: in tourism.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some 14,000 Syrians still live in the Israeli-occupied portion
of the Golan Heights, and only small numbers of them, usually
schoolchildren, are permitted to return to Syria, even for short
visits.
</P>
<P>
   At one spot near here, relatives kept apart by the conflict keep
abreast of news on the other side by shouting across a narrow
valley that divides Syrian territory from the Israeli-held village
of Majdal Shams.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria has left Quneitra empty and in ruins as a reminder of
the past. The city, captured by Israeli forces in 1967, was taken
over again by Syria after the 1973 war, but not before its
churches, mosques and schools were razed by the withdrawing Israeli
forces, the Syrians say.
</P>
<P>
   (Israel has said the damage, still shocking more than two
decades later, was a consequence of the fighting. But a resolution
passed by the U.N. General Assembly in 1974 accused Israel of
having committed a ``grave breach'' in carrying out the
destruction.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What makes the current Syrian push for peace different from any
in the past is the vigor with which Assad has been trying to
present a gentler face. The main target, it appears, is the Israeli
public, where people have been accustomed to denunciations of ``the
Zionist enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   If Israelis can be persuaded that Syria is a committed peace
partner, according to what diplomats presume to be the Syrian
thinking, Barak may find himself with more room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   And with another round of American presidential elections on the
horizon, there is concern that the Clinton administration, seen by
Syrians as a vital peace broker, will become increasingly
distracted by domestic politics. With Syria's economy sputtering
and unemployment running at 20 percent, the prospect of a
post-peace influx of Western aid and a reduction in military
spending appear increasingly attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria has had to become more realistic,'' said Hamdan Hamdan,
a Palestinian writer based in Damascus, ``particularly after
waiting through three long years of Netanyahu, when there was no
hope for peace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It also seems that a change at the top of Syria's opaque power
structure may come sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Assad is believed to suffer from heart trouble and diabetes,
among other ailments, and although he clearly remains in charge, he
has assigned increasing responsibilities to Bashar, a former
opthamologist and now an army colonel, even dispatching him on
diplomatic trips to Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the succession is not yet certain, and Assad may hope to
convert the euphoria from any peace deal into a wave of acclamation
for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Under Syria's constitution, Bashar is still too young by six
years to become president. He does not yet hold another
prerequisite, a position within the leadership of the ruling Baath
party. His rapid rise is also believed to have caused resentment
among powerful figures in Syria's military and intelligence
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   With the economic dividends that could come from a
Syrian-Israeli peace, his chances of overcoming those obstacles
would certainly improve. And as the president looks to the future,
he must also worry that no other Syrian leader, and particularly
his son, can command the kind of authority he has built up during
nearly three decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Only someone with such authority may be in the position to
overcome any internal opposition to peace with a country with which
Syria has been at war for more than 50 years.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Sometime in the next week or so, the population
of India, which adds more people to the world each year than any
other nation, will officially cross the one billion mark, just in
time for Indian Independence Day on Aug. 15, according to U.N.
demographers.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-two years ago, when India threw off colonialism, it had
345 million people; since then, its population has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   India, with its population growing by 1.6 percent a year, is
expected to overtake China as the most populous nation in the next
four decades. China, with more than three times the area of India,
reached the one billion mark in 1980 and now has 1.27 billion
people, with a growth rate of only 0.9 percent. Indians say China
achieved the lower rate only through coercion, including forced
abortion, a course that democratic India could not condone.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, India and China already account for more than
one-third of the world's people. The global population is expected
to reach six billion on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   By 2016, India, slightly more than a third the size of the
United States, is likely to have more people than all of Europe and
the rest of the industrial world, excluding Russia, U.N.
demographers say.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of India that emerges from the demographers'
computers is replete with big numbers because everything about this
Asian nation is measured in superlatives, said Joseph Chamie,
director of the U.N. Population Division. Chamie, an American,
worked with his wife on family planning projects in India as Peace
Corps volunteers 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable country,'' he said. For example, India
has about 600 million people of voting age, and a healthy democracy
to accommodate them. India has the most births annually among
nations, 25 million, and many more children survive each year
because of better, if still rudimentary, health care.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its considerable problems, often worsened by population
pressures, India has increased life expectancy to 63 years, from
39, in less than half a century, and has cut its fertility rate
from six births for each woman of child-bearing age to 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   The latest population estimate is built on an array of such
birth, death and fertility statistics, with further adjustments for
migration.
</P>
<P>
   There are other big numbers that tell a less happy story, World
Bank experts have found. India has a large majority of the world's
illiterates, nearly 500 million. It has more than 320 million
abjectly poor people unable to muster an income equivalent to the
$1 a day needed to buy basic foods. As many as 50 million children
do not go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Development experts and demographers say India is in danger of
being overwhelmed by numbers as gains made in fields like
education, health and agriculture fail to stay ahead of the surging
population. While poverty rates decline steadily in India, the
World Bank found, the actual number of people living in poverty
continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poverty imposes an oppressive weight on India, especially in
the rural areas, where almost three out of four Indians and 77
percent of the poor live,'' the World Bank said in its last report
on poverty in India, in 1997. An update now being completed does
not show much better results, World Bank officials say.
</P>
<P>
   At the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, Lester Brown,
president of the independent research organization, said in an
interview that population growth ``has put pressure on all of
India's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground water supplies are shrinking as more farmers turn to
pumps when surface irrigation fails or is unreliable. Indians have
sunk eight million wells and are using them to water fields where
double-cropping has been introduced for higher food production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well before it reached a billion people, India was using water
at an unsustainable rate,'' he said. ``You have to wonder, what in
the world happens when you add another half billion? To formulate
an intelligent population policy, you have to know something about
hydrology. I have the feeling that the population policy in India
is put together in a vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while the government _ trying to educate young people,
trying to find them jobs, trying to deal with environmental fallout
_ gets stretched so thin it just can't respond. I think the
government is already suffering from demographic fatigue.''

 &HT;    Prescription drug manufacturers seek patent extensions
 &HT;    By Jonathan Hall
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The maker of Claritin, a popular prescription
allergy medication, urged a Senate panel Wednesday to grant it and
six other drugs a three-year extension of their patents, arguing
that Congress changed the rules while the medicines were still in
the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   But former Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the
non-profit Consumer Federation of America, said the proposal
``couldn't come at a worse time for Americans who desperately need
access to affordable drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are bills in both houses that would require the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to determine whether the seven drugs _
Cardiogen-82, Claritin, Dermatop, Eulexin, Nimotop, Penetrex and
Relafen _ should be granted additional years of patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1984 law designed to give generic drugs the opportunity
to get into the market quickly, drugs already in the regulatory
pipeline were given two years of patent protection rather than the
five years normally given. In the case of these seven drugs,
however, approval from the Food and Drug Administration took more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Kogan, chairman and CEO of Schering-Plough Corp., the
manufacturer of Claritin, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that
drugs which took more than five years to receive FDA approval
should receive an additional three years of patent protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill does not extend any patent or guarantee that any
patent will be extended,'' Kogan said. ``Rather it creates a
non-political process in which the (Patent Office) determines if it
is fair and equitable to restore patent term on any of these seven
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Metzenbaum, whose association has more than 50 million
members and has often opposed patent legislation, said he was
concerned about the bill's potential cost to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of patent protection is to provide drug
manufacturers with an incentive to pursue future research and
development of new drugs, not to increase profits on existing
drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the new bill said protection is needed for future
medical breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper patent protection for pharmaceutical products is
crucial for the discovery of new, potentially lifesaving drugs,''
said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the sponsor of the 1984 act.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of Congress said the bill is not the way to
improve consumer access to affordable medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should not be in the business of extending individual
patents for drugs, nor should we be authorizing special extensions
without overwhelming justification,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt.

   ARGENTINA-AUTOS (Cordoba, Argentina) _ Fiat's Cordoba plant,
like much of Argentina's auto industry, is operating at less than a
quarter of its capacity. Part of the problem is the recession that
has been shaking Argentina since last September. But of more
lasting importance, auto executives fear, is the fallout from
Brazil's decision in January to devalue its currency, the real, by
nearly 40 percent. As a result, Argentina has lost competitiveness
in world trade and has only a limited capacity to export its way

FIRST LADY SAYS HUSBAND ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS INFIDELITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham on Wednesday
abandoned her explanation of her husband's marital infidelity as
stemming from childhood ``abuse'' and instead declared that he
alone bears ``responsibility'' for straying from their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady revived discussion of her 24-year marriage a day
after Talk magazine published remarks in which she attributed the
president's sexual conduct to a ``weakness'' stemming from his
troubled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   When some commentators criticized her for making excuses for her
husband, both Mrs. Clinton and her husband sought to change that
perception. She spoke in a dusty, noisy 116-year-old furniture
manufacturing plant in upstate New York, he spoke in the White
House Rose Garden, but they both made the same point: He was
responsible for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Talk interview, Mrs. Clinton appeared to excuse her
husband's infidelity as a ``weakness'' stemming from the stresses
of his childhood in rural Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse that
he can't even take it out and look at it,'' Clinton said in the
Talk interview. ``There was terrible conflict between his mother
and grandmother. A psychologist once told me that for a boy being
in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, traveling in New York state to assess whether she
should run for the U.S. Senate from here, was inside the Crawford
Furniture Manufacturing Corp. participating in a round-table
discussion about economic development when she suddenly invited
questions from reporters. They obligingly asked about her Talk
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is responsible for their behavior,'' Mrs. Clinton
declared. ``I am a very strong proponent and believer in personal
responsibility _ so I hope that people will take that message away
from it (the article).''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton added that ``everyone of us comes out of our own
childhood and I believe that we're all responsible.'' Mrs. Clinton
continued: ``I believe everyone is responsible for his or her
behavior _ including the president and all the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she and her husband had ``been through a lot''
but they remain ``very much'' in love and ``very committed to one
another.'' The first lady said the nation has put the episode
``behind us _ and I have as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton then abruptly declared that her discussion of the
issue was over. Asked why she was willing to discuss intimate
details of her marriage that had once been off limits, Mrs. Clinton
replied curtly: ``Well, I'm not going to any more. I've said all
I'm going to say on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House Rose Garden, the president echoed his wife's
remarks at the conclusion of an event to discuss economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and
think that she was making any excuses for me,'' the president said.
``I have not made any excuses for what was inexcusable _ and
neither has she, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he ``didn't have any bed of roses as a kid,''
but ``always knew that I was well-loved and I think that's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman in Mrs. Clinton's exploratory Senate
campaign, said the first lady hoped her remarks would correct
``misinterpretations'' of her Talk magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's a refinement,'' Wolfson said. ``She just
wanted to make sure people understood that she holds her husband
responsible for his behavior, as does the president.''

</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks appeared designed in part to allay the
concerns of people like workers at the Crawford factory who, in
interviews with reporters, questioned her willingness to excuse her
husband's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   David Rasmussen, 33, a married father of two daughters from
Frewsburg, N.Y., who earns $540-a-week as a furniture polisher,
said the first lady had no business blaming the president's
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I heard, I don't really think he has any excuses,''
said Rasmussen. ``If there had been physical abuse or sexual abuse
_ maybe. But I don't think arguments between his mother and
grandmother are an excuse for stepping out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Spontaneo, 45, of Frewsburg, N.Y., a Crawford employee
for 21 years and a married mother of three, said the first lady
should not offer excuses for her husband's betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say you make your own bed _ you sleep in it,''
Spontaneo said. ``The president should have thought what he was
doing. But she's strong _ anybody who could go through what she
went through has to be one strong lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Shirey, 64, of Ashville, N.Y., a 38-year veteran at
Crawford said the president has no excuse for his behavior.
Pointing to a troubled childhood is ``no excuse in my book,''
Shirey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bargar, Democratic majority leader of the Chautauqua
County legislature who was invited to be in the audience, said the
first lady's discussion of her marriage was not as important to New
Yorkers as her willingness to address specific issues of interest
to ordinary people ``in a forgotten corner of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Bargar added: ``Frankly I'm interested in what she says about
the issues of today, issues that affect day-to-day lives.''

<P>
   Clinton managed to touch upon issues with political appeal to
New York. She lamented federal regulations that led to a ban on
harvesting trees in nearby national forests because of the sighting
of a lone endangered Indiana bat.
</P>
<P>
   She vowed, if she runs and is elected to the Senate, to forge a
congressional coalition to win a ``fair share'' of federal spending
for New York, which sends $14 billion more in tax dollars to
Washington each year than it receives in federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also promised to help form regional cooperatives to
enable small companies to bulk buy cheaper health insurance
coverage for employees. She suggested, too, that small businesses
forge cooperatives to share common expenses for bookkeepers,
accountants and marketing specialists to help the firms make their
products more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she was getting ``more interested'' in seeking a Senate
seat ``every day,'' Clinton outlined the centerpiece of her
political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a sense of community where we believed we were all
in this together, we could come up with solutions,'' Clinton said.
``We could do more if we had a sense that we can do it together.''

 &HT;    HOUSE PANEL SUBPOENAS RENO FOR DATA ON ALIEN CRIMINALS
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A House subcommittee Wednesday voted to subpoena
Attorney General Janet Reno for information about criminal aliens
released by immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Led by its chairman, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who expressed
anger over delays in providing the information, the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration and claims voted 6-1 to issue the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesperson Carole Florman said the
department is ``certainly ready to work with the subcommittee to
find an effective means'' to provide the information.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service came under fire last
month for returning Angel Maturino Resendiz, 40, who was wanted by
the FBI, to Mexico. Resendiz, who returned to the United States, is
now suspected as the ``railroad killer'' of nine people in three
states.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has said it did not know the FBI was seeking the man,
and has referred the case to the Justice Department's inspector
general.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Resendiz surrendered to authorities in El Paso,
Texas, Smith sent a letter to Reno requesting information about
criminal aliens released by the INS who later committed additional
crimes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The July 14 letter asked Reno to provide by July 31 detailed
information ``regarding inadmissible or deportable criminal aliens
who, during the past five years, were released from INS custody and
then subsequently convicted of additional crimes in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department didn't respond by the deadline, but did
send a letter to Smith dated Aug. 2 that said, ``We are unable to
provide information regarding the number of criminal aliens who
have committed crimes following their release from INS custody.
Most of these crimes are prosecuted by local law enforcement
agencies and no means exist to capture that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also lists the number of criminal aliens that have
been released by the INS since 1995 _ 26,870.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Justice Department officials called his office
Tuesday, saying they could get the information but that it would
take a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``First they told us they didn't have the information. Then they
say they'll promise to provide the information in the next month or
two,'' Smith said. ``They can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official said Wednesday that the letter was
accurate and that there is no database in which all the requested
information can be found. The department will try to get
information from different systems to satisfy the request, the
official said, but it could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Wednesday that there is ``no excuse for withholding
crucial information from Congress and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other INS mistakes like Resendiz are walking our
streets every day, committing more crimes?'' Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The lone vote opposing the subpoena came from Rep. Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif., who said she preferred that the committee work the matter
out with the department ``rather than getting into a huge,
extenuating argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena also asks the Justice Department for two overdue
reports requested by Congress on the release of criminals from
detention. It gives the department ``a generous three weeks'' to
deliver them, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of a sweeping immigration law in 1996 placed new
pressures on the INS's detention network.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated that the INS detain virtually all non-citizens
whose criminal convictions have made them deportable, ending the
agency's discretion to release criminal immigrants believed to pose
no risk. Lawmakers also broadened the definition of crimes
triggering deportation and included provisions to cover convictions
prior to the 1996 law's passage.

 &HT;    CLINTON REJECTS LATEST VERSION OF REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With congressional Republicans braced to pass a
$792 billion tax cut, President Clinton vowed Wednesday to veto the
plan, setting the stage for a full-blown political showdown over
how to use the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   With the House set to vote on the reshaped measure Thursday, and
the Senate planning to vote by Friday, Clinton pronounced the
package ``risky, and plainly wrong for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, Clinton
pledged to spike the latest version of the tax legislation if the
Republican-controlled Congress approves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they conclude this plan and send it to me, I will have to
veto it,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the nation needs to use the expected surplus to
shore up entitlement systems and pay down its debt, Clinton has
proposed $250 billion worth of targeted tax cuts over 10 years,
less than one-third the across-the-board reductions in the
Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he remained optimistic that Republicans would
eventually negotiate with him on the size of a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could certainly do this,'' Clinton said. ``For me, this is
not a political issue; this is a matter of basic arithmetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has driven up federal tax revenues sharply in
recent years. As a result, the government will take in an estimated
$99 billion more this year than it will spend, compared with a $290
billion deficit the year Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
   Over the coming decade, the federal government is projected to
take in some $3 trillion more than it spends, according to White
House and congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using $250 billion of that amount for
targeted tax cuts heavily weighted toward benefiting the working
poor.
</P>
<P>
   He would use most of the rest of the surplus to shore up Social
Security and Medicare, the federal retirement and health care
programs that face funding problems early in the next century, and
to reduce the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government owes $3.6 trillion to banks and other
investors, the so-called public portion of the government's debt;
it owes about $2 trillion more to federal institutions and trust
funds.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Wednesday by the Treasury Department concluded
that public debt reduction has put billions of dollars in the
pockets of American families, in an effect the White House likened
to a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   By reducing the federal budget deficit, and by paying down $142
billion in publicly held debt over the past two years, the
government has cut its interest payments by $189 billion since
1993, compared to what would have been paid under 1993 projections
of continuing deficits and government borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Those savings work out to $2,700 per American family per year,
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he claimed, reduced federal borrowing has put
downward pressure on interest rates, leading to consumer savings on
home mortgage loans, auto loans and credit cards. Those savings,
Lockhart said, amount to roughly $2,000 a year for a family with a
$100,000 home mortgage.

<P>
   Economists regard such calculations as soft, claiming that it's
impossible to quantify the effect of reduced government spending on
interest rates, which are determined by a complex combination of
policy and market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan agreed to Tuesday by House and Senate Republican
leaders, income taxes and capital gains taxes _ assessed against
profits from the sale of property _ would be cut by $792 billion
over 10 years. The cuts would be phased in gradually, and would
have little benefit in the first year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have chafed at the idea that the government would
decide how to dispose of a $3 trillion surplus. They have said that
much of the money should instead be returned to the workers and
businesses that pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican plan, federal income tax rates _ of 15, 28,
31 and 39.6 percent for different income levels _ would be cut by
one percentage point over several years, beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has derided the Republican approach, saying it puts tax
cuts ahead of other national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to save Social Security and Medicare and pay the
debt off, then you have to figure out how much money you have left
and how much money the Congress is determined to spend over and
above the present budget caps, and you can spend what is left on
the tax cut,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to pass a tax cut first and then say, ``Well, I'm sorry,
we can't really save Social Security ... and we may or may not be
able to spend money on education and national defense and, if we
do, we'll go back into deficit spending again,' I don't
</P>
<P>
   think we want to get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Republican congressional leaders, including Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and House Majority Leader
Dick Armey of Texas, were reluctant to engage in serious budget
talks because they want to portray their party as the bearer of big
tax cuts when they return to their constituents during the August
recess, which begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarks sound like two leaders in a sandbox, Mr. Armey and
Senator Lott saying that if they don't get their tax cut they don't
want to play,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``is hoping the Republicans will come back (after Labor
Day) in a different state of mind and looking to do business,'' the
spokesman said.

TECHNICIANS BLAST AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL DEFICIENCIES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a scathing report sent to every member of Congress, the union
which represents technicians who install, maintain and repair the
nation's air-traffic control equipment have accused the Federal
Aviation Administration of degrading safety and botching its
multibillion-dollar program to modernize air-traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that on any given day, 10 percent of the
national airspace system equipment is not functioning, resulting in
costly delays to the nation's airlines and passengers, and that
staffing for technicians is at 66 percent of recommended levels,
which means it takes much longer to bring inoperable systems back
on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford the risks the FAA is imposing on the American
public,'' Mike Fanfalone, national president of the Professional
Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), said Wednesday. ``Our hope is
that Congress will hold the FAA accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman William Shumann said the system is safe and said
PASS's mailing to Congress is motivated by contract negotiations
which are entering a third year. Fanfalone denied that the charges
were part of negotiating tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Shumann denied that 10 percent of the system was not functioning
on any given day. He noted that last year, the average number of
daily outages was 327, and the number of unscheduled outages
averaged 71 a day. He said an outage could last for seconds or
hours, but noted that the FAA tracks some 44,000 pieces of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that number came from, but apparently they
are off by an order of magnitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PASS said that it has tried to suggest a new way of training
employees on site rather than sending them to the FAA's training
center in Oklahoma City as a way of saving some $26 million and
increasing staffing levels at the same time, but said the FAA has
ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   Shumann countered that training and staffing levels are both
subjects of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But PASS says that this year alone, there have been repeated
delays around the country, including one at Logan International
Airport in Boston May 23 when 100 flights had to be diverted
because an instrument-landing system, used to guide planes to the
runway, was not operating.
</P>
<P>
   And in Miami, air-traffic controllers lost all voice
communication with pilots for eight minutes because of a power
outage caused by an outside contractor working at the center
without proper supervision.
</P>
<P>
   With staffing levels down, equipment takes longer to repair.
Jobs that averaged seven hours in 1983, took 27.5 hours in 1997,
PASS said.
</P>
<P>
   Shumann said that the FAA now sets priorities on what to repair.
For example, if a radar system is down, but the air space is
adequately covered by neighboring systems, technicians might repair
something else before working on the radar. ``The average time has
increased, but we think we are providing better service by setting
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But delays caused by air-traffic problems are increasing
dramatically, frustrating passengers, flight crews and airline
executives, and costing the airline industry $4.1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real frustration out there,'' said David Fuscus, vice
president, communications for the Air Transport Association, the
trade association group representing major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In May, for example, there were 40,053 air-traffic delays, up
37 percent from a year ago, and up 109 percent from May 1997,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not at gridlock, but the system is very inefficient.
There has been a tremendous increase in traffic in the last 20
years and the system cannot efficiently process all the
airplanes.''

FORBIDDEN LOVE IMPROVES `THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Probably the closest juvenilized, modern Hollywood
is going to get to a real adult caper film for a while, ``The
Thomas Crown Affair'' doesn't always juggle cool and heat adroitly.
But the fact that it even tries, with measured, mature
deliberateness, places this one in a whole higher grade than the
year's earlier, more frivolous attempt at high-stakes (he)art
theft, ``Entrapment.''
</P>
<P>
   The remake is also arguably an improvement on the original
``Crown Affair,'' the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway artifact from 1968
that was more concerned with heists and visual gimmicks. Poorly as
it may have aged, though, the ``Crown'' concept had an irresistible
hook: wealthy master thief is stalked by superchic female insurance
investigator, both use their sex appeal to enchant and outsmart the
other.
</P>
<P>
   What's nice about the remake, which was directed with a certain
delicacy by the usually bombastic John McTiernan (``Die Hard,''
``The Hunt for Red October''), is that all the erotic
cat-and-mousing here isn't just a game _ and as if to prove it, the
famous, suggestive chess sequence hasn't been repeated from the
original. The new pair of sophisticated loners, played rather too
obscurely by Pierce Brosnan and with nicely contrasted boldness and
yearning by Rene Russo, really put their feelings on the line.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other changes, most rather felicitous. Brosnan's
Crown is not a professional bank robber but a self-made financier
with a love of fine art. He loves it so much, in fact, that he
organizes the theft of a priceless Monet from New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   This complicated sequence, employing excellent copies of
masterworks and shot on a very convincing set designed by Bruno
Rubeo (real art museums, not surprisingly, do not cooperate with
films about stealing paintings), showcases McTiernan's great feel
for suspense in enclosed spaces. But with the arrival of insurance
investigator Catherine Banning, he falls back on a more leisurely,
conversational style that not only emphasizes the growing,
forbidden bond between her and Crown, but two other interesting and
amusing relationships as well.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Leary plays Michael McCann, the working-class New York
detective who's appalled by both the privileges the rich expect and
the Europe-based Banning's utter disregard for American police
procedures. Still bitter over a long-failed marriage, McCann's also
repulsed and stimulated by her willingness to throw her body into
the Crown-nailing effort.
</P>
<P>
   The other great, if brief, duet is between Crown and a new
character, a sardonic psychiatrist played with provoking relish by
none other than Faye Dunaway. In her few short scenes, she tells us
more about what's going on with Crown's emotions than Brosnan's
entire performance manages to convey.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his shortcomings, though, Brosnan sure looks the part
of an unknowable object of desire. He distinguishes Crown from his
similarly sporting James Bond, incrementally but just enough.
There's a yearning behind that, um, piercing Irish gaze that no
self-respecting superspy would ever reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The real performance here is Russo's, however. Catherine has the
biggest conflict and the toughest choices to make, and the
relationship's development is seen primarily from her point of
view. Russo brings humanizing humor and true ache to an impossible
fantasy figure, a feat made no easier in a movie dreamscape of all
the beauty wealth can buy.

<P>
   BOSTON -- The New York Times Co.'s Internet business unit
Wednesday named Lincoln Millstein, a Globe newsroom veteran and
chief architect of the newspaper's Web site, to oversee its local
and regional Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Millstein, 49, was named group vice president and a publisher of
Times Company Digital, which was created as a unit of the Times Co.
in May to consolidate approximately 50 Internet businesses and Web
sites operated by the company, which also owns The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief executive of the Globe's Web site,
www.boston.com, will now be responsible for all of the Times Co.'s
regional sites, including the New York Times' entertainment-news
site, www.nytoday.com, the Globe site, and Web sites run by the
company's 21 regional newspapers. Millstein, who joined the Globe
in 1983, has served as business editor, living editor, and
assistant managing editor/features for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Cristian Edwards was also named a group vice president and a
publisher of Times Company Digital, overseeing the company's
national sites. Those include The New York Times newspaper's site,
www.nytimes.com, a wine resource, www.winetoday.com, and
golfdigest.com.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments are part of a broader reorganization inside
Times Co. to sharpen the focus of its Internet properties and to
plan the future expansion of Times Company Digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to put a strong management team in place at
TCD,'' said Martin Nisenholtz, chief executive of Times Company
Digital. The group, he said, ``provides us with the necessary
balance between our daily operation and future activities that will
lead us to scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight new Times Company Digital managers were named Wednesday,
including Andres Rodriguez, 33, a co-founder of Abuzz Technologies
Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. software company acquired last month by
Times Co. Rodriguez will become Abuzz's general manager. Abuzz's
Beehive technology directs Web surfers to people who agree to share
their expertise in various topics over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   David Thurm, a former vice president of production for the
Times, was named chief operating officer of Times Company Digital.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co. stock closed at 38 5/16, down 9/16, on the New York
Stock Exchange.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO AWARD MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO JIMMY AND ROSALYNN CARTER
 &HT;    300&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paying tribute to a White House predecessor,
President Clinton will award former President Jimmy Carter and his
wife, Rosalynn, the nation's highest civilian award Monday in an
Atlanta ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters will each receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom
for their work advancing peace, fighting poverty and disease, and
promoting human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who will be in Atlanta on Monday to address the annual
convention of the American Bar Association, will present the awards
at the chapel at the Carter Center, said Ann Carney, associate
director of public information at the non-profit center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's wonderful and an honor,'' Carney said in a
telephone interview. ``It just represents all the hard work and the
efforts both of the Carters have put in, not only at the center,
but worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual recognition of both of the Carters is also meant to
signify the extraordinary, if not unique, partnership the Georgians
have forged as a force for change in the two decades since they
left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The former president will be recognized specifically for his
contributions to human rights, his quest for Mideast peace and his
efforts to eradicate hunger and such Third World maladies as guinea
worm disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter will be cited as a national leader in the fight for
improved mental health care, childhood immunization, women's
equality and improved care for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful recognition of two people who have spent
their entire lives in public service,'' said Carrie Harmon,
spokeswoman for the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials notified Carter of the award last week,
said Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Carters were in their Plains, Ga., home on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who served from 1977 until 1981, was the last Democratic
president until Clinton's election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Carter performed three high-stakes diplomatic missions during
Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   He broke a dangerous impasse between the United States and North
Korea over Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons program; negotiated
the peaceful entry of 20,000 American peacekeepers into Haiti,
averting a forced invasion; and brokered a temporary cease-fire
between Serbs and non-Serbs in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their party commonality, however, the two men have had a
mostly distant relationship.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign and early on in his administration, Clinton
showed a reluctance to attach himself too closely to Carter, who
lost the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan after years in which the
country was hit with soaring oil prices, double-digit interest and
inflation rates and the humiliation of the capture of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran by Iranian revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a year-long sex scandal resulting in his
impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate, revealed
himself to be a very different sort of man than Carter, a devout
Sunday school teacher who once felt compelled to confess to the
nation that he sometimes lusted in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton begins to look toward his own post-presidential life,
however, he has cited Carter as something of an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Carter has been the most effective former
president in my lifetime,'' Clinton told the CNN cable television
network in a June interview. ``I think the model of what he's done
and how he's done it is a good model for every former president.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Center aides declined to discuss the men's relationship
Wednesday, as they worked to cull a final list of the 350 or so
Carter family members, center staffers and donors to be on hand for
Monday's awards presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff is all scrambling to get ready,'' said Harmon.
``President Carter was on the giving end of the medal when he was
president, and it's nice to be on the receiving end, as he's about
to find out.''

RED SOX 7, INDIANS 2 AS PORTUGAL DOMINATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Let's start with the premise, based on 87 years of
history, that there really are no easy days at Fenway Park. The Red
Sox may have slapped a 7-2 loss on the Indians in Wednesday's
matinee inside the emerald bandbox, but let it be duly noted that
the day began with the Boston Fire Department summoned to Yawkey
Way with hook and ladders, and it ended with Sox reliever Derek
Lowe asked to do some emergency fireman's work of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of three hours and six minutes, the Sox and
Indians evenly divvied up 20 hits, and four Cleveland pitchers also
yielded nine walks (only half of what the two sides combined for
Tuesday night). The wild-card wannabe Red Sox posted a 3-0 lead in
the first inning, and starter Mark Portugal scattered 10 hits over
8 2/3 innings. With the help of a Toronto loss to the Yankees, it
all neatly added up to Boston moving one giant step closer in the
chase for an American League playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   But easy? Well, how about slightly lower on the stress-o-meter?
After the three-run first inning, the Indians never got closer than
3-1, allowing the Sox to place victory No. 58 in their '99 diary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go out and get wins,'' said newly-acquired DH Butch
Huskey prior to jumping aboard the flight to Anaheim, Calif., where
the Sox take on the Angels Thursday night. ``It doesn't matter if
it's at home or on the road, the bottom line right now is we have
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it was not a false alarm that brought the BFD,
with sirens blaring, to the house that Harry Frazee burned to the
ground long ago. A small fire on the fourth floor was quickly
extinguished shortly after 11 a.m. As for Lowe's appearance in the
ninth, when he took over for Portugal with two outs and two men on,
that was a false alarm. But manager Jimy Williams, concerned that
that the Indians already had scored once, didn't want to be
reaching for the call box before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 7-2, with two on _ they pop one and it's 7-5,'' said
Williams. ``You've got to give your reliever some room if something
happens. You can't be worrying about a complete game (what could
have been Portugal's first complete-game victory of the season)
when the most important thing is to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe faced only Omar Vizquel, and the game ended when the
talented shortstop sent a routine fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   A packed house of 33,282 saw the Sox deliver immediately against
righthander Bartolo Colon. Jose Offerman (2 for 3 with two walks)
opened with a triple to center, and John Valentin, fresh from
delivering his 1,000 career hit the night before, knocked a
run-scoring single to right. After Brian Daubach drew a walk, Nomar
Garciaparra and Troy O'Leary each followed with run-scoring
singles.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the first was enough for Portugal to nurse
along for his seventh win of the season. He was dinged up for a run
in the third, in part because of a John Valentin error, but he
chugged into the ninth with a fat 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox added single runs in the fourth and fifth and two more
in the sixth, the final run coming across when Trot Nixon swung and
missed on a third strike, and the ball eluded catcher Einar Diaz.
Brian Daubach scooted in with the 7-1 lead. A true gimme. Darren
Lewis followed with a fly to right for the fourth out.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-reality ninth inning began with a David Justice
double (the only leadoff hit of the day against Portugal). Jacob
Cruz followed with a one-out double to make it 7-2, followed by an
Alex Ramirez fly to left center. When Valentin just missed making a
sensational play to end it on a Diaz grounder, Williams gave
Portugal the hook and hollered for Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched a lot of innings for us,'' said Williams,
admiring Portugal's effort. ``He'll take the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key for him'' said Portugal's catcher, Lenny
Webster, ``was getting his first pitch in for strikes. As a
catcher, it's a pleasure when a guy is working ahead on the count.
It allowed him to make those dirty pitches when he had to.''

<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The Patriots wanted to draft Rob Konrad, the
Syracuse University fullback and North Andover, Mass., native, but
he was scooped up by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of
April's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Shaping up as the next best thing for New England is free agent
Jamie Bowers, an H-back who has been moved from fullback to tight
end as a result of recent injuries at that position.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers's teammates have even nicknamed him ``Konrad.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3 inches and 237 pounds, Bowers has decent size, but
is much smaller than the 260-pound Konrad. Bowers attended a small
school; Wabash, with 800 students, is one of the few all-male
private colleges still remaining in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers has become noticeable because Ben Coates and Mike Bartrum
have been sidelined with a sprained left knees, and Rod Rutledge
has a minor finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was especially impressive Wednesday and even earned some
recognition from coach Pete Carroll, who yelled, ``Having yourself
quite a day, 43.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers has made the most of his chance, showing the ability to
catch the ball consistently and in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't have much information on Bowers until they
were flipping through a pre-draft book on small college players
published by Mike Medatarso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking through the book for a fullback and we gave
him a call,'' said Patriots vice president of player development
Bobby Grier. ``He's been a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   A long shot, yes, but Bowers never thought he'd even be in an
NFL training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given me a chance and they've told me to make the most
of it,'' said Bowers. ``I'm just trying to learn the information
real quick. It hasn't been super rough; sometimes there's a little
juggling going on in the brain, but it's not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-sport star at Wabash, Bowers played baseball and football
for four years, certainly unusual for most college athletes, who
normally play just one sport. He was also a physics major and had a
3.3 grade-point average. He was heading toward a career in teaching
and coaching and had actually completed a nine-week course tutoring
high school sophomores on their state-mandated testing.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after the nine-week period ended that Bowers got a
call about coming to Foxborough for a tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't even find me,'' said Bowers. ``I got done with
school in December and then did my student teaching. My coach was
trying to get in touch with me to let me know. No one else called.
For me, this is my one and only shot. There weren't many people
knocking on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers caught 37 passes for 547 yards in his senior year and
made 94 receptions for 1,323 yards and five touchdowns in his
career. His career average on the baseball team was .321 with 19
doubles, 4 triples, 5 homers and 76 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many Division 3 guys get drafted,'' said Bowers. ``It
wasn't until I got to college when I started to gain weight. Out of
(Warsaw, Ind.) high school I was under 200 pounds and there weren't
any big schools interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he lined up on the line sometimes and also was used
as the lead blocker in the backfield. He carried only 11 times for
45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers does a good job catching and protecting the ball. He has
already caught Coates's eye, the All-Pro telling Bowers to keep
making the most of every day.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to arriving here, Bowers said he phoned former NFL tight
end Pete Metzelaars, the only athlete to make it to the pros from
Wabash. In college, Bowers wore No. 88, a number that will soon be
retired in Metzelaars's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was compared to him a lot in school,'' said Bowers. ``I
ended up calling him up to get some veteran advice before I came
out here. He gave me some good advice, but it's classified
information. He gave me some good tips, basically to work hard and
never let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous about fitting in before he got to camp, Bowers now
thinks he belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've gotten to camp, I think I can play,'' he said.
``I was a little nervous at first because I didn't want to mess up.
Now that the coaches have a little confidence in me, I can show
them what I have to offer. It's a great opportunity. That's what
I'm all about. Going to a 3-D school, it's a long shot, so I have
to show up every day and make sure I do something the coaches
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to be inconspicuous in other ways. Apparently one
of the bits of information Metzelaars gave him was to be seen but
not heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be seen by the coaches and not so much by the veterans,''
Bowers said. ``Lay low, keep my mouth shut, and say the right
things on the field. I don't want to get too chummy, chummy with
anybody. I'm just feeling my way through and as I'm getting more
reps, more guys are saying hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now he says the playbook is easier than the physics book,
but ``with the hits to my brain, I think I'm losing a little bit up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Patriots are impressed. From the Wabash Little
Giants to the New England Patriots. It's a good preseason story
that may have a longer life span.

<P>
   If somebody started to spray your workplace with gunfire, would
you know how to increase your survival chances?
</P>
<P>
   It's an awful question, but one that has to be asked, given the
history of workplace violence in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another important question: Would your workplace have
seen it coming?
</P>
<P>
   Workplace violence experts were quick to jump on the day
trader's recent rampage in Atlanta and point out his flawed
background and all the warning signs he sent.
</P>
<P>
   No single incident, even in finely combed retrospect, can
provide a blueprint for future action, but here are some tips
collected from several safety consultants:
</P>
<P>
   For the individual worker:
</P>
<P>
   - Take a few minutes to think about where you'd duck, where
you'd hide, what escape route might be safest and how you'd
communicate if a gunman suddenly appeared.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask your workplace's owners or managers to hire a consultant
or trainer to provide a brief employee-safety course. Attend it.
</P>
<P>
   - Report threats or behavior _ from customers, fellow workers or
family members _ that hint at violence. You may be wrong, but you
also may save lives by helping others be alert to possible danger.
</P>
<P>
   For workplace managers:
</P>
<P>
   - Know the personality signs that predict violence. The list is
long, but it includes:
</P>
<P>
   Prior history of violence (do those pre-hiring background
checks!), inability to take criticism, paranoia, grudge holding or
blame placing, zealotry, obsessive-compulsive behavior, obsessive
focus on personal needs, explosive anger, pattern of threats and
intimidation, pronounced disdain for others and authority.
</P>
<P>
   - Have a zero-tolerance policy in place _ and well publicized _
to handle violent behavior of any kind. Follow the policy.
</P>
<P>
   - Be religious about pre-employment screening. Check references
or hire background-check companies to review applicants' work and
criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   - Provide whatever professional security personnel, security
cameras, controlled-access facilities and other safety measures
seem appropriate for the place and situation.
</P>
<P>
   - Have counseling available through an employee-assistance
program to help deter and deal with violence.
</P>
<P>
   - Solicit employees' input to learn their safety concerns and
act on their suggestions when vulnerabilities are pointed out.
Include staff members in designing a reaction-to-violence game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   - Designate a conflict-resolution expert on staff or hire one on
contract to help identified antagonists improve their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   - Pay attention to notable problems in employees' home lives.
Perpetrators of workplace violence often are spurned spouses or
boyfriends. Be careful to walk the fine line between invading
privacy and offering help. You may want a trained human-resource
counselor to tell you how and what questions to ask if you think
you have an endangered employee.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, much more to think about or do. And no
place can ever be guaranteed safe. But it's not crying wolf to make
workplace safety an agenda item. Better before than after the fact.

WESTERN-TRAINED SURGEON'S NATIVE GHANA IS WHERE HIS HEART IS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana _ Until one of his residents was promoted a few
months ago at the cardiac center he founded here, Dr. Kwabena
Frimpong-Boateng was Ghana's only heart surgeon, the only man out
of 19 million citizens in this corner of West Africa who could
plunge into another's chest and heal.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent whose scientists and doctors often leave
permanently for the West, however, Frimpong-Boateng had already
distinguished himself by a simple act: coming home. In his late
20s, the doctor, a son of farmers, won a scholarship to Germany,
where he mastered cardiothoracic surgery at Hanover Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Then a decade later, in 1989, the doctor left Europe, its
comforts, the predictable arc of a surgeon's career, his
specialty's lucrative rewards, tossed all of that for a giant
question mark.
</P>
<P>
   This young country had never had an elected leader, only
successful coup plotters; it had never had a cardiac center, or a
surgeon determined to forge one out of nothing, and for a
$300-a-month salary.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Frimpong-Boateng, 49, is hard at work on expanding the
National Cardiothoracic Center here in the capital. The center's
reputation, as well as his own, has reached beyond Ghana's borders,
to countries like Sierra Leone, where there is not even a single
heart surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, letters mailed from other African countries land on
his desk and implore Frimpong-Boateng for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be poor, but the heart is the same everywhere,'' the
doctor said one recent morning as he returned to his office from an
inspection of the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   He held the blueprint of the expansion that, among other
improvements, will move patients from the current colonial-era
ward, which has one toilet for 35 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in sub-Saharan standards,'' he said. ``I
believe we have international standards. Heart surgery is like an
airline. We're not a TWA or Pan Am with a large fleet, but the one
or two planes we have we must maintain at the same standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Frimpong-Boateng, Ghana would have sent a ``minister or a
key professor at the university'' overseas for heart surgery, said
Dr. Issaka Tinorgah, director of medical services in the Ministry
of Health. What would have happened to those not included in this
group, to those unable to travel on their own means, was better
left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   For a developing country with limited resources _ Ghana spends
about $10 in health care a year per citizen, compared with a range
of $7 to $15 in West Africa _ deciding which medical services to
offer entailed difficult moral choices, Tinorgah said.
</P>
<P>
   As unseemly as it was to leave patients requiring heart surgery
untreated, the hard reality is that the vast majority of people
here died of everyday illnesses like malaria, respiratory
infections and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government focuses almost exclusively on
primary care; to Frimpong-Boateng, it gives a location, and pays
the utilities and most of his staff's salaries. But everything
else, Frimpong-Boateng has paid on his own by raising money through
his Heart Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart Foundation raised about $350,000 last year, mostly by
running ads on local radio and television, by focusing on a
particular group each month, cab drivers one month, small-business
owners the next. He created the center, he said matter-of-factly,
to treat the ordinary Ghanaian who would have died otherwise of
heart ailments. And so he viewed the foundation as a sort of social
contract with the poor and expected most of his funds to come in $1
or $2 donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, he's like a missionary,'' said Tinorgah,
who, asked whether Ghana would have a heart center today without
Frimpong-Boateng, answered simply: no.
</P>
<P>
   For the freedom he has enjoyed, Frimpong-Boateng has also
learned the diplomacy required of being the country's only heart
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This voice sounds very familiar,'' the surgeon recalled
thinking when he received a phone call a couple of years ago, and
then realized it was the country's longtime president, Jerry
Rawlings. ``Oh, I thought, my God, what have I done?'' A foreign
dignitary had suffered a heart attack here.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the center operating has also meant dealing delicately
with the politically connected. On a recent afternoon, two
relatives of an 85-year-old man _ a traditional chief in a region
where cocoa, Ghana's main export, was grown _ entered the doctor's
office. The old man needed a pacemaker, and the entire operation
would cost about $5,000. The relatives were clearly hoping that the
Heart Foundation would pick up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Frimpong-Boateng, on hearing that they had never donated to the
foundation, shook his finger at them. ``When you heard about the
Heart Foundation,'' he said, ``you thought it's far off. Now it's
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor noted the patient's age. Who knows how long he would
live with the pacemaker anyway? ``It's a moral question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say so,'' one of the relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the old chief lay on a bed in the doctor's
ward; his family had persuaded the local cocoa association to pay
for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the 17 other patients there, however, most of his
patients are dependent on the foundation. On one bed lay a small
boy who had swallowed a metal pipe that had been lodged in his
chest for some time; his older sister had brought him here from the
bush and then disappeared. In the operating room was a woman badly
hurt in a car accident the night before; no one knew who she was.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor asked one of the nurses for some X-rays. When she
could not find them, he flung his stethoscope in her face.
``Sometimes I get so upset with the nurses I don't want to see them
for the rest of the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he smiled at his own impatience, a smile that conveyed
the belief that individual will would always triumph over personal
weakness, so long as the greater goal remained clear.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that on his first day at Hanover Medical School he
told his teachers that he had begun working toward his return to
Ghana; in fact, he had avoided going to the United States because
so many Ghanaian doctors had gone there and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   He feared America might prove too seductive. He had to return to
Ghana. Most of his five children were now away in Europe or the
United States. But the rest of his family was here, including his
aging mother, who had raised him after his father died just before
his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to come back to be with her,'' he said. ``I grew
up with the woman, and I have never regretted it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' he added, and it was not clear whether his words
meant mother or motherland, ``your presence alone is enough to make
a difference.''

CLINTONS DENY THEY'RE MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIS INFIDELITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton both
said Wednesday that they were not trying to make excuses for his
marital infidelities, as may have been suggested by Mrs. Clinton's
recent comments that he was abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady delivered their similar messages
separately as they tried to quell the controversy raised by Mrs.
Clinton's recent insinuations to Talk magazine that her husband's
adultery was rooted in the conflict between his mother and
grandmother that he witnessed as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and
think that she was making any excuses for me,'' Clinton said in the
Rose Garden in response to reporters' questions after he made a
statement on the federal budget. ``I have not made any excuses for
what was inexcusable, and neither has she, believe me,'' he said,
arching his eyebrows for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Mrs. Clinton, who was meeting with voters at a
furniture factory in Jamestown, N.Y., where she was campaigning for
her all-but-certain Senate race, told reporters she had not meant
to imply a link between the president's abuse as a child and his
infidelities as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is responsible for their behavior, and I am a very
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she believed that the country had moved on from
questions about her husband's adultery, which led to his
impeachment last year by the House, although he was acquitted by
the Senate. ``I have as well,'' she said, adding that she and her
husband ``love each other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments widely perceived as an attempt by Mrs. Clinton to
pre-empt questions before the Senate race about her marriage, Mrs.
Clinton had told Talk magazine in its debut issue: ``He was so
young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse that he can't even
take it out and look at it. There was terrible conflict between his
mother and grandmother. A psychologist once told me that for a boy
being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst
possible situation. There is always the desire to please each
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But these comments only stirred up pundits who said that Mrs.
Clinton _ who once said that the allegations of her husband's
philandering were the product of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
and then attributed the allegations to discrimination because they
were from Arkansas _ was making excuses for him once again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Wednesday that his childhood, with an
alcoholic stepfather who was sometimes violent, was no ``bed of
roses'' but that he was loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that every child needs to know,
growing up, that he or she is the most important person in the
world to someone,'' he said. ``And I knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that anyone reading the article would have to draw
two conclusions about Mrs. Clinton: ``One is that my wife is an
extraordinary person with a passionate commitment to public service
and a genuine record of important achievement,'' he said. ``And the
second is that we love each other very, very much.''

   ZITINJE, Yugoslavia _ Half of the homes in this once-mixed
village gape emptily now, purged of all their Serbs in one of the
failures of the U.S. peace-keeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of U.S. troops and armor, ethnic Albanians
from this village and surrounding ones intimidated the Serbs as the
Serbs had intimidated them a few months before, when the Albanians
were forced to leave this village a few miles southeast of
Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, despite U.S. promises of protection, all the 350 or
so Serbs of Zitinje demanded and received an armed U.S. escort to
travel the 35 miles east through the province of Kosovo toward the
border with Serbia, ignoring a plea to stay from Bishop Atanasije
of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it felt like a defeat, and it was perceived as a defeat
by all the higher command,'' said 1st Lt. Ryan Leigh, who commands
the U.S. platoon here. ``We did everything we could to get the
Serbs to stay, but they really wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Zitinje _ Zhiti in Albanian _ had a population of about 60
percent Albanians and 40 percent Serbs. It is a glaring example of
Kosovo's enduring problems, which good will, money and even the
force of sophisticated weaponry cannot easily mollify, remedy or
fix.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, rolls of razor wire surrounded the Serb houses, to
prevent them from being looted and burned; armed U.S. soldiers
patrolled the dirt streets of the village in groups of three in the
searing summer sun, as Albanian kids played with balloons and
showed each other their new Adidas footwear. Windows were broken;
furniture and clothes were scattered about; part of a dress uniform
of the Yugoslav army, trousers and cap, were scattered on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nevrete Emini, 38, who married a native of the village and has
lived here for 20 years, does not pretend to be sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we watched them go, I was thinking of how we were thrown
out by them,'' she said acidly. ``But we left through clouds of
bullets, while they got to go with an escort from the Americans.''
She described how Serbian paramilitaries threatened to cut the
throat of her son, Esat, 17. ``It's better that they're gone,'' she
said. ``They were bad; they know what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-month war, in May, Serb troops and
paramilitaries herded the Albanians out of Zitinje, helped, Mrs.
Emini and others said, by some of the local Serbs. The Serbs killed
no one here, but demanded money from the Albanians _ 100, 200 or
300 German marks, whatever they had _ and sent them off to the
nearby town of Pozaranje.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for no clear reason, 10 days later, after trying to extort
more money, the Serbs let the Albanians of Zitinje return home.
</P>
<P>
   They came back, said Sabit Emini, 56, to find some of their
possessions and livestock looted and a few of their houses burned,
including that of his son, Ismet.
</P>
<P>
   Emini was careful to say he does not know who looted his house
and took one of his five cows, that it could have been Serbs from
the nearby villages and towns, like Kolkot. He had been told the
names of local Serbs who were under suspicion, he said, ``but I
couldn't do to them what they did to us, I can't even think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Emini is troubled that the Serbs are gone. ``I was not happy to
watch them go,'' he said. ``It was tragic. Even if the men were
guilty, the women and children were not.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it a failure of the peacekeepers? ``It's not good for us,
either,'' he said, touching his ``plis,'' the traditional white
wool cap. ``For more than a century they lived with us and we never
had real problems with them. But Belgrade's policy did this to
them; Milosevic did it to them,'' he said, referring to the
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who rose to power on the
grievances of Kosovo's Serbs and stripped autonomy from Kosovo in
1989.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, relations changed with the village Serbs,
who became more lordly and distant, pushed some Albanians from
their jobs and would not let Albanian children attend the new
village school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, in the streets, Serbs would say hello and ask for your
family, and sometimes in Albanian. Then, it mostly stopped. Some
older people would still say hello, but the younger ones, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Emini and his younger brother, Ethem, 45, offered soda and
Turkish coffee in their courtyard Wednesday, as 10 children
gathered around to stare at the strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better if only Albanians live here,'' said Ethem. ``There
was no shared life any more. And some of them did terrible
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they admitted, there was an effort by Albanians ``from
outside'' this village to drive the Serbs away. There had been
shooting at night, and in the previous 10 days, four Serbs from the
village had been killed. As the Americans cleaned up two of the
dead, young Albanian children flashed victory signs.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh was open about the problems. Originally, the Americans had
a company of four platoons in the village, but after about three
weeks, he and his single platoon took their place.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, his troops had been in a 10-minute exchange of fire
with unknown people who had tried to lure them into an ambush by
setting a house on fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has no doubt that the intimidation of the Serbs was
deliberate, and said it reminded him of events a month ago in
Urosevac, which were ``totally controlled'' by the Kosovo
Liberation Army, ``even though they always denied it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies and Serbs were driven out in a week, he said, ``and then
the houses were looted in order, completely controlled, and then
burned, but of course they said no one controlled it.'' The
Americans caught a lot of looters and arsonists, he said, ``but it
had little effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Americans are trying to save what they can. The
problem was that Albanians gave goods to friendly Serbs to keep for
them when they left, and now that the Serbs are gone, there is no
way to prove who might own what.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a way, the troops are being turned into villagers.
</P>
<P>
   To protect Serbian property and avoid the health hazard of dead
animals, American soldiers gathered together the Serbs' livestock _
horses, cows, goats, ducks, pigs, chickens _ and are feeding them,
Leigh said, laughing. ``It's crazy,'' he said. ``We've tried to get
rid of the pigs, but the Albanians won't eat them,'' since many are
Muslim, ``and the Serbs don't want to come to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone now in this Albanian town is grateful to the Americans
and the rest of NATO for saving them from the Serbs. ``If not for
God, first, then the Americans, maybe we would all be dead,'' Sabit
Emini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you never know how the world turns,'' he said. ``Maybe the
Serbs will be back, and it would be terrible for them to return and
find their goods gone, as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in words of praise that might ring ominously to Leigh and
his troops, Emini said: ``The Serbs are 10 million and we are just
2 million. We can never let the Americans and the British and the
Germans leave here.''

CLINTON REPEATS VOW TO VETO GOP TAX-CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton renewed his vow Wednesday to veto
a sweeping tax-cut bill as Republican leaders began carefully
counting to make sure they had the votes to pass the plan that
Senate and House negotiators approved Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the public eye, the congressional tax staff worked
against tight deadlines to fill in the details of the framework
adopted by negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate plan to vote on the legislation before
lawmakers leave at the end of this week for a month-long recess.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the measure would reduce the lowest
income tax rate, now 15 percent, to 14.5 percent in 2001 and to 14
percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The rates for more affluent taxpayers, now ranging from 28
percent to 39.6 percent, would also be reduced by 1 percentage
point, but that would not happen until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the legislation, an amalgam of bills approved last
month by the Senate and House, would lower taxes by $792 billion
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they conclude this plan and send it to me, I will veto
it,'' Clinton told reporters in the Rose Garden on Wednesday. ``I
will refuse to sign any plan that signs away our commitment to
America's future, to Social Security, to Medicare, to paying down
the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House met Wednesday morning, and leaders said
afterward that the rank and file was enthusiastic about the tax
bill and would pass it, even in the face of solid Democratic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more ticklish in the Senate. The measure is now
more favorable to the wealthy than the bill the Senate approved
last week, 57-43. On that vote, four Democrats supported the bill
and two Republicans voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The word from leaders' offices was that the four Democrats would
vote against the new version, as would the two Republicans who
voted no last week, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and George V.
Voinovich of Ohio. Another Republican, James M. Jeffords of
Vermont, is also expected to vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If all other senators stand pat, that would make the vote 52-48
in favor of the bill. But three other Republicans, John H. Chafee
of Rhode Island and Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, both of
Maine, were said to be on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought among Republicans is that the best
possible outcome would be for the Senate to deadlock, 50-50,
meaning that Vice President Al Gore would have to cast the
tie-breaking vote to defeat the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of partisan calculation was rampant in the Capitol on
Wednesday. Everyone knows that the votes this week are for exercise
and that one way or another this particular bill will never become
law.
</P>
<P>
   Musing on the situation, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said it
was like drawing up a Christmas list when you knew Santa Claus was
not coming.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan maneuvering, of course, is the daily bread of Congress.
But what makes this issue so unusual is that both sides seem
convinced that they have the political advantage. Normally, one
side or the other is much more defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said he could hardly wait to present the Republican
tax-cut measure to the people during the congressional recess.
``Republicans in the House and Senate have kept our commitment to
protect the taxpayers and not the tax-takers,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have decided that, even though Congress votes
final approval of the legislation this week, they will not send it
to the White House until after Labor Day. That will give them a
month to tout its value.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were equally confident that they held the strong
political position. ``They're rolling the dice,'' Sen. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said of the Republicans,
``and in my view, they're going to come up the big losers here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill the Republican leaders agreed on starts small and
mushrooms over the next decade. The total tax reduction in 2000
would be only $5.2 billion. In the first five years, the cuts would
total $156.1 billion, but they would continue to mount so that in
2009 alone, taxes would be reduced by $130 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Calculations by Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accounting firm, showed
that a couple with two children under 17 and an income of $50,000,
approximately the national median, would get an annual tax cut of
$265 when the bill is fully in effect.
</P>
<P>
   A similar couple with an income of $200,000 would get a tax cut
of $2,720, and one with an income of $1 million would receive a cut
of $9,861.
</P>
<P>
   But in percentage terms, the $50,000 couple would have their
taxes reduced by 9 percent, while the taxes of the $200,000 couple
would be lowered by 7 percent and the taxes of the $1 million
family would be reduced by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Tax Justice, an organization sponsored by labor
unions that usually makes reliable calculations, figured that
nearly half of the tax reduction from the rate cuts alone would go
to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above
$89,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions of the Republican bill would be even more
favorable to the affluent, including a reduction in the top capital
gains rate to 18 percent from 20 percent, effective Jan. 1, 1999,
and a gradual abolition of the inheritance tax on large estates.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also adjust capital gains, the profits from
investments, so that inflation after Jan. 1, 2000, would not be
counted when the profits were figured.
</P>
<P>
   This provision would cost the government significantly in the
long run, but it would result in a short-term windfall.
</P>
<P>
   In order to take advantage of the inflation adjustment,
taxpayers would have to pay the capital gains tax in 2000 on
profits accumulated to date. This would raise $15 billion in 2000.
Without it, no tax cuts would be possible in 2000 without creating
a budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the special-interest provisions of the Senate and House
bills were cleaned out when the two measures were reconciled. But
multinational corporations would receive more favorable tax
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break for business meals was watered down. Restaurant
owners had hoped that the current 50 percent deduction on the cost
of business meals would be increased to 80 percent. But the bill
would raise it only to 60 percent _ in 2007.

SPECULATION ABOUNDS ON SCHWEPPES' PLANS IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the owner of soft-drink brands like
Dr. Pepper and 7-Up, announced 18 months ago that it was buying two
Midwestern bottlers for $730 million, investors were relieved.
</P>
<P>
   The bottlers, to be renamed the American Bottling Co., were
expected to consolidate the fragmented independent bottler network
on which Cadbury depended heavily to get its products into stores.
</P>
<P>
   But American Bottling is running into problems, in part because
of Cadbury's ownership, which is a 40 percent stake in a joint
venture with the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm.
Cost-cutting _ a major byword in the Cadbury corner office _
resulted in the closing of five of the company's nine factories in
the spring to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But in what is normally the peak selling season for soft drinks,
the bottler has been unable to meet demand. In fact, some of its
orders have been subcontracted out to other independent bottlers,
said Christina Meyers, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   And as for driving additional consolidation, there has been
almost none. One small bottler was acquired and a few territories
were added, but American Bottling shows no signs of soon becoming a
behemoth like Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola's largest bottler,
or the Pepsi Bottling Group, which Pepsico spun off earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace of consolidation, combined with Cadbury's sale of
its brands in most overseas markets to Coca-Cola as part of a
strategy that favors expanding Cadbury's confectionery operations
worldwide, is fanning the theory that Cadbury will exit the U.S.
soft-drink business before long.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein, says that
within the next two years, Cadbury will sell off either its
concentrate company, Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, or the entire
concentrate-and-bottler package _ a move that Cadbury's chief
executive, John M. Sunderland, has repeatedly denied is part of his
strategy, although some inside Dr Pepper/Seven-Up think the
opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland is holding meetings Thursday in New York with Wall
Street analysts at a time when Cadbury's American depository
receipts, which closed Wednesday at $25.375, are barely $1 above
its 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the way the endgame is closer to being played
out in the U.S. in soft drinks than in the confectionery business
abroad, they are better off going into the confectionery
business,'' Pecoriello said. ``We don't envision Dr. Pepper being
acquired by Coke or Pepsi. The bottling company could be combined
with the concentrate company, or you could have two separate
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   That move cannot happen now, he added, because problems at 7-Up
_ where volume has declined 3 percent despite increased advertising
and other marketing efforts _ still need to be corrected. Then
there are the difficulties at American Bottling, which ``aren't
helping,'' Pecoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that profit goals set by Cadbury executives in
London will erode the U.S. beverage business in the long run.
``Cadbury wants 10 percent earnings growth, but proper investment
in the U.S. soft drink business would only allow 7 percent to 8
percent earnings growth,'' he wrote in a report issued on Monday.
``In the short run, a concentrate company can cut back on media or
limit marketing support for its bottlers and deliver attractive
profit growth,'' as in the 9 percent profit surge Cadbury reported
for the first half of this year. ``In the longer term, this
strategy will starve the bottler network and result in a death
spiral for the non-Dr. Pepper brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunderland, reached in New York, dismissed the report as ``the
most flawed piece of analysis it has ever been my misfortune to
read,'' calling it ``riddled with what I would call illogical
deductions.'' He said the problems at American Bottling were almost
resolved, and added, ``There is absolutely no intention on our part
to exit the business in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Many industry experts think that American Bottling is trying to
acquire the highly successful Dr. Pepper and Seven-Up bottling
business in Dallas run by Jim Turner, who would then take over the
management of American Bottling. The move would parallel one made
in 1991, when the struggling Coca-Cola Enterprises bought the
bottling company run by Summerfield Johnston Jr., whose management
team took control of Coca-Cola Enterprises and is credited for
turning it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turner would be a huge positive,'' said Michael Bellas, chief
executive of Beverage Marketing, an industry consulting company and
data base. ``Once you get someone like that in place, it makes a
big difference.'' Sunderland said he could not comment on the
status of talks with Turner, but added: ``We have not reopened
talks with him on management control. It's all nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But earlier
this year, he predicted that Cadbury would sell its U.S. soft-drink
business. He made the statement a few weeks after Cadbury announced
in December that it would sell most of its overseas brands to
Coca-Cola for $1.85 billion, noting that Cadbury's willingness to
do that ``opens up a lot of questions in terms of Cadbury's
long-term plans in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal has since been trimmed back, after opposition from
European regulators, to exclude most countries in the European
Union. But it is still running into roadblocks: Mexico and
Australia, two of Cadbury's largest markets, have rejected it,
although Coca-Cola and Cadbury say they hope they will be able to
revise the deal there and win approval for it.
</P>
<P>
   The current deal is worth $1.1 billion to Cadbury, and about
$705 million of that was closed last Friday. The brands are not
expected to add anything to Coke's earnings for at least a year;
about 60 percent of the volume, estimated at 300 million cases,
will be handled by Pepsi bottlers under existing agreements, which
Coke agreed to honor until they expire.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, while it puts cash into Cadbury's pockets, also leaves
the company with a knottier business plan than was envisioned when
the original deal was announced. Instead of being free to focus on
expanding its global confectionery and U.S. soft drink operations,
Cadbury for the time being must run beverage businesses in Eastern
Europe, Western Europe, Australia, Mexico and Canada _ which
Sunderland has said the company is happy to do, as long as it has
to.

COMMENTARY: HOT ENOUGH FOR YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can do it. We can keep our heads buried in the increasingly
hot sand until we're all as crisp as french fries.
</P>
<P>
   Or we can try to raise our collective consciousness and do
something about global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous warming of the planet Earth is already under way.
Forget for a moment this summer's extreme heat and the threat of
severe drought hovering over large sections of the United States.
No conclusions about climate can be drawn from a single midsummer
hot spell, not even from a heat wave that killed close to 200
people in the last couple of weeks of July.
</P>
<P>
   But consider that the Earth's average temperature in 1998 was
the highest on record. And consider that 1998 was the 20th
consecutive year that the Earth's surface was warmer than its
recent long-term average, which is the average for 1961 through
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as The New York Times' William K. Stevens wrote last
December: ``Seven of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred
since 1990 and the other three occurred after 1983. Most recently,
new monthly high temperature records were set in each of the 18
consecutive months ending in October 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief
scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund, said, ``The world we
are going to live in over the next 30 to 40 years will be different
climatologically than the world has been in the whole history of
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   By different, he means warmer. You can count on earlier springs,
longer and hotter summers, more air pollution, more droughts, and
more heat-related health problems and deaths. And you can count on
the oceans rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for the rise in sea levels is twofold,'' said
Oppenheimer. ``Increasing temperatures cause mountain glaciers to
melt. That adds water to the ocean. That's happening already.
Almost all glaciers worldwide are melting. We don't know what's
happening near the poles, but in the regions between the poles,
almost all glaciers are melting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number two, water expands when it's heated, like most fluids.
So the combination of those factors will cause sea levels to rise.
Partly because Earth has already warmed over the last century about
a degree, sea level has already risen somewhere between 4 and 10
inches. That may not sound like a lot, but on a typical East Coast
beach, if you raise sea level one foot, 50 to 100 feet of land
becomes permanently submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projected sea-level rise for the next century is anywhere
from one foot to three feet. There's not much doubt about this part
of it. Big chunks of Long Island, New England, New Jersey, right
down the East Coast, are going to simply erode and disappear
underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many factors that can contribute to the warming of the
globe, but most scientists are convinced that an enhancement of the
naturally occurring greenhouse effect _ an enhancement caused by
human activity _ is a big contributor now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain gases that exist naturally in the atmosphere, like
water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and even nitrous oxide, which
you know as laughing gas, keep the Earth warmer than it otherwise
would be, because they are transparent to sunlight, but they trap
heat that would otherwise escape into space,'' said Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that greenhouse effect, Earth is about 60 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than it would otherwise be. Without the natural
greenhouse effect, Earth would be a frozen desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that various human activities in our
era of industrialization are causing a buildup in the levels of
some of the gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which results from
the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. As more and more of the
gases build up, more and more heat is trapped by the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   We could get this problem under control, but that would require
political leadership and a fair amount of willpower _ two qualities
that currently are in spectacularly short supply.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll wait. Not enough people dying yet, and not enough
property destroyed. We'll keep our heads in the blazing hot sand
until we actually feel the flames of a full-fledged catastrophe.  &QL;

   HOLBROOKE-CONFIRM (Washington) _ The Senate moves closer to

administraton without a high-profile representative during a series
of foreign-policy crises. The vote was made possible when the last

   DEBT-BUYBACK (Washington) _ The Clinton administration moves to
take advantage of projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling
the way the government handles its finances. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers says the government will change its strategy for
handling the $3.6 billion it owes to the public in the form of
Treasury bonds and other securities. Rather than simply retiring
Treasury securities when they mature, the government would have the
option of repurchasing some of the debt from investors before it
comes due. The Treasury would then replace a portion of the
repurchased debt with new securities that carry lower interest
payments and save money for the taxpayers. By Richard W. Stevenson.

surrounding hilltops seem to laugh down at them, a boast about who
still controls the Golan Heights. The streets are all but deserted,
off-limits to most Syrians. The buildings are rubble, sacked by
Israeli forces years ago. But such is the mood in Syria today that

organization's expulsion of a gay Eagle Scout in 1990 violated the
state's antidiscrimination law. This case is the second one to have
reached the highest court in a state. In March 1998, a California

IT'S THE PITCHING, STUPID! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- To borrow a phrase, ``It's the pitching, stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar may or may not hit .380. Brian Daubach may or may not swat
his way to Rookie of the Year. Offerman may or may not hike his
on-base percentage back up over .400. None of this will matter if
Jimy Williams and Joe Kerrigan don't see more of what Mark Portugal
gave them Wednesday _ and not just from Mark Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   What Portugal submitted was a thoroughly professional pitching
performance against a very good hitting team. There was no Kenny
Lofton and no Manny Ramirez and still that did not guarantee an
easy afternoon against Mike Hargrove's Cleveland Indians. On this
club, even the JVs can swing the bat.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran righthander gave his team 8 2/3 innings of very nice
pitching. The Indians had a hit in every inning but the eighth, but
only in the ninth, long after the prize stallion had escaped from
the barn, did they get more than one. Portugal walked no one. He
only allowed one leadoff man to reach base, and that was with a 7-1
lead in the aforementioned ninth. It was Pitching 101, is what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``First-pitch strikes,'' assessed Kerrigan, the garrulous
pitching coach. ``He worked ahead all afternoon. He had 28 out of
36 first-pitch strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now take a look at Cleveland starter Bartolo Colon. We are
talking about Mr. Compare vs. Mr. Contrast. The alleged ace of
Hargrove's staff (should a Numero Uno carry a 4.36 ERA into a game
on Aug. 3?) threw 88 pitches in 4 2/3 innings. Among them were _
are you ready? _ 40 strikes. He walked five men and three of them
scored. It was a pretty wretched performance.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Portugal has nowhere near Colon's arm strength.
He's had surgery on just about every part of his body except his
eyebrows (if you bring your binocs, you can check out the hideously
bulging brace on his right knee). But pitching is about a lot more
than the ability to heave it up there in the high 90s. There's a
lot of Yoda stuff going on in the heads of baseball's Mark
Portugals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied this team on television for two days,'' he
explained. ``I saw Pedro get them out with a lot of off-speed
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? Changeups happen to be part of the Portugal
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw 37 changeups,'' reported Kerrigan, ``25 for strikes.
He had seven changeup outs.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why there can never be too many veterans on your staff.
</P>
<P>
   You can laugh and say that there is nothing more inconsequential
in sports than one baseball game out of 162, but you would be
wrong. There are vital checkpoint games for most teams hoping to
engage in postseason play (an exception being a Cleveland squad
that starts each spring training knowing that the Central Division
is its), and this was one of them for the Boston Red Sox. They are
locked in mortal combat with Toronto, Oakland, and, in case you
haven't been paying attention of late, Seattle, for the wild-card
berth, and they had just lost two games they know they should have
won. They are heading out for a seven-game road trip. They needed a
win on this made-for-baseball afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Mark Portugal, they got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big win for us,'' confirmed the skipper. ``Now
we've got a good feeling going on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally important in the big picture was that this was a nice
day for bullpen siestas. By coming within one out of a complete
game, Portugal provided a major service for his ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge pick-me-up,'' acknowledged Kerrigan. ``To have
only one man get up (Derek Lowe) and then to only work to one
batter was great medicine for our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pitching sky is a lot bluer today than it was a very
short time ago. Pedro Martinez looked like himself on Tuesday. Bret
Saberhagen appears to be OK. Brian Rose clearly has big league
ability. If this was the real Portugal, then the Red Sox will be in
this thing to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always about pitching,'' says Portugal, who has been in
enough pennant struggles to know. ``Pitching and defense are what
win games and championships. You look at this staff and, first of
all, you see Pedro Martinez, who is the best pitcher in baseball.
You've got Brian Rose, who has been outstanding all year. Then
you've got myself and Bret Saberhagen, a couple of veterans who
know how to pitch. If we can get out there and stay healthy, there
is no reason why this team won't be playing games in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a reason, and that would be if Tim Wakefield
inherits any more two-run eighth inning leads and turns them into
horriying one-run losses.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanically, there were things that happened on Tuesday night
that also sometimes happen when Wakefield starts,'' Kerrigan
explained. ``It was nothing we haven't seen before. He has a
checklist of about 10 things, and on Tuesday he missed about three
or four of them. It doesn't matter whether he's starting or
relieving, if he doesn't get them all he'll have problems. We
worked on things this morning, and he's going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, OK, but we'll be the judge of that. The essentials
remain: the Red Sox built up that nice wild-card lead originally
because the pitching was sound and the defense was not giving away
games. If the Red Sox are to secure the wild-card spot, it will
have to be the result of sound pitching and a defense that refuses
to give away games. No way, no how, will there ever be enough
offense from (itals)this(unitals) bunch to carry the team.
</P>
<P>
   Give us enough pitching shows like this one, and we can all
prepare for Martinez vs. Colon in Game 1 of the playoffs. It will
be about the pitching. It always is.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were no explanations inside the big white church
Wednesday as the city officially remembered the victims of last
week's shooting spasm. The only solace offered seemed to be the
collective nature of the quandary, an admission that no one could
truly comprehend why 13 lives were lost when a mind slipped its
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect answers to all the questions we have brought
with us,'' said the Rev. Joanna Adams in her invocation at the
memorial service, inside the Peachtree Road United Methodist
Church. ``But we expect you to tend these broken hearts that are
bowed before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell had organized what he called the Citywide
Service of Hope and Remembrance to bring healing to a city aghast
at its largest mass murder, committed last week by a despondent
trader of stocks, Mark O. Barton. But the close-up images of
mourners broadcast live on every major local television station
seemed only to magnify the losses: a mother leaning her forehead on
her child's shoulder, the trembling lip of an elderly woman, a
young man trying desperately not to break down before the city.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience of about 800 people wept when a choir
member sang ``In the Sweet Bye-and-Bye,'' and when representatives
of each family came to the front of the sanctuary to light a candle
in memory of each victim. Ministers stood near the candles to help
those who were nearly overcome, and speakers from different
churches and of different faiths tried to find the words to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the spirit, no weapon can inflict wound, no fire can burn,
no water can wet, and no wind can dry,'' said Amitabh Sharma,
president of the Greater Atlanta Vedic Temple, on behalf of the two
victims who were Hindu. ``Certain is the death of each body that is
born, and certain is the birth of the dead. So grieve not for what
is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers, including Campbell, explicitly mentioned Rabbi
Harold Kushner's book, ``When Bad Things Happen to Good People,''
if only to raise the eternal question in the familiar phrases of
the best-seller list. The Rev. Don Harp, senior minister of the
church, who delivered the day's principal message, said he was
asked last week if the murders were God's will, and his initial
angry response was to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``God does not punish his children,
he does not take away the lives of innocent persons. This was the
act of people who'd lost touch with reality, that perhaps we would
call insane.''
</P>
<P>
   But after further reflection, he said he was obligated to look
deeper into the future and conclude that whatever the reasons for
the tragedy, God at some point will not ultimately be defeated.
Those surviving must also work to reduce violence, he said,
lamenting that it is more difficult to get a prescription filled
than to buy a handgun in America.
</P>
<P>
   The service was also intended to remember other victims of
recent violence in Atlanta, but the emphasis was on last week's
shootings, which took place about a half mile from the church. No
one showed up to light a candle for the six members of a family who
were shot and killed last month in a domestic dispute in southwest
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The one death not mentioned during the service was that of
Barton, who killed himself after slaying his family and nine
others. That bothered Joe E. Carter, a community organizer who
attended the service, who said that Barton merited a prayer and the
hope of forgiveness. That was deemed to be too painful for the
families, however, whose spiritual wounds were repeatedly compared
with those of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest Hemingway wrote that life breaks us all, and for many
we become strong at the broken places,'' said Harp. ``We have
gathered as a community today to express that we are at one of
those broken places.''

DUNN INDUSTRIES ACQUIRES COLORADO CONTRACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dunn Industries Inc. has announced the acquisition of a Colorado
contractor that will expand the company's reach into the mountain
state.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn Industries, based in Kansas City, announced this week that
it had acquired Hughes/Smith Inc., a Colorado Springs contractor.
The terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Carl W. Smith, president of Hughes/Smith since 1991, will
continue to run the contractor, which has about 50 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will continue to do business as Hughes/Smith, but the
company will change its legal name to Dunn of Colorado as it joins
Dunn Industries' growing stable of divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn Industries Inc. is the parent company of J.E. Dunn
Construction Co. and Dunn Industrial Group of Kansas City; Witcher
Construction Co. of Minneapolis; Drake Construction Co. of
Portland, Ore.; and CE Ward Constructors Inc. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The five construction units forecast more than $1 billion of
construction revenue in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Dunn, president and chief executive officer of Dunn
Industries, said the acquisition of Hughes/Smith gave Dunn
Industries a strong base for growth in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been exploring the best ways to continue our growth
into the construction market in the West,'' Dunn said in a prepared
statement. ``By acquiring a local firm, we gain the benefit of
their knowledge of local subcontractors and other business
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dunn added: ``It is valuable for our operation
to invest in a company with a strong local tradition. It has the
roots to be able to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes/Smith was established in 1955. In recent years, the
company has been the contractor for a $9 million municipal court
building in Colorado Springs, a $12 million electric utilities
center and a $15 million high school in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Hughes/Smith would be able to pursue larger
construction projects by becoming part of Dunn Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado firm will keep the name that is familiar to its
local business executives and government officials because the name
has value, Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relationship business,'' Dunn said. ``That's how we
differentiate ourselves.''

OPPOSITION PARTIES IN MEXICO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After months of bickering, Mexico's main
opposition parties _ which embrace widely differing ideologies _
are reporting surprising progress in negotiations to form an
alliance against President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party in
next year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of the pro-business National Action Party, the
center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, and six
smaller parties have been meeting intermittently since March to
discuss a coalition, without seeming to surmount many of the
obstacles to the venture. But in recent days, leaders of all the
parties say they have made dramatic advances.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Tuesday, opposition leaders upgraded what had been just
ad-hoc conversations in politicians' homes into formal
negotiations, forming a negotiating committee composed of
representatives of the eight parties. They announced that they were
preparing the documents required for the coalition, called the
Alianza Por Mexico, to appear on the ballot in the July 2000
elections. They also agreed to try to work out a common electoral
platform, a program of government, and a legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The parties also agreed to work to develop a common slate of
congressional candidates and to design a ``national consultation''
to pick a single presidential candidate. That term appeared to have
been left intentionally vague because the two largest parties are
still at odds about how to designate a single nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The formation of a coalition of political parties to
participate in the federal elections in the year 2000 requires us
to get past many political, legal and organizational obstacles,''
the parties said in their first joint statement, issued late
Tuesday. ``This is not only about defeating the official party, but
also about taking advantage of the historic opportunity that will
present itself in 2000 to complete Mexico's transition to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the opposition parties are finding common ground,
politicians involved in the talks said, is that recent opinion
polls have shown that a single candidate representing an opposition
alliance could defeat virtually any candidate nominated by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two largest opposition parties each run separate
candidates, the PRI, which has never lost a presidential election,
is likely to win again, the polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Although several opposition parties have occasionally joined
forces against the PRI to pass legislation in the Congress, where
they form a majority, the two main parties are ideological
opposites. National Action was founded in 1939 by Catholic
free-marketeers who believed the PRI was dragging Mexico into
socialism. The PRD was born in 1989 when ex-communists and
socialists joined with members of the PRI who were disappointed
with the governing party's drift away from its revolutionary roots.
</P>
<P>
   But egos have appeared to be even more important than issues in
preventing progress toward the alliance. Both Vicente Fox Quesada,
National Action's presidential candidate, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
Solorzano, the Mexico City mayor who is the PRD's likely candidate,
are strong-willed leaders for whom stepping aside in favor of a
rival would be wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, both men have expressed strong new interest
in the alliance. ``We're about 90 percent along on the way toward
complete agreement,'' Fox said on Sunday. ``The only difference
that remains is how to select the presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the toughest issue from the start, since both
Cardenas and Fox aspire to be the candidate of the alliance.
Cardenas's representatives have insisted that the candidate be
elected in a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Fox, who is running far ahead in nationwide
polls, have argued that neither opposition party counts with the
resources necessary to organize a nationwide primary. Instead, Fox
has suggested that the opposition should carry out a special public
opinion survey and simply designate Mexico's most popular
opposition politician as the alliance's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks and weeks, the leaders of National Action and the PRD
did little except trade insults, at least publicly. But on Friday,
National Action's highest decision-making body formally voted the
party's intention to participate in an opposition alliance with the
PRD. And the PRD's newly-elected leader, Amalia Garcia, said over
the weekend she had a ``strong desire'' to help forge the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say our two parties are like water and oil, that we
can't mix, but we're proving they can form an emulsion,'' said
Santiago Creel, a congressman from National Action who has been
active in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Also participating in the talks have been the Labor and Green
Parties, each of which have tiny congressional delegations, and
four other new parties formed recently by leaders who have defected
from the PRI and from the PRD.

OUSTER OF GAY SCOUTMASTER WAS ILLEGAL, SAYS N.J. HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Equating the Boy Scouts of America with public
accommodations such as restaurants, libraries, schools and
theaters, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the
organization's 1990 expulsion of a gay assistant scoutmaster
violated the state's anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-0 decision, the court first rejected the Boy Scouts'
arguments that it is a private organization and that its decision
to remove the assistant scoutmaster, James Dale, was protected by
the First Amendment. The court also dismissed the Scouts'
contention that homosexuality is immoral, comparing that argument
with discrimination against women and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding that Dale's dismissal was ``based little more
than prejudice,'' Chief Justice Deborah Poritz declared: ``The sad
truth is that excluded groups and individuals have been prevented
from full participation in the social, economic and political life
of our country. The human price of this bigotry has been enormous.
At a most fundamental level, adherence to the principle of equality
demands that our legal system protect the victim of invidious
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate opinion, Justice Alan Handler, who is widely
considered the court's staunchest liberal, said he agreed with much
of his colleagues' legal reasoning. Then Handler, who is retiring
after this term, concluded his 44-page opinion with something of a
sociological and philosophical lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One particular stereotype that we renounce today is that
homosexuals are inherently immoral,'' Handler wrote. ``That myth is
repudiated by decades of social science data that convincingly
establish that being homosexual does not, in itself, derogate from
one's ability to participate in and contribute responsibly and
positively to society. In short, a lesbian and gay person, merely
because he or she is a homosexual, is no more or less likely to be
moral than a person who is heterosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Dale, who is now 29, is the second one to have
reached a state's highest court. But the New Jersey result is the
opposite of the outcome of the earlier case. In March 1998, the
California Supreme Court ruled that the Scouts could expel
homosexuals. That court held that the Boy Scouts were a private
organization not covered by California's civil rights law and that
the organization had constitutional rights of freedom of
association and freedom of expression to expel homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stevenson, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America,
expressed disappointment with the New Jersey ruling and said the
group planned to appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts of America is a private organization with the
right to set our membership and leadership standards,'' said
Stevenson. He argued that New Jersey's anti-discrimination law did
not supersede the organization's First Amendment rights of
association. Consequently, he reasoned, New Jersey's high court had
used the state's anti-discrimination law to discriminate against
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman applauded the ruling during a public
appearance in Bergen County. She said she did not believe in
discrimination ``in any form'' and said a person's sexual
preferences were private matters. ``If the troop leader is a good
leader, there's no reason to worry about his sexual preferences,''
said Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who was an assistant scoutmaster at Troop 73 in Matawan
when he was expelled, said he was elated with the ruling. ``The
Supreme Court of New Jersey is wonderful,'' he said, as he appeared
with his lawyer at the headquarters of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund in Manhattan. ``This is what scouting taught me:
goodness will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Evan Wolfson, called the ruling ``a strong, clear
powerful decision by one of the nation's most respected state
supreme courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision we got today is a win/win decision,'' Wolfson
said. ``It's a victory for Jim Dale and it's a victory for other
gay men like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who lives in Manhattan and helps arrange health fairs for
people with AIDS, said he wants to return to scouting. The ruling
ordered his reinstatement and instructed a lower New Jersey court
to take up his request for compensatory and punitive damages
against the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dale joined scouting in 1978 at age eight, obtained more than 25
merit badges and scouting's highest rank and honor _ Eagle Scout _
and eventually became assistant scoutmaster. The Boy Scouts
considered him an exemplary member, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1990, his photograph appeared in a local newspaper,
identifying him as co-president of the Gay/Lesbian Alliance at
Rutgers University. Soon afterward, the Scouts sent him a letter,
informing him of his expulsion and saying that the Scouts'
standards for leadership forbade membership to homosexuals.

MEDICAL SOCIETY, INTERIM JOURNAL EDITOR AGREE ON CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Medical Society Wednesday stepped
back from the brink of a crisis involving its prestigious and
profitable publication, the New England Journal of Medicine, a
crisis that insiders said might have resulted in a temporary halt
to its weekly publication.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a 10-day controversy that followed the firing of the
journal's current editor-in-chief, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, the
Medical Society agreed to grant the journal's next chief editor
authority over use of the publication's name, logo, and content
``in print or any other form.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the journal's editorial staff expressed relief at the
outcome. If Angell and the Medical Society leaders had been unable
to agree, many feared an exodus of key editors that could have made
it impossible to meet the journal's weekly publication schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The new principles ``set a very high standard of editorial
integrity,'' said one editor, who asked to remain anonymous. ``I
think the Medical Society got burned very badly and they won't try
to find someone (as permanent editor) who will be their `yes'
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's ouster, after eight years at the top of the world's
most influential medical publication, reflected deep disagreements
over the Medical Society's plans to exploit the New England
Journal's prestige to launch other profitable publishing ventures,
in print and on the Internet. The publication is also highly
profitable, accounting for about 95 percent of the society's $73
million annual budget, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement with Dr. Marcia Angell, who is expected to
become interim editor-in-chief, the physician group pledged
``complete editorial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Medical Society's committee on publications ``nor
any other agent of the society will have authority over content or
editorial policy,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no use of the name, `The New England Journal of
. . .' for other products, as, for example, `The New England
Journal of Cardiology,' '' the statement said, reflecting
opposition to one plan to spin off journals to capitalize on the
name of the 187-year-old New England Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The society, however, did reserve the right to put a label on
its other publications saying they are ``from the publishers of the
NEJM.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal's editorial staff will also approve the
content of a consumer version of the journal that is expected to
begin appearing this fall on an Internet Web site called
Healthgate.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society promised not to move the journal's editorial
offices to its new suburban Waltham headquarters without ``the full
and active involvement'' of Angell and her staff.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, no move would take place before a permanent editor
is named, possibly by next summer, giving the next editor a voice
in any relocation. The prospect of moving editorial operations from
the Harvard Medical Area to Waltham is strongly opposed by Angell
and the editorial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Angell, 60, said she hopes the new guarantees of the editor's
prerogatives will live on beyond her tenure as interim editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wording leaves open the possibility of a move of the
editorial offices to Waltham, but not during my tenure,'' Angell
said in an interview. ``The other two principles are much more
general and timeless. I would hope very much _ and I expect _ that
the Society will embrace them even after I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Jack T. Evjy, the Medical Society's president,
initially said the durability of the new principles was something
he ``didn't want to address at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can predict into the future,'' Evjy said.
``Those of us who are here today can't really make decisions for
those people who will be here in the future. Secondly, we don't
know what the conditions will be in the future. But there are at
present absolutely no plans to . . . change the principles as
written, none.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal's associate editors, a panel of six
academic leaders who help screen which scientific articles the
journal will publish, are pressing for establishment of a new
independent group outside the Medical Society to serve as a buffer
between the New England Journal and the financial concerns and
politics of the physician organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The associate editors want to make sure there's a mechanism, a
buffer, to make sure this won't happen again,'' said one of the
six, Dr. Morton N. Swartz, referring to the dispute that led to
Kassirer's firing.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Society did agree to appoint ``a blue-ribbon search
committee'' to select the new New England Journal editor, and said
the panel would have representation from the journal's editorial
staff and ``the wider academic medical community.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell said the new guarantees will help recruit a permanent
editor-in-chief. ``It certainly means that better people will be
interested in the job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her ``present intention'' is to retire when a permanent
editor takes over, but she did not rule out the possibility of
being a candidate for the permanent post.

UMPIRES' UNION HEAD NO STRANGER TO CONFRONTATIONS, CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Entire 2nd take is optional trim.) 
 (rk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Among his friends, the story is legendary: how
Richie Phillips, at 13, organized a strike of altar boys in his
West Philadelphia parish because, he said, a new priest was
cheating them out of their tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, he backed off and said, `OK, keep the money,'''
Phillips recalled, relishing the memory.
</P>
<P>
   That combative spirit has run through Phillips' long career as a
lawyer, sports agent, and, for the last 20 years, the legal counsel
and guiding spirit of the Major League Umpires Association.
</P>
<P>
   But now Phillips, 58, having skillfully steered the umpires
through four strikes and lockouts with bare-fisted resolve, may
have pushed his members one step too far, convincing them to resign
en masse three weeks ago, a risky first move in what had been
expected to be a bruising contract negotiation. The ploy splintered
the umpires, allowed baseball to dismiss a third of the 68 umpires,
and, as a consequence, possibly imperiled the future of the union
Phillips had built into a powerful organization two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concerns for me in this episode,'' Phillips said.
``If I have a concern, it's for the union. I do have a concern for
the union.''
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, including more than a dozen umpires, it is
something of a wonder that it took so long for Phillips to stumble.
For them, it has been hard over the years to tell when Phillips was
reflecting his members wishes and when he was shaping them. Some
had long feared Phillips' confrontational approach would undermine
the greater interests of the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our union, and I think Richie lost sight of the fact
that he's never worked the plate or the bases in the big leagues,''
said Rocky Roe, an American League umpire who opposes Phillips.
``He sometimes thought it was his union. I got the feeling that the
will of the people was sometimes what Richie wanted it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout of the mass resignation strategy has been serious:
some umpires have called for Phillips' resignation; labor experts
have criticized his plan as foolhardy, and baseball, according to
Phillips, has achieved what it had long sought _ to portray him as
a ``demon'' and thus divide the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying awfully hard to bust this union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Phillips has never shied from a good showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is a former prosecutor who has organized unions from
scratch for a range of sports officials, from basketball referees
to golf officials, earning them better pay, benefits, and, he says,
respect. He calls his union organizing ``God's work,'' and he has
influential and powerful friends, including Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   But the full history of Phillips' involvement with sports unions
is not without its share of trouble and recrimination: eight years
after he unionized the referees of the NBA, the referees fired him
in 1984 after concerns arose about his pay and access to financial
records; and in the mid-1980s, a handful of umpires, again
concerned about Phillips' handling of union finances, mounted an
effort to more closely scrutinize the union's books.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, federal prosecutors investigated
possible financial improprieties at the union, and the assistant
U.S. attorney in charge of the case recommended that an indictment
be sought against Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia ultimately rejected the
recommendation, and, in the end, the union addressed the worries,
in part, by bringing in outside accountants to oversee its
finances. Phillips denies that he personally was ever the subject
of the federal inquiry, and said every penny of the union's money
was accounted for to the U.S. Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, however, Phillips always has done well at the
bargaining table. Since he began representing the union, no umpires
have been fired for their performance on the field, and they now
earn many times more than they did in the 1970s, their salaries
ranging between $75,000 and $225,000 a year, with four weeks
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   But the question now is whether all those triumphs might have
been endangered in one precipitous gamble resulting from an
overestimation of the power of the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his assumption is and has always been that in the end
we need them as much as they need us,'' Robert Kheel, a negotiator
for the National League, said of Phillips and baseball. ``I'm not
sure he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' association with the umpires began in 1978, when
several umpires approached him at a meeting in the Waldorf Astoria
in New York and asked him for help. Two years earlier, he had won
attention in the sports world for organizing the NBA's referees
into a collective bargaining unit and leading them in successive
strikes in 1977 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the umpires were in need of leadership. Each had
an individual contract with the American and National Leagues. Many
experienced umpires made less than $20,000 a year, and they
received no vacation during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips organized the umpires, won recognition from the labor
relations board, and led them on a seven-week strike in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was exactly the kind of person we needed at that time,''
said David Phillips, an American League umpire who was among the
umpires who was in the room when they hired Phillips. ``He created
a lot of turmoil. He's very radical in his views.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   For some umpires, Phillips became something of a folk hero. He
had grown up in West Philadelphia, a working-class Italian
neighborhood. The son of a police officer who never went to high
school, Phillips went to Villanova University on a football
scholarship, stayed to earn a law degree, and then became a top
prosecutor under District Attorney Arlen Specter, the future
senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie does not shy away from controversy, and I think that is
to his credit,'' Sen. Specter said. ``If people disagree with him,
he stands his ground.''
</P>
<P>
   For the umpires Phillips unfailingly won higher salaries, more
vacation time and better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires struck for four days during the National League
playoffs in 1984, but won contracts without work stoppages in 1987
and 1990. In 1995, after management locked out the umpires,
Phillips successfully negotiated the current contract that expires
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie has gotten us everything,'' said Edward Montague, a
veteran National League umpire who was making $16,000 a year in the
1970s. ``Richie rallied us and made us believe in ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary raises in five successive contracts won Phillips the
loyalty of a majority of the umpires, several of his supporters
said, even though he often presented the contracts as done deals to
the rank and file and consulted with them very little during talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always done the deal and it's always been acceptable to
the rank and file when it's done,'' Don Denkinger, an umpire who
retired last year, said. ``The rank and file, other than a few
isolated cases, will saddle up and ride with him right down to the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some grumblings about his leadership. For a union
lawyer, Phillips had a remarkable amount of power, running the
union as a one-man operation out of his office and having
check-writing privileges on the union's accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, a handful of umpires complained they did not have any
access to records of union spending. One of them, Jerry Dale, a
former umpire who had been dismissed for medical reasons, began
making complaints to both union leaders and the U.S. Department of
Labor about Phillips' handling of union funds and his refusal to
produce records, according to several umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Those complaints eventually led to a federal investigation. Some
of the details of the federal investigation came to light as a
result of a 1990 article on Phillips published by the National
Sports Daily. The article claimed, among others things, that the
Assistant U.S. attorney handling the investigation had recommended
to his superiors that Phillips be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips maintains he was never the target of the investigation,
and he has sued the publication for libel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpires association was being investigated because a
couple of members brought certain charges which were false
charges,'' he said. ``I, personally, Richard Phillips, was never
the target of that investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a May 1996 deposition taken in the libel case, the
assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the inquiry, Richard Scheff,
said he had recommended that an indictment be sought against
Phillips after the grand jury finished hearing testimony. He said
that, despite having written a draft indictment, he was overruled
by the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia at the time, Ed Dennis. Scheff
and Dennis did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the grand jury inquiry, the union began hiring
accountants to review their finances, according to Jim Evans, an
umpire and union official who testified before the grand jury.
Phillips' popularity did not suffer, he said, because most of the
umpires viewed Dale as a disgruntled troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue was not so much that he was being dishonest with the
money, but the fact that he didn't have an accounting of the
money,'' said Gerald Crawford, the current president of the union.
``Richie has rectified that.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode, however, was not the first time Phillips had had a
falling out with union members over finances.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' relationship with the basketball referees union fell
apart in 1984 when a number of referees accused him of charging an
exorbitant fee of $300,000 for negotiating their 1983 contract. The
fee was twice what he had received for the previous contract, and
the award had been approved only by several veteran officials on
the executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Some younger members, however, led by Michael Mathis and Hugh
Evans, demanded an accounting of the hours Phillips had worked,
and, when he did not produce records, they initiated an effort to
oust him, one that resulted in his firing in 1985. Phillips and a
number of his supporters in the union sued for for breach of
contract, and he ultimately gained a $500,000 settlement.

VOTERS APPROVE INTERNATIONAL TRADE HUB FOR KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT CARROLL and LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With voter approval Tuesday of a truck-train freight hub at
Kansas City's Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport, Kansas City
Southern Railway plans a fast start on the project, which it says
will catapult the city into a key international trade position.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved the project 54 percent to 46 percent. A simple
majority was needed. Before the airport can be closed, though, the
city must receive permission from the Federal Aviation
Administration, and city aviation officials do not know how long
that will take.
</P>
<P>
   The intermodal hub will use the main runway to transfer cargo
between trains and trucks. As planned, Kansas City would become a
dissemination point for goods flowing into the United States from
Mexico and possibly Canada under the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Levi, president of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of
Commerce, lauded the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote today places Kansas City in a unique position to lead
the country in international trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes said, ``We will look back on this
evening and realize this is truly a turning point for our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also reached out to the opponents. ``I will do everything
I can to work with them to deal with their concerns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she firmly believes the city can develop an aviation
capacity at Richards-Gebaur.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kansas City Southern's first priorities will be to work
on an automotive distribution center that Mazda has expressed
interest in occupying next spring, said Warren Erdman, Kansas City
Southern's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad expects to begin grading work in September on the
entry and exit ramps for the intermodal facility. It hopes to begin
using the site by next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Erdman said the project management team and Missouri Department
of Transportation officials would meet today to discuss bid-letting
on highway work to improve safety and avoid blocking traffic at
railroad crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The department hopes to begin right of way acquisition in
September in preparation for making Missouri 150 four lanes by
2002, Erdman said. It also hopes to let the bids for an overpass in
October and begin construction in November.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents, organized as the Save Richards-Gebaur Committee,
gathered at the airport to watch the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we had a really good run at them,'' said Tim
McDermott, leader of the opposition. ``If we'd had the financial
resources and a little more time to get the message out, it would
have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue wasn't dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A local vote does not change Federal Aviation Administration
policy. Now we'll see if they're going to let a local election
affect federal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure heavily outspent opponents, who relied
on a grass-roots campaign that appealed to deep-seated skepticism
over claims that the operation would be an economic boon.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates' handling of the proposal raised issues of trust
from the start. Many residents near the airport protested that the
project was a ``done deal'' before it had received public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   A petition drive forced the City Council to call the election.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have said the airport loses more than $1 million
a year. But opponents said the plan called for ``giving away'' the
airport. They said projections of the hub's economic benefits were
exaggerated and, despite the railroad's assurances that security
would be tight, they feared that trains from Mexico would bring in
drugs and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they said, trucks going to and from the center would
congest traffic and the center would pollute neighborhoods with
light and noise.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculation exists that approval of the hub will heighten
the movement at City Hall to privatize some city services.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelsie Sweeney, who supported the measure, said no
correlation exists between the hub proposal and privatization. ``It
is not uncommon at all for the city to lease public land to a
private company. The TWA overhaul base is an example.''

 PHILADELPHIA: $500,000 settlement. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current crisis for the umpires was first set in motion last
November when the commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig, a former
team owner, brought in Sandy Alderson, the former general manager
of the Oakland Athletics, and put him in charge of improving
umpiring. Alderson angered union leaders with plans to establish an
evaluation system for umpires and to pool umpires from both leagues
under Alderson's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips and his allies saw such measures as the first steps in
a campaign to undermine the union. Phillips maintains that league
officials had told him in private they were planning to get rid of
at least 20 low-rated umpires by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they should systematically eliminate a certain
number of umpires each year and that's the way to improve
umpiring,'' he said. ``You don't dismiss people as a way of
improving people.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the union members agreed that baseball's plans were
threatening. In February, a group of American League umpires,
fearing Phillips' militant stance would drag them into an illegal
strike and again concerned about how much money they were paying
into the union and where it was going, proposed replacing him with
a sports agent, Ron Shapiro, at a union meeting in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Under Phillips' contract with the union, according to a person
who has seen the agreement, he receives more than $300,000 a year
in compensation, and his law firm bills separately for any work
done on behalf of the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we applauded back in the '70s might not be the right
avenue for the '90s,'' said David Phillips, the American League
umpire. ``I want the image of the umpires to change. We act like we
are gangsters all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richie Phillips won a new three-year contract to serve as
the union's negotiator after members voted 49-14 to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he later devised the mass-resignation plan to
avert a strike as the union's current contract with baseball
approached its termination at the end of the year. He said the
leadership of the union was frustrated with Alderson's refusal to
bargain seriously, and had voted to authorize a strike vote during
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, Phillips convinced 57 umpires who met in
Philadelphia that, rather than strike, it would be better to resign
as a group on September 2, just before the playoffs . He persuaded
more than 50 to sign letters of resignation and sent them to league
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he wanted to provide a cooling off period before
his members struck illegally and to give baseball a deadline for
coming to the bargaining table. But he apparently overlooked an
important legal point: employees generally do not have the right to
withdraw their resignations once they are tendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were telling me they wanted to engage in a strike, I was
giving them an alternative, to save things,'' he said. ``Baseball
jumped at it as an opportunity to bust this union.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately backfired. Several umpires who had refused
to submit resignations were soon joined by a number of others who
asked to withdraw their resignations, suspecting Phillips had
miscalculated. The division among the umpires led the union leaders
to try to withdraw the rest of the resignations. But baseball
executives chose to accept 22 of the resignations and replace them
with newly hired minor-league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find a logical reason for it,'' Marvin Miller, the
former negotiator for the Major League Baseball Players
Association, said of Phillips' tactic. ``It just gave the
management and the owners all the weapons and all the options to
use against the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips maintains his only miscalculation has been to
underestimate the ``inner courage'' of some of his members, and he
has gone on the offensive. This week he filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board, charging that baseball had
improperly targeted union stalwarts in selectively accepting
certain resignations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was to bust this union and to bust Richie
Phillips, and to rule the umpires with an iron fist,'' said Ed
Montague, the veteran umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, sitting in his office outside Philadelphia, Phillips
exudes the self-confidence that has characterized his long career.
Facing the toughest labor struggle of his life, he predicts he will
be able to rally his supporters and prevail in court.
</P>
<P>
   A bearish man, he has a steel handshake and deep voice that
rumbles up from his cavernous chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I'm as hard-line as I'm required to be and forced
to be in the circumstances,'' he says. ``I'm inaccurately depicted
when I am depicted as someone who can't go to sleep that night
unless he has a fight every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the current crisis, Phillips is likely
to continue to have his share of battles. In his 30 years as a
lawyer, he has fought in court with everyone from the Internal
Revenue Service, to his landlord, to former clients, to lawyers who
have represented him.
</P>
<P>
   The docket of Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas alone lists
more than 25 suits filed against him since 1981, and eight suits
that he has launched against others. Most of these actions have
arisen out of fights over debts people claim he has refused to pay
or debts he claims he is owed.
</P>
<P>
   It is also clear Phillips will not suffer financially even if
the umpire's union disintegrates. In 1994, he took over Pilot Air
Freight Inc., surviving a vicious, three-way corporate battle and
eventually ousting the former president, John J. Edwards. He now
controls half the stock, earns about $700,000 a year as president
and is expected to take home more than $2 million in profit this
year, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Phillips, who spends less and less time at his law
office and leaves most of the union-related work to his two
partners, maintains that he represents the umpires mostly out of
his love for the union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound corny,'' he says. ``I believe I'm doing God's
work. I believe there is an immoral culture in baseball today and
that I have to eradicate that culture.''

'69 OR '99, A ROCK FESTIVAL IS A COMBUSTIBLE MIX  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared, the drumming stopped and the police
broke formation around 6:30 a.m., some eight hours after the
burning, looting and youth-gone-wild marauding of Woodstock '99 had
begun, an older state trooper walked toward a vendor who was
offering free coffee. ``Remember Woodstock,'' the officer said,
wearily, to the bedraggled teen-agers sitting nearby. ``The first
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he dropped his hammy fist onto the coffee counter and
proclaimed, sarcastically, more wearily, ``Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember Woodstock? I often wonder whether the peace-and-love
Woodstock _ the Goodstock _ of our historical consciousness was the
real Woodstock. Or, in the same way that a photograph often
replaces an actual memory, has the myth and movie of Woodstock
replaced the more complicated reality of the late '60s? A different
filmmaker could have edited a documentary about Woodstock '69 that
showed the festival as a disaster, depicting the food shortages,
overflowing toilets, standstill traffic, lack of medical supplies,
deaths, heroin overdoses, countless bad trips, bonfires, food
stands burned to the ground and even Pete Townshend violating the
peace-and-love ethos by bashing Abbie Hoffman in the head with an
electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   If Goodstock was seen as a triumph of peace and love, it was
viewed this way because it advertised itself as an exception, an
unexpected example of youth (and, as important, the community of
Bethel, N.Y.) uniting to make the best out of a very bad _ and
badly planned _ situation.
</P>
<P>
   Even at its best, it was an oasis in a series of large-scale,
audience-exploiting festivals in 1969 and 1970 that were
overshadowed by gate-crashing, rioting, property damage, and
arrests and injuries numbering in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Memory is selective: after all, in few press accounts trumpeting
Michael Lang, the co-promoter of this year's Woodstock, as one of
the promoters of the 1969 festival does it also mention his
involvement as an organizer of another 1969 festival, Altamont, the
Rolling Stones bill at which Hell's Angels ran amok and four
attendees died.
</P>
<P>
   So in the interest of historical perspective, I spent last week
watching the four great documentaries of that rock festival era _
``Monterey Pop,'' ``Woodstock,'' ``Gimme Shelter'' and ``Message to
Love: The Isle of Wight Festival'' (keeping in mind, of course,
that a documentary from a director's point of view is no substitute
for firsthand observation).
</P>
<P>
   ``Monterey Pop'' is the director D.A. Pennebaker's cinema verite
account of what many cite as the first modern (though by no means
the first) rock festival, a relatively peaceful folding-chair event
at which more than 50,000 fans heard future Woodstock performers
like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Who and Jefferson Airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Woodstock '99, what strikes one first while watching
``Monterey Pop'' is not how much better some performances were but
what an amazingly sexist event this year's festival was.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no ogling, molesting or lewd, condescending
behavior by fans in this film (or any of the others for that
matter). All of this was commonplace at Woodstock '99, which left a
misogynistic aftertaste, with four rape charges and a litany of
memories of men groping bare breasts as if it were Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``Show us your breasts'' replaced ``peace'' as a
greeting, teen-agers walked around with phrases like ``Free
Breathalyzer test'' painted on their chests with an arrow pointing
to their pants and women's clothes were routinely ripped off in the
mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the draft dodgers in ``Woodstock,'' Michael
Wadleigh's reverential documentary of the festival that
unexpectedly drew 500,000 people to Bethel, one can't help thinking
that things might have been very different at Goodstock if there
hadn't been a war reducing the male population at home, if the
festival hadn't been partly in protest to the accounts of massacre,
destruction and rape that a portion of their generation was taking
part in overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Goodstock's similarities with this year's event were many:
bonfires stoked with plywood and trash; filthy toilets; scores of
townspeople trying to make a buck off festivalgoers; a pledge by
Lang, the promoter, that there would be another Woodstock, and the
fact that at both, the youthful audience shocked itself with its
size and power, though in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodstock, with little history of these kinds of festivals,
the audience was bent on proving to the world that it could get
along; this year, with a recent history of indistinguishable large
festivals, the audience was bent on proving that it had its own
identity, that it could make something memorable happen at its
Woodstock, regardless of whether that something was positive or
negative.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gimme Shelter,'' David and Albert Maysles' documentary of
the Rolling Stones' self-conscious attempt to top Woodstock with
its hastily organized Altamont festival, one sees a scene that
looks like a bad trip even without the Hell's Angels. Many of the
things that seem unique to today's rock generation, like
slam-dancing and crowd-surfing, already appear to be a concert
staple, as does the tendency for promoters to be in denial after a
tragedy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gimme Shelter,'' when asked about marauding Hell's Angels
who, acting as stage security, stabbed one audience member to
death, beat up countless others and punched out Marty Balin of
Jefferson Airplane midshow, one promoter explains: ``The Angels did
as they saw best in a difficult situation,'' adding that as far as
he was concerned, they were people ``who tried to help in their own
way.''
</P>
<P>
   John Scher, who shared promotion duties with Lang, defended
Woodstock '99 by saying that it was a great festival marred at the
end by a few bad eggs. Altamont turned tragic because of a few bad
eggs. But at Woodstock '99, if a few bad eggs started it, then a
lot of ambivalent eggs joined in. If they didn't physically take
part, most everybody was complicit in the mayhem, simply by hanging
around and enjoying the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   When trucks began exploding, speaker towers began to topple and
concession stands went up in flames, the general feeling was one of
excitement, not fear. Nobody I talked to was outraged or
remorseful; they only wanted to see how far things could be pushed
without anyone being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer doctor noted that there were more injuries in the
mosh pit during Limp Bizkit's performance than during the
post-concert melee. The real generational damage done at Woodstock
'99 was not in the riots, at which only one injury _ a man who
broke his leg beneath a toppling trailer as he tried to throw a
trash barrel at it _ was reported; the real damage was in the
reports of women raped in portable toilets, tents and even in the
audience, hate crimes worthy of branding Woodstock '99 this
generation's Altamont.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that they weren't captured on film, though the
police and promoters are currently reviewing videotapes.
Unfortunately, rapes have occurred at previous festivals, but they
were never reported to the extent that they were this year and they
certainly were never alleged to have taken place in plain view in a
mosh pit (where the generational apathy of the alternative-rock
audience of a few years ago seems to have been replaced at this
event by age-old mob savagery).
</P>
<P>
   At Woodstock '94 a man was charged with rape on the employee
campgrounds; the 1982 Us Festival in California resulted in one
rape charge, and the disastrous 1971 Celebration of Life festival
in Louisiana ended with several reports of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in ``Message to Love,'' Murray Lerner's disdainful
portrait of the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival that drew 600,000
people to see the Doors, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, the Who and
Leonard Cohen, one sees for the first time the great irrationality
of the rock festival, the conflict between greedy promoters trying
to turn a profit and idealistic rock fans who repeatedly fool
themselves into thinking that rock concerts are not, at base,
moneymaking propositions, that the music they love is not a
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodstock '99, rioters claimed that they were reacting
against the price-gouging at concession stands charging $4 for
small bottles of water, but the rationale was an afterthought.
During the rioting, they didn't chant ``rip-off'' or ``free
water'': they chanted ``Woodstock,'' ``U.S.A.'' and ``Canada,''
showing the world that they were rioting solely because they could,
because security fled the site the minute trouble started and left
them alone for over an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message to Love,'' on the other hand, shows a festival falling
apart because of money, because thousands of young people were
trying to break down the fences to gain free admission and rushing
the stage during performances to complain about ticket prices
(nowhere near the $150 price tag of Woodstock '99, before service
fees).
</P>
<P>
   Smack dab in the middle of the squabbling promoters and fans are
the performers, who the film shows paying lip service to the idea
that this should be a free festival while, offstage, refusing to
perform unless they are paid in cash in advance and complaining
about which band's name was printed in larger type in
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Message to Love'' also shows that the myth of Goodstock had
already infected the rock crowd a year later and that like the
Woodstock '99 festivalgoers and performers, they experienced a
pressure to live up to a nearly impossible ideal. ``This festival
business is becoming a psychedelic concentration camp where people
are being exploited,'' one festivalgoer clambers onto the stage and
announces before going on to complain about the lack of
Woodstock-style ``peace and love'' at the Isle of Wight festival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MC's response to the chaos, yelled angrily from the stage,
is: ``We worked for one year for you pigs, and you want to break
our walls down and you want to destroy it. Well, you go to hell.''
It's a line that the promoters at Woodstock '99 probably wanted to
yell at today's audience.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the predecessors of Woodstock '99, one realizes
that mayhem and destruction at organized mass gatherings isn't
generational. It is timeless, as are the motivations for it: money,
testerone, intoxication, arrogance, boredom and repression.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits will use Woodstock '99 to condemn today's youth;
others will take the opposite stance and criticize the way we treat
our youth. But perhaps it is less a statement about this generation
than about the combustibility between youth and mass gatherings,
between the individual and authority, between rock and commerce
and, sadly, between women and men.

JOCKEY BAEZ SEVERLY INJURED IN FALL AT ROCKINGHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Jockey Rudy Baez, perennially the leading rider in New
England, suffered career-threatening injuries in a spill during the
second race at Rockingham Park Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, Baez was listed as ``stable
but critical.'' After being transferred to Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, he was listed in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, 49, who was leading the Rockingham meeting with 57 winners
in 59 dates, was aboard Gaitor Bait in the second race when the
horse, who broke from post No. 1, clipped heels as the field beagan
to crowd a sixteenth of a mile out of the gate in the six-furlong
race.
</P>
<P>
   Gaitor Bait went down along the rail, catapulting Baez, who
landed head-first on the track. No other horses or riders were
involved in the spill, and Gaitor Bait was uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   When help arrived, Baez was conscious and alert, but reportedly
said he had lost feeling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Baez, who resides in Wakefield, Mass., with his wife, Judy, and
three children, was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He
began riding as a 13-year-old in his native country. He rode his
first winner in the United States at Detroit Racecourse in 1973,
arrived in New England in 1974, and has been a star of the local
circuit since.
</P>
<P>
   A winner of over 4,500 races in his career, Baez has captured 13
riding titles at Suffolk Downs, and 10 at Rockingham Park. In 1991,
Baez rode seven winners on a card at Rockingham, and finished
second in number of races won (to Pat Day) in the nation with 431.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Baez rode Lambana to victory in the $100,000 Spicy
Living Sweepstakes, one of the biggest races of the year at
Rockingham.

VIRTUAL CLUB HOPPING OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last month the Digital Club Festival hit New York,
with about 350 bands performing in 25 clubs. More significantly,
the event's organizers boasted that their brainchild was also the
biggest Internet festival in the world, with many of the shows
being cybercast to an expected audience of half a million computer
users. Barring any skepticism about the number, I decided to take
their claim at face value and watch the festival the way most
people supposedly were, on the Internet. It seemed like a simple
way to solve the old Manhattan rock-festival dilemmas, which
include suffocatingly crowded shows and too many decent bands
playing at the same hour.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed like a good way to test out the latest Internet
get-rich scheme sweeping the music business: concerts as Web
content. If people will one day pay for songs and albums on the
Internet, the logic goes, won't they also ante up to see live
broadcasts, download archived concerts or relive a show they
recently saw in person? There are thousands of Phish fanatics who
would probably be excited by this, and somewhere in this wide world
there must be one Sugar Ray fan who wants to see every stop on the
group's American tour.
</P>
<P>
   The concert idea illustrates the advantages and faults of the
Web as marketplace because the Internet music business model seems
based almost entirely on bilking a band's core audience of all its
time and money with a steady stream of bonus songs, concerts,
contests, video clips, trivia and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Internet concert business has several
influential new backers. Last week the House of Blues Entertainment
Inc. bought Universal Concerts, one of the largest remaining
concert promotion and arena management companies in the country,
for $190 million in cash and assumed debt. The main incentive for
the purchase, a spokesman for House of Blues said, was to build a
strong on-line concert business. To that end, the company announced
this week that it would conduct the Web's first pay-per-view
concert cybercasts later this year, with shows by the Cult, Ziggy
Marley, Sheryl Crow and Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the biggest concert company in the business, SFX, made
similar moves, investing in Internet companies and making a deal
with Intel to cybercast live performances by 20 pop stars this
summer. In addition, the Digital Club Festival promoted the startup
company Digital Club Network, which is trying to amass a giant
library of concerts from smaller-scale concert halls around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most machine dreams, the technology has not caught
up with the imagination. Club-hopping on line at the Digital Club
Festival was slightly less exciting than watching a pop act perform
live on a late-night talk show. The resolution of the shows was so
poor that it was tolerable only on a screen the size of a saltine,
and the audio wasn't even good enough for a fan to consider
bootlegging. Of course, many live rock-club experiences are not
unlike this _ with tin-can sound and poor sightlines _ but at a
real club one can at least talk with friends, wander around or
inhale secondhand smoke. At some Digital Club shows, the cybercast
was audio only; at others, the video and audio continued between
sets, allowing Internet users to eavesdrop on stage technicians
gossiping about their relationships.
</P>
<P>
   For people in New York the best use of the Digital Club Festival
cybercasts seemed to be to determine when a certain concert started
and if it looked good enough to attend; for those living elsewhere,
their best use was probably to get a vague notion of what they were
missing and whether they should see a particular band when it came
to their town.
</P>
<P>
   In the future and on other Web sites, concerts will likely be
presented with better audio, with clearer images and with multiple
cameras making the scene more complete and immediate. Clearly,
cybercasts and archived concerts won't replace the live experience.
But neither will they be completely useless. For instance, many
great live groups, like the New York Dolls, would have an even
better legacy if videos of their performances were as available as
their CDs have been. It remains to be seen, however, whether the
conversion of thousands of concerts a year into commodities will be
a windfall for music entrepreneurs or just more digital
information.

LAWYERS WORRY ABOUT KEEPING THEIR AUTONOMY, POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Calif., Conn., Fla., Pa.) (rk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American lawyers may be at the peak of their power.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving victories in court that could not be won in Congress,
they are playing ever more pivotal roles in public issues from sex
discrimination and civil rights to tobacco and the current battles
over guns and Microsoft. The size and wealth of the profession is
greater than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   But, partly in a reaction to that success, and because of the
increasing criticism of gargantuan legal fees and excessive
litigation, lawyers and the suits they bring are facing a host of
new restrictions. Legislatures and courts have barred certain types
of suits entirely and tried to limit the type of advice lawyers can
give. Many lawyers warn that as their influence is restricted,
Americans lose the ability to turn to the legal system for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an effort to foreclose the absolute freedom of
lawyers to represent their clients and the reason is that lawyers
have been successful in doing so,'' Philip S. Anderson, president
of the American Bar Association, the country's largest lawyers'
group said in an interview on the eve of the association's annual
convention, which began here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the trend, after more than 20 municipalities
filed suits seeking to force the gun industry to control firearms,
13 states have recently passed laws simply barring such suits
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   As the political landscape changes, so does the legal profession
itself. Some lawyers say new business and professional trends are
further limiting their autonomy, with lawyers increasingly finding
their decisions second guessed by insurance companies and others
reviewing their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any time in the history of the country,''
Anderson said, ``that the independence of the legal profession has
been as threatened as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say the new limits on lawyers and suits are a
response to legitimate public concerns. Deborah L. Rhode, a
Stanford law professor who is writing a book on the problems of the
profession, said some of the limits on lawyers were the result of a
concern about the profession's growing arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all responses, not just to the bar's political
clout, but to the bar's perceived greed,'' said Rhode, who is to
appear on a panel here.
</P>
<P>
   George L. Priest, a Yale law professor, said some of the new
restrictions, like the limits on gun suits, showed disillusionment
with what he said was the idea that had prevailed for decades that
``all disputes can be _ and ought to be _ resolved through
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But as more than 9,000 lawyers gathered in Atlanta Wednesday,
some see themselves facing the same kind of threat that doctors
faced with the advent of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still at a place where we can avoid what happened to the
medical profession,'' said Lawrence J. Fox, a Philadelphia trial
lawyer who is a former chairman of the bar association's ethics
committee. ``But we have to defend the proposition of professional
independence right now _ today _ we can't wait any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike doctors, lawyers are facing challenges on many different
fronts as courts, state legislatures and Congress have all imposed
new restrictions. A host of new federal and state laws and court
decisions, for example, make it harder to bring certain kinds of
personal injury suits, limit the legal arguments available in
immigration cases, and curtail civil rights suits on behalf of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by seeing government money used to fight decisions the
government had made, Congress passed laws that went into effect in
1996 forbidding all government-financed lawyers for the poor from
filing class action suits, challenging welfare reform legislation
or lobbying on behalf of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation on lawyers that has drawn particular attention in
the profession is a two-year-old federal law, popularly known as
``Granny's Lawyer Goes To Jail.'' It declared that any lawyer who
advised an elderly person how to give away property to qualify for
need-based Medicaid benefits was guilty of a crime. Last year a
U.S. District Court in Albany said the law was unconstitutional.
But it remains on the books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new legal limits, lawyers are facing changes
in the $130 billion business of law that some lawyers say are
creating additional constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, insurance companies that promise to pay for
the defense of lawsuits in malpractice, automobile insurance and
other policies are beginning to insist on reviewing the
expenditures of the lawyers hired to handle those cases. Some of
the lawyers say that is an invasion of their professional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of lawyers working at accounting firms spawned a Bar
Association commission's proposal to formally authorize lawyers to
practice law in accounting and other professional service firms
that has deeply divided the convention here. Some lawyers say such
lawyer-employees lack the autonomy to make independent judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics provide support for the widespread belief that there
are more and more lawyers with growing clout. Just 20 years ago,
government statistics show, there were three lawyers for every
1,000 Americans. Now there are more than 4.6 lawyers for every
1,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those lawyers are making unprecedented sums,
transforming an influential profession into what some critics call
``a new political class'' with enormous clout.
</P>
<P>
   According to The American Lawyer magazine, the gross revenues of
the country's 100 largest firms more than doubled to $23.1 billion
last year from $10.6 billion in 1988. The 1,467 partners of the
largest 13 law firms made annual profits of more than $1 million
per partner. The fees of more than $8.2 billion that have been
awarded so far in settlements with tobacco companies have led to
calls for controls on such fees.

 &HT;    Ohio governor tours dry farms
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio _ The spring in Jerry and Betty Wolford's cow
pasture is usually pumping clear water into the creek for their
cattle. But this summer, when the cows come for a drink, the spring
yields only brown sludge and maggots.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, the Wolfords use water from a garden hose and an old
bath tub set up in the pasture to keep their cattle alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This farm is 100 years old and I don't think it's ever been
this bad with the heat and seeing what's happened to our crops and
cattle,'' said Betty Wolford, whose family also grows corn, wheat,
hay and soybeans on about 1,000 acres. ``Like any farmer we're just
making do with what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gov. Bob Taft got a close look at some the Ohio
crops and pastures devastated by the prolonged drought and high
temperatures. Taft took a two-hour tour of the Wolford farm and
another farm in Pickaway County to examine crop damage that many
agricultural experts believe is as bad as the severe drought of
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Taft found shriveled field corn, burned pumpkin patches and
dried-out soybean plants that were less than 20 percent of their
normal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Taft arrived by helicopter in this county south of Columbus, one
of 39 in the central and southern parts of the state he recently
asked to be surveyed for drought damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers are hurting and farming is part of the lifeblood
of the state of Ohio, this is a very sad and very serious
situation,'' Taft said. ``This is a double whammy for our farmers
because not only is the yield going to be low, but prices are very
low.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farms in the Miami Valley are also on the verge of losing
much of their crops before the fall harvest. Taft already has
included Montgomery, Greene and Warren counties in his list of
areas that should be considered federal disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   The drought hasn't created as much damage on farms in the
northern Miami Valley, but many farmers in Warren County and parts
of Greene County are in danger of losing their crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are going to get wiped out by this drought. It's
been that bad, especially for soybean and corn crops,'' said Vince
Uetrecht, who grows corn, soybean, wheat and hay crops on a
1,000-acre farm in Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Uetrecht said his farm will survive because of a good yield on
his wheat and hay crops, but other farmers won't be as fortunate,
he said. ``If the weather doesn't get 'em, the ridiculous low
prices will,'' said Uetrecht, a fourth-generation farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Several county extension offices in the Miami Valley expect many
local farmers to lose up to 50 percent of their corn and soybean
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very spotty, there are some spots in Greene County
that have had some rain and are doing well, and other places that
are just burning up,'' said Jerry Mahan, the agricultural agent for
the Greene County Extension Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a farmer just tell me that this is going to be his last
year. He's lost too much and even if it does rain now it won't help
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the Dayton area has received nearly 9 inches of rain,
about 2.4 inches below normal, according to the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said he will ask Ohio's congressional delegation to support
funding for farm emergency-relief programs, including a crop-loss
disaster-assistance program, a livestock-feed program and low-cost
loans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dave Hobson surveyed affected farms in Pickaway and
Ross counties over the weekend and learned of other crop damage in
Fayette and Fairfield counties. He wrote a letter to U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, urging disaster assistance for
drought-stricken counties in his district and inviting him to tour
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The severity and intensity of this drought have created the
worst possible situation for farmers _ low prices and low yields,''
Hobson said. ``Certainly, disaster assistance is very much needed
in these depressed areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft also said he would consider using state money to provide
relief for farmers if the federal government doesn't come through
with enough financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule out any kind of relief,'' Taft said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Joe Haines (R-Xenia), chairman of the Ohio House
Agriculture Committee, said farmers aren't exaggerating the
severity of the dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be quite a few that will lose their farms this
year,'' he said while touring the Circleville farms with Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Taft this week asked Ohioans living east of Interstate 71 to
voluntarily limit their water usage until conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of state agencies recommended the request because
groundwater levels are declining, rainfall is expected to be below
normal in August and recent rains have not helped conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The drought and high temperatures have hit farmers in other
states even harder than Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, federal officials declared as disaster areas all of
West Virginia and parts of four neighboring states, including nine
southern Ohio counties.
</P>
<P>
   The federal declaration makes farmers in West Virginia eligible
for low-interest loans, along with their counterparts in the
drought-stricken parts of Ohio, and Kentucky, Maryland,
Pennsylvania and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio counties included are Athens, Belmont, Columbiana,
Gallia, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Betty Wolford said she's not sure what kind of crop
her family will have this year, but that old bath tub in the cow
pasture will continue to get a work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to see what's happening to farms, but farmers
usually find a way to keep on going,'' she said.

 ATLANTA: on such fees. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some lawyers see a connection between their growing power in
American society and new efforts to control them.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Little Rock lawyer who has been the bar association
president for a year, said civil rights and liability cases like
the tobacco and gun suits, showed that lawyers were sometimes more
capable than government of tackling problems. That, he said, made
lawyers a target.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the convention, the business developments some lawyers
say are threatening lawyers' autonomy are a major focus.
</P>
<P>
   One legal battleground across the country that is attracting
wide interest here is a fight between lawyers and insurance
companies over the costs of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have recently begun to audit the way
lawyers handle the cases of the insured clients, sometimes
requiring advance approval of decisions that have traditionally
been lawyers' alone, like how many depositions to conduct or which
expert witnesses to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Although malpractice insurers, for example, theoretically save
money when they do not have to pay verdicts, some lawyers say
insurers sometimes decide that some cases are not worth the
investment required to win. That, the lawyers say, puts them in the
position of being pressured to forfeit the interests of the person
they are defending to satisfy an insurance company that is paying
the bills. Insurance companies argue that they have a right to
control litigation they are subsidizing.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over lawyer independence is opening here because of
the proposal that would authorize the accounting firms' move toward
offering legal services. Under age-old rules that the commission
would change, lawyers are not permitted to share fees with other
professionals. One purpose of that rule was to ensure that only
lawyers controlled legal decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the thousands of lawyers working at the accounting
firms are legally barred from practicing law, filing suits or
formally rendering legal advice, although many are employed because
of their legal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The bar commission, appointed by Anderson, concluded that
allowing lawyers to practice in other professional service firms
would increase Americans' access to legal services. Several
European countries permit such multidisciplinary practice. Some
lawyers here feel American lawyers will simply lose the business of
global companies to the large accounting firms that can offer many
different professional services if the legal profession here does
not loosen its rules.
</P>
<P>
   If the bar association approves the proposal that would change a
model national code. But because the states set their own rules for
the practice of law, each state would then be required to decide
whether to adopt the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here say the proposal would ensure that lawyers, like
doctors in health maintenance organizations, will increasingly lose
their ability to make independent professional judgments.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the change say lawyers are already working
outside the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice of law has changed,'' said Sherwin P. Simmons, a
Miami lawyer who was chairman of the commission on
multidisciplinary practice. ``It is more global. It is more
interstate and the bar needs to respond. We can't just say, `Hell,
no! We won't go.'''

COURT REJECTS BOY SCOUTS' BAN OF EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled Wednesday that the Boy
Scouts of America ban on homosexuals violates a state
anti-discrimination law and rejected the organization's claim that
its policy of excluding gays is protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first defeat on the issue for the Boy Scouts in a
state Supreme Court, and the organization is vowing to appeal the
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey panel voted unanimously in favor of James Dale, a
29-year-old assistant scoutmaster (and former Eagle Scout) who was
ousted from scouting nine years ago when a local newspaper revealed
his college activism on gay issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly wonderful day for me,'' said Dale. ``I
always knew that the Boy Scouts aren't about bigotry or
discrimination. They're about something better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale's attorney, Evan Wolfson, called it a terrific decision
from a highly respected court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a policy of discrimination the membership or
people asked for,'' Wolfson said. ``It's been imposed by the
hierarchy (Scout headquarters) in Irving, Texas. This ruling puts
the Boy Scouts back in line with what most of its members
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts have previously prevailed against a handful of
gay complainants in other states on the argument that as a private
group they are entitled to the right to free association. But the
New Jersey panel determined the scouting organization constitutes a
``place of public accommodation'' because of its broad-based
membership and partnerships with public entities and public service
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the court ruled, the Boy Scouts are subject to New
Jersey's anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   Dale lost his first court battle in 1995, but an appeals court
overturned that decision last year, noting that Dale's ``exemplary
journey through the Boy Scouts of America ranks as testament enough
that these stereotypical notions about homosexuals must be
rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, one state Supreme Court justice filed a
concurring opinion denouncing ``certain unfounded stereotypical
notions in respect to homosexuals, such as the myth that a
homosexual male is more likely than a heterosexual male to molest
children, as well as the myth that homosexuals are inherently
immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our standards and our membership requirement have
stood as long as the Boy Scouts themselves _ over 80 years,'' said
Boy Scouts spokesman Paul Stevenson. ``At the moment, there's no
cause to think we're going to change or that we're looking to
review our leadership standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson acknowledged that enforcement (or non-enforcement) of
the homosexual ban varies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask anyone's sexual orientation when they apply for
membership or leadership positions. It's not our policy to look
into the sexual orientation of potential members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes known that they fail to meet the standards, we
would ask that they resign their membership or leader position,''
Stevenson said. ``If they refuse to resign, then we would rescind
it.''
</P>
<P>
   California resident and former Scout leader Scott Cozza said
that typically homosexuals can participate in scouting as long as
their sexual orientation remains a secret. Cozza's 14-year-old
Eagle Scout son, Steven, is crusading for acceptance of homosexuals
in scouting. ``We do know hundreds of young people who are in
scouting and concealing that. We know thousands of Eagle Scouts who
are gay, who have contacted us over the past two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many troops across this country who are aware of gay
or lesbian adult leaders in their troops, and it's not an issue,''
Cozza said. `` But the frightening thing is if they get a
homophobic parent who comes into the troop, if they want to report
that person, then that person will definitely be out. Then the
troop is put in the position of, do we want to risk the troop being
unchartered and loose our troop, or do we turn our backs and allow
the troop to go on?''.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Civil rights Project Director James C. Harrington said
it's impossible to measure how many youngsters and adults have been
discouraged from participating or quietly forced out of scouting in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason these cases get the kind of profile they do is
because of the few people who do make an issue of it,'' Harrington
said. ``With some people, you reach a quiet mutual agreement to
leave. And of course, (some) boys don't go into scouting for that
reason, and it's hard to measure how many that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, because Boy Scouts gives you that great
opportunity to learn about diversity and working together,'' he
said, calling the gay ban, ``myopic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say this having been a Boy Scout leader and an Eagle
Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman in Washington for the Family Research Council, a
socially conservative organization, denounced the New Jersey
decision as a verdict that would force the dismantling of the Boy
Scouts in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that prohibits a girl from becoming a Boy
Scout, a woman from being a Boy Scout leader _ even a member of the
North American Man-Boy Love Association from participating in this
group,'' said Family Research Council spokesman Janet Parshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state supreme court has defined the Boy Scouts as nothing
more than a hotel, hospital or restaurant,'' she said. ``All must
be accommodated, regardless of belief.''

 &HT;    Mississippi primary a vote against hard-edge politics
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From a distance, it's hard to draw many lessons from
this week's exercise in hot weather democracy, the primary
elections in Mississippi. But one trend line is clearly
discernible.
</P>
<P>
   In this, as in other elections in states from California to
Georgia in the past year or so, edge politics didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Lt. Gov.
Ronnie Musgrove, withstood a battery of ads attacking him for
logging too many miles on the state airplane. Mike Parker, who won
the crowded Republican primary without a runoff, was accused of
having a liberal voting record when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the ineffectiveness of negative advertising, but
the style of the winners that marks the decline of hard-edged
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the winners comes from the ideological extremes of
his party. As a state legislator, Musgrove had the kind of
conservative voting record a Republican would have been proud of.
Parker is a former Democrat who switched parties after the 1994
elections and won re-election in a district that is 41 percent
black.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an article of faith during this decade that a
candidate has to respond to negative attacks as quickly as
possible. Both Musgrove and Parker ignored this dictum, plugging
along with bland, values-related campaigns with barely a mention of
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's ads were described in a news story as ``almost
whimsical.'' In one, he made light of not being able to bag a deer
while out hunting with his son. In another, he claimed to be
running so hard he was endangering the armadillo population on the
state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the winners appears to have promised very much,
although both ran against opponents who promised to remove the
sales tax on groceries.
</P>
<P>
   They both made prominent mention of their ability to get along
with others, regardless of party. That's quite a change from the
strident style of the outgoing governor, Kirk Fordice, who vetoed a
record number of bills during his two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results could be read in part as a reaction to
Fordice, whose highly public affair with a childhood sweetheart
embarrassed the state. (After he announced he would divorce his
wife of many years to marry the other woman after he left office,
Fordice's hometown of Vicksburg took down signs honoring its
formerly favorite son.)
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi is accustomed to eccentricities in the Governor's
Mansion, however. A stronger factor is the state's economy, which
may be in the best shape it has been in since before the Civil War.
With things going so well, an angry in-your-face approach doesn't
have the same appeal it had just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The tone could change in the general election campaign because
polls show Parker has a long way to go to overtake Musgrove.
</P>
<P>
   If Musgrove hangs on to his lead, it would represent a
remarkable Deep South comeback for the Democrats, who last year
took back statehouses from Republican incumbents in South Carolina
and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   That will give both national parties impetus to compete in
Mississippi this fall, but the state's voters have already made a
choice that rests on style more than party.

SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES UNPREPARED TO DEAL WITH Y2K PROBLEM,
REPORT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L.WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lights are expected to stay on and the
telephones will still work on Jan. 1, because the computers that
control them are ready for the shift to the year 2000. But other
computers may not work, like the ones that issue pupils' report
cards and teachers' paychecks, according to a new government
report.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the report by the President's Council on the Year
2000 Conversion, the final version of which is due to be released
Thursday, added education to the ranks of relatively unprepared
sectors that could be adversely affected by the so-called Y2K
problem, joining local governments, the health care industry and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-page draft, the next-to-last report expected from the
council before the end of the year, says that critical services
like electricity, telecommunications and banking are well prepared,
along with air traffic control and most other federal operations.
</P>
<P>
   But fewer than a third of schools, universities and school
boards have certified that their computer hardware and software
comply with new standards designed to sidestep possible problems,
it says.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official said that the laggards ``continue
to struggle,'' and that ``we're running out of struggle time.'' He
asked not to be identified because the report has not yet been
released.
</P>
<P>
   Industries that have been hard at work on the problem for years
are nearing the end of their tasks, he said. But schools and local
governments did not begin as early.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand it if you know how local politics and
school board politics and funding goes,'' said the official.
``Sometimes it's hard for them to get on the right wavelength early
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   For areas like banking and power systems, ``there's no evidence
we're going to have those failures,'' said the official, who has
been deeply involved in such issues since late last year. ``Now
what we've got is industries nearing completion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem stems from the widespread use by computer
programmers of just two digits to represent years, like 99 for
1999. Some computers and programs read 00 as 1900 instead of 2000,
and others do not recognize it as a valid year, leading to
miscalculations or crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In education, the draft said, ``a troubling number of
institutions, especially in the elementary/secondary area, have not
yet completed their assessment of systems and are lagging in
remediation and testing.'' It cited a recent Department of
Education count that said that only 28 percent of more than 3,500
school districts and other education agencies reported that all
their critical systems are ready for the year 2000. Among colleges
and universities, only 30 percent of 2,100 institutions said they
were compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K-related failures in schools are unlikely to have a direct
impact on teaching and learning,'' said the draft, but they could
affect school buildings, possibly making them unsafe, and lessons
that involve computers directly could also be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also said that for most buildings, elevators and
heating systems do not care what year it is, and would continue
undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Some security systems that control building access could have a
problem, the report said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In general, the report was reassuring about the continued
operation of basic systems, but it pointed to some holes. For
example, of over 2,000 ``911'' call centers, just 37 percent were
prepared for the changeover at the end of June, the study said. And
the changeover could come at a time of strain for emergency
services, the study pointed out, with bad weather likely in at
least some parts of the country, and big New Years Eve parties.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the Year 2000 problem for the nuclear
industry were examined Wednesday on Capitol Hill, where the
chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Greta J. Dicus,
told a special Senate committee that ``we are not aware of any Y2K
problems in nuclear power plant systems'' that could directly
affect safety functions, partly because most of those systems are
so old that they have no computers in them.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear plants are of special interest because if they
automatically shut down, they still require electricity to remain
safe, and the emergency diesel generators they use for that purpose
sometimes fail in tests. Thus their ability to keep operating
smoothly bears on their safety, as does the operation of the whole
power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Of 103 operable commercial plants, only 68 are completely ready,
she said; of the remaining 35, ``about half'' need work on power
generation equipment; others have administrative systems or
monitoring systems that need work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dykus said that plants that still needed work were mostly
those with shutdowns scheduled in the fall, or were waiting for
parts. Six are not scheduled to finish by Nov. 1, including two in
long-term shut-down, and four that must be shut down for the work
to be done, she said. Those four all have sister units on which
work is complete, adding confidence that they can be upgraded, she
said.

FBI CHIEF SAYS `MISTAKES' MADE DURING MAFIA PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In his first public remarks on the scandal that rocked
the Boston office of the FBI last year, FBI director Louis Freeh
says ``significant mistakes were made'' by local agents who
recruited Irish gangsters to inform on the Italian Mafia, and said
he knows of evidence that could lead to their prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let the chips fall where they may,'' Freeh said
Wednesday during a news conference at the Boston office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the bureau was committed to finding James
``Whitey'' Bulger, the indicted South Boston crime boss turned
informant, who has been a fugitive for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that Bulger is in the running to be named to the
FBI's vaunted 10 Most Wanted list _ a designation long sought by
the local agents assigned to find him.
</P>
<P>
   For months, prosecutors investigating possible criminal
wrongdoing by Bulger's FBI handlers have been presenting evidence
to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That grand jury, according to sources, has heard evidence of
possible crimes by retired Special Agent John Connolly, who was
Bulger's handler for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the agents implicated are retired or the criminal
conduct dates back many years, Freeh said, ``There's nothing we
take more seriously than the integrity and honesty of our agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not an agency to make excuses for either problems or
people who. . .have committed serious violations and crimes while
working for the FBI,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting that the FBI's credibility has been damaged in
the fallout over its handling of Bulger and his criminal sidekick
Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi, Freeh said he didn't think the the
bureau's reputation had been ``indelibly'' harmed.
</P>
<P>
   He compared it to the taint which attached to the bureau after a
counterintelligence agent two years ago was discovered passing
secrets to Russian spies.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said the bureau was embarrassed by the espionage of
Special Agent Earl Pitts, who pleaded guilty to passing secrets to
the KGB, but not ``irrevocably'' damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh pointed out that no one yet knows if the alleged
wrongdoing of agents who handled high-level informants like Bulger
and Flemmi will result in the dismissal of extortion and
racketeering charges brought against Bulger, Flemmi, reputed new
England Mafia boss Francis P. ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme and
several associates in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After holding months of hearings lasting most of last year, US
District Judge Mark L. Wolf has yet to rule on defense motions to
dismiss the charges and suppress evidence. Flemmi says the charges
should be dismissed because he and Bulger were given permission to
commit crimes in exchange for information they gave the FBI on the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Freeh said, the FBI is revising its policies on
handling criminal informants.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh stressed that the kind of wrongdoing Connolly and others
are alleged to have engaged in _ turning their backs on crimes
committed by informants, tipping them off to investigations,
exchanging gifts _ is neither ``representative or symptomatic'' of
the way the bureau's 29,000 employees operate.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he is concerned about losing the faith of the
public. Responding to relentless questions about the Bulger case
during the 20-minute news conference, Freeh said Bulger may be
added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when a panel in Washington
meets next week.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, he said, would be given ``due consideration.'' Freeh
said that finding Bulger, who has been on the run since his Jan. 4,
1995 indictment, is a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he demurred when asked why that has not translated into a
higher profile for the 69-year-old Bulger. He acknowledged that the
Boston FBI has proposed Bulger for the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   After at first saying that he is not on the committee that
chooses the Top 10, Freeh admitted he does in fact carry some
weight with the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to 1950, the 10 Most Wanted list has led to the
capture of many a criminal, often with the public's help.
</P>
<P>
   An important consideration in putting fugitives on the list _
and one that works in Bulger's favor _ is whether the publicity
would enhance his chances of being captured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may in fact put him on the Top 10 list,'' Freeh said later.
``He's as important as anyone on our Top 10 list.''

COLORADO MAN LINKED TO CULT RETURNS `PARENT OF YEAR AWARD' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo., N.C.) 
 
By EVAN MOORE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1999 ``Parent of the Year Award,'' an honor created by
Congress in 1994, has been bestowed on a Colorado man with
connections to a cult that once prostituted its female members as
``happy hookers for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the National Parents Day Foundation, which chooses the
annual winner, has been found to have ties to the Rev. Sun Myung
Moon and his Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the recipient's past involvement with the
Children of God led him to return the award, Gary Jarmin, spokesman
for the foundation, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The award is given in conjunction with National Parents Day, the
fourth Sunday of July, and was created by a resolution sponsored by
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. It was signed
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This year's recipient was Zack Prendergast of Longmont, Colo.,
who, with his wife, Naomi, operates a nonprofit group called
``Family Services.''
</P>
<P>
   Former members of the Children of God said Prendergast and his
wife are members of the group, which was started in California by
David Berg in the 1960s. The group eventually spread worldwide
after Berg fled tax evasion charges in the United States and led
his followers out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They became infamous when, in addition to prostituting female
members, they were linked to child pornography in South America.
</P>
<P>
   The group has since changed its name to ``The Family'' and a
number of its adherents have returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Prendergasts did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmin, however, said his organization was unaware of the
Prendergast's affiliation with the Children of God when the award
was given. He said Prendergast sent a letter Wednesday declining
the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that there seems to be some definite
misunderstandings and distortions in what we've heard and can
assure you that these criticisms are unfounded,'' the Prendergasts
wrote to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple did not deny membership in the Children of God,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the information we received on them to
indicate that they were involved in anything like that,'' Jarmin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we don't ask about religious affiliation. The award
is based on the environment they provide for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prendergasts have 12 children, three of whom they said were
adopted in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Former members of the Children of God identified Pendergast as a
leader who operated a ``Victor Camp'' in Italy in the 1980s. The
camps were indoctrination sites for children.
</P>
<P>
   The Parents Day Foundation shares office space with the American
Constitution Committee, another group with ties to Moon, and is
headed by Robert Grant, former head of the now-defunct American
Freedom Coalition, created by Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Jarmin said the apparent connections with Moon were
coincidental, but conceded that the bulk of the foundation's funds
came from Moon-supported organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to have the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 award was not the first given to parents with
questionable backgrounds. In 1994, the foundation handed a state
award to a North Carolina woman who had previously been convicted
of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope this won't reflect on the other, worthy people
who've received this award in the past,'' Jarmin said.

CLINTON TRIES TO EASE CRITICISM OVER WIFE'S MAGAZINE INTERVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Wednesday that his wife was
not making ``excuses for what was inexusable'' when she partly
attributed his marital infidelities to the abuse he suffered as a
child.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public comments since Hillary Rodham Clinton's
interview in Talk magazine became the talk of this town, the
president said his childhood had not been ``a bed of roses'' but he
had ``no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, which hit newsstands this week, sent White House
aides scurrying to clarify just what Mrs. Clinton meant when she
said her husband had been ``scarred by abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's comments may have been intended to address and
put to rest questions she is likely to face about her husband as
she weighs a run for the US Senate from New York. But the Talk
interview instead triggered a new wave of speculation about the
couple's marriage and her possible motives in linking her husband's
misbehavior, in part, to his wounded psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The president, responding to reporters' questions in the White
House Rose Garden, said the first lady's comments were open to
interpretation. ``You can draw a thousand conclusions, but I think
there are two conclusions that anyone would have to draw, amid all
the differences they might have in the way they read the piece,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is that my wife is an extraordinary person with a
passionate commitment to public service and a genuine record of
important achievement. And the second is that we love each other
very, very much. And I think those are the two important things,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his childhood had ``really tough
moments,'' he said, ``I always knew I was loved. And I think that's
important for all of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady told the magazine that Clinton had been scarred
by abuse when he was 4 years old because of a tumultuous
relationship between his mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he has his weaknesses,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Yes, he
needs to be more responsible, more disciplined, but it is
remarkable given his background that he turned out to be the kind
of person he is, capable of such leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said, ``A psychologist once told me that for a boy
being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst
possible situation,'' adding, ``There is always a desire to please
each one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. ``Mack'' McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff and
boyhood friend, said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Little
Rock that he had not read the magazine article but ``in general''
understood what Mrs. Clinton was saying.
</P>
<P>
   McLarty said he was not aware of any abuse the president may
have suffered. ``I know the president has a great amount of love
and respect for his grandmother, and his mother was a tremendous
influence on him,'' McLarty said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the conflict between the president's
mother and grandmother was hardly a secret and was detailed in
Virginia Kelly's autobiography, ``Leading With My Heart,''
published after her death in 1994 from breast cancer at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Kelly recounted her difficulties. She was married
four times and widowed three times; her first husband died at age
22 when she was six months pregnant. She said she battled a
verbally abusive mother who had ``nightly screaming fits.'' She
said her mother regularly accused her father of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Garden, the president said his wife clearly never
meant to suggest that his upbringing somehow excused his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and
think that she was making any excuses for me. I haven't made any
excuses for what was inexcusable, and neither has she, believe
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as to my childhood, everybody knows that's looked into it
I didn't have a bed of roses as a kid,'' he said. ``But I can tell
you this, as I think about other children in the world and in our
country that have difficulties growing up, I am convinced from my
own life and from my research and from my experience with other
children, the most important thing is that every child needs to
know growing up that he or she is the most important person in the
world to someone. And I knew that. And I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, traveling Wednesday in Jamestown, N.Y., declined
to expand on her comments. ``This is an issue that the country has
put behind us and I have as well,'' she said. ``I've said all I'm
going to say on that.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, add: ``Everybody is responsible for their
behavior and I am a very strong proponent and believer in personal
responsibility, so I hope that people will take that message away
from this.''

 &HT;    Campaign collectibles convention just the ticket for history
buffs
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's a pop quiz: Who was Hannibal Hamlin?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Abraham Lincoln's first vice president, elected in 1860,
then dumped from the ticket in 1864. Odds are that you failed that
quiz. But there's at least one place in Atlanta where they'd get it
right: the biennial meeting of the American Political Items
Collectors organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Robison of Atlanta walked into the meeting Wednesday with a
faded silk Lincoln-Hamlin campaign ribbon, and it took only seconds
for experts to put a price tag on it: $2,500, minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' said Robison, who found it in an old Bible he
inherited years ago from his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was used as a bookmark. My grandfather probably got it from
his father, who would have been living then.''
</P>
<P>
   Robison isn't a member of the political collectors group, but he
was the first of thousands of Atlantans who are expected to flock
to the downtown Sheraton Atlanta in the next few days to have their
political artifacts appraised and possibly sold _ or just to gawk.
</P>
<P>
   The APIC's convention starts in earnest today. Hundreds of
history buffs from around the world will display thousands of
pieces of political memorabilia, from campaign buttons worth two
bits on up to items valued at $50,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most valuable will be campaign buttons from the
unsuccessful 1920 presidential campaign of Democrat James M. Cox,
who ran with Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go up to $100,000,'' said Ed Gillette, a lawyer from
Kansas City, Mo. ``The Cox-Roosevelt buttons are the rarest of the
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Auctions will be held through Saturday, and collectors will
appraise and make offers to walk-ins like Robison. At least two
congressmen, Reps. Jim Rogan (R-Calif.) and Virgil Goode (D-Va.),
are expected, as is former President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   As workers set up scores of long tables on Wednesday, APIC
officers proudly pointed to displays just taken from boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that frame sits 250 grand,'' said Gillette, pointing to
Atlantan Chris Olmstead's collection of campaign buttons
</P>
<P>
   and ribbons. The frame included a campaign pin from Theodore
Roosevelt's unsuccessful run for president as the nominee of the
Bull Moose party in 1912 and buttons for presidential candidate
Charles Evans Hughes, who lost to Woodrow Wilson in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Other political items on display include an autographed copy of
a book by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., souvenirs issued for
George Washington's inauguration, a ribbon from a Macon rally at
which Jefferson Davis spoke in 1887 and a Teddy Roosevelt button
reading ``My Hat's in the Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are important because you can pick up a lot of
what's happened in the past,'' said Chris Hearn of Washington, the
group's incoming president. ``Your past is what you are. Our goal
in APIC is to provide as much information about American political
history as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a tall order, said Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids recognize Joe Camel, but not many would recognize the
current vice president,'' he said. ``Like jazz, the banjo, what we
have here is truly American.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Krapf, a Savannah lawyer and chairman of the convention,
specializes in items with Georgia history. He proudly pointed to
original photographs _ not copies _ of Confederate Vice President
Alexander Stephens of Georgia and Georgia's Civil War Gov. Joseph
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal favorite is a ribbon to promote the candidacy of
William Henry Harrison, worn at the National Whig Convention in
1840 by a delegate from Augusta, (Ga.),'' he said, pointing to the
relic, which he valued in the ``low four figures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it in a cotton factory's ledger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most APIC members spend a lot of time scouring garage and estate
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible what you can find out there,'' said
Krapf, whose collection extends from 1789 political items up to
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Stark, of Boston, sat on a table beside two of his prized
possessions, 1840 ceramic water pitchers bearing the images of
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. The images look alike because
the English makers didn't know one from the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these things have been lost,'' Stark observed. ``Stop
and think how many things you throw out over the years. A lot of
people make a wonderful living picking through trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who go to such shows just get lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``One fellow walked in at a show once and had a box of fishing
tackle full of campaign buttons,'' said Krapf. ``He had been
looking for money to pay his mortgage, and it turned out the
buttons brought about $28,000.''

 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Jacquelyn Woods was on the telephone, as usual, with
her friend Efrain Casas one evening last January, and she could
hear Efrain and his high school buddy Eduardo Rivera playing with
two semiautomatic pistols owned by Efrain's father.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were laughing and pointing the guns at each other, and
pulling the triggers. It was a game to see who could fire the
fastest. She heard Efrain say, ``Eddie, are you ready?'' and count
``One, two, three.'' There was a loud gunshot. After that, silence.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, it turned out, pulled their triggers simultaneously,
and unknown to them, even though they had taken the magazines out
to examine them, the guns had rounds in the chambers.
Fifteen-year-old Efrain was shot through the head and killed.
Eduardo, 16, was shot through the neck, severing his spinal column.
</P>
<P>
   Now, paralyzed from the neck down, Eduardo, has been charged
with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't prosecute this kid, it would send the wrong
message,'' the assistant district attorney in charge of the case,
Steven V. Licata, said Wednesday after a preliminary hearing in
Children's Court.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was recessed after two hours because Eduardo,
slumped in a reclining wheelchair, was in too much discomfort to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A human life was taken,'' Licata said, ``and there is a lesson
to be learned about kids playing around with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Licata said his office normally charges the juvenile who pulls
the trigger in accidental shootings in which two young people are
playing with a gun and one is killed. He said the government has
already shown compassion for Eduardo's special plight by agreeing
not to try him in adult criminal court, where he would face a more
severe sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Shellow, Eduardo's lawyer, said prosecuting him ``is
ghoulish, the criminal justice system gone mad. It's like
convicting a dead person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shellow, who has taken the case for free, says she will
argue that the boys were simply playing and did not know that the
guns were loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to charge a kid with homicide, to provide
accountability,'' Ms. Shellow said, ``so we don't have to look at
what guns do in America and what role adults play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Hargarten, director of the Firearm Injury Center at
the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, said he believes the
case is an example of a little-known phenomenon in which roughly 5
percent to 10 percent of shootings listed by the police as
homicides are actually accidental deaths, frequently involving
adolescents who did not know that a gun was loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult issue for law enforcement, for district
attorneys and for medical examiners and coroners investigating
these cases,'' said Hargarten, who is a professor of emergency
medicine. ``But from a public health perspective, to classify these
shootings as homicides and cast the blame entirely on the people
who pull the trigger does not address the question of how can we
reduce the number of these shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be more punishment of adults who allow children
access to firearms or who won guns that are involved in accidental
shootings, Hargarten added, and gun manufacturers should be
required to incorporate more safety devices to prevent accidental
shootings. These would include several devices already available on
some handguns, such as trigger safety locks, load indicators to
show if there is a bullet in the gun and safeties that prevent
firing a gun if the magazine has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the last year for which data are available, more than
34,000 Americans were killed with firearms, including 14,300
homicides, about 18,100 suicides and more than 1,100 unintentional
shootings, the Journal of the American Medical Association reports.
Of the accidental deaths, 23 percent occurred because the person
firing the gun did not know it was loaded, a report by the General
Accounting Office found.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of many gun makers to incorporate safety features in
pistols that would help prevent accidental shootings is a main
issue in lawsuits filed in recent months by 23 cities and counties
against the gun industry. The suits seek damages to recover the
costs of gun violence for additional police and hospital care, and
changes in gun design and marketing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday it took Eduardo's mother, Yolanda Rivera, three hours
to get him ready for the court appearance. She dressed him neatly
in a tan shirt and loose khaki pants.
</P>
<P>
   Before the January shooting, Eduardo had been in trouble with
the law only once. Last fall he was convicted in Children's Court
of joy riding and was sentenced to one year of probation. Judge
Thomas R. Cooper warned Eduardo that under a new Wisconsin law he
was prohibited for life from possessing a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction, and the ban on possessing a gun, figured in the
decision to prosecute Eduardo in the shooting, Licata said.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 5, 1999, Eduardo and several other
friends had gathered at Efrain's apartment, police reports show.
Tony Schmalfelt, a 16-year-old who was there, told the police that
Eduardo and Efrain opened a plastic case where Efrain's father kept
the two .22-caliber pistols, and the two boys each pulled back the
slide on their gun to check if they were loaded. The clips, or
magazines, were not in the guns, Tony recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Efrain and Eddie, they would pull the triggers and the
guns would click while they were pointing the guns at each other,''
Tony told the police.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the other friends left, but Efrain remained on
the phone with Jacqueline Woods. ``They were laughing and
giggling,'' Ms. Woods told the police, and she could hear someone
pull the trigger and the sound of a click. After that, one boy said
jokingly, ``I got you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo was lying on a bed and Efrain was standing at the foot
of the bed, no more than three or four feet away. Precisely what
happened next, and how bullets got into the guns, is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Scott Lange reported that he interviewed Eduardo the
next morning in a hospital intensive care ward and Eduardo told him
that the two boys had each loaded a gun, and Efrain had said,
``Let's see who can draw and cock the gun fastest.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, however, after Eduardo was arrested in the
hospital and read his rights, he told another detective that the
boys had checked the guns by pulling the slides back and believed
they were unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, after the two boys fired at the same time,
Eduardo was left helpless on the bed for five hours, until his
father, also Efrain Casas, returned from his job at the Milwaukee
city garage at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woods had stayed on the phone for a time and had heard
Eduardo say, ``Call 911,'' but his voice was faint and she thought
it was a prank.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against Efrain Casas' father, also
Efrain, whose guns were used in the shootings. Lawyers for the
defense said the elder Casas quit his job and they have not been
able to locate him.

 &HT;    Man removed from Delta flight to Turkey remains in custody
 &HT;    By Julie Bryant and Ralph Ellis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Turkish man remained in the custody of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service on Wednesday for an expired
visa after he was yanked from a plane bound for Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified as 35-year-old Hakan Caglar, was removed
from Delta Air Lines Flight 40 on Tuesday evening at Hartsfield
International Airport following what FBI officials said were a
series of suspicious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Caglar applied for a business visa in February and arrived in
the United States on March 7. The visa expired June 6, according to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He overstayed and that's the primary reason that we are
holding him right now,'' said Thomas Fisher, district director for
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has not accused Caglar of committing a crime or planning
to commit one.
</P>
<P>
   Valdosta police Detective W.R. Schulenberg said Caglar, a
Turkish national, arrived at the airport just before the 11:50 a.m.
flight to Atlanta, went inside and bought the one-way ticket with
cash, then returned to the rental van and got his luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The van had been rented on Monday in Naples, Fla., and was
supposed to be returned to Naples by 5 p.m. Tuesday. Caglar was not
the person who rented the van, Schulenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the ASA ticket counter became suspicious and called
Valdosta police, who then notified the Valdosta office of the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI stands firmly behind its decision yesterday to remove
Mr. Caglar from Delta Flight 40. A series of circumstances led us
to believe that removal of Mr. Caglar was justified,'' the FBI said
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Celestine Armstead said Wednesday that Caglar
was being held in the DeKalb County Jail as the FBI continues to
investigate. ``Obviously there are a lot of unanswered questions
and we're trying to fill in the blanks,'' Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents also searched the rental van, but found nothing unusual,
Schulenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Five adult passengers sitting in Caglar's row on the plane also
were detained, but later released. Delta officials issued a formal
apology to passengers for the inconvenience.
</P>

   Upon the plane's arrival in Istanbul, Turkish authorities
questioned the same five passengers, along with a child, the
semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported. The six Turkish
citizens, who included one woman, were all released without charge
after about five hours of questioning, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-up, same-day purchase of one-way Delta tickets from
Valdosta to Istanbul would have cost about $1,000, according to a
Delta Web site.

TRAVEL AGENTS EXPRESS ANGER ON INTERNET-ONLY PLANE FARES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Va.)   By EDWIN McDOWELL

<P>
   Travel agents reacted with anger and disappointment Wednesday to
the latest airline offers of additional discounts on tickets booked
over the carriers' World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how the airlines dance around it, this is an attempt
to put travel agents out of business,'' John Hawks, president of
the Association of Retail Travel Agents in Lexington, Ky., said of
the latest round of discount offers. Hawks added that he expected
Congress to take a critical look at Internet-only fare offers when
it returns to the topic of airline passenger rights, possibly later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria, Va., also
opposes Internet-only fares. ``All fares should be available to all
travelers,'' said Dina Long, a spokeswoman for the association.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they are doing what every business tries to do _
lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to put anybody out of business,'' said Dave
Swierenga, the economist for the Air Transport Association, the
industry trade group. ``But now we have a new technology that
bypasses a big part of the labor component of writing tickets, and
obviously that's hard for agents to deal with. This is simply a
rational business decision in a world that's changing, and travel
agents need to recognize that the ticket-writing function can now
be done more simply by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That new technology is the Internet, which allows passengers to
buy tickets directly, without having to go through travel agents,
who book about 80 percent of airline tickets, or reservations
agents. Travel agents can match fares loaded into the computerized
reservations systems as well as most fares posted on an airline's
Web site, but special low fares for last-minute weekend travel are
usually made available only to an airline's e-mail subscribers,
while other bargain fares are increasingly found only on the Web
sites of airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines offer Internet-only fares in hopes of persuading more
passengers to book electronically because it saves the carriers
money. ``It costs Delta up to 400 percent more to book and deliver
a ticket using the traditional processes,'' Vince Caminiti, a Delta
executive, said in a speech to a business travel association in
Minneapolis last month.
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry's ticket commission costs fell to $5.2
billion in 1998 from a high of $7.6 billion in 1993, mainly because
in 1995 the carriers succeeded in scrapping the traditional 10
percent agent's commission and imposing a maximum $50 fee for each
transaction. Over all, commission rates fell to 6.3 percent this
June from 10 percent in June 1994. To help pick up the slack,
travel agents have increased their sales of cruises and land
excursions, package tours and hotel rooms. Many also charge
customers a fee for such once-free services as rewriting tickets
and planning itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Northwest Airlines reduced leisure fares by as much
as 25 percent for travel between next month and December. Most
other airlines quickly matched Northwest, including Delta Air
Lines. Then on Tuesday, Delta offered an additional 10 percent off
the sale fares for passengers who book their tickets on the Delta
Web site. Other airlines matched those reductions as well. Unlike
an unsuccessful attempt by Delta last January to charge $2 for each
round-trip flight not booked on its Internet site, this week's
Internet moves appear likely to succeed. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are very brave at doing such things when we're in
a robust economy,'' Hawks said. ``But if there's any business
that's cyclical, it's airlines, and when the downturn comes, as it
will, travel agents will remember how they were treated.''

MEDIA MERGER SKIDS TO A HALT WITH UNCERTAINTY OVER CZECH TV
STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LADKA BAUEROVA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ When Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. signed a merger agreement with SBS Broadcasting SA in March,
the partners hoped to become one of the most powerful media
networks in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has since become entangled in a dispute that
could result in the loss of its only money-making asset, a greatly
popular television station in the Czech Republic called TV Nova.
And now, the merger is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Established in the early 1990s by the cosmetics heir Ronald S.
Lauder, Central European Media is a Bahamas-based broadcasting
company that has been operating in the post-Communist lands of
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But after the company lost $125 million last year, the third
consecutive money-losing year, Lauder struck a deal to merge the
business with SBS Broadcasting, a Luxembourg-based media company,
for $615 million in stock, payable to current Central European
Media shareholders. Lauder would retain a 6 percent stake in the
combined company.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of SBS and Central European Media would create a
broadcaster with 18 TV and 12 radio stations estimated to reach 150
million people in 13 countries, mainly in Scandinavia, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and the East European countries.
</P>
<P>
   But within weeks of the announcement, things started to go awry.
On April 19, Fred Klinkhammer, Central European Media's president,
dismissed the general director of TV Nova, Vladimir Zelezny, for
what Klinkhammer called an accumulation of evidence that Zelezny
had been cheating and stealing from the company. Zelezny denied the
accusation and mounted a stunning counterattack _ seizure of TV
Nova's broadcasting license.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny contends that he controls the license through his 60
percent share in the license holding company CET 21. That company,
in turn, was formed jointly by Zelezny and Central European Media's
Czech subsidiary, Ceska Nezavisla Televizni Spolecnost, in 1994.
The dispute is now in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a license for one TV broadcaster might ordinarily
not be considered a deal breaker. But TV Nova is no ordinary
broadcaster. Under Zelezny's guidance, it has become one of the
most commercially successful media enterprises in the former Soviet
bloc, scrapping its original intellectual programming in favor of a
formula that ranges from schlock comedies to sensationalist news
and dubbed reruns of ``Baywatch.''
</P>
<P>
   TV Nova's most popular program is the 10 p.m. variation on TV
weather reporting, ``Pocasicko'' (A Little Weather), a reverse
striptease in which a naked male or female model dresses according
to the next day's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over who controls TV Nova's license has driven down
Central European Media's share price to $6.35 from a high of around
$30 last year, and has become the main source of doubts about the
company's merger with SBS Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Both prospective partners have rejected speculation that the
deal will collapse. ``Nothing has changed in this deal yet,''
Klinkhammer said. The two companies are working closely, he said,
sharing staff and technical expertise. ``So although we are not
married yet, we are dating a lot, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others outside the companies are pessimistic. ``Nova is the only
operation they have that's making any money,'' said Jake Waters, a
London-based independent media analyst. ``If C.E.M. people don't
win their legal battle, I'm sure SBS will want to renegotiate the
deal. I can't see that they would go with the original conditions.`
</P>
<P>
   Last year, TV Nova earned $55 million, securing 75 percent of
Czech advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   After Central European Media's falling-out with Zelezny, Moody's
Investors Service lowered the company's debt rating to a
speculative grade, Caa-1, and warned investors that the rating
might be reviewed again with the ``direction uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny said he was confident he would prevail and was
determined to make TV Nova thrive. ``I can do without them,'' he
said, referring to Central European Media and SBS, during a recent
interview in his makeshift office attached to several half-finished
broadcasting studios on the outskirts of Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Central European Media officials said Zelezny had been dismissed
after they discovered that he had been using the company's Czech
subsidiary to guarantee debts and had provided free or inexpensive
advertising time to favored clients, including a mineral-water
company he is said to have owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just stole from this company in a number of very deceitful
and clever ways,'' Klinkhammer asserted.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Central European Media filed a lawsuit with the
International Chamber of Commerce's Court of Arbitration in Paris
in an effort to prove it was the rightful license holder for TV
Nova. It also sued in the Czech courts to get the license back.
</P>
<P>
   The company won a preliminary victory on July 14 when the
regional commercial court in Prague froze Zelezny's property until
the dispute was resolved. But Zelezny is still holding the TV Nova
license unless the courts determine that he does not own it.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the freezing of his property an ``irrelevant decision,''
Zelezny has continued to behave as though TV Nova belongs to him.
Every Saturday at lunchtime, he broadcasts his own live program
from his studio. The program, titled ``Call the Director,'' is 30
minutes of Zelezny's unrestrained editorial comment on topics
ranging from the country's politics to his own dispute with Central
European Media.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Central European Media appear to have no
strong card up their sleeve. ``What's best for our shareholders is
to put aside whatever personal differences we may have over his
dismissal and deal with this on behalf of our shareholders,''
Klinkhammer said. ``So it is my continuous hope and belief that
there will be a resolution to this. I just don't know what it will
be.''

ANALYSIS: ADMINISTRATION FEARS CHINA-TAIWAN DISPUTE COULD
ESCALATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As is often the case in disputes between China and
Taiwan, the United States finds itself in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides pour verbal scorn on each other and as military
tensions remain high, the Clinton administration is trying to steer
a delicate course, signaling to Beijing its commitment to the ``one
China'' policy that Taiwan is rejecting while reassuring Taiwan
that arms sales will continue.
</P>
<P>
   This time _ unlike during the last crisis, in 1996, which
brought China and the United States closer to confrontation than at
any time since the Eisenhower era _ the Chinese have not fired
ballistic missiles towards Taiwan and Washington has not dispatched
aircraft carriers to the region.
</P>
<P>
   But as Chinese and Taiwan fighter jets fly perilously close to
each other over the narrow waters of the Taiwan Strait, the
administration is fearful that the volatile situation could get out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a military clash comes as the administration's
policy of engagement with China is under pressure and as the White
House grows increasingly fretful that its China policy may blow up
just at the start of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And in Congress, Taiwan's stalwarts are proposing more military
assistance, a move that the administration believes would further
inflame the situation.
</P>
<P>
   With all these competing forces, the administration is finding
it difficult to soothe feelings between two stubborn sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate time, even a potentially dangerous
time,'' said Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Kurt Campbell on
Wednesday. ``It behooves us to move very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his comments to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
as it discussed legislation proposed by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., that would expand the military
provisions of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. This law is the basis
of Washington's mandate to provide for the defense of Taiwan
without entering a formal alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more ominously, another official expressed doubts about
the effectiveness of Washington's diplomacy since the crisis arose
when the Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui announced he was abandoning
the ``one China'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Washington has sent at least six urgent
messages in the last three days to Beijing and Taipei demanding
they reduce their provocative air sorties, said the official,
Stanley Roth, the assistant secretary of state for Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But he told the Senate panel: ``We do not know if our warnings
not to engage in military activity will work. The risk of
escalation remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has kept up the pressure with military maneuvers that
appear to be a combination of muscle-flexing and psychological
games. Last Saturday, the Chinese seized a Taiwan cargo ship off
the Chinese coast and followed up with the test launching, albeit
expected, of a new long-range rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday the administration notified Congress that it would
go ahead with a planned sale to Taiwan of early-warning radar
aircraft and spare parts for F-16 fighter jets. The notification
was obligatory under the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act. But the
Chinese made sure that Washington knew the announcement did not go
unnoticed: the Foreign Ministry in Beijing called in a senior U.S.
diplomat to protest.
</P>
<P>
   From the administration's point of view, the current crisis,
unlike one in 1995, came out of the blue. And this time, the White
House has appeared more ambivalent in its support of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the administration was aware of the risk it was
taking in antagonizing China when President Clinton reversed
previous policy and issued a visa to allow Lee to visit his alma
mater, Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the White House was apparently caught unawares when
Lee, eager to bolster the flagging electoral fortunes of his
possible successor, told a German reporter that his government
would henceforth deal with China only on a ``state to state''
basis.
</P>
<P>
   To Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, this
statement came dangerously close to a declaration of independence.
A fundamental axiom of China's policy is that it would use force if
Taiwan declared independence.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, as the 2000 presidential campaign gets
under way, China could easily become a hot issue, something that
Vice President Al Gore could do without but which foreign policy
experts advising Texas Gov. George W. Bush are debating.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, supports
the Clinton administration's policy of a ``strategic partnership''
with China. But Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican
nomination, considers China a ``strategic competitor,'' not a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy experts in both parties have not forgotten
that in 1992, Bush's father, President George Bush, went ahead with
the sale of F-16s to Taiwan. Since the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis,
the Clinton administration has acknowledged that it has broadened
its military ties with Taiwan and is considering including Taiwan
in a regional missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop it may not be easy, administration
officials admit, to calm the eruptions in the
Beijing-Washington-Taipei axis.

 CORDOBA, Argentia: Brazil's devaluation.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lately, Fiat and the other foreign auto companies here have been
forced o sell some of their export models in Brazil at or below
production costs just to keep their plants running. Meanwhile,
Argentine auto dealers have been forced to cut retail prices
sharply by as much as 30 percent on some models. Ford recently
decided to drastically downsize a planned modernization of its
plant outside Buenos Aires to produce a medium-sized car named
Focus from its original $320 million upgrade to a more modest $70
million program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long-term problem, with the industry facing the
prospect of restructuring over the next three to five years,'' said
Luis Fernando Katz, the head of economic studies at the Association
of Automotive Manufacturers, the local auto trade group. ``There is
the prospect for transferring assembly lines to Brazil and
diminishing production in Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Top auto executives say they were not likely to abandon any time
soon the $5 billion investment they made in new plants,
modernizations and worker training over the last seven years.
Nevertheless, the introduction of new models has been delayed, and
Fiat and Volkswagen AG have already transferred production of some
models to Brazil, where costs are lower. And some analysts believe
the relatively small operations that DaimlerChrysler &UR;  &LR; AG and the
Toyota Motor Corp. have in Argentina could be in jeopardy if the
recession here is prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Production, sales and earnings for all seven foreign auto
companies in Argentina have been disappointing this year. Revenues
generated by Ford declined more than 40 percent in the January-June
period _ to $530 million from nearly $1 billion during the first
six months of 1998. And the Fiat plant that is capable of turning
out 550 cars a day has slowed its daily production to a mere 130
cars this month despite a new government program subsidizing
trade-ins of old cars for credit to buy new models.
</P>
<P>
   The auto companies have laid off some workers, but they are
mostly suspending shifts for weeks at a time, paying workers 50
percent to 75 percent of their salaries. Workers say they are able
to make up their lost factory income by finding part-time work
during the shift suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation could easily change for the worse, labor
leaders say, especially if the companies get serious about shifting
more and more production to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the men are taking pills to sleep,'' said Jose
Campellone, the 60-year-old leader of the autoworkers union in
Cordoba, ``but the workers are definitely anguished about the
future.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS NEED WILLIAMS TO PLAY LEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams glides though a baseball season,
moving so quietly that you sometimes forget he's even there.
Occasionally, he isn't, at least not in the manner the New York
Yankees prefer at their most famous position, look at me, center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks go by, and while Williams is hitting for average, driving
in runs, making plays and being a truly harmonious presence as he
tunes his guitar at his corner dressing stall, there is an element
of impact that is conspicuously and undeniably absent.
</P>
<P>
   He is Allan Houston scoring 22 points when the opportunity
exists for 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't look like he's giving you the energy that other
people do, but you can see the intensity when he comes into the
dugout,'' Joe Torre said, with a nice diplomatic touch. ``He has
some feeble at-bats, but he'll come back in the third or fourth
at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an appropriate day for Torre to reduce the thought to the
microcosm of one game. For assorted reasons, not the least of which
was the prospect of losing a third straight series, Wednesday's 8-3
victory over Toronto came packaged as that rare regular-season
game, excluding those against the Mets, when the owner's breath can
be felt on the back of all Yankee necks. Williams responded with
his 16th and 17th home runs, with five runs batted in, and nobody
broke a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of the team that began the day with the best
winning percentage in New York, Chuck Knoblauch led off the game
with a home run, as the Mets' Rickey Henderson so often has.
Williams soon after muscled up against Kelvim Escobar for a
three-run homer, in the mercurial manner of Mike Piazza. Then
Hideki Irabu gave Torre seven strong innings, prompting the manager
to call Irabu a bulldog, the nickname Orel Hershiser has been going
by for years.
</P>
<P>
   Torre admitted that he has followed the Mets' stirring progress,
and you can be sure that George from Tampa has been dying to check
in with sports talk radio on the subject of who owns New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets don't, and may never, but it has been hard not to
notice how much more potent their lineup has looked the last few
weeks. While the Yankees are in no danger of facing anything more
than a run for the American League's best record, too often they
have given off the impression that if Derek Jeter can't win them a
close game, they're just not going to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill is having an acceptable season. Tino Martinez, who
struck out three times Wednesday, is not. Against playoff
competition, it sure looks as if the Yankees will need Williams to
put his stamp on games, to step away from his clubhouse corner, as
he did Wednesday, to the center of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' Williams said of his rare power surge.
``It was a great day. I had two good pitches to hit and was able to
put good swings on them.''
</P>
<P>
   He is hitting almost .340 and has 71 RBI and while these numbers
certainly project to an estimable season, few people around the
Yankees would argue that Williams has been a $12 million-a-year
player. As much as we hate justifying an athlete's worth against
his contract, expectations for Williams have not just been raised
by the $87 million he got after begging the Yankees to not make him
play for Boston. It's a contextual appraisal as well.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the Yankees' stock rose faster than America
Online's, Williams' tranquil efficiency was so much easier to
applaud. This time, with less magic all over the field, the Yankees
may not win unless they get more from their established stars.
</P>
<P>
   Williams understands how his personal stakes have changed,
confiding to people that he could have used a few days off after
hurting his left shoulder in Florida last June. This, he's said, is
not the season for him to miss games, the way he has since he
became the fixture in center. Williams has been around here long
enough to know that George Steinbrenner, raised in Woody Hayes
country on Big Ten football, is watching to make sure he's getting
his full money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing through it,'' said Williams. ``There's no way I
was going to put that out as an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   He says this so softly, with so little passion, that it almost
sounds like an act. But Williams is the only Yankee to have played
in all 106 games. He is playing hurt and playing well, with his
trademark grace and skill, but still somehow leaving people with
the idea that the Yankee cleanup hitter and center fielder could do
more. Come October, these Yankees look like they will need more.

BRAZILIAN STEELMAKER TO ACQUIRE AMERISTEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Gerdau SA, one of Brazil's biggest
steelmakers, moved to expand its manufacturing operations into the
United States Wednesday with a deal to acquire control of
Ameristeel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau said it would purchase a 75 percent stake in the company,
which is held by Kyoei Steel Ltd. of Japan, which would give Gerdau
a pan-American production network extending from Canada to Chile.
The deal for Ameristeel also would mean that nearly half of
Gerdau's revenue would come from outside Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau is a leader among Brazilian companies that are expanding
abroad to insulate themselves from the uncertainties that have
buffeted Latin America's biggest economy. ``This is a smart move by
Gerdau because it shields them from the volatility in their home
region,'' said Mauricio Reveco, who covers Latin American steel
companies at Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The process is expected to be completed within 60 days. Terms of
the acquisition were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of a controlling stake in closely held
Ameristeel, which has 2,100 employees, four manufacturing sites and
estimated annual sales of $600 million, Gerdau reinforces its
position as a leading maker of steel for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, Gerdau, based in the southern city of Porto
Alegre, has acquired steel mills in Uruguay and Argentina, as well
as in Canada and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau's purchase also touched off speculation about the future
of the Brazilian steel industry, which has been hurt by Brazil's
economic slowdown in the aftermath of a currency devaluation crisis
in January. There have been predictions of a consolidation among
steelmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau, considered among the healthiest, has been mentioned as
the most likely candidate to take over Companhia Siderurgica
Nacional, or CSN, the country's largest steel company. Since the
devaluation of the Brazilian real, CSN has had difficulties
servicing its substantial foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerdau's acquisition of Ameristeel throws the assumption
that it could also buy CSN into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be highly unlikely for Gerdau to make a move now on
CSN,'' said Daniel Altman, a Latin American steel analyst with Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York. ``Ameristeel should be a significant
investment for them, although we still don't know how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason why analysts now believe that CSN could be sold
to a foreign concern such as Thyssen Krupp Stahl AG of Germany or
Arbed SA of Luxembourg, which have shown interest in the company,
is that Gerdau is in a substantially different business than CSN.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau produces ``long'' steel, used in the construction of
buildings or to produce heavy machinery like food harvesters, while
CSN makes ``flat'' steel, used in products like refrigerators or
cars.
</P>
<P>
   (The same distinction is what excludes Gerdau from an agreement
reached last month between the governments of the United States and
Brazil to avoid punitive tariffs on Brazilian steel imports. The
agreement, which established a quota system for the next five
years, applied to flat steel producers like CSN.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking to CSN, and the major shareholders in CSN,
but we're not swimming in money,'' Osvaldo Schirmer, Gerdau's
financial director, said in a telephone interview from Tampa, Fla.,
where Ameristeel is based.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, CSN shares advanced on news of the Ameristeel
acquisition, reflecting speculation that it could be next. Its
American Depository Receipts rose 5.4 percent to $45 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Gerdau's ADRs rose 3.1 percent to $16.875.
</P>
<P>
   Gerdau, which negotiated with Kyoei on the transaction without
hiring an investment bank as an adviser, said it planned to pay for
the acquisition with a combination of resources on hand and money
borrowed internationally.

 &HT;    Adding windows to a prison
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine you are imprisoned in a room with only one
window. And imagine you are given the chance to have one more
window that would afford you any view you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   What would you most like to look at every day?
</P>
<P>
   For Kyla Green, who is just shy of her sixth birthday, the
answer was simple: more windows.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of what someone in that situation would want, she drew
a red seven-story building with two windows on each floor _ 14 in
all. An elevator inside the door, she explained, takes people to
any floor so they can find more windows to look through.
</P>
<P>
   Why did she draw that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's three people living there, and they have no
window,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three people are CARE Australia workers Steve Pratt, Peter
Wallace and Branko Jelen. And Kyla's picture may soon adorn the
one-window cell in Belgrade in which the three are imprisoned for
having allegedly tried to take secret information out of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt and Wallace, both Australians, were detained March 31, a
week after NATO forces began bombing Yugoslavia. Jelen, a Yugoslav
staff member, was arrested later in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The three were found not guilty of espionage but were convicted
of passing secret information to a foreign organization _ namely
CARE.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pratt's sentence of 12 years in prison was lowered
to eight; Wallace's four-year term was cut to one; and Jelen's term
was reduced from six years to three. CARE maintains the three men
are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The three will decide soon whether to apply to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic for clemency, said Peter Bell,
president of Atlanta-based CARE USA. In the meantime, they have
been imprisoned for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Children of CARE USA staffers in the metro area are trying to
lift the spirits of the three men. The children were asked to draw
pictures in response to this question: If you were in a room with
only one window that let in daylight, and you could draw another
window, what would you like to see out of it?
</P>
<P>
   The men are receiving visits from the Australian diplomats, CARE
staff members and family members _ including Pratt's wife, Samira,
who is pregnant. The pictures will be delivered to the cell, 15
feet square, in which the men live.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Sicay-Perrow, who is 5, drew a volcano with a lake on top
of it. More than that, having heard the story from his mother,
Rosemary, who works in CARE's publications department, he
spontaneously organized his whole camp troop to draw pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Kyla, an indefatigable artist, drew and drew _ a leprechaun
finding a pot of gold, people watching a movie with Cokes and
candy, people flying through a tie-dye sky.
</P>
<P>
   Marquese Gabriel, 13, drew hills topped by a setting sun and
birds flying free.
</P>
<P>
   And Mickey Williams, who is 10, drew something men in prison
might really like to see _ someone from outer space arriving to
right the world's wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to bring peace on Earth,'' the alien says. On his
clipboard he has a to-do list: ``1. Stop fighting. 2. Stop hunger.
3. Stop poorness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an alien, and he came to make the world a better place,''
Mickey said.

 &HT;    At Georgia State, Taiwanese-Chinese ties being forged
 &HT;    By Julie Bryant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over the din of classroom chatter at Georgia State
University, Victor Wang hears something different in the
conversations between Asian students.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same difference he notices when he calls a meeting as
president of the Chinese Student Association, an organization made
up mostly of Taiwanese students.
</P>
<P>
   Students from mainland China and Taiwan are talking to each
other more. His group and the Chinese Student Scholars Friendship
Association, which is made up mostly of students from mainland
China, are participating in school functions together.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups traditionally divided by their political views are
making hesitant steps toward understanding each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this year we have joined together in student events,''
said Wang, who left Taiwan six years ago to pursue a Ph.D. at
Georgia State. ``It's great. I feel we can really share a lot and
see that our ethnic groups are so similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wang hopes the two sparring governments in his homeland will
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, tensions escalated between Taiwan and China.
China sent a warning to the U.S. Congress against backing any move
by Taiwan toward independence, saying Beijing is ready to pay ``any
price'' to defend China's claim to the island.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's announcement last
month that his country of 22 million would negotiate with China
only on a state-to-state level, the metro area's Asian community is
watching the unfolding events carefully.
</P>
<P>
   For now, political talk among students is kept to a minimum. The
words ``state-to-state negotiations'' seldom come up in
conversation. The subject of Taiwan is a sensitive one.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's announcement has been viewed largely as a renewed attempt
by Taiwan to gain independence from China. China has retaliated,
sending veiled threats to the tiny island in the form of missile
tests and harassing Taiwanese shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State students from mainland China shake their heads
over Taiwan's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old issue,'' said Xiaohui Wang, a graduate student who
was born in Shanghai. ``It's already agreed that they are part of
China. Now all of a sudden they make this statement that they want
to be isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese in Atlanta say their country is not plotting a break
from China, but attempting to preserve what they have worked for _
a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't speak up, who will speak for us?'' asked Alice
Wang, director of Atlanta's Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working so hard to be involved in the United
Nations and the World Health Organization and the World Trade
Organization. It's nonpolitical; it's for the circulation of
medical information. We are not allowed to be in these
organizations. It doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1949, when the Chinese civil war divided Taiwan and China,
their internal differences have grown. While the People's Republic
of China remains a Communist country, Taiwan has embraced
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently reaffirmed the nation's ``one-China''
stance, agreeing to negotiations with only one country.
</P>
<P>
   That stance has backed Taiwan into a corner, Alice Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Taiwan is already independent, said Victor Wang.
Taiwanese are separated from China by their economy, their society,
even their sports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those differences are not likely to be officially recognized
any time soon by China or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S.-Chinese relations only recently recuperating from the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, a nod in
Taiwan's direction could shatter already fragile negotiations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Taiwan to fend for itself, barring an all-out war
with China. In 1979, the United States committed itself to Taiwan's
defense to prevent reunification by force.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by China over continued U.S. military sales to
Taiwan, Clinton administration officials worried Wednesday that the
situation could worsen, possibly dragging the United States into
the conflict. Both Taiwan and China have increased military flights
over the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four voices now,'' said Victor Wang, who stays in
touch with his parents and four siblings in Taiwan and watches
Taiwanese Internet sites closely.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who want Taiwan's government to gradually unify
with China, those who want to unify right now, those who want to
gradually become more independent, and those who want independence
at any cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way would be gradual integration,'' said Alice Wang.
``But for our survival and further development, we cannot be
suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any advantage to becoming part of China unless
they change,'' she said. ``At least they should show us their good
will and stop squeezing us. We don't want independence, we want
further development and survival.

   DEBT-BUYBACK (Washington) _ The Clinton administration moves to
take advantage of projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling
the way the government handles its finances. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers says the government will change its strategy for
handling the $3.6 billion it owes to the public in the form of
Treasury bonds and other securities. Rather than simply retiring
Treasury securities when they mature, the government would have the
option of repurchasing some of the debt from investors before it
comes due. The Treasury would then replace a portion of the
repurchased debt with new securities that carry lower interest
payments and save money for the taxpayers. By Richard W. Stevenson.

reached the highest court in a state. In March 1998, a California

 &HT;    BellSouth tied at top in telephone ranking
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. on Wednesday tied for the top spot in
the national ranking of local phone companies by J.D. Power and
Associates, the fourth consecutive time that it has taken
first-place honors.
</P>
<P>
   Outpacing 11 other companies were BellSouth, which had stood
solo at the top for three years, and Southern New England
Telephone, which serves Connecticut and is permitted to offer
long-distance service _ a right still forbidden to BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Using several benchmarks, J.D. Power computed an industry
average of 100, with the two winners scoring a 115. Next closest
was Cincinnati Bell with 110, PacBell at 105 and Bell Atlantic with
104.
</P>
<P>
   With BellSouth facing increasing competition, those results were
heartening, so long as they don't make the company complacent, said
Chairman and Chief Executive F. Duane Ackerman. ``Having been there
and done that, we have to focus on tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will tout the award in its ads, including many that
thank employees who deal daily with customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is facing an increased challenge to its dominance of
the residential market on its nine-state turf. Also, an array of
competitors is battling BellSouth for the more lucrative business
customers. In holding its ground, customer satisfaction counts,
Ackerman said. ``It may not be the only factor, but it will be a
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's victory comes amid a national trend of customer
disatisfaction with confusing bills, new charges and questionable
service, according to Kirk Parsons, director of telecommuncations
accounts for J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   Some fees have been added by regulators, as the industry
gradually moves toward full-blown competition in local service _ a
time when confusion about choices and charges may increase, he
said. ``People see changes for the worse, and they are blaming the
local phone company. More change is coming, people sense it and
they are apprehensive. It's nothing BellSouth is doing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   SNET's corporate parent, SBC Communications, finished fourth
from the bottom with a grade of 94, but ahead of U S West and
Sprint. By contrast to Sprint's poor performance in local service,
the company was ranked at the top for long-distance customers
spending more than $50 a month. SNET won in the under-$50-a-month
category.

NORWAY WHALE HUNTERS BATTLE ACTIVISTS AND THE MARKETPLACE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ Norway's 175 or so whale hunters say they have
had a tough season at sea, with choppy water camouflaging their
prey and anti-whaling protests marked by gunfire and boat
collisions. But their biggest problem, some concede, may be the low
consumption of whale meat by their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Norway defied the International Whaling
Commission and resumed its commercial hunt in 1993, the number of
minke whales killed was lower than that of the year before. The
final tally, announced on Tuesday, was 589 _ 36 fewer than last
year and 164 short of the limit set by the Norwegian authorities.
For many whaling crews the season effectively ended on July 1, when
processing facilities announced that they would take no more whale
meat. Supermarkets in Oslo and other cities had trouble persuading
shoppers to pay up to $10 per pound for the dark, oily meat that in
previous decades was popular as a relatively inexpensive substitute
for beef.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Greenpeace environmentalists carried out their most
combative campaign against Norwegian whaling in five years. But
they paid the price with broken bones, 13 arrests, the forfeiture
of several small craft and about $40,000 in fines imposed by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   A Greenpeace spokesman said the weak domestic market was a sign
that the industry is obsolete. Norwegian whalers, however, used it
as grounds to step up their demand to export meat to other
whale-eating countries, like Japan and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of an international backlash, the Norwegian authorities
have so far prohibited the export of whale products, but have tried
through diplomacy to pave the way for such a move. Their argument
is based on the whaling commission's estimates that the world's
minke whale stock exceeds 900,000. The whales can grow to more than
30 feet long and weigh up to 11 tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day Norway opens for export of whale meat there will be
very many countries that want to buy it,'' said Jan Kristiansen,
leader of the whalers' association.
</P>
<P>
   A Greenpeace spokesman, Frode Preym, said his organization's
complaint has nothing to do with the minke whale's numbers or the
notion that whales are intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making the rational argument that Norway's defiance of
international agreements could tempt other nations to follow
suit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan hunts whales for what it calls research purposes. A
variety of aboriginal groups _ including the American Indian Makah
tribe _ have received dispensation to conduct small-scale
traditional hunts. But only Norway has resumed commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   Protests have been low-key in recent years, but this season
Greenpeace sent two ships and a half-dozen semi-inflatable
motorboats to whaling sites in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian coast guard sent its own flotilla to enforce a
security zone around the whalers. A coast guard patrol boat and a
smaller Greenpeace vessel collided near the Villduen whaling vessel
in June, sending an activist to the hospital with a broken arm,
broken pelvis, broken fingers and internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, when a Greenpeace semi-inflatable craft carrying a
member of Parliament came between a harpooned whale and the Kato
whaling vessel, three gunshots rang out. The Kato's skipper, Ole
Mindor Myklebust, said in a mobile telephone interview from sea
that he fired his high-caliber rifle in the direction of the whale,
which he said was showing signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that a bullet punctured a pontoon on the Greenpeace
vessel but declined to comment on whether he had aimed one of his
shots there, as Greenpeace insisted a videotape shows. No one was
hurt on the Greenpeace vessel.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to comment on the protesters' accusation that
he tossed an unspent bullet into their listing boat while shouting,
``Have a souvenir!''
</P>
<P>
   The coast guard, which was also present, took no action against
Myklebust. But it arrested the activists on harassment charges and
towed the Greenpeace mother ship, Sirius, into port, where its
support craft were confiscated.

 &HT;    Review shows how prosperity turns into failure
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber entered the 1970s with a
seven-decade record of growth. But, says Harvard Business Review
(August), the tire industry changed overnight when a French
company, Michelin, introduced the radial tire to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough design, the radial tire was safer and more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone's response was quick but not effective, since the
company clung to old ways of working even while investing in new
products.
</P>
<P>
   That, says the prestigious business journal, is what led to the
demise of Firestone and many other successful companies _ the
reluctance of management to give up ``tried and true'' ways of
doing business even when the market changes drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fresh thinking that led to a company's success is often
replaced by a rigid devotion to the status quo,'' says author
Donald N. Sull of the London Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Sull gives these examples of the kinds of thinking he sees at
companies suffering from fatal inertia: ``We know our competitors
inside out.'' ``We have a very stable top-management team.'' ``Our
top priority is keeping our existing customers happy.'' ``If it
ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Got a light, mister?
</P>
<P>
   The more that anti-smoking zealots and plaintiff attorneys
horsewhip Philip Morris, the more determined the company gets _ and
the more it dominates the market _ says Forbes (Aug. 9).
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco accounted for 68 percent of the company's $15.4 billion
in operating income last year, and 35 percent of the tobacco
profits were made in the United States by Philip Morris USA despite
years of fending off anti-smoking legislation and tort verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes describes Philip Morris as ``one fearsome company,'' and
a ``brand bully'' much like Anheuser-Busch and Microsoft.
``Unrepentant and determined, Philip Morris fights for every inch
of shelf space and every point of market share,'' says Forbes.
``And it's winning this battle, even as it loses the legal
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Business Week's mea culpa
</P>
<P>
   If you invested in the stocks spotlighted last year by the
Business Week (Aug. 9) ``Inside Wall Street'' column, you did well
early on but less and less well the longer you kept the stock. This
comes from the magazine, which admits the performance of the 183
stocks featured in the column was ``disappointing'' but ``not
surprising'' given last year's market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   On the day they were announced, the stock picks posted an
average gain of 4.9 percent, vs. 0.3 percent for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500. The column's picks were still ahead a month later, 3.8
percent vs. the S&AMP;P's 2.7 percent. Then they slipped, declining an
average of 0.1 percent after three months vs. a 6.3 percent gain by
the S&AMP;P, and falling 2.2 percent after six months to the S&AMP;P's 11.2
percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   As for now, ``preliminary indications for 1999 so far are that
the column is beating the averages,'' says Business Week, which
promises to publish the results at this time next year.

CUBAN WORLD RECORD HOLDER SOTOMAYOR TESTS POSITIVE FOR COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest casualty in the sports war against drugs is one of
the biggest names in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American Games officials in Winnipeg, Canada, announced
Wednesday that Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, the only person ever to
have high jumped 8 feet, had tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sotomayor won the high jump at 7-6 1/2 and became the
first track and field athlete to win the same event in four
consecutive quadrennial Pan American Games. That victory will now
be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of track and field's world governing body, the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, call for a two-year
suspension. That would put Sotomayor out of this month's world
championships in Seville, Spain, and next year's Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Suspensions must normally be made by an athlete's national
federation. Primo Nebiolo of Italy, the IAAF president, said if the
Cubans did not suspend Sotomayor, the IAAF would.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught Cuban officials denied that Sotomayor had taken
cocaine. They said someone must have planted it in something he ate
or drank, and they are expected to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra, director of the Orthopedic
Complex of Cuba, said, ``He has told us he has not taken this
substance, and we believe his word.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans said they had not taken special precautions to
protect their athletes from sabotaged food and drink. As Mario
Granbda, the team's chief doctor, said, ``We are simply eating what
the rest of the athletes are eating.''
</P>
<P>
   The major drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee
and sports federations involve illegal bodybuilding substances,
such as anabolic steroids. Recreational drugs, including cocaine,
are also banned, although penalties for using them have sometimes
been lighter.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mario Vasquez Rana of Mexico, the president of the Pan
American Sports Organization, said its rules treat
performance-enhancing and recreational drugs alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us,'' he said, ``it is sanctioned as an infraction.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Eduardo de Rose, the games' medical chief,
said Sotomayor's urine sample showed 200 parts of cocaine per
million. De Rose said that would be consistent with someone who
used the drug. He said the cocaine was probably taken four or five
days before the postcompetition test.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than that,'' de Rose said, ``we would not find it. When
we find traces of cocaine, it shows the ingestion was very
recent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor has held the world outdoor record for almost 11 years,
clearing 7-11 1/2 in 1988, 8 feet in 1989 and 8-0 1/2 in 1993. He
also holds the world indoor record of 7-11 1/2, set in 1989. He won
gold in the 1992 Olympics, and he has won two world outdoor titles
and four indoors.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 4 inches and 176 pounds, he is slim and quick. He is a
skilled technician who approaches the high jump bar with a fast,
head-on approach rather than the curved approach used by most other
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor is the most celebrated track and field athlete to fail
a drug test since Ben Johnson of Canada at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
Johnson's world-record victory in the 100 meters was wiped out when
a urine test showed the presence of stanozolol, an anabolic
steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the IAAF suspended Linford Christie of
Britain, the 1992 Olympic 100-meter champion, saying a drug test
from an indoor meet in February showed the presence of the steroid
nandrolone. Christie, semiretired at 39, said he was completely
innocent and would fight the charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dennis Mitchell, the United States 100-meter
champion, was banned by the IAAF for two years for an excessive
level of testosterone, a natural hormone also available
artificially. He had been exonerated by USA Track and Field, the
American governing body, and the IAAF Council will hear his appeal
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor was the third athlete (and third gold medalist) to
test positive for drugs at the Pan American Games. The others were
Juana Rosario Arrendel of the Dominican Republic in the women's
high jump and Steve Vezina, the goalie for Canada's inline roller
hockey team. Rosario Arrendel lost her gold medal, as did the
entire roller hockey team.

HIDEKI IRABU, THE GOAT OF SPRING, EVOLVES INTO BOY WONDER OF
SUMMER

(DW) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The evolution of Hideki Irabu from an uncaring and
often puzzling pitcher to a devoted and usually reliable pitcher
continued at Yankee Stadium Wednesday. The once valid questions
about Irabu's desire, his consistency and his pedigree for starting
games in the post-season drift farther away every time he does what
he did in an 8-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu fought, he battled, he scraped and, eventually, he
succeeded. There were at-bats when Irabu could have folded and let
the Blue Jays creep closer. But he kept throwing powerful fastballs
and sweeping curveballs, and he refused to relent. This was the new
Irabu, although he is really not new any longer _ he has been
pitching this way for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Chuck Knoblauch opened the Yankees' half of the
first inning with a home run for the third time in six games, and
that later in the inning Bernie Williams followed with the first of
his two homers and three of his five runs batted in to give Irabu a
4-0 cushion. It helped that the lead swelled to 6-2 after three
innings, and that Irabu gave up just one run in a fiasco of a
fourth and then stopped the Jays through the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubts about his ability and his stuff,''
Williams said of Irabu. ``He's right up there with the best in the
game, and is showing that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The feelings of invincibility that sometime circulate around the
Yankees because of last season should not fool anyone. This was a
crucial August game, because the talented Blue Jays are threatening
to stage an actual race in the American League East _ they began
the day just five games behind the Yankees. Even Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, called the Jays ``legitimate contenders not only
for the wild card, but for the division.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was up to Irabu to calm the growing edginess in Yankeeland
and make sure that the first-place Yankees would travel to Seattle
Wednesday night feeling safer. Irabu gave up three runs, struck out
eight batters and walked none in seven innings to improve to 8-0
with a 3.11 earned run average in his last 12 starts and to boost
the Yankees' lead over Toronto to six games.
</P>
<P>
   He is 9-3 with a 3.89 e.r.a. this season, and has been more
consistent than Roger Clemens, David Cone, Andy Pettitte or Orlando
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a little sense that he belongs,'' Cone said. ``He's
been our best pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees battered Kelvim Escobar for five runs in the
first two innings, Irabu felt more comfortable. He was comfortable
enough to hit Shannon Stewart with a pitch, with two outs and none
on in the third, after Derek Jeter had been hit in the left elbow
by Escobar. It seemed obvious that Irabu was retaliating, and it
cost him when the next batter, Tony Batista, homered to make the
score 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had a difficult fourth in which two-out singles by Darrin
Fletcher and Jacob Brumfield sliced the score to 6-3 and left two
runners on base. The Yankees were probably one hit away from
calling the bullpen, but Irabu blew Homer Bush away with a 2-2
fastball. He retired 9 of the last 11 batters he faced to send the
Jays to their eighth loss in nine games against New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the one bad inning, but the wheels didn't come off,''
Torre said. ``He kept it together. You can see that grit in him
where he just hitches up the belt and goes after people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Williams, Cone and Torre called Irabu the Yanks' finest
starter, Irabu was cautious. There is still a mysterious quality
about Irabu, and he is rarely forthcoming in interviews. Irabu said
he had been helped by being allowed to throw as many as 120
pitches, and he dismissed any desire for vindication after being
criticized by George Steinbrenner before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a six-month season,'' Irabu said through a
translator. ``It's not something that shows what you can do in one
or two weeks. It takes time. So there is no way to answer criticism
over such a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has combated the criticism by getting better, which starts
before he throws a pitch. After Irabu silenced Boston, 13-3, last
Friday, he ran laps around Fenway Park early Saturday morning in a
routine out of Clemens' Cy Young handbook. &QL;

 &HT;    Wanted: Entry-level pilots
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Years of record pilot hiring by big airlines has
lowered the talent pool, forcing smaller carriers to use new means
of finding qualified aviators.
</P>
<P>
   Help wanted ads, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines, the Atlanta-based subsidiary of
Delta Air Lines, this week ran a classified ad for pilots in The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, right alongside ads for aircraft
cabin cleaners and fuelers.
</P>
<P>
   AmericanEagle, a subsidiary of American Airlines, recently ran
an ad in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen ads for pilots like that in a long time,''
said Kit Darby, president of AIR Inc., an Atlanta-based pilot
career counseling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot hiring has set records for five straight years. This year
will be no exception, with an expected 15,000 jobs filled,
according to Darby's firm. A run of good times for the industry,
coupled with a wave of pilot retirements at big airlines, is
driving the hiring boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have eaten pretty deeply into our pilot supply, although
there's still no lack of people who want to be pilots,'' Darby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines can still pick and choose from among backlogs of
experienced applicants, and even smaller carriers hire only one of
four interviewees, Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   But to ensure a large pool of applicants, smaller carriers are
casting a wider net.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advertising, they're trimming minimum experience
requirements and, in some cases, scrapping the practice of making
new hires pay for their own initial training.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is most pronounced at regional carriers like ASA,
which constantly lose experienced pilots to major airlines that
offer better pay and benefits. Regionals must not only recruit
replacements but also find enough new pilots to fuel their own
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there's more competition for the available pool of
pilots out there,'' ASA spokesman Sam Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the decision to run classified ads, saying it's
merely ``another way'' of finding applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still quite selective, but you don't want to limit the
scope of your recruiting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said ASA also has established recruitment programs with
Purdue University and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.
Students can get specialized training and be hired with less flight
time than is required of other applicants.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, regional carriers typically demanded that
applicants have at least 1,500 total hours and 500 multiengine
hours. Now they typically demand 1,000 to 1,200 total hours and 100
multiengine hours, Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   He added the average new hire at a carrier of ASA's size still
has about 3,000 hours, well over the minimum. The average new hire
at a major carrier, such as Delta, American or United, has 4,000 to
5,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ASA's ad seeks applicants with at least 1,200 total hours and
200 multiengine hours. As an incentive to those with more
experience, it also promises company-funded initial training to new
hires with 1,500 total and 500 multiengine hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's a change for ASA, which has been among carriers that
require newly hired pilots to buy their own initial training from a
contractor. The training usually costs around $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Darby said only 10 airlines still require pilots to foot the
bill, down from 25 airlines three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe the lower requirements are a safety concern,
noting they remain far above the 250 hours required by the Federal
Aviation Administration for a commercial pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome, he said, is the heavy turnover at some small
carriers. Darby said attrition rates are between 25 percent and 50
percent a year at some smaller carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business wants high turnover,'' he said. ``To grow and lose
experienced people at the same time is difficult.'' He added the
tightening labor market is forcing some smaller carriers to boost
pay and benefits and giving unions more clout.
</P>
<P>
   Watts wouldn't disclose ASA's attrition rate but said it's
relatively low. He said the airline, which has about 850 pilots,
hired 200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ASA's unionized pilots ratified a new contract last year that
pays them between $17,400 and $71,700, depending on experience,
rank and aircraft flown. By contrast, Delta pilots make between
$33,400 and $209,300 in base pay under their current contract.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring boom has had other effects on the makeup of the
airline pilot population, according to Darby.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of today's new hires have civilian rather than
military training, he said, up from only about 30 percent a decade
ago. ``There's a fixed number of military pilots to draw from, so
when a hiring push develops, the percentage of civilian pilots is
going to go up,'' Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian-trained pilots hired by airlines tend to be younger
than their military counterparts, but they also have more flight
time under their belts, since military flying is limited to set
hours.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of new pilots wear glasses or contact lenses,
up from only about 5 percent a decade ago. The trend has even
affected the way pilots look, as airlines loosen height and weight
restrictions that might eliminate good applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots today,'' said Darby, ``are shorter, taller and
fatter.''

IOWA JOURNAL TAKES ON THE NEW YORKER

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ It has always struck the people of this proud
old Iowa town as an awfully snooty remark.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1925 prospectus for The New Yorker, Harold Ross, the
magazine's founder, boasted that it would not be ``edited for the
old lady in Dubuque.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably all the old ladies who were in Dubuque in 1925 have
since passed from the scene, as has Ross. But the remark still
stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been sitting here seething for 75 years,'' David Rusk
said, not altogether in jest. ``And by golly, it was time to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusk is the editor of Julien's Journal, a monthly here, and in
the June and July issues he gave The New Yorker, and New York, a
taste of their own medicine, accusing New York of provincialism, at
least when it comes to a condescending view of Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dubuque area magazine has at long last come to the defense
of the community it serves, nose to nose, magazine to magazine,''
Rusk wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ross and The New Yorker,'' his article said, ``were actually
ill equipped to know the real Dubuque and, as a result, cast their
aspersion without sufficient grounds. They didn't know our
community then, and they don't know it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa likes to claim the highest literacy rate in the nation, and
its high school test scores are consistently at or near the top.
But Rusk complained that the ``old lady'' remark forever cast
Dubuque as ``the quintessential notion of provincial,
non-metropolitan Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Rusk's grievance, people at The New Yorker said they
had not known they had a battle on their hands. ``We wish all the
people in Dubuque well,'' said a spokeswoman, Perri Dorset.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone here is losing sleep over the
75-year-old slight. At 60, Betty Baule, a reference librarian, is
far from an old lady. But she plans to be one someday, and she
said: ``I love The New Yorker. A lot of people in Dubuque read the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, stereotypes run in both directions. ``I'm
sure there are people in Dubuque,'' she said, ``who have
stereotypical views of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rusk says he feels no great animosity toward New
York. He has friends and family there, and the Rusk Institute for
Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medical Center was
founded by a distant relative, Dr. Howard A. Rusk. (Another
relative was Dean Rusk, the secretary of state under presidents
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.)
</P>
<P>
   It's just that he wouldn't want to live there. ``Too much city,
too much humanity, too much crime, too much traffic, too much of
everything,'' he wrote. ``It costs too much to live well there.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that some people would regard Dubuque as too much
the opposite: too small, too contained, too provincial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, good for you,'' he wrote. ``Stay in New York and leave
us to our own. But do let us visit. And please visit us as well. We
can both do with a bit of broadening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Dubuque, an old Mississippi River town, and Julien's
Journal were named for a French explorer, Julien Dubuque, the
city's founder.
</P>
<P>
   These are good times for Dubuque, which has rebounded from the
disastrous '80s, when unemployment soared to nearly 15 percent and
housing values plummeted. In those days, the city relied heavily on
meatpacking and the manufacture of farm implements, and a downturn
in the agricultural sector brought big trouble for Dubuque as a
whole. Now the local economy is much more diversified, with much of
the job growth in computer programming, publishing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   With more jobs than workers, Dubuque civic and business leaders
have run a campaign in recent years to lure back young people. The
campaign, ``Come back to your future _ come home to Dubuque,'' has
succeeded in reaching some native sons and daughters who moved far
away when the economy here was a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters note that for a town of 60,000, Dubuque has a rich
plate of cultural offerings. The Mississippi River Museum is the
centerpiece of a $28 million riverfront project under construction
here, and the town also has the Heartland Ballet Company, the
Dubuque Symphony Orchestra and a theater group, the Barn Community
Players.
</P>
<P>
   All that may be small potatoes compared with New York, and Rusk
acknowledges that his own, 23-year-old magazine is certainly small
potatoes compared with the storied if financially struggling New
Yorker. Nonetheless, he likes where he's sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our magazine,'' he noted, ``is making money.''

<P>
   ACCRA, Ghana _ Until one of his residents was promoted a few
months ago at the cardiac center he founded here, Dr. Kwabena
Frimpong-Boateng was Ghana's only heart surgeon, the only man out
of 19 million citizens in this corner of West Africa who could
plunge into another's chest and heal.
</P>
<P>
   On a continent whose scientists and doctors often leave
permanently for the West, however, Frimpong-Boateng had already
distinguished himself by a simple act: coming home. In his late
20s, the doctor, a son of farmers, won a scholarship to Germany,
where he mastered cardiothoracic surgery at Hanover Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Then a decade later, in 1989, the doctor left Europe, its
comforts, the predictable arc of a surgeon's career, his
specialty's lucrative rewards, tossed all of that for a giant
question mark.
</P>
<P>
   This young country had never had an elected leader, only
successful coup plotters; it had never had a cardiac center, or a
surgeon determined to forge one out of nothing, and for a
$300-a-month salary.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Frimpong-Boateng, 49, is hard at work on expanding the
National Cardiothoracic Center here in the capital. The center's
reputation, as well as his own, has reached beyond Ghana's borders,
to countries like Sierra Leone, where there is not even a single
heart surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, letters mailed from other African countries land on
his desk and implore Frimpong-Boateng for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be poor, but the heart is the same everywhere,'' the
doctor said one recent morning as he returned to his office from an
inspection of the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   He held the blueprint of the expansion that, among other
improvements, will move patients from the current colonial-era
ward, which has one toilet for 35 patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in sub-Saharan standards,'' he said. ``I
believe we have international standards. Heart surgery is like an
airline. We're not a TWA or Pan Am with a large fleet, but the one
or two planes we have we must maintain at the same standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Frimpong-Boateng, Ghana would have sent a ``minister or a
key professor at the university'' overseas for heart surgery, said
Dr. Issaka Tinorgah, director of medical services in the Ministry
of Health. What would have happened to those not included in this
group, to those unable to travel on their own means, was better
left unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   For a developing country with limited resources _ Ghana spends
about $10 in health care a year per citizen, compared with a range
of $7 to $15 in West Africa _ deciding which medical services to
offer entailed difficult moral choices, Tinorgah said.
</P>
<P>
   As unseemly as it was to leave patients requiring heart surgery
untreated, the hard reality is that the vast majority of people
here died of everyday illnesses like malaria, respiratory
infections and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government focuses almost exclusively on
primary care; to Frimpong-Boateng, it gives a location, and pays
the utilities and most of his staff's salaries. But everything
else, Frimpong-Boateng has paid on his own by raising money through
his Heart Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Heart Foundation raised about $350,000 last year, mostly by
running ads on local radio and television, by focusing on a
particular group each month, cab drivers one month, small-business
owners the next. He created the center, he said matter-of-factly,
to treat the ordinary Ghanaian who would have died otherwise of
heart ailments. And so he viewed the foundation as a sort of social
contract with the poor and expected most of his funds to come in $1
or $2 donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, he's like a missionary,'' said Tinorgah,
who, asked whether Ghana would have a heart center today without
Frimpong-Boateng, answered simply: no.
</P>
<P>
   For the freedom he has enjoyed, Frimpong-Boateng has also
learned the diplomacy required of being the country's only heart
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This voice sounds very familiar,'' the surgeon recalled
thinking when he received a phone call a couple of years ago, and
then realized it was the country's longtime president, Jerry
Rawlings. ``Oh, I thought, my God, what have I done?'' A foreign
dignitary had suffered a heart attack here.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the center operating has also meant dealing delicately
with the politically connected. On a recent afternoon, two
relatives of an 85-year-old man _ a traditional chief in a region
where cocoa, Ghana's main export, was grown _ entered the doctor's
office. The old man needed a pacemaker, and the entire operation
would cost about $5,000. The relatives were clearly hoping that the
Heart Foundation would pick up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Frimpong-Boateng, on hearing that they had never donated to the
foundation, shook his finger at them. ``When you heard about the
Heart Foundation,'' he said, ``you thought it's far off. Now it's
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor noted the patient's age. Who knows how long he would
live with the pacemaker anyway? ``It's a moral question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say so,'' one of the relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the old chief lay on a bed in the doctor's
ward; his family had persuaded the local cocoa association to pay
for the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the 17 other patients there, however, most of his
patients are dependent on the foundation. On one bed lay a small
boy who had swallowed a metal pipe that had been lodged in his
chest for some time; his older sister had brought him here from the
bush and then disappeared. In the operating room was a woman badly
hurt in a car accident the night before; no one knew who she was.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor asked one of the nurses for some X-rays. When she
could not find them, he flung his stethoscope in her face.
``Sometimes I get so upset with the nurses I don't want to see them
for the rest of the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he smiled at his own impatience, a smile that conveyed
the belief that individual will would always triumph over personal
weakness, so long as the greater goal remained clear.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that on his first day at Hanover Medical School he
told his teachers that he had begun working toward his return to
Ghana; in fact, he had avoided going to the United States because
so many Ghanaian doctors had gone there and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   He feared America might prove too seductive. He had to return to
Ghana. Most of his five children were now away in Europe or the
United States. But the rest of his family was here, including his
aging mother, who had raised him after his father died just before
his birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also wanted to come back to be with her,'' he said. ``I grew
up with the woman, and I have never regretted it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow,'' he added, and it was not clear whether his words
meant mother or motherland, ``your presence alone is enough to make
a difference.''

JUDGE'S RULING REIGNITES NORTHWEST LOGGING WARS

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Five years after the Clinton administration hammered
out a landmark plan to settle legal and environmental disputes over
logging across the Pacific Northwest, the region's timber wars are
flaring up again.
</P>
<P>
   The same federal judge who once issued rulings to protect the
northern spotted owl has now blocked nine major logging deals and
threatened to stop dozens of others by declaring that federal
officials have failed to take proper steps to ensure that other
species are being protected as well.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with environmentalists and enraging the forest industry,
U.S. District Judge William Dwyer of Seattle ruled Monday that the
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management had
unlawfully neglected to conduct detailed wildlife surveys on
federal forest land, as required by the 1994 compact, before
approving contracts allowing logging of parcels in old-growth
forests west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon and
in northwestern California.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who in 1994 had released the land agencies from court
oversight by approving the so-called Northwest Forest Plan,
declared that the agencies' actions were ``arbitrary and contrary
to the plain language'' of that plan. Under pressure from
environmentalists and the logging industry, the Clinton
administration brokered that compromise allowing logging on about a
third of remaining federally owned old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling this week effectively put the land agencies back
under a degree of court jurisdiction until they can show they are
doing a better job of monitoring logging's effects on 77 animal and
plant species, including rodents, snails, salamanders, mollusks and
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the species are considered indicators of the overall
health of the old-growth forest ecosystem. Under terms of the 1994
plan, all were supposed to be intensively surveyed by the federal
agencies, which say they believe they have followed those terms.
But the environmentalists, in their suit, said the agencies had
failed to do complete surveys before granting logging permission.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling has the immediate effect of blocking logging
plans for about 100 million board feet of timber. But even more
broadly, the judge indicated that his court's approval would be
needed before new logging could occur under about 200 other deals
in the region. If upheld on appeal, after a likely challenge from
the industry, the ruling could significantly curtail logging in the
majority of contracts approved by the federal officials in the last
three years in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was hailed as a ``blockbuster victory'' by one of the
lawyers for the 13 environmental groups who joined forces in the
lawsuit. A spokesman for the timber industry said it was
``disappointed that the judge feels he knows the plan better than
the professionals in the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The forest service said it was still studying the ruling to
assess its impact. But Rex Holloway, a spokesman for the agency in
Portland, Ore., said the forest service believed it had correctly
followed the guidelines of the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is unclear whether the red tree vole, a small
rodent favored as food by the spotted owl, or the blue-gray
tail-dropper, a tiny snail, will acquire the emotional symbolism
that the owl brought to the fight over old-growth forests. Both are
among the species at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But it is certain that the fight is renewed, and that
environmentalists are again on the offensive, trying to move toward
a much broader ban on logging in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little old-growth left, there's no good place to
cut it anymore at all,'' Doug Heiken, western Oregon field
representative for the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``All of it should be protected for
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit, says that
only 10 percent of the region's old-growth forests are left, and
that about 30 percent of that area remains eligible for cutting
under the 1994 plan.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, meanwhile, says the judge's ruling imperils
hundreds of logging jobs and the local economy in some pockets of
the Northwest and many are pressing Congress to relax the survey
regulations. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has sponsored
legislation to relax some of the requirements of the environmental
surveys, making it easier for many of the timber deals to go
through, and the judge's ruling is likely to intensify the fight
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the region as a whole is far less dependent on logging
than it once was _ in Oregon, for example, the high-tech industry
is now a bigger source of jobs than forest-products companies. And
even in some places that were once deeply reliant on logging,
tourism built on the area's natural beauty is now a mainstay of the
economy, which leads at least some local business people to oppose
the logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messes up the area, big-time,'' said Tom Vuyovich, owner of
the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Ore., on the edge of the
Cascades, who said much of his clientele consists of tourists drawn
to the area's natural beauty and its many recreational
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them look around, there are clear-cuts visible all
around, and they say, `What happened here. Where are the trees?'
They want to know where the old growth is, and I can carefully
point them out to the last few spots that have been saved _ so
far.''

   GRAND-ILLUSION-FILM (New York) _ Frequently called one of the
``best films of all time,'' Jean Renoir's ``Grand Illusion'' (``La
Grande Illusion''), released in 1937, about people caught up in war
can be something of a surprise. Not that there is any particular
reason to dispute the ranking, but there is a simplicity, if that's
the word, and a kind of sprightly directness that can be startling
in a work deemed so towering. Or that is the impression one gets
from a strikingly vivid, newly subtitled restoration from Rialto
Films now playing in Manhattan. By Peter M. Nichols. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KAT-KINGS-THEATER (Cape Town, South Africa) _ There is still one
victim of apartheid that until now has remained unsung: doo-wop.
That is not meant facetiously. Normally, it might be offensive to
lightly link the AK-47 rattle of racial liberation with the
patent-leather tap of rhythms bopped out under a street lamp, but
``Kat and the Kings,'' the South African musical now in previews at
the Cort Theater on Broadway, where it is to open on Aug. 19, does
not trivialize the suffering of the people it portrays. It is, like
their lives, bittersweet. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOICES-THEATER (New York) _ Even last month's scorching heat
could not melt a major special effect of the new Broadway play
``Voices in the Dark.'' Still, when the thriller officially opens
on Thursday, at least one man will be as white-knuckled as the
heroine, played by Judith Ivey, who is menaced repeatedly in her
snowbound Adirondack retreat. For Greg Meeh, the action on the
Longacre stage begins and ends with the snow that has to fall
steadily for two hours of real time outside the cabin's picture
windows. ``I just hope it doesn't come down in clumps or stick to
the scrim,'' Meeh was saying recently, as he kicked around several
piles of the white stuff backstage. One thing was clear: the mounds
weren't turning into water. This ``snow'' is made of thin plastic
shavings. Meeh, who has orchestrated inclement weather for dozens
of Broadway productions, was the man behind the downpour in ``The
Lonesome West,'' the pea-soup fog in ``An Inspector Calls'' and the
violent typhoon of ``Geniuses.'' By Andrew Jacobs. (Moved). Photo.

main shapers of American musical taste in the second half of the
20th century. By David Schiff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCRIABIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ The slightly mad find their most
eloquent spokesmen in the ranks of the eminently sane. That, at
least, is the subtext of a remarkable new recording of Scriabin's

Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SCHOENBERG-MUSIC (Undated) _ Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' has arrived just in time to illuminate the music of Arnold
Schoenberg, the focus of the Bard Music Festival over the next two
weekends. For its 10th season, the festival at Bard College, in
Annandale-on Hudson, N.Y., is bringing all its accustomed
interdisciplinary tools to bear on a composer who, nearly 50 years

   ELEANOR-ANTIN-ART (Los Angeles) _ The movie marquee in the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art says, ``Now Showing: Eleanor Antin.''
Beneath it are a few stills of Ms. Antin's most famous roles, plus
a free-standing cutout of her in full ballerina regalia. If you
can't find Eleanor Antin in your movie guide, try the deadpan
dictionary, the feminist gazette, the lexicon of subversive notions
or, better still, the catalogue named after her by Howard N. Fox,
curator of ``Eleanor Antin,'' the first retrospective of 30 years
of this artist's work (through Aug. 23). By Vicki Goldberg.

<P>
   RICHARD-MEIER-ARCH (Paris) _ Architects who consider themselves
artists are understandably delighted when their work is featured in
museums, but Richard Meier, the designer of the Getty Center in Los
Angeles, has special reason to feel honored. The Musee du Jeu de
Paume in Paris has chosen Meier, an American, as the subject of its
first-ever architectural exhibition. And in doing so, it has set
out to reinforce the notion that architecture is art. ``Richard
Meier Architect,'' will be on show through Sept. 26. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).

<P>
   LAYLAH-ALI-ART (Undated) _ In Laylah Ali's cheery little
gouache-on-paper drawings, skinny characters with bulbous heads and
colorful uniforms trade hostilities in regimented ways that
resemble team sports. Both ``sides'' are frequently masked like
burglars. Perpetrators in one frame of her cartoon-strip-like works
are likely to be victims in the next. In a style as innocuous as
the Sunday funnies, they might be shown strung upside down,
whipped, shrouded, straitjacketed or impaled. No text bubbles
explain these ambiguous goings-on. Instead Ms. Ali, who is based in
Boston, and whose first solo museum show opens Saturday at the
Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, invites viewers to supply
narratives. By Ann Wilson Lloyd. (Moved).

 &HT;    United next taking on world
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Manchester United is not England's national team, no
matter how much the press corps has been waving the Union Jack. The
Premier League season begins Saturday, and United is favored for
the sixth time in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   But if the defending Premier League, F.A. Cup and European Cup
champions took that description to heart, they wouldn't have
increased their global presence with a recent playing and marketing
tour of Asia and Australia or burned up some of the goodwill they
earned at home after completing a triple-crown season.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the British government and the Football
Association, the club controversially is skipping the F.A. Cup,
saying that its presence in the first FIFA World Club Championship
in Brazil in January will aid England's 2006 World Cup bid. The
media blasted the decision, as did new British Sports Minister Kate
Hoey, who conveniently omitted her allegiance to United rival
Arsenal in her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, United didn't have to think long and hard, not with
the lure of international glory and the lucrative payoffs that come
with it. United management says it is trying to keep up with AC
Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Juventus in Italy, Bayern Munich in
Germany and Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, who purchase more
world-class players because of the greater television riches
available to them.
</P>
<P>
   But weep not for United, still the wealthiest sports club in the
world. In the coming months, United retail stores will open in
China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, including cafes and a
``virtual'' tour of the club's Old Trafford ground. ``We don't
envisage our stores as just places for selling merchandise,''
United deputy chairman Peter Kenyon recently told The Sunday
Telegraph of London. ``We see them as emotional headquarters.... to
make people part of Manchester United.''
</P>
<P>
   On the pitch, brilliant midfielder David Beckham is continuing
where he left off last year, while new goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has
a big task succeeding Peter Schmeichel. He was the only major move
for a club with talent, depth and spectacular resolve, along with
the crafty coaching of the newly knighted manager, Sir Alex
Ferguson. Those intangibles, rather than the sale of expensive new
replica shirts, reveal the true appeal of the Red Devils.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest threats: Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, who has
turned his corner of London's fashionable West End into a veritable
Little Italy-France-Norway-Holland-Romania-Uruguay, actually signed
an Englishman. Forward Chris Sutton, who fled relegated Blackburn
for a cool $16 million, could be the missing link for The Blues,
who haven't won a league crown since 1955. Vialli also added
ex-Juventus midfielder Didier Deschamps, the 1998 French World Cup
captain.... Arsenal's Nicolas Anelka, has made a $36.6 million move
to Real Madrid. Croatian World Cup star Davor Suker arrived from
the same Spanish club, and young striker Thierry Henry transferred
from Juventus for an Arsenal record $16 million. Manager Arsene
Wenger's biggest concerns are an aging backline and depth through
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   _ The dark horses: Leeds, which just missed a Champions' League
berth, has given up on keeping disgruntled Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink,
the top Premier League goal-scorer a year ago, and has offered him
to Atletico Madrid for $19.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Running in place: Liverpool has spent $40 million, but a
10-year trophy drought won't end anytime soon. Michael Owen will
miss the start of the season with a hamstring injury.... A ray of
hope at Newcastle, ridden with internal strife, could be young
playmaker Kieron Dyer, acquired for $11 million from first-division
Ipswich Town.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hopelessly mediocre: Derby County, Coventry City, Leicester
City, Middlesbrough, Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham and Wimbledon
are ensconced in the league, but that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relegation zone: Bradford City, in the top flight for the
first time since 1927, and Elton John's Watford club simply don't
have the resources to stick around. Sunderland has a chance, while
cash-strapped Everton and Southampton will have to battle to avoid
the drop again.
</P>
<P>
   France: Bordeaux wins
</P>
<P>
   Defending first-division champions Girondins Bordeaux won its
season-opener Friday by holding off Bastia 3-2. It got the clincher
from Lilian Laslandes in the 81st minute.... Olympique Lyon, which
went on a French-record spending spree of $42 million over the
summer, lost to Montpellier 2-1.... Favorite Olympique Marseille
got goals from Ibrahim Bakayoko and Christophe Dugarry in a 3-0
rout of Sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Free kicks
</P>
<P>
   Asian federations threatening to boycott the 2002 World Cup were
dealt a blow earlier this week when Malaysia decided not to
participate in the boycott. Some Asian delegates walked out of last
month's annual FIFA congress, upset that the continent was allotted
no more than two qualifying spots in addition to co-hosts Japan and
South Korea.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like a family that suddenly finds itself with
enough cash to pay off both its credit cards and its mortgage, the
Clinton administration moved on Wednesday to take advantage of
projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling the way the
government handles its finances.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the government would
change its strategy for handling the $3.6 trillion it owes to the
public in the form of Treasury bonds and other securities, seeking
to minimize its interest expenses.
</P>
<P>
   With the government already running a budget surplus when excess
Social Security revenues are included, the Treasury has been using
much of the extra money for the last two years to reduce the
national debt. The debt will decline by about $87 billion this
year, and if the surplus grows as projected over the next decade,
the pace of debt reduction could accelerate substantially.
</P>
<P>
   As with most issues involving the surplus, this one is caught up
in politics. President Clinton used the prospect of cost-efficient
debt reduction as an argument on Wednesday against the $792
billion, 10-year tax cut that the Republican-controlled Congress
plans to pass in final form this week despite the president's veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the administration's debt-reduction plan
would allow the Treasury to repurchase some of the existing
high-interest-rate debt from investors before it matures, and to
replace it with new securities that carry lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prepayments _ in many ways analogous to a homeowner
refinancing a mortgage or a company refinancing its debt _ would
hold out the prospect for reducing federal borrowing costs over
time,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Under its current policy, the government has simply been paying
off Treasury securities when they mature, regardless of their
interest rate, and issuing smaller amounts of new debt in their
place, an approach that limits its ability to swap low-cost debt
for higher-rate debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not bought back debt in any way since 1972,
and it has not repurchased debt for cash at least since World War
II and probably not in this century, Treasury officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the Treasury Department was still working out the
complex details of the plan, and analysts said it is unlikely to be
put into effect before next year. It would not require approval by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While arcane, the changes have substantial implications for the
bond markets, where the government and private companies compete to
borrow money. And they are the leading edge of what could be even
broader shifts in the nation's financial strategy as it confronts
the possibility of substantially reducing or even wiping out the
government debt held by the public over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government
will generate $2.9 trillion more in revenues over the next decade
than it needs to pay for its programs under current law. Of that,
$1.9 trillion is nominally earmarked for Social Security, but in
practice it is likely to go to reducing the debt held by the
public. The two parties are fighting over what to do with the other
$1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Treasury plan was a common-sense approach to
making the most of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely doing the right thing,'' said John
Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the debt plan could run into questions from some Republicans
because it would require that the government absorb some costs in
the short run _ in the form of the premium it would have to pay to
convince investors to sell their Treasury bonds _ in order to reap
the interest savings in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration did not say how big a debt
repurchase plan the Treasury Department might undertake, or even
when it might begin, analysts said the short-term costs could be
substantial enough to be a factor in the battle over the surplus,
since the Republicans are counting on as much as possible of it for
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much prefer to use that money for reductions in marginal
tax rates,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, an economist and former Reagan
administration official who is influential with conservatives in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But in an appearance in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday
afternoon, President Clinton argued that the Treasury's plan
``would, in effect, allow us to refinance old debt and pay it down
on the best terms possible, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in
the process,'' President Clinton said during an appearance in the
White House Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying down the debt creates wealth, creates jobs, creates
opportunity,'' he said. ``It's the right and responsible thing to
do, and we have the chance of a lifetime to do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To protests from Republicans, who say their budget plans do more
to reduce the national debt than his plan, Clinton has sought to
frame the current debate over the surplus as a choice between an
irresponsible Republican tax cut for the wealthy and a prudent
division of money between debt reduction, increased spending and
modest tax cuts for working people.
</P>
<P>
   The debt securities issued by the Treasury generally are not
callable _ that is, the government cannot demand that investors
sell them back. Instead, under the Treasury's new plan, the
government would announce that is interested in buying back a
particular bond issue, and then ask the investors who own it to
name a price. The Treasury would accept those offers that made
sense to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gensler, the undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic
finance, used the following example to illustrate how the debt plan
would work. In November 1991, the government sold a 30-year bond
carrying an interest rate of 8 percent. The bond currently trades
in the market at an interest rate of 6.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury could repurchase that bond, Gensler said, and
replace it with a combination of 30-year bonds, which currently
carry a rate of 6.16 percent, and 10-year bonds, which currently
trade at 5.95 percent, giving an average rate of around 6.07
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even tiny reductions in interest costs could
yield substantial savings to the government. Summers said on
Wednesday that for every three one-hundredths of a percentage point
in reduced interest rates on the total debt, the government
ultimately saves $1 billion a year in interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond just swapping high-rate debt for lower-rate debt,
Gensler said, the plan would increase the volume of new bonds being
issued by Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Because new bonds are more actively traded than older ones, and
can be more easily bought and sold, investors are willing to pay a
bit more for them, meaning their interest rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   It is that increase in the tradability of the bonds, and the
corresponding decrease in interest rates, that could bring the
biggest benefits to the taxpayer, Gensler said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the market for the bonds active is a major goal of the
plan, Gensler said, because as the national debt falls, the
Treasury is issuing fewer and fewer new bonds and other securities.
Over the last 12 months the Treasury had made 26 debt offerings, he
said; in the prior year the number was 39. On Wednesday Gensler
announced that Treasury would sell its 30-year bonds twice a year
from now on instead of three times.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the problem of keeping an active market in
government securities could become more acute if the national debt
eventually approaches zero. The market for U.S. securities is the
worldwide benchmark for safety and security in investments, and if
the market were to dry up it could make it more difficult to judge
the relative risks of various investments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Treasury would want to find a way to keep an
active market in government securities in case a war, a deep
recession or some other event led the government to need to borrow
a lot of money quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to figure out how you maintain an active market
if the Treasury's net borrowing needs are close to zero,'' said L.
Douglas Lee, an economist at HSBC Washington Analysis, an
investment firm.

IN FIELD OF ALL-STARS, WOODS STANDS TALL
</HEADLINE>
 12 ALL-STARS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oklahoma State coach Dick Halterman helped put together an
athletic squad of Big 12 women's basketball all-stars that will
play six games during a 10-day tour of Finland and Sweden,
beginning Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But from the first workout Monday in Dallas, one player
continually caught his eye _ Texas junior guard/forward Jo Ruth
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of kids on this team that individually can
make things happen,'' Halterman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jo Ruth has really been impressive. ... Last year, during
the season, she was a handful for us. But I've really appreciated
watching her here. She's so athletic and so talented. She has a lot
of range on her shots and she's almost impossible to guard
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, any time you can give her the ball and clear out the
floor, someone is going to go help on her or she's going to get a
pretty good shot. And she can guard you. The other thing that
catches your eye is that I don't think I've seen anyone play any
harder than she does.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a compliment, considering the group that Halterman
is taking overseas includes, among others, Oklahoma's Phylesha
Whaley, Iowa State's Megan Taylor, Kansas' Jaclyn Johnson, Texas
Tech's Melinda Schmucker, Texas A&AMP;M's Prissy Sharpe and Baylor's
Nicole Collins _ all of whom throw themselves into a full-court
game.
</P>
<P>
   OSU's Jennifer Crow and Devon Magness, Missouri's Tracy
Franklin, Nebraska's Cori McDill and Kansas State's Nicky Ramage
round out the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awhile since I've played against really great
players like this,'' Woods said. ``This (tour) is most definitely
going to be a great experience. We're going to try and come back
6-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods led Cedar Hill (Texas) to consecutive Class 4A state
championships. Two roller-coaster seasons at Texas have led coach
Jody Conradt and Texas fans to anticipate her being a more
consistently outstanding player this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns have four starters returning, including standout
Edwina Brown, who has been the leading scorer this summer on the
U.S. team at the Pan American Games. Though she started 16 games
last year, Woods isn't included on that list because toward the end
of the season, she developed into a spark off the bench. It's a
role she covets and hopes to reprise this season as Texas shoots
for another NCAA Tournament berth. But she might also be UT's best
defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in my defense, but I've been working
this summer on my ball handling and shooting,'' Woods said. ``This
season, I'm just going to play as hard as I can all the time. And
whatever happens, happens.'' nn

N.J. COURT RULES AGAINST BOY SCOUT BAN ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boy Scouts, which has become a contoversial
symbol in the debate over homosexual rights, suffered a court
defeat Wednesday that could transform the rules governing troops in
New England and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in which New Jersey's highest court unanimously
stuck down the Boy Scout policy banning gays from being members or
leaders in the organization, elicited a range of reactions both
nationally and locally.
</P>
<P>
   Having earlier refused to hear a California case in which the
scouts' ban was upheld, the US Supreme Court now could be prompted
to clarify the issue. An attorney for the Boy Scouts, George
Davidson, vowed to appeal to the high court, and said Wednesday's
decision gave the organization ``the first opportunity to go the US
Supreme Court and get a definitive ruling to put an end to these
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachussets, meanwhile, one troop master lambasted the
ruling as ``opening all kinds of dangerous doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But among advocates for gay rights and even some troop masters
themselves, the ruling served as a welcome sign the organization
may soon be forced to enter a new era of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Buseck, executive director of Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders, said it could have wide-reaching
implications in Massachusetts, where state law is nearly identical
to the New Jersey statute that bars discrimination at ``public
accommodations,'' and where at least one troop privately admitted
Wednesday it has a teenage member who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think it could have a huge impact here,''
Buseck said of the court decision, which, although handed down in
New Jersey, could have a broader effect because it comes from one
of the most respected state courts in the country. ``This is a
terrific victory. The decision was unanimous, written by the chief
justice. I think it actually means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, an attorney for the plaintiff, said it was a
``tremendously powerful decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will further the national discussion about gay youth and
the need to end discrimination,'' said Wolfson, who is also an
attorney with the Lamda Legal Defense Fund, which advocates gay and
lesbian causes.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves James Dale, 29, a former assistant scoutmaster
from Matawan, N.J., who was expelled from the Boy Scouts in 1990
after spending 12 years in the organization and earning some 30
merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was kicked out for being gay. The Boy Scouts argues that
its policy is legal because it falls within its First Amendment
rights. In 1995, a lower court agreed with the Boy Scouts. When the
case was first brought, the court ruled that the Boy Scouts is a
private organization that can set its own membership rules.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court overturned that decision in 1998, and Wednesday
the highest court in New Jersey agreed that no organization as
broad-based as the Boy Scouts could be qualified as anything but
public.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court said the Boy Scouts falls into the
``public accomodation'' category _ meaning that the organization is
public, and therefore must follow all applicable state rules. In
New Jersey _ as in Massachusetts _ that means not discrimating on
the basis of race, religion or, in this case, sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling read: ``To recognize the Boy Scouts' First
Amendment claim would be tantamount to tolerating the expulsion of
an individual solely because of his status as a homosexual _ an act
of discrimination unprotected by the First Amendment freedom of
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout officials said they were ``disappointed by the
ruling,'' and quickly announced plans to appeal to the US Supreme
Court, which last year refused to hear a California case in which a
troop leader was fired for being gay. Organization officials
expressed optimism the Supreme Court would put this case on the
docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law against discrimination as applied to the Boy Scouts is
unconstitutional,'' said spokesman Paul Stevenson. ``The New Jersey
law against discrimination applies to public accommodations. The
Boy Scouts is a private accomodation, and as such we're not
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate among troop members, however, seemed to have little
to do with the semantics of public and private _ and everything to
do with the identity of being gay, as well as the appropriateness
of discussing such topics with boys as young as 11.
</P>
<P>
   James Blair, scoutmaster for the 35 or so boys who form Troop 12
in Chartley, Mass., said the issue of homosexuality has never even
arisen among his charges, who range in age from 11 to 17. If it
did, however, he said he would vehemently oppose a change in Boy
Scout policy _ as would a number of parents in the Taunton,
Mass.-based Annawon Council of Boy Scouts, home to some 20 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Blair denied the policy against gays is unnecessarily
discriminatory, saying that ``people are aware there's a difference
between a gay scout leader and a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But myself, and people I have talked to about it, we like to
think the troop is a safe place for kids _ safe from a lot of
things,'' said Blair, who has been scoutmaster for 10 years and a
member of the organization nearly all his life. ``I would not
support that kind of an adult leader. It opens doors to things that
lend themselves to stress. And I don't think the kids deserve that
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But an associate of another Massachusetts Boy Scout troop had
the opposite reaction. Recently, she said, a teenager in her troop
had told his friends he was gay, and was ``petrified of what would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very disturbed about what could happen,'' said the
woman, who did not want anything about the identity of the member
revealed. ``He's in high school now, and he was feeling very
vulnerable. It was so upsetting to think it could happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   For James Dale, the fact that it did happen to him has run
counter to everything he learned in the Boy Scouts, he said. But at
the same time, he said his years as a scout prepared him for the
current fight. Speaking at a press conference after the ruling,
Dale described it as ``exactly what scouting has taught me: to
believe in the system and that justice will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I didn't know I was gay, but the Boy
Scouts made me feel good about who I was,'' Dale said. ``Whether or
not they know it, the Boy Scouts do wonderful things for gay kids
across the country.''

   WASHINGTON _ The life of C.W. Bill Young, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, arguably the most powerful body in
Congress, sounds like the world's saddest country-and-western song.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a shotgun shack in a dirt-poor Pennsylvania coal
town during the Depression. His father fled. A river washed away
the shack when he was 6. His mother fell ill, and he dropped out of
high school to support her by hauling concrete blocks and mixing
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my short life,'' said Young, a 68-year-old Republican who
has represented the St. Petersburg, Fla., area in the House for
nearly 30 years, ``I've been shot, I've been hit by a truck,
survived an airplane crash, I've had my chest opened and my heart
rebuilt. And it's sort of hard to get me flustered after all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Utterly unacquainted with money and power in his youth, Young is
now burdened with both. On his shoulders, which are as wide as a
side of beef, rest $538 billion and the prestige of the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of a high-school diploma but with a penchant for
numbers, the uncannily genial Young is responsible, as
Appropriations chairman, for deciding how to spend that huge sum to
run the government. Thirteen subcommittees wrangle over 13 spending
bills that provide the money, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
Young presides over all of them with extraordinary patience while
squabbling swirls around him.
</P>
<P>
   The process began with House Republican leaders freezing or
cutting money for almost every agency except the Pentagon, which
got a $19 billion increase. Then hundreds of members came privately
to Young seeking some $80 billion in new spending, much of it for
pet programs. ``We had to say no to an awful lot of them,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   He has since marched 10 of the 13 bills through the House, often
in midnight sessions and not without fierce floor fights undertaken
by conservative colleagues determined to cut all the bills to the
bone and sometimes even deeper. All the while, he has been
surrounded by lawmakers' incessant snarling and sniping over how to
spend the people's treasure, a battle with all the grace and
subtlety of greedy children pouncing on their parents' inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   If that battle is not settled soon, and the bills cannot be
enacted by the end of September, Congress may be facing alternative
fiascoes: The lawmakers could wind up in a spending free-for-all in
which they define some routine expenditures as emergency
appropriations, exempt from painful spending caps. Or, if the
spending process collapses, the government could be shut down, and
Republicans might well be burdened again by wrath from a public
that perceives them as incapable of making the federal trains run
on time. Any festering of that anger, Young knows, could cost the
Republicans their tiny House majority, now just five votes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he displays a calm that in another man might be attributed
to either Zen meditation or mood medication. His secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got so many scars on my back,'' he said, ``I don't feel
the whip anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The lash keeps falling, wielded mostly by his fellow
Republicans, some of whom want even deeper cuts than the $26
billion by which spending on domestic programs for next year has
already been reduced, relative to this year's budget. Under the
caps, that spending, excluding entitlements, has dropped to 3.4
percent of the U.S. economy, its lowest level since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about medical research, education, embassy
security, problems all around the world, immigration problems all
along our borders, all the law-enforcement agencies, including the
FBI,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young is juggling a few billion here and a few billion there to
keep the troops in line, but he concedes that this is no solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' he said. ``Trouble is,
Peter doesn't have anything more to rob.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 16-hour days, he needs every inch of the tough hide
he picked up during his hard youth and a political lifetime spent
mostly in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Born into poverty in 1930 in Harmarville, Pa., near Pittsburgh,
Young had few prospects before him. He was 16 when he was shot in a
hunting accident, and then things got worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got quite sick,'' he said in an interview in his
committee's suite, all gilded mirrors and glittering chandeliers.
``My uncle had a little camp in Florida. This camp was a tent,
really. But we went down there. Then my mother got really sick. She
was in the hospital in a coma. So I went to work. We stayed in
Florida. Less expensive to stay there than try to get back home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to find jobs,'' he said. ``I carried
cement blocks, mixed mortar. I had left school, and I didn't have
anybody in the family closer than a thousand miles to help me get a
job or to get an introduction to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, at 25 ``I realized, `I got to get out of this
rut.''' He applied for a job as a salesman with the Federated
Mutual Implement and Hardware Insurance Company. And the way he got
it boded well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very reluctant to hire me, because I did not have a
formal education,'' he remembered. ``And they gave me a test. They
gave you a list of numbers, and you were to figure out the missing
numbers and tell them what those numbers meant. And they said I was
the only one who had ever answered these questions correctly. I
could see the patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   This turns out to be a useful skill for Young, who now has to
find missing billions and pattern them in politically acceptable
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Young found insurance a very good living. The St. Petersburg
area, where he worked, was booming with Yankee newcomers _ many of
them Republicans _ and he made his fortune. In 1960, he went into a
new line of work, becoming the only Republican state senator in
Florida. He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1970, and
survived a campaign-trail plane crash to win his seat.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 years in the minority in Tallahassee were followed by 24
years in the minority in the House, until the Republicans took
control there in 1994 for the first time in four decades. Now Young
has real power. But he seems to have sympathy for people who do
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minority, I got shot down a lot,'' he said with a weary
smile. ``I received a lot of scars. Political scars. They taught me
a lot.''

 &HT;    Cox starts suspension; Perez begins appeal
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ For the first time since returning to manage the
Braves in 1990, manager Bobby Cox was not on the bench for a game
on Wednesday night. He began serving his two-game suspension for
going out onto the field during the Braves' brawl with the Phillies
on Friday after he'd already been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was not allowed on the bench but he could be at the
ballpark. He planned to watch the game on TV in the visiting
clubhouse at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you're exiled,'' Cox said. ``You see everybody,
you're around everybody. It's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The big deal may have been his fine. Cox was fined $5,000 by the
National League. The most he'd ever been fined before was $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too much money,'' Cox said. ``I thought $1,500 was
pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox had not been suspended since 1980 during his first stint
with the Braves when he got into a spitting match with umpire Jerry
Dale over a play at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Of Friday's actions, Cox said if he had to do it over again, he
would do the exact same thing to protect his players from getting
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your instinct,'' Cox said. ``It's your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez, meanwhile, put in a call to the players'
association Wednesday to appeal his four-game suspension for his
role in the fight. Perez, who was hit by a Paul Byrd pitch,
initiated a fight when Byrd came up to bat in the top of the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Perez will be able to play until he can meet with NL president
Len Coleman, which may be as early as next week in Atlanta. The
Braves will call on minor-league catcher Pascual Matos if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez at short
</P>
<P>
   Fans got their first look at new acquisition Jose Hernandez on
Wednesday night when he made his first start with the Braves at
shortstop. Cox told him he would play shortstop the last two games
of this series, which ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop is the position Hernandez is most used to playing _ he
played 80 games at shortstop for the Cubs _ though he can also play
third, first and all three outfield positions. But hitting leadoff
was something new to him. Hernandez has hit second, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth and even ninth (for interleague games) this season
for the Cubs. But he's only hit leadoff a handful of times in his
six-year big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm going to change anything,'' Hernandez said.
``I'm going to be the same hitter. I should be more patient and get
on base, but I can still
</P>
<P>
   free swing too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is going to strike out a good bit. He's averaging one
strikeout every 3.4 at-bats. But he's hitting .272 and has an
on-base percentage of .357, significantly better than the other
leadoff hitters the Braves have used this season _ Walt Weiss
(.309), Gerald Williams (.330), Otis Nixon (.289) and Ozzie Guillen
(.274).
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Don Baylor has already talked to Hernandez about
his problems with the slider, the pitch he's liable to strike out
on, and how he should think about taking that pitch or driving it
to right center.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland prepares for Saturday
</P>
<P>
   Terry Mulholland will start for the Braves on Saturday against
the Giants. Mulholland, who took a no-decision in a 3-2 loss in San
Francisco on June 17, said he wasn't so much nervous about his
upcoming start but eager for it to get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get out there and start contributing,'' Mulholland
said.
</P>
<P>
   His previous start was nine days ago in Montreal when he came
one out away from a complete game in a 4-2 victory against the
Expos. Mulholland, who pitched an inning on Tuesday night, plans to
throw on the side today with pitching coach Leo Mazzone. Mulholland
had been scheduled to start last Sunday for the Cubs before he was
traded to the Braves on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce Chen, who was originally scheduled to make that start,
it means he's in the bullpen indefinitely. It's a role he has
filled, unless you count pitching the last four innings in two
minor-league games, but it's a role he accepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever it takes,'' Chen said. ``I'd rather be here
doing this than starting every five days in the minor leagues. I
have a chance to get better here.

ANTI-TRUST RUMBLINGS

 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After spending more than $8 billion in the past two
years to acquire some of the world's largest seed companies and
millions more to pioneer in the development of genetically
engineered foods, Monsanto Co. is facing growing skepticism about
its debt management and mounting resistance to some of its
bio-engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   The company's problems are manifold: despite optimistic ``buy''
recommendations from Wall Street analysts and blockbuster sales of
its arthritis drug Celebrex, the best-selling drug launch in
history, Monsanto's stock price has been languishing for months.
Its shares closed Wednesday at $41.5625, up $1.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons: agricultural experts and anti-trust lawyers
are beginning to raise concerns about whether Monsanto's buying
spree has concentrated too much of the world's seed business in one
company. Farmers, academics and environmental activists are
questioning the safety and efficacy of genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning setback for Monsanto came this year in Europe,
where opposition to what some dubbed ``Frankenstein Foods'' led the
European Union to slow approval of genetically modified crops. As a
result, some of the world's largest food processors say they will
not accept genetically modified crops for export.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure to improve its balance sheet and revive its stock
price, Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, said last November
that it would lay off about 9 percent of its workforce and issue $4
billion in new debt; a month ago, the company put its Nutrasweet
division up for sale as a way to cut $6.5 billion in debt, a debt
level that at 60 percent of the company's capitalization is twice
as high as rival companies, according to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
&AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance its transformation from a chemical to a ``life
sciences company,'' Monsanto executives have held merger talks over
the past year with DuPont Co. Those talks were confirmed last month
by a federal filing by Pioneer Hi-Bred Inc., the nation's largest
seed company, which was acquired last March by DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives said last week that they would not rule out
a merger, but brushed aside suggestions that a merger deal was
necessary or imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Monsanto finds a partner, the company needs to
improve its standing with investors and the public. The company
would like to persuade consumers that genetically modified foods
are not just safe but critical to feeding a growing population by
boosting crop yields while reducing waste and the need for harmful
pesticides, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, executives at DuPont say that Shapiro of
Monsanto has had discussions with Charles O. Holliday, the chief
executive at DuPont, about joining forces to hold public meetings
as part of an effort to shore up the acceptability of
genetically-modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto executives are trying to convince investors that as the
company transforms itself into a ``life sciences'' firm, it will
double its earnings in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Shapiro, the chief executive at Monsanto, says he
likes the challenges the company faces. Monsanto is now the number
two player in the seed market, he said, and genetically modified
crops are growing all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the single most successful introduction of technology
in the history of agriculture including the plow,'' Shapiro said in
a telephone interview last week. ``The fundamental question
investors are asking me: Is the public's acceptance going to slow
down the commercialization? And that's a perfectly good question.
The only appropriate answer is Let's see.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, however, consumers have reacted negatively to
genetically engineered foods. Buoyed by the media storm in Europe,
activists in the U.S. have stepped up their assault on
biotechnology in recent months, with groups like Greenpeace
painting an ugly picture of Monsanto and the industry. One Internet
web site has even taken to calling the company ``Mutanto.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has generally
supported biotechnology, announced last month that it was setting
up an independent scientific review of its biotech approval
process, largely to shore up public confidence and insure the
safety of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Rifkin, the environmental activist, says Monsanto and
other biotechnology companies have failed to address concerns about
the environmental impact of such crops, particularly the risk that
altering the genetic makeup of plants could accidentally foster
genetically altered weeds and pests that could be impossible to
thwart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agricultural biotechnology is unraveling, and Monsanto has
staked its future on biotech,'' said Rifkin, author of The Biotech
Century. ``There are a lot of problems and there will be lots of
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nation's most prominent anti-trust lawyers, David
Boies who is leading the Justice Department's prosecution of
Microsoft and Michael Hausfeld, a Washington lawyer involved in
Holocaust-related suits, say they are considering representing
farmers in a class-action anti-trust suit against Monsanto and
other biotechnology companies. The attorneys say that the companies
that dominate the seed business are using technology agreements,
legal contracts and alliances to limit the choices available to
farmers and push bio-engineered seeds in an anti-competitive
manner.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The problems that beset Monsanto are perhaps a lesson in how
perilous it can be on the front lines of a revolution in the food
and agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto and other biotechnology companies stand to reap
billions of dollars in profits if genetically-engineered crops
become a staple of the world's diet. But while some of the world's
largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as
Rhone-Poulenc and DuPont, prepare a robust pipeline of future
products, it is Monsanto that has been virtually alone in the
sometimes harsh public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The company concedes that it may have been naive in trying to
win approval in Europe, but eventually, scientific proof should win
over consumers, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. regulators have approved genetically modified crops, and
American farmers have been huge backers of bio-engineered crops
that resist pests and cut down on spraying and equipment costs.
Monsanto estimates that more than 70 million acres have been
planted with the company's biotech seeds. Many Wall Street analysts
believe the company is primed for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driven by their pharmaceutical and ag biotech earnings, we
think the company is poised for a dramatic earnings runup,'' said
Mark Wiltamuth, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monsanto's second quarter earnings were largely driven
by Celebrex, the arthritis drug, and sales of Roundup herbicide, a
chemical, the company says its biotechnology products are selling
well, even in a depressed market.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: will farmers continue to purchase
genetically-engineered seeds if they sense closed export markets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most growers are seeing benefits to biotechnology,'' said
Kevin Aandahl, a spokesman for the National Crow Growers
Association. ``The concerns are now about the market ability and
acceptance of those grains. There's no question that there are
concerns.'' &QL;

LAWYERS WORRY ABOUT KEEPING THEIR AUTONOMY, POWER

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American lawyers may be at the peak of their power.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving victories in court that could not be won in Congress,
they are playing ever more pivotal roles in public issues from sex
discrimination and civil rights to tobacco and the current battles
over guns and Microsoft. The size and wealth of the profession is
greater than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   But, partly in a reaction to that success, and because of the
increasing criticism of gargantuan legal fees and excessive
litigation, lawyers and the suits they bring are facing a host of
new restrictions. Legislatures and courts have barred certain types
of suits entirely and tried to limit the type of advice lawyers can
give. Many lawyers warn that as their influence is restricted,
Americans lose the ability to turn to the legal system for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an effort to foreclose the absolute freedom of
lawyers to represent their clients and the reason is that lawyers
have been successful in doing so,'' Philip S. Anderson, president
of the American Bar Association, the country's largest lawyers'
group said in an interview on the eve of the association's annual
convention, which began here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one sign of the trend, after more than 20 municipalities
filed suits seeking to force the gun industry to control firearms,
13 states have recently passed laws simply barring such suits
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   As the political landscape changes, so does the legal profession
itself. Some lawyers say new business and professional trends are
further limiting their autonomy, with lawyers increasingly finding
their decisions second guessed by insurance companies and others
reviewing their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any time in the history of the country,''
Anderson said, ``that the independence of the legal profession has
been as threatened as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say the new limits on lawyers and suits are a
response to legitimate public concerns. Deborah L. Rhode, a
Stanford law professor who is writing a book on the problems of the
profession, said some of the limits on lawyers were the result of a
concern about the profession's growing arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all responses, not just to the bar's political
clout, but to the bar's perceived greed,'' said Rhode, who is to
appear on a panel here.
</P>
<P>
   George L. Priest, a Yale law professor, said some of the new
restrictions, like the limits on gun suits, showed disillusionment
with what he said was the idea that had prevailed for decades that
``all disputes can be _ and ought to be _ resolved through
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But as more than 9,000 lawyers gathered in Atlanta Wednesday,
some see themselves facing the same kind of threat that doctors
faced with the advent of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still at a place where we can avoid what happened to the
medical profession,'' said Lawrence J. Fox, a Philadelphia trial
lawyer who is a former chairman of the bar association's ethics
committee. ``But we have to defend the proposition of professional
independence right now _ today _ we can't wait any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike doctors, lawyers are facing challenges on many different
fronts as courts, state legislatures and Congress have all imposed
new restrictions. A host of new federal and state laws and court
decisions, for example, make it harder to bring certain kinds of
personal injury suits, limit the legal arguments available in
immigration cases, and curtail civil rights suits on behalf of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by seeing government money used to fight decisions the
government had made, Congress passed laws that went into effect in
1996 forbidding all government-financed lawyers for the poor from
filing class action suits, challenging welfare reform legislation
or lobbying on behalf of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   One limitation on lawyers that has drawn particular attention in
the profession is a two-year-old federal law, popularly known as
``Granny's Lawyer Goes To Jail.'' It declared that any lawyer who
advised an elderly person how to give away property to qualify for
need-based Medicaid benefits was guilty of a crime. Last year a
U.S. District Court in Albany said the law was unconstitutional.
But it remains on the books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new legal limits, lawyers are facing changes
in the $130 billion business of law that some lawyers say are
creating additional constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, insurance companies that promise to pay for
the defense of lawsuits in malpractice, automobile insurance and
other policies are beginning to insist on reviewing the
expenditures of the lawyers hired to handle those cases. Some of
the lawyers say that is an invasion of their professional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of lawyers working at accounting firms spawned a Bar
Association commission's proposal to formally authorize lawyers to
practice law in accounting and other professional service firms
that has deeply divided the convention here. Some lawyers say such
lawyer-employees lack the autonomy to make independent judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics provide support for the widespread belief that there
are more and more lawyers with growing clout. Just 20 years ago,
government statistics show, there were three lawyers for every
1,000 Americans. Now there are more than 4.6 lawyers for every
1,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those lawyers are making unprecedented sums,
transforming an influential profession into what some critics call
``a new political class'' with enormous clout.
</P>
<P>
   According to The American Lawyer magazine, the gross revenues of
the country's 100 largest firms more than doubled to $23.1 billion
last year from $10.6 billion in 1988. The 1,467 partners of the
largest 13 law firms made annual profits of more than $1 million
per partner. The fees of more than $8.2 billion that have been
awarded so far in settlements with tobacco companies have led to
calls for controls on such fees.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers see a connection between their growing power in
American society and new efforts to control them.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Little Rock lawyer who has been the bar association
president for a year, said civil rights and liability cases like
the tobacco and gun suits, showed that lawyers were sometimes more
capable than government of tackling problems. That, he said, made
lawyers a target.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the convention, the business developments some lawyers
say are threatening lawyers' autonomy are a major focus.
</P>
<P>
   One legal battleground across the country that is attracting
wide interest here is a fight between lawyers and insurance
companies over the costs of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurance companies have recently begun to audit the way
lawyers handle the cases of the insured clients, sometimes
requiring advance approval of decisions that have traditionally
been lawyers' alone, like how many depositions to conduct or which
expert witnesses to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Although malpractice insurers, for example, theoretically save
money when they do not have to pay verdicts, some lawyers say
insurers sometimes decide that some cases are not worth the
investment required to win. That, the lawyers say, puts them in the
position of being pressured to forfeit the interests of the person
they are defending to satisfy an insurance company that is paying
the bills. Insurance companies argue that they have a right to
control litigation they are subsidizing.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over lawyer independence is opening here because of
the proposal that would authorize the accounting firms' move toward
offering legal services. Under age-old rules that the commission
would change, lawyers are not permitted to share fees with other
professionals. One purpose of that rule was to ensure that only
lawyers controlled legal decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the thousands of lawyers working at the accounting
firms are legally barred from practicing law, filing suits or
formally rendering legal advice, although many are employed because
of their legal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The bar commission, appointed by Anderson, concluded that
allowing lawyers to practice in other professional service firms
would increase Americans' access to legal services. Several
European countries permit such multidisciplinary practice. Some
lawyers here feel American lawyers will simply lose the business of
global companies to the large accounting firms that can offer many
different professional services if the legal profession here does
not loosen its rules.
</P>
<P>
   If the bar association approves the proposal that would change a
model national code. But because the states set their own rules for
the practice of law, each state would then be required to decide
whether to adopt the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here say the proposal would ensure that lawyers, like
doctors in health maintenance organizations, will increasingly lose
their ability to make independent professional judgments.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the change say lawyers are already working
outside the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice of law has changed,'' said Sherwin P. Simmons, a
Miami lawyer who was chairman of the commission on
multidisciplinary practice. ``It is more global. It is more
interstate and the bar needs to respond. We can't just say, `Hell,
no! We won't go.'''

   BC-NY-TALK-PARTY-NYT (moved on Monday, Aug. 2)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Aug. 2,
about a party to introduce Talk magazine misstated the attribution

 &HT;    Falcons' reserves in a dogfight
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ It's not something Falcons pro personnel
chief Ron Hill talks openly about, but it's impossible to forget
the way he twisted last summer when defensive tackle Nathan Davis
tanked it.
</P>
<P>
   There don't appear to be any Nathan Davis-types in the Falcons'
training camp this summer, and this camp clearly is more
competitive than last, especially for reserve roles at tight end,
defensive line, wide receiver, safety, linebacker and fullback.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of somebody quitting, like Davis did on the first
day last summer, appear slim.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, some players who get cut cost the team considerable
money because of the way the cap is calculated. But the goal for
every NFL coach and personnel chief is to be forced into difficult
decisions, not to have easy ones made for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you want,'' coach Dan Reeves. ``If you have an
easy decision, that means you didn't have a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of strong safety Marty Carter was the Falcons' only
big-money free-agent acquisition, but some smaller moves have
created competitition _ and job insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to try to get as deep as you can ... so you can be
competitive,'' he said. ``There's really not a whole lot of
positions out here where people should feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than left guard, where free-agent signee Greg Bishop is
working behind Calvin Collins, no starter faces stiff competition
from a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, it's not competition that decides roster
spots. The key factors can also be finances and/or the long-held
belief that high draft choices should get more time to show their
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the fullback position, where Bob Christian
will remain the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, when injuries to Christian caused a hole in
the backfield, the Falcons now plan to keep a backup at that spot.
With that in mind, they drafted Jeff Paulk in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   However, Paulk is now working with the third unit behind free
agent Eric Lane, who made the Giants' roster as a rookie in '97 but
was cut in '98 for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, though, may again find himself a victim of budget cuts
despite his on-field performance.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's rare for a team to cut a third-round draft
pick. For another, Paulk's $340,000 signing bonus means cutting him
and keeping Lane would cost Atlanta about $600,000 against the cap
(as long as Paulk was claimed off waivers).
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Lane would cost only about $300,000. ``In no other camp
I've been in has it been this close as far as competitiveness,''
said Pro Bowl cornerback Ray Buchanan, who isn't facing any
competition.

N.J. COURT RULES AGAINST BOY SCOUT BAN ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boy Scouts, which has become a contoversial
symbol in the debate over homosexual rights, suffered a court
defeat Wednesday that could transform the rules governing troops in
New England and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in which New Jersey's highest court unanimously
stuck down the Boy Scout policy banning gays from being members or
leaders in the organization, elicited a range of reactions both
nationally and locally.
</P>
<P>
   Having earlier refused to hear a California case in which the
scouts' ban was upheld, the US Supreme Court now could be prompted
to clarify the issue. An attorney for the Boy Scouts, George
Davidson, vowed to appeal to the high court, and said Wednesday's
decision gave the organization ``the first opportunity to go the US
Supreme Court and get a definitive ruling to put an end to these
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachussets, meanwhile, one troop master lambasted the
ruling as ``opening all kinds of dangerous doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But among advocates for gay rights and even some troop masters
themselves, the ruling served as a welcome sign the organization
may soon be forced to enter a new era of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Buseck, executive director of Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders, said it could have wide-reaching
implications in Massachusetts, where state law is nearly identical
to the New Jersey statute that bars discrimination at ``public
accommodations,'' and where at least one troop privately admitted
Wednesday it has a teenage member who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think it could have a huge impact here,''
Buseck said of the court decision, which, although handed down in
New Jersey, could have a broader effect because it comes from one
of the most respected state courts in the country. ``This is a
terrific victory. The decision was unanimous, written by the chief
justice. I think it actually means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, an attorney for the plaintiff, said it was a
``tremendously powerful decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will further the national discussion about gay youth and
the need to end discrimination,'' said Wolfson, who is also an
attorney with the Lamda Legal Defense Fund, which advocates gay and
lesbian causes.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves James Dale, 29, a former assistant scoutmaster
from Matawan, N.J., who was expelled from the Boy Scouts in 1990
after spending 12 years in the organization and earning some 30
merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was kicked out for being gay. The Boy Scouts argues that
its policy is legal because it falls within its First Amendment
rights. In 1995, a lower court agreed with the Boy Scouts. When the
case was first brought, the court ruled that the Boy Scouts is a
private organization that can set its own membership rules.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court overturned that decision in 1998, and Wednesday
the highest court in New Jersey agreed that no organization as
broad-based as the Boy Scouts could be qualified as anything but
public.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court said the Boy Scouts falls into the
``public accomodation'' category _ meaning that the organization is
public, and therefore must follow all applicable state rules. In
New Jersey _ as in Massachusetts _ that means not discrimating on
the basis of race, religion or, in this case, sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling read: ``To recognize the Boy Scouts' First
Amendment claim would be tantamount to tolerating the expulsion of
an individual solely because of his status as a homosexual _ an act
of discrimination unprotected by the First Amendment freedom of
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout officials said they were ``disappointed by the
ruling,'' and quickly announced plans to appeal to the US Supreme
Court, which last year refused to hear a California case in which a
troop leader was fired for being gay. Organization officials
expressed optimism the Supreme Court would put this case on the
docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law against discrimination as applied to the Boy Scouts is
unconstitutional,'' said spokesman Paul Stevenson. ``The New Jersey
law against discrimination applies to public accommodations. The
Boy Scouts is a private accomodation, and as such we're not
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate among troop members, however, seemed to have little
to do with the semantics of public and private _ and everything to
do with the identity of being gay, as well as the appropriateness
of discussing such topics with boys as young as 11.
</P>
<P>
   James Blair, scoutmaster for the 35 or so boys who form Troop 12
in Chartley, Mass., said the issue of homosexuality has never even
arisen among his charges, who range in age from 11 to 17. If it
did, however, he said he would vehemently oppose a change in Boy
Scout policy _ as would a number of parents in the Taunton,
Mass.-based Annawon Council of Boy Scouts, home to some 20 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Blair denied the policy against gays is unnecessarily
discriminatory, saying that ``people are aware there's a difference
between a gay scout leader and a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But myself, and people I have talked to about it, we like to
think the troop is a safe place for kids _ safe from a lot of
things,'' said Blair, who has been scoutmaster for 10 years and a
member of the organization nearly all his life. ``I would not
support that kind of an adult leader. It opens doors to things that
lend themselves to stress. And I don't think the kids deserve that
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But an associate of another Massachusetts Boy Scout troop had
the opposite reaction. Recently, she said, a teenager in her troop
had told his friends he was gay, and was ``petrified of what would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very disturbed about what could happen,'' said the
woman, who did not want anything about the identity of the member
revealed. ``He's in high school now, and he was feeling very
vulnerable. It was so upsetting to think it could happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   For James Dale, the fact that it did happen to him has run
counter to everything he learned in the Boy Scouts, he said. But at
the same time, he said his years as a scout prepared him for the
current fight. Speaking at a press conference after the ruling,
Dale described it as ``exactly what scouting has taught me: to
believe in the system and that justice will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I didn't know I was gay, but the Boy
Scouts made me feel good about who I was,'' Dale said. ``Whether or
not they know it, the Boy Scouts do wonderful things for gay kids
across the country.''

   ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME
</P>
<P>
   Tired of getting up early for school? Ask your parents to buy an
extra house closer to campus.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a family from Barrington, Ill., did. The son, Srinu
Yeshwant, has a $157,000 home near his high school where he parks
his new truck in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   The family _ both parents are doctors _ and son live in a larger
home in South Barrington. With the parking place at the bungalow,
Srinu can sleep later because he doesn't have to fight for a spot
in the school lot.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors complained, saying they resented the setup. The
parents agreed to let a support group for single mothers use the
home.
</P>
<P>
   USE YOUR HEAD _ WEAR A HELMET
</P>
<P>
   Your head _ it's something you want to keep, right? So use it
already. Wear a bike helmet every time you hop on a two-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know:
</P>
<P>
   The typical bike crash happens within a mile of the rider's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 350,000 children under age 15 go to hospital
emergency rooms with bicycle-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Falling off a bike can cause serious or even permanent head
injury.

   ROSSVILLE, Ga. _ North Georgia Lotto store manager Randy
Thompson sees the frenzy in this tiny mountain town on the
Tennessee border every time the lottery jackpot creeps above $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   People cross the state line, snatch up lottery tickets and drive
back to Tennessee. On Tuesday, one of those folks, Thomas ``Randy''
Kerfoot, of East Ridge, Tenn., won the $116 million Big Game played
in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rossville is the destination for gas, Lotto and groceries,''
Thompson said. ``Monday and Tuesday it was three lines deep for
hours and hours. It's like a hurricane leading up to the drawing.''
</P>
<P>
   Multimillion-dollar jackpots are becoming old hat in the
Rossville area, just across the state line from Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, part-time Rossville police Officer Maxine Warren
split a $79 million Big Game jackpot with two Massachusetts
winners. Warren, who lives in Rossville, actually bought her ticket
four miles away in Fort Oglethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   And this past February, a single ticket was sold in Ringgold _
just 11 miles from Rossville _ for a $60 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Zip convenience store, where Kerfoot bought his winning
ticket, is on State Line Road, which is the physical border between
Georgia and Tennessee. Employees inside the store wouldn't talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerfoot, 41, a husband and father of two, seemed happy to
tell the world of his new fortune on the day after the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   On his Quik Pik ticket he had chosen the cash option, which pays
the lump-sum winnings of about $59 million, or $38.9 million after
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest payout to a single winner since the state
lottery began in 1993, lottery officials said Wednesday at a press
conference for Kerfoot in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kerfoot said he and his wife, Sandy, checked the numbers
repeatedly after Tuesday night's drawing to make sure their ticket
won.
</P>
<P>
   The family was unable to resist spreading the news to family and
friends. ``Probably around 3 a.m. or 4 a.m., we started getting
people out of bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took it a while to really sink in, and I don't think
anybody took their eyes off that ticket all night,'' he told
reporters. Then Kerfoot, a parts and service director for an
Infiniti dealership in Chattanooga, called his boss to say, ``I'm
out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Rossville, at the Mr. Zip, customers seemed amazed that
someone got rich where they pencil in lottery cards and dream
everyday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Warren, a part-time nurse in Rossville, stopped by
Wednesday to buy a ticket as she does most days. ``I was surprised.
I had five of 'em,'' Warren said. ``We've been fussing about not
winning up here.''

N.J. COURT RULES AGAINST BOY SCOUT BAN ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Boy Scouts, which has become a contoversial
symbol in the debate over homosexual rights, suffered a court
defeat Wednesday that could transform the rules governing troops in
New England and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in which New Jersey's highest court unanimously
stuck down the Boy Scout policy banning gays from being members or
leaders in the organization, elicited a range of reactions both
nationally and locally.
</P>
<P>
   Having earlier refused to hear a California case in which the
scouts' ban was upheld, the US Supreme Court now could be prompted
to clarify the issue. An attorney for the Boy Scouts, George
Davidson, vowed to appeal to the high court, and said Wednesday's
decision gave the organization ``the first opportunity to go the US
Supreme Court and get a definitive ruling to put an end to these
lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachussets, meanwhile, one troop master lambasted the
ruling as ``opening all kinds of dangerous doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But among advocates for gay rights and even some troop masters
themselves, the ruling served as a welcome sign the organization
may soon be forced to enter a new era of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Buseck, executive director of Boston's Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders, said it could have wide-reaching
implications in Massachusetts, where state law is nearly identical
to the New Jersey statute that bars discrimination at ``public
accommodations,'' and where at least one troop privately admitted
Wednesday it has a teenage member who is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, I think it could have a huge impact here,''
Buseck said of the court decision, which, although handed down in
New Jersey, could have a broader effect because it comes from one
of the most respected state courts in the country. ``This is a
terrific victory. The decision was unanimous, written by the chief
justice. I think it actually means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Wolfson, an attorney for the plaintiff, said it was a
``tremendously powerful decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will further the national discussion about gay youth and
the need to end discrimination,'' said Wolfson, who is also an
attorney with the Lamda Legal Defense Fund, which advocates gay and
lesbian causes.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves James Dale, 29, a former assistant scoutmaster
from Matawan, N.J., who was expelled from the Boy Scouts in 1990
after spending 12 years in the organization and earning some 30
merit badges.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was kicked out for being gay. The Boy Scouts argues that
its policy is legal because it falls within its First Amendment
rights. In 1995, a lower court agreed with the Boy Scouts. When the
case was first brought, the court ruled that the Boy Scouts is a
private organization that can set its own membership rules.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court overturned that decision in 1998, and Wednesday
the highest court in New Jersey agreed that no organization as
broad-based as the Boy Scouts could be qualified as anything but
public.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court said the Boy Scouts falls into the
``public accomodation'' category _ meaning that the organization is
public, and therefore must follow all applicable state rules. In
New Jersey _ as in Massachusetts _ that means not discrimating on
the basis of race, religion or, in this case, sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling read: ``To recognize the Boy Scouts' First
Amendment claim would be tantamount to tolerating the expulsion of
an individual solely because of his status as a homosexual _ an act
of discrimination unprotected by the First Amendment freedom of
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy Scout officials said they were ``disappointed by the
ruling,'' and quickly announced plans to appeal to the US Supreme
Court, which last year refused to hear a California case in which a
troop leader was fired for being gay. Organization officials
expressed optimism the Supreme Court would put this case on the
docket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law against discrimination as applied to the Boy Scouts is
unconstitutional,'' said spokesman Paul Stevenson. ``The New Jersey
law against discrimination applies to public accommodations. The
Boy Scouts is a private accomodation, and as such we're not
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate among troop members, however, seemed to have little
to do with the semantics of public and private _ and everything to
do with the identity of being gay, as well as the appropriateness
of discussing such topics with boys as young as 11.
</P>
<P>
   James Blair, scoutmaster for the 35 or so boys who form Troop 12
in Chartley, Mass., said the issue of homosexuality has never even
arisen among his charges, who range in age from 11 to 17. If it
did, however, he said he would vehemently oppose a change in Boy
Scout policy _ as would a number of parents in the Taunton,
Mass.-based Annawon Council of Boy Scouts, home to some 20 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Blair denied the policy against gays is unnecessarily
discriminatory, saying that ``people are aware there's a difference
between a gay scout leader and a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But myself, and people I have talked to about it, we like to
think the troop is a safe place for kids _ safe from a lot of
things,'' said Blair, who has been scoutmaster for 10 years and a
member of the organization nearly all his life. ``I would not
support that kind of an adult leader. It opens doors to things that
lend themselves to stress. And I don't think the kids deserve that
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But an associate of another Massachusetts Boy Scout troop had
the opposite reaction. Recently, she said, a teenager in her troop
had told his friends he was gay, and was ``petrified of what would
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very disturbed about what could happen,'' said the
woman, who did not want anything about the identity of the member
revealed. ``He's in high school now, and he was feeling very
vulnerable. It was so upsetting to think it could happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   For James Dale, the fact that it did happen to him has run
counter to everything he learned in the Boy Scouts, he said. But at
the same time, he said his years as a scout prepared him for the
current fight. Speaking at a press conference after the ruling,
Dale described it as ``exactly what scouting has taught me: to
believe in the system and that justice will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I didn't know I was gay, but the Boy
Scouts made me feel good about who I was,'' Dale said. ``Whether or
not they know it, the Boy Scouts do wonderful things for gay kids
across the country.''

 &HT;    Atlanta issues fit lawyers' agenda
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Among cities wrestling with the nation's most
controversial legal issues of the day, Atlanta can stand front and
center.
</P>
<P>
   The city is suing the gun industry, contending manufacturers do
not use enough safety devices to keep ``unauthorized users,''
including children, from using them. On affirmative action, the
city is preparing to wage legal warfare with the Southeastern Legal
Foundation, which has served notice it will file a lawsuit seeking
to abolish Atlanta's minority business program.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems appropriate that the American Bar Association, the
nation's largest group of lawyers with 400,000 members, will
convene its annual meeting here today. The last time the ABA came
to Atlanta was in 1991 when then-Vice President Dan Quayle created
an uproar during an address at the convention when he blamed
lawyers for America's failure to contend in the international
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Gun lawsuits and affirmative action will be among the key topics
of discussion during the six-day meeting. But another contentious
issue facing the ABA membership is a proposal to overhaul rules
preventing lawyers from setting up partnerships with accountants,
consultants and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 11,500 lawyers are expected to attend the ABA
meeting, held primarily at the cavernous Georgia World Congress
Center. President Clinton is scheduled to speak before the ABA's
House of Delegates on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell will have a chance to push the city's legal
agenda during an ABA luncheon Friday at the Commerce Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think certainly the kind of horrific events that have
happened in Atlanta recently will heighten interest in the
discussion of gun litigation at the ABA convention,'' said Dennis
Henigan of the Washington-based Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,
referring to the killings of nine office workers by
chemist-turned-day trader Mark O. Barton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a serious look at how guns are designed and
how they are sold,'' said Henigan, who will speak before a gun
litigation seminar Monday. ``Whenever you have a mass shooting like
this, it's a vivid demonstration of why guns are so unique. It's an
important part of our thinking about what we as a people have a
right to expect from an industry that sells such lethal weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure to be discussed will be whether the city of Atlanta can
overcome a new state law, enacted by the General Assembly five days
after the gun lawsuit was filed, that bars such litigation against
the gun industry. The industry, led by Smith &AMP; Wesson, recently
filed court motions asking Fulton County State Court Judge Gino
Brogdon to dismiss the lawsuit on those grounds, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week with members of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution editorial boards, ABA President Philip
Anderson expressed disappointment that the Legislature moved to
pre-empt Atlanta's gun litigation.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement was reached with the tobacco industry through
litigation, at a time when the executive branch, Congress and the
industry were at an impasse, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our court system we obtained a resolution of a
pressing social health issue,'' the Little Rock lawyer said.
``We've got the same thing looming with guns. ... I think the
courts can make a significant contribution to the resolution of the
problem. That means, I personally believe, handling cases from
cities filing suit against the gun manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said another issue that has sharply divided the
profession is the proposed rule change affecting legal services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controversial and it should be controversial,'' Anderson
said. ``It is one of the most important issues facing the legal
profession in our lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, a special ABA panel recommended the sweeping change,
which would allow accounting, insurance and consulting firms to
begin practicing law. The idea has gained momentum over the past
several years because it has become an increasingly common practice
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, if adopted, could allow lawyers specializing in
estate planning and wills to form a partnership with financial
consultants selling life insurance policies. Opponents of the
initiative claim it could create a ``one-stop shop'' where the same
firm could sell insurance, tax return and legal services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could absolutely change the face of the way professional
services are delivered,'' said Atlanta lawyer Linda Klein, a member
of the ABA's Georgia delegation. ``But there are dangers, because
you always want the people who give you legal advice to be thinking
only of you and not themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The main challenges facing the proposal are making sure the new
arrangements do not entangle lawyers in conflicts of interest,
preserving the sanctity of the attorney-client privilege and
preventing non-attorneys from engaging in the practice of law,
Klein said, adding, ``If we can do those three things, there might
be a benefit to the consumer.

 &HT;    House gun lawsuit debate shows bitter battle lines
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional debate Wednesday over whether the
Department of Housing and Urban Development can sue firearms
manufacturers quickly turned into a partisan battle over gun
violence in America.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee heard testimony about whether HUD could
join 23 cities and counties in a legal assault on the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that HUD had no business entering the
lawsuit. And they were not persuaded when Gail Laster, general
counsel to HUD, said there were no plans to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust this administration as far as I can throw
them,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a staunch opponent of the
lawsuits against gun manufacturers. ``That's just more of that
Clintonesque word parsing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he didn't see why gun makers should be held
accountable for criminals who misuse guns.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said HUD had every right to contemplate a lawsuit
given the level of violence in housing projects and elsewhere. In
1997, 500 homicides were reported by the nation's 100 largest
housing authorities alone, according to HUD officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the Republican leaders are willing to defend
their friends even though their friends and contributors make
products that kill,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   The debate went back and forth for close to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the session, Barr had asked Laster to repeat at
least four times that HUD had no plans to file a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Laster said nothing would preclude any of the nation's 3,400
housing authorities from suing on their own. And she noted that HUD
might be brought into such a lawsuit as a third party. In addition,
the agency could file a ``friend of the court'' brief supporting
such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussions with housing authorities have indicated that there
is a broad interest in taking some kind of action to cut the costs
of gun violence,'' Laster said. ``HUD does not, however, plan to
bring its own action against the gun industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing comes at a time when tensions are high on Capitol
Hill over what to do about guns. Last week's mass killings in
Atlanta have prompted new cries for tougher gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said earlier this
week that party disputes were serious enough to derail any gun
control legislation before the month-long recess Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, an NRA board member, also is a member of a conference
committee of House and Senate lawmakers assigned to hammer out gun
control differences in juvenile-crime bills that passed each
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But Barr appears resolved not to budge from his position that
existing gun laws should be enforced before new laws are added.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also said that he intends to research whether he can amend
the spending bill that funds HUD to prevent the agency from filing
a lawsuit against gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Barr said. ``They think they can just
decide to file a lawsuit? I don't think so.

 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Equating the Boy Scouts of America with public
accommodations such as restaurants, libraries, schools and
theaters, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that the
organization's 1990 expulsion of a gay assistant scoutmaster
violated the state's anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-0 decision, the court first rejected the Boy Scouts'
arguments that it is a private organization and that its decision
to remove the assistant scoutmaster, James Dale, was protected by
the First Amendment. The court also dismissed the Scouts'
contention that homosexuality is immoral, comparing that argument
with discrimination against women and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding that Dale's dismissal was ``based little more
than prejudice,'' Chief Justice Deborah Poritz declared: ``The sad
truth is that excluded groups and individuals have been prevented
from full participation in the social, economic and political life
of our country. The human price of this bigotry has been enormous.
At a most fundamental level, adherence to the principle of equality
demands that our legal system protect the victim of invidious
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate opinion, Justice Alan Handler, who is widely
considered the court's staunchest liberal, said he agreed with much
of his colleagues' legal reasoning. Then Handler, who is retiring
after this term, concluded his 44-page opinion with something of a
sociological and philosophical lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One particular stereotype that we renounce today is that
homosexuals are inherently immoral,'' Handler wrote. ``That myth is
repudiated by decades of social science data that convincingly
establish that being homosexual does not, in itself, derogate from
one's ability to participate in and contribute responsibly and
positively to society. In short, a lesbian and gay person, merely
because he or she is a homosexual, is no more or less likely to be
moral than a person who is heterosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Dale, who is now 29, is the second one to have
reached a state's highest court. But the New Jersey result is the
opposite of the outcome of the earlier case. In March 1998, the
California Supreme Court ruled that the Scouts could expel
homosexuals. That court held that the Boy Scouts were a private
organization not covered by California's civil rights law and that
the organization had constitutional rights of freedom of
association and freedom of expression to expel homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stevenson, a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America,
expressed disappointment with the New Jersey ruling and said the
group planned to appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts of America is a private organization with the
right to set our membership and leadership standards,'' said
Stevenson. He argued that New Jersey's anti-discrimination law did
not supersede the organization's First Amendment rights of
association. Consequently, he reasoned, New Jersey's high court had
used the state's anti-discrimination law to discriminate against
the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman applauded the ruling during a public
appearance in Bergen County. She said she did not believe in
discrimination ``in any form'' and said a person's sexual
preferences were private matters. ``If the troop leader is a good
leader, there's no reason to worry about his sexual preferences,''
said Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who was an assistant scoutmaster at Troop 73 in Matawan
when he was expelled, said he was elated with the ruling. ``The
Supreme Court of New Jersey is wonderful,'' he said, as he appeared
with his lawyer at the headquarters of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund in Manhattan. ``This is what scouting taught me:
goodness will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Evan Wolfson, called the ruling ``a strong, clear
powerful decision by one of the nation's most respected state
supreme courts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision we got today is a win/win decision,'' Wolfson
said. ``It's a victory for Jim Dale and it's a victory for other
gay men like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale, who lives in Manhattan and helps arrange health fairs for
people with AIDS, said he wants to return to scouting. The ruling
ordered his reinstatement and instructed a lower New Jersey court
to take up his request for compensatory and punitive damages
against the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dale joined scouting in 1978 at age eight, obtained more than 25
merit badges and scouting's highest rank and honor _ Eagle Scout _
and eventually became assistant scoutmaster. The Boy Scouts
considered him an exemplary member, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But in July 1990, his photograph appeared in a local newspaper,
identifying him as co-president of the Gay/Lesbian Alliance at
Rutgers University. Soon afterward, the Scouts sent him a letter,
informing him of his expulsion and saying that the Scouts'
standards for leadership forbade membership to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision said Dale asked various Scout executives
for a copy of the standards of leadership but was never given one.
In late 1990, the organization's lawyers told him that the Boy
Scouts ``does not admit avowed homosexuals to membership.'' He
began his legal fight soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   During court arguments over nine years, the Scouts argued that
the organization believed homosexuality was immoral and that belief
was both explicit and implicit in the Scout Oath that a scout is
``morally straight'' and in the Scout Law that a scout is
``clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The court disagreed with that argument in its 89-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In finding that the Scouts were a ``public accommodation'' as
defined by the state's anti-discrimination law and not a
``selective'' private organization, Chief Justice Poritz wrote that
Congress had chartered the organization, that 87 million boys and
men had joined Scouting since its inception in 1910, and that
churches and police and fire departments routinely sponsor local
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most important,'' she wrote, ``it is clear that Boy Scouts
does not limit its membership to individuals who belong to a
particular religion or subscribe to a specific set of moral
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Boy Scouts teach tolerance and the understanding of
differences in others and that the group's charter and bylaws do
not permit exclusion of any boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Scouts is not `distinctly private' because it is not
selective in its membership,'' the chief justice wrote. Largely
because of its broad membership and large size, she dismissed the
Boy Scouts' arguments that First Amendment freedom of ``intimate
association'' _ usually reserved for family relationships and small
groups whose members share common thoughts and beliefs _ shielded
the organization from the anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing the argument that the First Amendment right of
``expressive association'' allowed Dale's dismissal, the chief
justice said the organization's ability to disseminate its message
would not be impaired if he was a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Scout members do not associate for the purpose of
disseminating the belief that homosexuality is immoral,'' she
wrote. ``Boy Scouts discourages its leaders from disseminating any
views on sexual issues; and Boy Scouts includes sponsors and
members who subscribe to different views in respect of
homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice said the court agreed with the Scouts'
espousal of moral values. But she said it disagreed with the
contention that the Scout Oath's principle of `'morally straight''
and its admonition that a scout be ``clean'' meant that
homosexuality is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words `morally straight' and `clean' do not, on their
face, express anything about sexuality,'' she wrote. Thus, she
said, Dale's membership does not violate the Scouts' right of
expressive association.
</P>
<P>
   That, she concluded, ``suggests that Dale's expulsion
constituted discrimination based solely on his status as an openly
gay man.''
</P>
<P>
   Expelling him was not justified by the need to preserve the
organization's expressive rights, she said. And she held that
expulsion solely in the grounds of sexual orientation was
``inconsistent with the Boy Scouts' commitment to diverse and
representative membership.''
</P>
<P>
   In his concurring opinion, Handler said the Boy Scouts' legal
contention in the Dale case that homosexuality is immoral is out of
touch with current law, public policy and social mores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Scouts' adherence to `traditional moral values,' its
`belief in moral values,' '' Handler said, ``remain undisturbed and
undeterred by Dale's open avowal of his homosexuality.''

 Online sites help take sting out of beloved pet's death  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Noreen Morrone had her Labrador retriever, Thai, put to sleep in
April when the 12-year-old dog's arthritis grew so severe, she
could barely stand.
<P>
   Thai's ashes are now in Morrone's home, but her likeness _
standing in the grass, Frisbee in mouth _ lives on at
aplb.org/frameset4.htm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice little tribute,'' Morrone said of Thai's permanent
presence on the Web site of the Association for Pet Loss and
Bereavement. ``Every time I go online, I see her.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone. The Internet is now home to a number of virtual
pet cemeteries, where grieving pet owners leave memorials to
departed pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It addresses the need to honor the pet's memory that goes
beyond the private,'' said Wallace Sife, a New York psychologist
and founder of the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement. ``It
offers consolation. It's a way of finding closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest such resource by far is the Virtual Pet Cemetery,
run by a San Francisco multimedia company called LavaMind. The
Virtual Pet Cemetery calls itself ``the world's best known and most
cherished online burial ground.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may or may not be the case, there's no question that
the hundreds of tributes posted at the site are heartfelt and
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bandit, thank you for bringing us happiness and love, you will
be missed, and you will be remembered with love,'' wrote Kerry
Gibson and Steve Lamontagne to their cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss her talking and whistling. I miss her intelligence. I
miss her,'' wrote Sharon Dubois of her parrot, Georgie. ``She was
the most wonderful bird in the world. She will always live in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget her,'' wrote Mary Dey of her horse, Blue.
``She was my horse and I trained her, but she taught me more than I
ever taught her. We were more than horse and owner. We were
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And on and on. The Virtual Pet Cemetery now has 25 ``plots,''
each containing dozens of memorials. Some include pictures, some
are poems. Some are just a few lines long, and some offer detailed
accounts of full, happy lives.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people visit the Virtual Pet Cemetery every day just
to browse the epitaphs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the brainchild of husband-and-wife Web designers Steve
Hoffman and Naomi Kokubo, who request a minimum fee of $1 per
memorial. Most people pay about $15, they say, which helps cover
the cost of posting and maintaining text and pictures online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very emotion-based site,'' Hoffman observed.
``People are really pouring out their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Pet Cemetery was conceived about five years ago,
mostly as a lark. ``It was originally started as a Net
experiment,'' Hoffman said. ``The result is a thriving online
community.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a way to steer traffic to LavaMind's other sites,
which sell computer games. While Hoffman and Kokubo admit that this
is a benefit of operating the Virtual Pet Cemetery, they insist
that they're not in it for profit and have turned down requests
from companies seeking to advertise amid the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Sife, the pet loss association founder, said some online pet
cemeteries seek to exploit people's vulnerability by hawking
merchandise or services. There was one online burial ground that
offered, for a fee, to help people contact the spirits of departed
animals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sife views the Internet as a generally positive resource for
bereaved pet owners and organizes online support groups several
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who don't want to go to a group session because they
don't want to sit in front of others find our chat room perfect,''
he said. ``We refer to it as coming out of the closet with feelings
about your pet. The Internet offers the immediate availability of
counseling and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Martin found this support a godsend after her cat, Kitty
de Chelly, succumbed to feline leukemia a year ago. ``He was with
me for 31/2 years,'' she said. ``He was a marvelous cat. I was
devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining an online chat group for similarly bereaved pet
owners, Martin discovered that her feelings of loss and sadness
were not unique, and this helped hasten the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who talk with you and share your
experience,'' she said. ``Having a group available on the Internet
was a very powerful way of dealing with loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin now counsels others. ``There's an almost palpable sense
in the chat room when a new person comes online who has lost a
pet,'' she noted. ``Everyone wants to help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the Internet is that people can find others
around the country who are experiencing the same thing,'' said
Lorri Greene, a San Diego psychologist who specializes in pet-loss
counseling. ``It's a marvelous tool for helping people grieve.''
</P>
<P>
   After grief has been faced, psychologists say a memorial service
is an important way to say goodbye to a loved one and move on.
Posting a tribute at an online pet cemetery has become a crucial
step for many in achieving peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   John Mingo launched his online burial ground, In Memory Of,
after losing his cocker spaniel, Candy. His online tribute to her
drew responses from others, and the site now consists of more than
400 free-of-charge memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened to me, I thought I was the only one,'' Mingo
said. ``The Internet allows people to recognize that they aren't
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It also allows people to explore some of the metaphysical
aspects of losing a beloved pet. At Dogheaven, an online community
for people who have lost pooches, visitors are assured that dogs
hold a blessed place in the holy firmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a coincidence that this is revealed to us so clearly by
the simple reflection of the word DOG in a mirror?'' the site asks.
</P>
<P>
   It can only be hoped that such an insight is of value to the
likes of Blackie, a Labrador Retriever eulogized at the Virtual Pet
Cemetery by Mickey Huffstetter. A poem relating Blackie's fate
begins like this:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here lies Blackie,
</P>
<P>
   Chased a car,
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the muffler,
</P>
<P>
   Dragged through the tar,
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner,
</P>
<P>
   Across the track,
</P>
<P>
   He might not be dead,
</P>
<P>
   But he never came back.
</P>
<P>
   On the Net, if nowhere else, Blackie lives on.

INTERNET STOCKS DIVE AS NASDAQ EXPERIENCES CORRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet stocks suffered another pummeling Wednesday
as the technology-laden Nasdaq market slumped for the fifth
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq fell 47.99 points, or 1.85 percent, to 2,540, and is
now down 11.3 percent from its high of 2,864.48 on July 16, meaning
that it is experiencing a correction. Wall Street considers any
decline of more than 10 percent a correction and one of 20 percent
a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Other market gauges also declined on light trading as investors
continued to be concerned about the possibility of further
increases in interest rates as they await crucial reports on the
economy Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average declined 2.54 points, to
10,674.77. The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was down
16.85 points, or 1.27 percent, to 1,305.33.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to have gotten scared and tired'' in recent weeks,
said George Cohen, a portfolio manager at Cohen, Klingenstein &AMP;
Marks. Internet stocks, he contended, have been particularly
vulnerable to this shift in sentiment because they were bid up to
absurdly high levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not giving any sign of bottoming yet,'' said Scott
Marcouiller, an analyst at A.G. Edwards, referring to this most
speculative of sectors. ``Our recommendation is to avoid them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com tumbled 6 7/16 Wednesday, to 88 7/16; Ebay fell 8
5/8, to 75 3/4; CMGI declined 5 7/8, to 76, and Priceline.com
dropped 6 13/16, to 66 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a heck of a meltdown,'' said Fane Lozman, chairman
of the Chicago research company, Scanshift. ``People have lost huge
sums.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, stocks pushed higher during the early going, only to
sag in the afternoon, this time buoyed by a firming of the bond
market after the Treasury announced that it would be reducing
auctions of bonds and using some of the budget surplus to buy back
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped as much as 152 points,
aided by the proposed acquisition of Union Carbide by Dow Chemical.
Shares of Carbide rose 10 9/16, to 59 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Financial and drug stocks helped drag the Dow lower.
</P>
<P>
   American Express and J.P. Morgan each slid 3 3/16, to 123 1/2,
and 124 1/8, respectively, while Merck fell 2 1/2 to 64 1/2 and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson 2 3/6 to 92.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend were some companies tied closely to the
economy. International Paper rose 2 15/16 to 54 15/16 on talk of
higher prices but analysts expressed surprise at strength in such
stalwarts of Alcoa, Minnesota Mining and Exxon, which were up more
than a point each.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread distress elsewhere in the sector, an
initial public offering by Internet Initiative Japan, which
connects Japanese companies and consumers to the Internet, met an
enthusiastic reception. Shares of the Tokyo-based concern climbed 8
5/16, to 31 5/16, as 11.5 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two more initial public offerings were withdrawn,
according to Thomson Financial Securities Data _ Reynard Motorsport
and Country Maid Financial. Also withdrawn this week were
Mobilvest, Simtek, Spectrascience, Avado Brands and
Travelscape.com.

JAILED MOTHER MISSES FUNERAL OF INFANT SON WHO DIED IN HOT CAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fort Worth Star-Telegram) 
(Eds.: Accent marks needed over both e's in Protege) 
 
By KRISSAH WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An overflow crowd of family and friends gathered
Wednesday at Life in Christ Church in nearby Stafford to say
goodbye to 8-month-old Senon Arteaga Jr., who had been left
overnight in a hot car.
</P>
<P>
   But absent from the more than 100 mourners was the boy's mother,
Sandra Ann Arteaga, 30, charged with leaving him early Sunday after
a night of drinking and jailed on $20,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Senon Arteaga Sr., attended the funeral along with
the couple's remaining children, Angel, 5, and Cassandra, 3. The
father's cries echoed throughout the small church, known officially
as ``Iglesia la Vida En Cristo,'' during the one-hour service
conducted in Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Perez, who gave the eulogy in Spanish, stood
above the closed coffin as mourners prayed for the infant and his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do anything for the child now, because he is in the
hands of the Lord,'' Perez said. ``This baby, I would like to be
like him. He did not recognize sin. We know he is in a better
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The infant was the third child to die in an overheated car this
summer in Houston. He was buried in Greenlawn Memorial Park
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the family called the baby's death a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a casket so small, and I hope I never see
another one,'' said Christina, who asked that her last name not be
used. ``Sandra loved her children. She is a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina has worked with Arteaga, a receptionist, at a local
nonprofit organization for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Vasquez, who occasionally attended Full Gospel Christian
Church with the family, said she had never known Arteaga to neglect
her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she was sober, she wouldn't have done that,'' Vasquez said.
``She took those kids with her everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston homicide investigators said Arteaga, her husband and two
of their children were visiting friends in nearby Spring when the
mother left with the infant and 3-year-old early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 a.m., Arteaga decided she was too drunk to continue
driving, so she parked at a gas station off Interstate 45 in north
Houston, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A limousine driver offered her a ride home, police said, and
Arteaga got in with her 3-year-old, leaving the infant strapped in
his car seat.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't notice the tot was missing until the father arrived
home around 10 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County Sheriff's Department was called to help the
couple look for their car and child. A deputy found the Mazda
Protege with the dead child inside about 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature reached 97 degrees Sunday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The father has an extensive criminal history, including a 1993
felony conviction for burglary of a habitation, a 1991 conviction
for driving while intoxicated and another DWI arrest in May.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Marie Deleon, a friend of Senon Sr. for seven years, said,
``It hurts when you hear one of your good friends crying over his
baby. He talked very highly about his kids. It was just an
accident.''

 _ SF CHRON   Actions Louder Than Words for Columnist 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
And now, coming to the defense of beleaguered Mercury News reporter
Chris Nolan: her Internet brethren.
<P>
   Nolan wrote the Merc's Silicon Valley gossip column, Talk Is
Cheap, until she was suspended without pay for five days, stripped
of her column and exiled to cover suburban news in San Carlos and
Belmont after she made a quick $9,000 on an Internet stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the assertions are well known: Nolan said her friend,
the Autoweb chief executive, offered her a chance to buy stock
reserved for ``friends and family'' before the company's initial
public offering, and she told an editor about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News said Nolan never actually received approval and
created at least the appearance of a conflict of interest, which
compromised the paper's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knight Ridder should be ashamed of itself,'' Thom Calandra,
editor in chief of MarketWatch.com, a San Francisco financial news
Web site, said in reference to the Mercury's parent company. ``She
did consult her editors, and they dropped the ball. Her editors
should be banished to Redwood City, not her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, the executive editor of TheStreet.com, a financial
news site in New York, said the Mercury News did not appear to have
a clear-cut prohibition of stock ownership. ``She's paying the
price for some really hazy rule making,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And on the online magazine Salon.com, Managing Editor Scott
Rosenberg wrote that Nolan ``serves as a whipping boy for the
tut-tutting of old-line newshounds who resent the changes that the
Internet is bringing to their business.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nolan's friends have posted a Web site in her
defense, at www.fresher.com/chris.htm. Nolan is fighting the
suspension, seeking back pay for the missed five days; her union,
the San Jose Newspaper Guild, has filed a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, she points out that she was writing an article
for the next issue of Fortune magazine about the Autoweb stock deal
_ that was how the story broke in the first place. ``This has never
been a secret,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Professional Journalists has a Code of Ethics
that prohibits conflicts of interest but is silent on the specifics
of stock ownership, according to Tim Graham, the Northern
California chapter president. That may have to change, said Graham,
who is editor of TechWeek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many temptations out there in an emerging sector
like technology. (Journalists are) finding out a lot of things and
seeing financial opportunities that present themselves,'' Graham
said. ``There may be other Chris Nolans out there that just haven't
been reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's case has served as a lightning rod for all sorts of
journalists in the financial trades.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's Rosenberg wrote that his company is formulating an
ethics policy; similarly, MarketWatch's Calandra said his company
was already re-evaluating its policy, which allows reporters to own
stock, just not in the companies that they cover. ``On the rare
occasion, when there's no way around the conflict of interest, we
disclose it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited columnist Frank Barnako, a longtime investor in
Amazon.com and America Online, who writes regularly about Internet
stocks and whose column discloses his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   At TheStreet, editor Kansas said all staffers are forbidden from
owning any stocks, except in TheStreet.com itself. Reporters and
editors can own mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Non-staff contributors such as Jim Seymour or James Cramer, who
is also a company director and co-founder and who runs a hedge fund
that is active in the stock market, must disclose their stock
holdings when they write about those stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have valuable things to say,'' Kansas said. ``We want to
give them opportunity to write about things that they have
knowledge about as an insider, and when they write about things to
disclose their position.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock ban costs TheStreet in its recruiting efforts;
likewise, Calandra figures MarketWatch will lose some staff if it
enacts a similar prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that has vexed David Yarnold, executive editor of
the Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for paying reporters more,'' he said. ``In a valley
where the cost of living is high, everybody would agree with that
sentiment. But as a result, we should abandon our ethics? Give me a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DAVID VS ... DAVID &QL; 
feud is brewing between David Bunnell, the CEO of feisty tech mag
publisher Upside Media, and David Coursey, who runs a series of
popular conferences for Upside.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell is renegotiating Coursey's contract with Upside so that
other people can run the magazine's conferences, and he went so far
as to lock Coursey out of the company's file server room. ``We are
protecting our interest,'' Bunnell said. ``We took possession of
our data when we ended our contract with him. Any responsible CEO
on the planet would do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bunnell spoke about the situation Tuesday afternoon,
Upside issued a press release yesterday announcing the split. In
it, Bunnell praised Coursey for his ``key role in getting Upside
Events off the ground,'' but said he wants to pursue a ``different
direction'' with several other people running the conferences. The
new people have not yet been inked to deals.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Bunnell angrily denied rumors of impending
financial turmoil, saying the magazine just closed the September
issue with $1 million in advertising revenue, its biggest seller to
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you, the company is in good financial condition,'' he
said, conceding that ``from time to time, we have cash-flow
problems. They're very similar to other magazines I've been at. You
spend money, the bills come in before the revenues, they're
cash-flow issues, but that's all they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Coursey is an industry analyst known for his snappy trade shows,
such as Upside's Showcase and Digital Living Room, and Demo, which
is produced by International Data Group, now without his
participation. He declined to comment on his relationship with
Bunnell, saying only, ``We are renegotiating some things. It's not
clear exactly where things are this moment. I have nothing to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said only that two new conferences scheduled for October will
go on as planned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GLOOM AND BOOM?  &QL; 
The news came out last Thursday: U.S. wages rose 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Yahoo News ran a Reuters story on this, it put this
headline on it: ``Stocks Held Losses on Gloomy Wage News.''
</P>
<P>
   I guess it's gloomy for stock traders who lose money whenever
fears of inflation are exacerbated.
</P>
<P>
   But it's probably not such bad news for those people whose wages
went up.
</P>

PREMISE SEPARATES `SEBASTIAN   COLE' FROM TEEN PACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ If you're a confused adolescent _ or remember being
one _ this year has delivered a bumper crop of movies designed to
feel your pain. Ranging from the sublime (``Rushmore'') to the
subversive (``Election'') to the just plain stupid (``American
Pie''), these films have have served up teen-aged traumas that
include every demographic _ gay and straight, prom queen and social
outcast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest entry, ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole,'' scores
points for originality by having its troubled teen being reared by
a transsexual. That the man/woman in question is the most
responsible adult in Sebastian's world gives you an idea where
first-time filmmaker Tod Williams' sensibilities lie. This movie is
J.D. Salinger by way of John Hughes. And, for the most part, it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian (fine newcomer Adrian Grenier) lives a restless
existence in upstate New York with his high-strung mother (Margaret
Colin), college-bound sister (Marni Lustig) and stepfather Hank
(Clark Gregg). Everything is fine, if a little mundane, until the
day Hank announces that he has decided to become a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian's mom doesn't take the news well and whisks the
17-year-old off to her native England. But he's soon back in New
York, shunning his idiotic biological father (John Shea) in favor
of Hank, who now goes by Henrietta. In a way, it's an ideal
pairing. Both are outsiders struggling to understand themselves and
forge new identities. Of course, that commonality also produces its
share of problems as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian wants to be a writer and believes he must first have
some adventures (``like Hemingway,'' he says) in order to accrue
material. These episodes involve some standard elements of teen-age
rebellion _ motorcycles, late-night club-hopping and dangerous
girls, all of which hamper Sebastian's main goal, which is to leave
high school (and his small town) a year early.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sets his film in 1983 but doesn't overplay the
nostalgia card as, say, ``200 Cigarettes'' did earlier this year.
Likewise, the Hank/Henrietta role is nicely understated and never
lapses into caricature. Gregg plays the part with courage and
integrity, which is a refreshing change of pace from much of this
summer's smarminess.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the brooding Sebastian complains that he ``hates
all those dumb high school movies,'' and, indeed, ``The Adventures
of Sebastian Cole'' won't likely find a home with the ``American
Pie'' crowd. Williams' film doesn't reveal any big truths or
contain neat resolutions. If anything, it's a little too episodic,
and its structural creakiness catches up with it a bit at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are appealing adventures that truly seem bold and,
more importantly, authentic. But then, the movie pretty much has
the coming-of-age-with-a-transsexual-parent genre all to itself. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``The Adventures of Sebastian Cole'' (R, language and
crude sexual references). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Adrian Grenier, Clark Gregg. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Written and directed by Tod Williams. Released

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow Chemical Co. said Wednesday that it was acquiring the
Union Carbide Corp. for $9.3 billion in stock in a deal that would
join two household names and create a chemical giant second only to
DuPont in size.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither company makes consumer products any longer,
names they made famous, like Dow oven cleaner and the former Union
Carbide brands Prestone antifreeze, Eveready batteries and Glad
bags, still show up on supermarket shelves, made by others.
</P>
<P>
   Dow and Union Carbide now make lesser-known products like
polypropylene and ethylene glycol, so-called intermediate and basic
chemicals that crop up in everything from computers to food
wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   Declining profit and a cyclical slump in chemical prices put
Union Carbide in the market for a partner, and Dow is counting on
trimming its already low costs even further to help it compete in a
rapidly consolidating market. The merged company, which will have
combined revenue of about $24 billion, expects annual savings of
about $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will keep the Dow name and be based in
Dow's current home, Midland, Mich., plans to eliminate about 2,000
jobs, leaving a global work force of about 49,000. Although Union
Carbide _ and presumably its headquarters in Danbury, Conn. _ will
cease to exist as a separate entity, neither company would confirm
that the Danbury operations would be shut down or where the cuts
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dow has a number of businesses outside Midland, and maybe
we'll run some functions out of Danbury,'' said William S.
Stavropoulos, Dow's chief executive and the man who will head the
merged company. ``This is for the merger integration team to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of the new Dow, there are so many chemical
companies scattered across the globe that the merged company is
unlikely to command more than 12 percent of the market for any one
chemical market. Thus, analysts say it is unlikely to run into
antitrust obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Carbide's investors have seen their investment stagnate in
recent years. But Carbide's shares soared Wednesday, to $59.375, up
$10.5625. In contrast, Dow stock went down by $6.0625, to $118.625,
on the prospect that the company will issue new shares to close the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Carbide is one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones
industrial average _ a spot that many on Wall Street speculated
would go to the Microsoft Corp. but that history suggests may be
taken by the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger comes at a time when the companies that make
building-block chemicals _ look-alike products like ethylene and
propylene that are sold by the ton and differentiated primarily by
price _ have been joining forces throughout the world. Lyondell
Chemical, Millennium Chemicals and Occidental Petroleum pooled
their basic chemical businesses, while oil mergers like that of
Exxon and Mobil are creating huge chemical entities in addition to
oil giants. Merger mania has also embraced companies that make
specialty chemicals _ inks, foams and other technologically complex
products with small niche markets and high margins.
</P>
<P>
   Dow and Union Carbide have products in both camps, yet both have
marched against a broader trend in the chemical industry _ the
shift of many basic chemical companies toward agricultural
chemicals, pharmaceuticals and other so-called life sciences
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason that DuPont seems unfazed by the prospect
of a huge new competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `chemical company' doesn't accurately reflect the
DuPont of today,'' said Catherine L. Andriadis, a DuPont
spokeswoman. ``DuPont is a science company with a highly
diversified portfolio, and there are few areas where we compete
with either Dow or Union Carbide.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow and Union Carbide, in contrast, have remained focused on
using technology to become both the lowest-cost producers of older
style chemicals as well as finding more uses for them. Union
Carbide is among the largest makers of polyethylene and
polypropylene, two of the most commonly used plastics. It is also a
leading supplier of solvents and other chemicals to the paint
industry, and of various chemicals used in automotive, wire and
cable and personal care products.
</P>
<P>
   Dow, too, makes many forms of plastics and solvents. But Dow,
more than Carbide, has narrowed its sights in the last six years.
It sold its consumer products business to S.C. Johnson &AMP; Co. two
years ago and also shed its share in the drug company Marion
Merrill Dow. And while it has acquired some agricultural
technologies, it has expanded primarily by beefing up its existing
solvents, coatings and other process chemicals. It has squeezed
$2.2 billion out of its costs, and its profits and stock price have
risen accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger now is jump-starting the growth phase of our
strategy,'' Stavropoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide has a less successful tale to tell. The company
exited consumer products in 1985, primarily to raise cash to fight
off an unwanted takeover attempt. It has formed numerous strategic
partnerships with other chemical companies over the last few years,
but few analysts have been able to define a coherent strategy for
growth. Although its stock has run up nicely since April, most say
it was because of renewed interest in chemical stocks in general,
not any investor love for Union Carbide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Carbide has long been seen as a disappointment,'' said
James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ``It remained
static while everyone around was taking aggressive steps, and that
was the same as stepping backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company was badly hit by the Asian economic crisis
and by costly problems at its plant in Kuwait. To bolster lagging
shareholder confidence, William H. Joyce, Carbide's chief
executive, promised that he and several of his senior team would
forgo their base salaries if earnings did not hit $4 a share in
2000; at the time of the merger, few analysts were predicting
earnings to even hit $3.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, thus, may be saving Joyce and his executives a lot
of money. But, in a sense, it is costing them their jobs. Joyce,
63, will be vice chairman of the new company and will lead the
integration team but is unlikely to be involved in day-to-day
operations. And only one other Union Carbide person will join the
Dow board.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant proportion of Carbide's management will not be
with Dow Chemical a couple of years down the road,'' said Paul T.
Leming, an analyst with ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the sum of the two companies will be
far greater than either part. Dow says the merger will add to
earnings from day one, and that within two years it will have wrung
$500 million a year out of the merged company's annual costs.
Analysts believe them _ and expect the picture to get even rosier
over the next few years, when chemical prices are expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two companies have some overlapping product lines,
they have far more that are complementary. Both, for example, sell
various chemicals to paint makers; now they will be able to offer
large customers like Sherwin Williams one-stop shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Union Carbide shareholders will
receive 0.537 share of Dow for each share of Union Carbide. Based
on both stock's closing price on Tuesday, that meant the deal was
valued at $9.3 billion. Dow will also assume $2.3 billion in Union
Carbide debt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both companies have survived potentially catastrophic lawsuits
and public outrage over the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, Union Carbide had the dubious distinction of
being named one of the nation's dirtiest companies by the Council
of Economic Priorities, a corporate responsibility gadfly group.
And in 1984, the company garnered worldwide notoriety when one of
its plants in Bhopal, India, leaked toxic gas, eventually killing
as many as 10,000 people. Union Carbide paid a $470 million
settlement in India's Supreme Court in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Dow, meanwhile, was the target of widespread student protests in
the 1960s because it made napalm _ jellied gasoline _ for use in
the Vietnam War. Dow was the focus of litigation over the defoliant
Agent Orange, and its lethal byproduct, dioxin, which many Vietnam
War veterans said caused severe illness.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also embroiled in litigation over silicon breast
implants, made by its joint venture Dow Corning, which some women
said caused health problems. Dow Corning has offered to pay $3.2
billion to settle the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those cases represent financial threats for the future,
analysts said. Still, the bitter aftertastes continue to tarnish
their corporate reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those issues have had lingering impacts on their valuations on
Wall Street,'' said Leming, the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But even environmentalists acknowledge that both companies are
making strides to clean up their act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have demonstrated efforts to improve their environmental
performance,'' said Romi I. Gottfrid, an environmental research
associate at the Council on Economic Priorities, who cited the
merger as an opportunity for the combined company ``to emerge as an
environmental leader in the chemical industry.''

KENNY IRWIN'S FANTASY NASCAR RIDE RUNS INTO REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His racing fantasy is to win the Brickyard 400 back home, and
Kenny Irwin Jr. could silence his detractors by doing just that on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   You think transplanted Hoosier Jeff Gordon cried an ocean of
tears after winning the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994? Imagine
what it would be like if Indianapolis native Irwin _ tabbed by many
as the next Gordon two years ago when hired by team owner Robert
Yates _ could pull off his first NASCAR Winston Cup victory at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, Irwin has not become another Jeff Gordon.
Or the other Jeff Burton. Right now, 51 races into his Winston Cup
career with Yates, Irwin admittedly would be flattered to draw
comparisons to runaway rookie sensation Tony Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Irwin's status with one of the most coveted rides in
Winston Cup is uncertain as the series settles in for the sixth
annual Brickyard 400 this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Irwin spent most of last week's Winston Cup
off-weekend in Indy with his parents, eating favorite foods and
visiting family and friends on the back porch. He even revisited
his roots for an open-wheel U.S. Auto Club Silver Crown race in St.
Louis, where many of the questions that continually dog him in the
Cup garage area also surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Will Yates dump his onetime ``Wunderkind'' for a more
established driver?
</P>
<P>
   Has the transition from open-wheel to NASCAR Craftsman Trucks to
Cup really been that difficult?
</P>
<P>
   Was it unfair to think anyone could emulate three-time champion
Gordon's run of success?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Irwin pointed out that Indiana native Stewart _
fifth in points and directly ahead of Gordon _ is meeting and
exceeding expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just what everybody wants,'' said Irwin, 20th in points
during a season which has produced just one top-five and two top-10
results in the black Texaco Havoline Taurus. ``The car owners are
looking for the next Jeff Gordon and so are Chevrolet and Ford.
They want their next guy to be the greatest one, so I think
expectations are high no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living up to that, I don't know that it's hard because you can
only do what you can do. And after that, it's all a lot of talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, talk has been that first Terry Labonte and then Ward
Burton were being considered for Irwin's ride. Those rumors proved
false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fighting to keep my job,'' said Irwin, who balked at
the notion that he still is ``auditioning'' for Yates. ``No, that's
not how I feel. When he wants to make a change, then he'll make a
change, or vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the 1998 Cup rookie of the year, reiterated that Winston
Cup is where he wants to race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not convinced that it's gonna be in the 28 car
because there's so much that's around it,'' he said. ``But if
something would change, I feel like I can still get it done in
Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, there are options out there to consider after Friday, when
Irwin turns 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago me and my mom talked about stuff like this,
and that I have the opportunity to do other things,'' Irwin said.
``When I feel like it's absolutely no fun and I can still go and do
other stuff, whether it's who knows _ Indy-cars or Sprint Cars _
then I will make a change and go do something that is reasonably
more entertaining to myself and just stop there. I'm kind of
getting beat up every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   And after a fantasy weekend back home, there still are 15 more
races to go.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON: CRUZ PEDREGON
</P>
<P>
   Funny Car driver Cruz Pedregon and team owner Joe Gibbs
officially parted ways eight races into the National Hot Rod
Association schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But Pedregon said their relationship began deteriorating as
early as February, when he did not qualify the Interstate
Batteries/Hot Rod Pontiac Firebird for the season-opening
Winternationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal coming in was to win the championship,'' said
Pedregon, who returned to the points-paying Funny Car wars as
owner/driver during the Prolong Northwest Nationals at Seattle last
weekend. ``It was clear at the first event _ the DNQ at Pomona _ we
were not quite the team (everyone envisioned). It was very
discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon and Gibbs finalized their split during the Mopar Parts
Nationals in Englishtown, N.J., in late May. Pedregon said the
decision was made in a meeting during a rain delay, before Cruz
lost in the final against runaway points leader and nemesis John
``The Brute'' Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say it was my idea (to leave),'' Pedregon said. ``To
say we walked in there and had a brawl ... it was the opposite. We
felt we were getting freight-trained by John. It made it easier for
us, that maybe now is the right time. Although it seemed like an
abrupt thing, it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out four national events, Pedregon qualified 10th
at Seattle. He was a first-round loser against older brother Frank.
But ``The Cruzer'' showed up with a five-race sponsorship from
goracing.com, crew chief Ronnie Swearingen and a fresh outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really happy as a driver the last year or two,'' said
Pedregon, whose 1992 NHRA Funny Car championship is the only one
not won by Force this decade. ``I lost the hands-on approach. I was
not a happy person. I made good money, but I don't do this for the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Top Fuel driver Tommy Johnson Jr. is wheeling
the big green-and-black Firebird for Gibbs as the tour heads into
the Autolite Nationals at Sonoma, Calif., this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great car and I enjoyed driving for Joe Gibbs,''
said Pedregon, who has 21 national event victories. ``At the same
time, I felt the team was stagnant and we weren't clicking like we
should. There's a tremendous amount of pressure. And if you feel
you're being questioned and have any pride at all, you have to move
(on). And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   SLEEKER NASCAR TAURUS 2k DEBUTS
</P>
<P>
   Devoid of the fake ``four-door'' hoopla that surrounded its
original introduction in the summer of 1997, Ford Motor Co.
unveiled its new-look 2000 NASCAR Taurus in downtown Indianapolis
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed the Taurus 2k, the car is scheduled to debut at the
2000 Daytona 500 in February. But its introduction was neatly timed
to maximize media coverage in town for Saturday's Brickyard 400 at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Development work on the new Taurus has been a joint effort
between Ford Racing Technology and three of Ford's top NASCAR teams
_ Penske Racing South, Robert Yates Racing and Roush Racing, with
additional input from many of Ford's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our best to keep all our race teams in the loop on
where we are in the development of this new Taurus,'' said Dan
Davis, director of Ford Racing Technology. ``We've certainly
learned from our experience of two years ago when we changed over
to Taurus, that it's difficult for teams to race week-in and
week-out and also have to worry about the development of a new race
car.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its production counterpart that goes on sale this fall, the
2000 Taurus Cup car features new front and rear fascias, a new
hood, a revised trunk area and new rear window design.
</P>
<P>
   The Taurus 2k has visited the wind tunnel in recent weeks, but
its first on-track test will not come until early fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have challenged our teams to change over to another
new model,'' Davis said, ``but we're confident that the changes
will keep us at the top of the championship standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford drivers Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin are 1-2 in the points
chase. Ford also has a 9-6 lead over the Chevrolet Monte Carlo in
race victories. A new version of the Monte Carlo also will make its
racing debut at Daytona in February.
QUICK HITS
READY TO RECONCILE?
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League star Greg Ray of Plano says a possible
reconciliation with the rival Championship Auto Racing Teams was a
hot topic in the paddock at Dover Downs International Speedway in
Delaware last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more talk than I've heard in a long time about the
series coming together,'' said Ray, who won the MBNA Mid-Atlantic
200 and moved to within two points of Pep Boys IRL series leader
Scott Goodyear with three races remaining. ``I have mixed emotions
on it. The IRL is a great series on its own and getting more
competitive every race. The more you dig into it, the more a lot of
this is coming from the CART side. I think it's inevitable the two
will end up together. It's not going to happen next year. The best
that I can gather, 2002 would be the absolute first, full-blown
combination year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ray said he expects a number of CART FedEx
Series teams to put together one-off efforts for the Indianapolis
500 next May. CART lineups juggled
</P>
<P>
   A number of driver changes are scheduled for CART's Tenneco
Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Super-sub Roberto Moreno will replace the injured Christian
Fittipaldi at Newman/Haas Racing. Fittipaldi was fourth in the
championship race when he suffered a subdural hematoma during an
accident while testing Monday at Gateway International Raceway
outside St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno comes off an eight-race stint subbing for Mark Blundell
at PacWest Racing. Blundell has recovered from a small fracture of
the seventh cervical vertebra suffered while testing at Gateway on
May 4. Also, Naoki Hattori of Walker Racing will make his first
appearance since suffering a double compound fracture of the left
leg during a first-lap accident at the season-opener at Homestead,
Fla., on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes will see Jan Magnussen replacing P.J. Jones at
Patrick Racing and Gonzalo Rodriguez making his first CART start
for Marlboro Team Penske. EARNHARDT'S NEW LOOK
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt is sporting a new look at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway this week. His trademark mustache is gone for the first
time in 17 years, a sacrifice to his determination not to be beaten
_ at anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael (Waltrip) made me shave it off,'' said Earnhardt, a
seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion. ``We were down in the
Bahamas on Saturday, snorkeling, and he was getting down deeper
than I was. I was drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   The bushy lip, it turned out, prevented a tight seal between his
mask and his face. And so it went.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt could add another item to his burgeoning resume Friday
in the finale of the True Value International Race of Champions at
IMS. Earnhardt has won the first three rounds of the four-race
series matching 12 top drivers from various series in equally
prepared cars. If Earnhardt can win the 40-lap, 100-mile sprint
around the 2.5-mile Speedway, he will become the first driver in
the series' 23-year history to sweep all four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt won IROC championships in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Defending series champion Mark Martin trails Earnhardt by 20
points, and is the only driver capable of overhauling him for the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unique to race in IROC,'' said the elder Earnhardt, who
is racing against son Dale Jr., NASCAR's Busch Grand National
champion, in this series for the first time. ``To win is also
great. To come in and win three races already this year and maybe
set a record by winning four is pretty unique. But guys like Mark
Martin, Rusty Wallace and these guys are not wanting that to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my kid's in there, aggravating the hell out of me.'' LAST

FORMER NFL EXECUTIVE HOPES TO GET MLS ROLLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though his football experience is in the American rather than
the European definition of the sport, Don Garber says his
background will suit him well as Major League Soccer's new
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Garber, senior vice president of NFL International since 1996,
was hired as former commissioner Doug Logan's replacement
Wednesday. Logan, commissioner since MLS' inception in 1996,
resigned, saying he lost the support of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Garber's 15 years with the NFL includes launching its NFL
International endeavor, but little experience in soccer. However,
Garber said his international background and business expertise
will be crucial in helping MLS increase its visibility and fan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not I played or I coached is not important to me in
the vision I have to lead this sport to the next level,'' said
Garber, 41. ``Pete Rozelle and Paul Tagliabue, neither of them
played football. ... I am confident and the owners are confident
that the managing and marketing of the game at the international
and grass-roots level are necessary to what it takes to get it to
the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan was criticized for poor attendance and flat television
ratings. Attendance has rebounded slightly this season but is still
far below the 17,602 average in 1996. Attendance at July's All-Star
Game was at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Subotnick, chairman of MLS' board of governors, announced
Garber's hiring, citing a need for the league to connect better
with its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at an OK level, but we're not where we'd like to be in
respect of the revenue and fan participation,'' Subotnick said.
``So rather than wait until this season is over, when a buying
season for sponsors would be over, we decided to make the change at
this time so we wouldn't lose another year.''
</P>
<P>
   After resigning, Logan said he had no concrete plans for his
future but expressed a desire to remain involved with soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no elegant way of saying you're fired,'' Logan said.
``There are great phrases you'll use along the way ... but they
allowed me the option of resigning.'' nn

JETLINER LANDS ONE BITE AHEAD OF WOLFHOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Puppies chew and dogs love to dig and scratch and claw
_ any owner will tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, however, is their behavior destructive enough to affect
the operation of a Boeing 767 airplane. But that's what happened on
board United Airlines Flight 174, flying to Boston from San
Francisco on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   An Irish Wolfhound _ the world's tallest dog which was bred to
hunt wolves, but is known as the ``gentle giant'' _ was in its
kennel in the cargo hold of the airplane when it somehow got loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, the first thing they want to do is get out
of the airplane,'' said an aviation source familiar with the
incident. So, the dog began to dig and chew through the fiberglass
liner of the cargo pit, that resembles the plastic cabin interior.
The canine then went through the soft insulation and then came upon
wire bundles, which he attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the dog biting a plane did not cause the pilot to
declare an emergency, although sources said the damage to wires
resulted in the loss of ``a couple of warning lights in the
cockpit'' and the pilot could not fully extend the plane's wing
flaps on landing. The flaps add lift to the plane as it slows to
land, so the airplane, with 159 passengers and a crew of nine on
board, landed at a faster speed than normal, although still well
within the design specifications of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation sources in Boston and Washington say dogs have damaged
airplanes before, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it
could find no record of service difficulties on an airplane being
caused by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, some 500,000 pets travel on commercial airplanes and
nearly all of them have happy endings. When something goes wrong,
the animal usually suffers the consequences, not the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of airplane wiring has gained the attention of
safety investigators and aerospace engineers in the wake of two
recent crashes. TWA Flight 800 exploded three years ago, killing
everyone on board, and investigators believe vapors in the center
fuel tank were ignited _ possibly by faulty wiring. And Swissair
Flight 111 went down off Nova Scotia a year ago because of an
on-board fire, possibly caused by faulty wiring. But it is aging,
chafing, and vibrations that are considered prime threats to the
integrity of wire. Not dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still investigating the circumstances of how an Irish
Wolfhound escaped into the hold of the aircraft,'' said United
spokeswoman Susana Leyva. ``While we are concerned about the
incident and were inconvenienced, the crew acted promptly when
instruments indicated a possible problem. There was no emergency
declared, none was needed, and the plane landed safely.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight landed around midnight. Mechanics worked to repair
the damaged wiring, and the aircraft was back in service the next
morning, Leyva said.
</P>
<P>
   When baggage handlers opened the cargo door ``there he was, just
wagging his tail, happy to see to them,'' said the source.
</P>
<P>
   That the dog could get out of a kennel, and try to bite or claw
its way out of the cargo hold ``gives you some idea of the sort of
panic the animal felt,'' says Nancy Blaney, director of the
national legislative office of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the trade association and
lobbying group for the nation's major airlines, says that in less
than 1 percent of the cases is something amiss. But that is too
high a number for the ASCPA and some politicians. Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) introduced legislation in June requiring
airlines to make sure all cargo compartments are heated,
ventilated, and air-conditioned. The legislation would increase the
amount of compensation airlines would pay owners for lost, injured
or killed pets, and require better reporting of pet mishaps while
in the custody of airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the US Department of Agriculture's animal and plant
inspection service, is responsible for enforcing the Animal Welfare
Act, but has no accurate figures on the number of dogs and cats
killed, injured or lost each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several years, however, it has levied nominal fines
against airlines, which usually charge $50 to transport an animal
with a ticketed passenger, for mistreatment of animals.
</P>
<P>
   USDA filed a complaint against TWA on June 8 for vioalting the
Animal Welfare Act for causing the death of ``Quick'' a 6
1/2-year-old Golden Retreiver from hyperthermia. It fined the
airline $4,000 in 1996 for failing to transport animals while
ensuring their safety and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines was fined $6,500 in 1998 for placing six dogs in
the live cargo hold, but not providing adequate ventilation while
the flight was delayed for 90 minutes. Three of the animals died.
</P>
<P>
   USAir was fined $25,000 last year for eight separate violations
from 1991 through 1995, including crushing a cat in a cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines was fined $25,000 in 1993 for a series of
violations in the early 1990s, including transporting six dogs on a
flight that resulted in four of them suffocating from lack of
oxygen and a ramp worker driving a baggage conveyer over an
enclosure that contained a cat, killing the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Without the legislation, the ASPCA recommends leaving pets at
home, or finding alternative transportation, said Blaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``If travel is absolutely essential, try to make sure the flight
is non-stop, from point A to point B and fly during cool times of
the day.''

 &QL; 
Q: If you're such a Mac expert, how come your column about moving
files from an old Mac to an iMac didn't include the best solution _
putting the old files on a CD with a CD-R or CD-RW drive? That's a
heck of a lot easier than the complicated approaches you suggested.

<P>
   A: The technologies you mention definitely are cool, not just
for the job at hand, but also for lots of others.

<P>
   A little background: CD-R stands for ``Compact
Disc-Recordable,'' and RW, in this context, stands for
``ReWritable.''

<P>
   Both technologies let you create compact discs with up to 650
megabytes of your own files on them. CD-R discs are read-only: Once
the files are written, you can't change them. With CD-RW, you can
overwrite files with new versions up to 1,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Any regular CD-ROM drive, including the one built into the iMac,
can read both CD-R and -RW discs. Then you can simply open the
files or copy them to the new machine's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't I mention these technologies in my July 1 column
on moving files to the iMac? Because CD-R and CD-RW drives, which
generally cost at least $300, still are ``power user'' tools, not
the sort of thing your average Performa user contemplating an iMac
purchase is likely to have around.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't already have such a drive, buying one to help
with the transition from old Mac to new is a really bad idea.
That's because old Macs work only with SCSI versions of such
drives, but the iMac has no built-in way to connect SCSI
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy adapters that make such connections possible, but
they mean extra cost, complexity and, often, compatibility
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if a friend with a SCSI CD-R or -RW drive
will lend it to you, or if you can make it worthwhile for a dealer
or consultant to do the job, putting all your old data on a CD is a
great solution: It not only makes the transition easy, but gives
you a permanent, relatively indestructible backup in case you need
it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Backup Plan
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a way to back up the data on my iMac, and a
CD-R or CD-RW drive sounds like a good solution. Are there any that
work with the iMac? And which is better, R or RW?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Clearly, CD writing is the topic of the month! Until recently,
there weren't any CD-R or CD-RW drives for the iMac, but happily
that situation has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies including Sony, APS Technologies and QPS now
offer external CD-R and -RW drives that connect to the iMac's
Universal Serial Bus ports.
</P>
<P>
   They're not cheap (still about $300 or more), and because the
capacity of USBs are limited, they're noticeably slower than
equivalent units for Macs and PCs with SCSI or ATAPI interfaces. On
the other hand, speed usually isn't a critical issue for backup _
just start the operation when you're about to go out or to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Judging between CD-R and CD-RW, I vote for the latter. RW drives
are a bit more expensive but not by much, and they give you more
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, blank CD-RW discs cost about 10 times as much as the
CD-R variety ($10-$20 each versus just a dollar or two for CD-R).
But you can use the cheaper discs even in a CD-RW drive when you
don't care about rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Applications and Upgrades
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own a Performa 636, and I'm thinking of upgrading to an
iMac, but neither your July column nor anything else I've read
answers my main question: What about my current applications _ will
they still work, or will I have to replace them all?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: In two words, it depends _ many older programs still will run,
but be prepared to upgrade a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   There are several issues here. First of all, the older the
application, the greater the odds that it's partially or completely
incompatible with the current Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even when old programs run on a new system, they might
not be taking full advantage of it. Your Performa has an old-style
Motorola 68040 chip; the iMac has a PowerPC, a completely different
kind of processor.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, like other PowerPC-based Macs, can run software
written for the 68040 and its predecessors but only in what's
called ``emulation mode,'' which is relatively slow. To get the
most out of any new Mac, you'll need to upgrade your programs to
``PowerPC-native'' versions, which are written specifically for the
newer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of how to install old programs on
the new machine if they came on floppy disks, because new Macs
don't have floppy drives. Third-party floppy drives connected to
the iMac's USB port work with 1.4-megabyte floppies but won't help
if you have old programs on 800-kilobyte disks.
</P>
<P>
   There are various work-around possibilities, but all in all,
your best bet is to budget for upgrades to current versions of your
main applications. They'll come on CD-ROM or via the Web, both of
which the iMac can handle with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Turn Up the Volume
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Power Mac G3, running Mac OS 8.1, regularly loses its
sound settings _ I seem to be resetting the volume almost every
time I start the machine. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, that's a fairly common problem, especially
with Mac OS 8.1. Fortunately, a fairly simple fix _ just trashing a
file or two _ often solves it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trick: Double-click your System Folder, then the
Preferences folder inside it. Look for a file labeled Monitors &AMP;
Sound Preferences and another called Sound Preferences. (You might
find only the former.) Drag both to the Trash. Restart your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A general note about Macs that go mute, especially after a
crash: The Volume slider in the Control Strip probably won't solve
the problem. Instead, open the Monitors &AMP; Sound control panel and
uncheck the Mute boxes.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way was cleared Wednesday for Richard Holbrooke
to win Senate confirmation as chief U.S. diplomat at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was all but assured of the post when the last senator
to block the nomination, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, announced that
he was releasing a ``hold'' that had prevented a final Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials said a vote would be held before the Senate
adjourns for its summer recess, which is scheduled to begin this
weekend. Holbrooke, a former ambassador to Germany and the
architect of the 1995 peace plan that ended the war in Bosnia, is
expected to be confirmed overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters of Holbrooke had hoped for a voice vote
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate aides said the vote was put off after Democratic
senators requested a roll-call vote, which they hoped would make
clear that Holbrooke enjoyed very broad bipartisan support despite
Republican political maneuvers that had blocked the nomination in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote, which may come Friday, will end the veteran
diplomat's 14-month struggle to win confirmation to lead the U.S.
delegation to the United Nations. The post, permanent
representative to the United Nations, has been vacant since
September 1998, when Bill Richardson left the job to become energy
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination, which was announced by President Clinton in June
1998, has been plagued by delays, first as the result of ethics
investigations of Holbrooke, then because of procedural maneuvers
in the Senate that had nothing to do with Holbrooke's
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley had blocked a final vote on the nomination, through use
of a senatorial privilege known as a hold, in protest over the
State Department's treatment of an employee who was recently
transferred to Washington from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley has insisted that the employee, Linda Shenwick, was
being transferred against her will as punishment for having shared
damaging information about the United Nations with members of
Congress and reporters. The State Department says that Ms. Shenwick
was insubordinate, and that she was not being punished for
whistleblowing.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read on the Senate floor, Grassley said he had
decided to lift the hold on Holbrooke, in part because his
negotiations with the Clinton administration had resulted in
``useful dialogue'' that could result in ``fair treatment for Ms.
Shenwick.''
</P>
<P>
   But he announced that he would place holds on three other
diplomatic nominations _ those of new ambassadors to the
Philippines, the Slovak Republic and Switzerland _ as the
negotiations over Ms. Shenwick's future continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interest, as I said, was not with Mr. Holbrooke. I intend
to vote for him,'' said Grassley, who has long campaigned to
protect so-called whistleblowers in the government. ``My interest
is, and has been from the beginning, in making sure the process for
Ms. Shenwick remains fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Holbrooke had no comment on Grassley's
announcement.

L.L. BEAN CATALOG MISSTEPS WITH WRONG PHONE NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spanking new L.L. Bean Kids' catalog offers teddy-bear
backpacks, sport leggings, day hiker boots, quick-drying socks and
more _ all the latest attire for the hip-and-rugged outdoorsy
child.
</P>
<P>
   But when potential customers called the phone number listed in
the Maine company's Back-to-School '99 catalog, they reached a
business in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   1-800-LLB-KIDS turned out to be 1-800-SNAFU.
</P>
<P>
   And the popular Freeport-based catalog giant is scrambling to
minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say a financial settlement is in the works for the
victim, a Virginia business that suddenly found itself inundated
with callers seeking such items as bear cub sherpa pullovers for
high-altitude toddlers, children's cargo vests with separate
pockets for crayons, rulers and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We guarantee everything except your grade,'' the catalog
promised its young, school-bound customers. But it couldn't
guarantee a correct phone number for catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   L.L.Bean declined to name the aggrieved Virginia company, other
than to say it is a child-oriented business, or confirm its exact
location. But spokeswoman Mary Rose MacKinnon said the firm
corrected the problem as soon as its officials realized what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when customers call, a Bean customer service
representantive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrangements have been made for us to assume the incorrect
phone number, to minimize the incovenience to our customers. We
regret the error,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the correct number should have been
1-877-LLB-KIDS. But some L.L.Bean employee working on production of
the catalog, believing that toll-free numbers begin with 800,
changed it to 1-800-LLB-KIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how that would happen,'' said MacKinnon,
sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   The new children's catalog was one of about 50 published by the
company famous for its Bean boot and flannel-lined blue jeans. The
faulty catalog arrived in customers' homes last week.
</P>
<P>
   The error was detected almost immediately, said L.L.Bean's
public relations manager, Richard Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked up on the problem on the same day'' that the
catalogs arrived in people's homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson declined to say how many catalogs were mailed with the
incorrect phone number, calling this ``proprietary information.''
Bean's typically mails millions of the catalogs to homes in the
U.S. and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Virginia business with the unfortunate phone
number ``was overwhelmed'' by callers trying to order items from
L.L.Bean's children's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the employee who made the error was not fired or
disciplined in any way. Still, the misstep was a blow to a company
that prides itself on sensitivity to customer needs and careful
marketing of its image.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1912, the company was named for founder Leon Leonwood
Bean (1872-1967.) Bean, a devoted outdoorsman, had bad feet and
lamented the way sweat condensed inside normal boots, making them
cold and damp in winter.
</P>
<P>
   So he created The Maine Hunting Shoe _ later known as the Bean
boot, with leather tops, rubber bottoms and special innersoles,
which he sold mainly through mail orders.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on functional outdoor gear, the company gradually
grew to become a dean of outdoor outfitters. The catalog business
has been the core of the company's success.

 _ SF CHRON  
 S.F. Firm Donates Computers to KLA  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A representative of the San Francisco office of Germany's Scopeland
Software yesterday handed over a first shipment of computers to the
Albanian rebels in Kosovo _ a move intended as a humanitarian
gesture but one that could strengthen the hand of the rebel group.
<P>
   The Provisional Government of Kosovo, comprised largely of
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, is not recognized by the
United Nations or the United States and has been implicated in
recent retaliatory attacks on Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The provisional government, based in Pristina, the province's
capital, could use its newly obtained Pentium III server,
workstations and network connections to develop an edge over
moderate political elements in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything is fluid. It's very delicate,'' said
Andres Ramirez, senior liaison officer for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in New York. ``In a situation where you
have a potential civil war, if you give equipment to one group, it
throws fuel on the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department official confirmed that Washington has
no official dealings with the Kosovo provisional government and
declined to comment on the ramifications of the info-tech donation.
</P>
<P>
   As Scopeland Software sees it, the provisional government, led
by former KLA commander Hashim Thaci, is in the best position to
swiftly implement measures to improve the lot of returning
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scopeland feels comfortable that this is the right thing to
do,'' John Kaufman, who oversees international operations for the
firm's U.S. subsidiary, said in a lengthy telephone interview from
Pristina. ``It's an educated act based on facts that we have
gathered from reliable sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman has been the prime mover for Scopeland's donation since
joining the company in May. Before starting with the company in San
Francisco, Kaufman spent several weeks visiting refugee camps in
Macedonia and Albania, and even traveled for three days with a KLA
unit battling Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dangerous thing,'' Kaufman said of his decision to
visit the Balkans amid NATO's bombing of Serbian targets. ``Some
would say stupid. But I wanted to see what these people were going
through. I wanted to get a firsthand view of things instead of
watching it on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   His experiences left him troubled. Upon taking a job with
Scopeland following a stint in Singapore with Compaq Computer
Corp., Kaufman began lobbying the database application maker's
chief executive, Karsten Noack, to donate funds to help Kosovar
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Scopeland has an office in Sofia, Bulgaria, that Kaufman said
was within a couple of miles of a stray NATO bomb strike.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about regional stability, Noack agreed to the request.
Later, Kaufman decided it would be better for Scopeland to
contribute about $80,000 worth of computer gear and software. ``I
didn't want to send a check,'' he said. ``You never know where the
money's going to end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman contacted the U.S. State Department in June and sought
help in bringing the equipment into Kosovo. ``I was shuffled around
from department to department, from person to person,'' he
recalled. ``The State Department complained that we were in too
much of a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Kaufman next contacted the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. ``They were extremely
helpful,'' he said. ``But they're a big machine. They don't turn on
a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said he was told by U.N. officials that it would take as
long as six weeks to set up the donated computers around Kosovo.
``I felt this wasn't the most expedient way to use our equipment,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so Kaufman went off on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in the security of Kosovo and the whole
region,'' explained Jurgen Kress, vice president of Scopeland and
head of the San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Scopeland feels about Kaufman's decision to directly
contact the Kosovo provisional government, Kress said only that
``he's acting on Scopeland's behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said Thaci, the provisional government's prime minister,
was at first wary of Scopeland's overture. ``Mr. Thaci has for a
long time dealt with people who have other agendas,'' he said. ``He
viewed any contribution with skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take long for Thaci to see the benefits of
possessing a state-of-the-art computer network, and he unpacked a
first shipment of one server and four workstations yesterday.
Kaufman said another nine workstations will arrive by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   As for how Thaci can be trusted to use all this gear for
humanitarian purposes, not political or military advantage, Kaufman
said he will ask Thaci to sign a document swearing that the
equipment will be used benevolently.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference next week will publicize the document to the
world, Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're holding Mr. Thaci's feet to the fire,'' he said. ``If he
breaks his covenant with us, the whole world's going to find out
pretty quickly.''

MARKET PLACE: IMAGINING A STRANGE WORLD WITHOUT U.S. DEBT OR
TREASURY BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With DEBT-BUYBACK, moved in `w' category)  
(DW) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, the government securities market has
grown exponentially as Uncle Sam has relied upon it to help finance
the nation's $5.5 trillion in debt. But looking ahead, the
financial markets are heading into strange territory, a landscape
in which Treasury securities _ a mainstay of professional hedging
strategies, an influence on consumer and corporate borrowing costs,
and a safe-haven investment for those with no appetite for risk _
will become increasingly scarce.
</P>
<P>
   What has been a suspicion since government surpluses first began
to emerge 18 months ago became more of a certainty Wednesday, when
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers announced an unusual proposal
that, if implemented, would allow the federal government to began
buying back some of its old bonds and notes. President Clinton has
said that he would like to pay off the entire national debt by the
year 2015.
</P>
<P>
   A world without Treasury bonds? No one in the market seems to
think that is likely. But market participants agree that a
profoundly important shift is occurring _ one that could ultimately
affect consumer and business borrowers, coupon-clipping investors,
mutual funds and their shareholders, and professional money
managers who rely on Treasury securities to hedge their riskier
debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sea change,'' said James M. Keller, senior vice
president and portfolio manager for U.S. Treasury securities at
PIMCO Advisers, an asset-management firm. ``I was struck by the
Treasury's observation that the last time there were two
back-to-back years of budget surpluses was in 1956 and 1957. I
wasn't alive then, so this is a new thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller added, ``The marketplace is really in search of a new
benchmark, one that they can price other investments off of. And we
don't really know what that's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's interest rates over the long run tend to
reflect its fundamental economic health, a shrinking supply of
Treasury bonds will probably cause the price of those securities to
rise relative to corporate and mortgage bonds, said Mickey D. Levy,
chief economist of Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been aware of this trend, but the Treasury has
sounded a wake-up call,'' Levy added. ``The total publicly held
Treasury debt is beginning to shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   Because supply and demand matter, he added, that is likely to
drive up the price of Treasury bonds, pushing down their yields.
That would be good news for corporate and consumer borrowers whose
loans are tied to the benchmark Treasury rates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the nation's debt was ballooning in the early
1980s, there was widespread concern that Uncle Sam would elbow out
other borrowers, making it harder and more expensive for them to
raise money. Thus, it is logical to hope that the reversal of that
trend will result in cheaper and more abundant credit for other
borrowers. As the budget surpluses have grown, the government's
share of the market for new bonds has declined, to 18 percent today
from 40 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But falling interest rates on Treasury bonds, the safest and
most liquid fixed-income securities in the market, would also trim
the interest income that new Treasury investors receive _ a
development that may prompt those wary investors to seek riskier
investments to maintain their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The same quandary may face people who invest in government bonds
through the nation's mutual fund industry. Short-term Treasury
bills and notes are the daily bread of the popular taxable
money-market mutual funds, some 685 of them holding more than $1.1
trillion in assets, that are used by millions of investors as a
place to park their short-term cash. Longer-term Treasury
securities are stuffed into a variety of other government-bond
mutual funds whose assets, as of the end of June, totaled roughly
$82.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, the portfolio manager, anticipates that the Treasury's
proposal could have a two-edged impact on his own fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``My holdings are in some of these bonds that the Treasury might
be seeking to retire,'' he said. ``So I may face a one-time gain,
yes. But going forward, there will be less of these cheaper issues
out there. There will be another competitor in the marketplace for
them _ the Treasury, with deeper pockets than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the plain vanilla world of mutual funds, Treasury
securities are used in a host of sophisticated hedging and
investment strategies _ as the world discovered last fall when one
large hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn.,
nearly capsized after a stampede of investors into the Treasury
market battered the bets the fund had placed on the future
relationship of various pairs of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders interviewed Wednesday said that they did not think that
a gradual reduction in Treasury debt would alter interest-rate
trends sharply enough to cause a similar disturbance. ``I think
people have been gun shy of putting those kinds of strategies on,''
said James Hamilton, head of swaps market-making in Europe for the
Bank of America's London branch.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been pushing for some new tool that would allow
the Treasury to streamline the inventory of bonds that are in the
public's hands, according to Keller. The hope, he explained, was
that the Treasury would be able to buy back ``the odds and ends'' _
bonds in the less popular maturities _ and replace them with bonds
that have become more useful as hedging instruments.
</P>
<P>
   If the Treasury does begin to focus its borrowing on certain
maturities, the esoteric derivatives and swaps markets would find
it easier to adapt to a world in which Treasury securities are in
short supply, said Paul Spraos, the publisher of the Swaps Monitor,
an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bonds have long been the swap market's equivalent of
Greenwich Mean Time, the point from which the prices of all sorts
of over-the-counter interest rate swaps are determined. ``But over
the past two years, we've seen a gradual cutback in the number of
auctions,'' Spraos said. ``Over time, the market has adjusted. But
there will come a time when it could be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As Summers announced the proposed debt buyback Wednesday, he
also said that the Treasury will auction new bonds only twice a
year in the future, in February and August, and will eliminate the
auction traditionally held in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry del Messier, a managing director of Barclays Capital, the
investment banking division of Barclays Bank PLC, said he thought
shrinkage in the Treasury market would ultimately boost the swaps
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will ever replace the government bond as the true
risk-free interest-rate. But we are seeing an increasing
willingness of investors to look to the swap rates as the
benchmark,'' Del Messier added. ``Swaps are a better hedge. We have
seen that in the sterling markets. And we are seeing an increasing
willingness of investors to accept swaps as proxies for buying
fixed-income securities.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller agreed that the interest rates established in the swaps
market are becoming increasingly influential among professionals on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the bonds issued by more familiar
government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae are more likely to
emerge as the new benchmark for consumer-driven money managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a mutual fund manager like myself, it is easier to go from
cash Treasury securities to cash agency debt than to make the leap
over the chasm to an instrument that is still perceived as very
exotic.''

BLUE CROSS SAYS EARNINS TOP $10 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sustaining a two-year profitability streak, Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Massachusetts Wednesday said it earned more than
$10 million during the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The positive numbers represent the ninth consecutive quarter in
which Blue Cross, the state's largest health insurer, made money,
after posting a $90 million loss for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to filings to be made next week with the state's
Division of Insurance, Blue Cross earned $19.5 million on revenues
of $1 billion in the first six months of this year. In the second
quarter, the insurer collected $507 million in premium revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Other insurers, including Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Tufts
Health Plan, and Fallon Community Health Plan, are not expected to
release their financial figures until after Aug. 15, the deadline
for filing with the state's Division of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Blue Cross' profits, as with many insurers, came
from money made from a sizable investment portfolio. The company
earned $12 million from interest income in the second quarter and
$735,000 from operations. After paying $2.5 million in federal
income tax, the company recorded a net income of $10.2 million for
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with an $8.3 million profit in the second quarter
of 1998 on $493 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross, however, stumbled on its managed care business,
called HMO Blue. The insurer lost $3.6 million from HMO Blue in the
second quarter on $293.5 million in revenue. The red ink was
generally attributed to the high cost of prescription drugs,
particularly in Blue Cross' Medicare HMO for senior citizens, said
Gary St. Hilaire, the company's chief financial officer. Blue Cross
lost about $1 million on Blue Care 65, its Medicare HMO, St.
Hilaire said.
</P>
<P>
   After steadily losing members for years, Blue Cross is starting
to slowly regain customers. The insurer since Jan. 1 has added
64,000 people, for a total membership of 1.68 million. Its managed
care business added 61,500 new members this year, for a total of
631,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about the results,'' said St. Hilaire, who
has projected Blue Cross would post net profits of $45 million for
the entire year. ``It appears we are going to meet or exceed that
projection.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Blue Cross has sought to turn around its finances by
raising premiums, getting rid of unprofitable businesses, and
selling assets to rebuild its reserves. By the end of June, Blue
Cross had reserves of $335 million.

 &HT;    Atlanta mayor: Families of shooting victims `are not alone'
 &HT;    By Gayle White and Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, speaking Wednesday at a
``service of hope and remembrance'' for the 20 lives taken in three
bloody incidents this month, said that, like the city itself after
the Civil War, ``we will rise again from the ashes of our
despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell began the service he organized at the Peachtree Road
United Methodist Church in Atlanta with a short, eloquent speech in
which he told the families and friends of the dead that ``you are
not alone _ it is on the rock of faith that we stand beside you.''
</P>
<P>
   The service began at noon with a moment of silence. Heavy
lunchtime traffic on Peachtree came to a halt as the church's bell
tolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence continues to cast a deep shadow,'' Campbell said.
``This year it has cast its shadow over Atlanta like never
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks' time:
</P>
<P>
   _ Six members of a southwest Atlanta family were shot to death
by a man who then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two members of the Cobb County police SWAT team were slain in
an assault on the house of a man who had shot and wounded another
officer and was later killed by a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   _ A deranged day trader beat his wife and two children to death
with a hammer and shot to death nine people in two Atlanta offices
before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to this: We are caught between heaven and earth
on a journey of faith,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Six rows of pews across the front of the elegant church were
reserved for the family and friends of the dead. When those
mourners were brought in from a side room, they packed the reserved
area. The rest of the church was not full. An usher estimated 700
people were in the sanctuary, which holds 825. A handful of
visitors joined reporters and cameramen in the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the service, a candle was lit for each of the 20
victims. In some cases _ such as the Cobb County policeman who lit
both candles for the dead officers _ one individual came forth. In
other cases, as many as four people came to the bank of votive
candles, supporting one person chosen to hold the lighter.
</P>
<P>
   No one was on hand to represent the six people killed in
southwest Atlanta; a church official lit their candles as their
names were intoned.
</P>
<P>
   The noontime moment of silence went unnoticed in much of the
city, although the ceremony was televised live.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were packed into the Varsity near the Georgia
Tech campus, but few paid attention to the three TV sets tuned to
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate manager Barbara Graham, fighting tears as she
watched one of the TVs in the busy restaurant, said, ``I think it
was really considerate that they scheduled this during lunch, and I
wanted to watch it because I really care about what's going on. I'm
really surprised that more people aren't watching it. I don't know
_ maybe other people care, too. They're just busy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Don Harp, senior minister of the church, said in his
message, ``We gather to reaffirm our understanding of life and,
unfortunately, death.''
</P>
<P>
   God ``shall be with us. He shall sustain us. He shall strengthen
us,'' Harp said. ``The people of God _whatever the faith _ shall
stand together to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, together, we must find ways to protect our
children,'' he said. ``Together, brothers and sisters across faith
lines, we're smart enough to find a way of curbing violence in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims in the most recent killings, which happened a
few blocks from the church, were a Jew, two Muslims and a Hindu.
Representatives of each faith spoke at the service.
</P>
<P>
   Amitabh Sharma, president of the Greater Atlanta Vedic Temple,
spoke on the Hindu belief in reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a body changes clothes, so the spirit changes its fleshy
attire,'' Sharma said. ``May each soul enter a body full of
luster.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Frank, Southeastern director of the American Jewish
Committee, and Deborah Lauter, community relations director of the
Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta and a cousin of Allen
Tenenbaum, one of the shooting victims, expressed dissatisfaction
with the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud the mayor for wanting the community to come
together,'' Frank said. ``I think we all came here for healing and
inclusiveness. But, for me, it was a very Christian service. There
wasn't one song that I could sing that included my way of speaking
to my God.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauter said that one of her relatives ``was so upset'' he ran
out of the service. She praised the mayor's remarks and those of
Harp, but she said that she was ``disappointed'' that a cross led
the processional and that prayers were offered in the name of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they meant well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Feroz Delawalla, brother of slain Muslim Dean Delawalla, said he
thought the service ``was really nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's spokesman, Nick Gold, who is Jewish, said: ``Perhaps
there could have been more sensitivity, but all in all, we think it
was a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Tech Investment Group, Inc., joined in the expressions of
sympathy for those who were wounded or killed by Barton at their
company and at Momentum Securities. An advertisement offering
All-Tech's ``sympathies and our prayers...'' is in The Atlanta
Journal and Constitution today.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the service, Campbell said the city
is discussing the possibility of creating a permanent memorial to
the recent victims of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying now to sort out what to do, but we want something
that perhaps could serve as a touchstone for healing for the whole
city,'' he said.

L.L. BEAN CATALOG MISSTEPS WITH WRONG PHONE NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spanking new L.L. Bean Kids' catalog offers teddy-bear
backpacks, sport leggings, day hiker boots, quick-drying socks and
more _ all the latest attire for the hip-and-rugged outdoorsy
child.
</P>
<P>
   But when potential customers called the phone number listed in
the Maine company's Back-to-School '99 catalog, they reached a
business in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   1-800-LLB-KIDS turned out to be 1-800-SNAFU.
</P>
<P>
   And the popular Freeport-based catalog giant is scrambling to
minimize the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say a financial settlement is in the works for the
victim, a Virginia business that suddenly found itself inundated
with callers seeking such items as bear cub sherpa pullovers for
high-altitude toddlers, children's cargo vests with separate
pockets for crayons, rulers and pencils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We guarantee everything except your grade,'' the catalog
promised its young, school-bound customers. But it couldn't
guarantee a correct phone number for catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   L.L.Bean declined to name the aggrieved Virginia company, other
than to say it is a child-oriented business, or confirm its exact
location. But spokeswoman Mary Rose MacKinnon said the firm
corrected the problem as soon as its officials realized what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when customers call, a Bean customer service
representantive answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrangements have been made for us to assume the incorrect
phone number, to minimize the incovenience to our customers. We
regret the error,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the correct number should have been
1-877-LLB-KIDS. But some L.L.Bean employee working on production of
the catalog, believing that toll-free numbers begin with 800,
changed it to 1-800-LLB-KIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how that would happen,'' said MacKinnon,
sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   The new children's catalog was one of about 50 published by the
company famous for its Bean boot and flannel-lined blue jeans. The
faulty catalog arrived in customers' homes last week.
</P>
<P>
   The error was detected almost immediately, said L.L.Bean's
public relations manager, Richard Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked up on the problem on the same day'' that the
catalogs arrived in people's homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson declined to say how many catalogs were mailed with the
incorrect phone number, calling this ``proprietary information.''
Bean's typically mails millions of the catalogs to homes in the
U.S. and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Virginia business with the unfortunate phone
number ``was overwhelmed'' by callers trying to order items from
L.L.Bean's children's catalog.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the employee who made the error was not fired or
disciplined in any way. Still, the misstep was a blow to a company
that prides itself on sensitivity to customer needs and careful
marketing of its image.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1912, the company was named for founder Leon Leonwood
Bean (1872-1967.) Bean, a devoted outdoorsman, had bad feet and
lamented the way sweat condensed inside normal boots, making them
cold and damp in winter.
</P>
<P>
   So he created The Maine Hunting Shoe _ later known as the Bean
boot, with leather tops, rubber bottoms and special innersoles,
which he sold mainly through mail orders.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating on functional outdoor gear, the company gradually
grew to become a dean of outdoor outfitters. The catalog business
has been the core of the company's success.

AS U.S. RELATIONS WITH U.N. LANGUISH, IS CLINTON OR CONGRESS TO
BLAME?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Relations between the United States and the United
Nations are at one of their lowest points in years, say diplomats,
senior U.N. officials and foreign policy analysts, with many
blaming President Clinton and his administration for the growing
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations are terrible, as troubled and as difficult as I can
remember,'' said Lee Hamilton, the Democrat who is a former House
foreign affairs chairman and is now the director of the Woodrow
Wilson Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and several other experts and diplomats say Congress is
the main culprit _ as does the Clinton administration. Congress has
refused to pay the organization $1.6 billion in back dues. It is
hostile to many U.N. initiatives that command wide support within
the international community, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   They also cite attacks from senior lawmakers like Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. He has spearheaded efforts to cut the U.S. share of
financing for the United Nations from 25 to 20 percent while trying
to impose reforms and program changes through legislation rather
than negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, the same experts and diplomats blame President
Clinton for letting the relationship deteriorate, failing to give
it priority or to fight forcefully for the United Nations in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being virtual AWOL, Bill Clinton has done this institution
incalculable damage,'' said a senior U.N. official, who spoke about
this politically sensitive topic, as did several others, on
condition that they not be identified by name or nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the secretary-general, declined to comment, but
senior aides who said they were familiar with his thinking spoke at
length.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials at the White House and the State
Department directly responsible for managing America's relations
with the United Nations declined to comment. But a spokesman for
the National Security Council disagreed with the widespread
impression at the United Nations that the Clinton administration
was indifferent or neglectful.
</P>
<P>
   The fault, he said, lies not with the administration, but with
Congress. He pointed out, for example, that Rep. Chris Smith,
R-N.J., attached a rider to the U.N. budget bill last year limiting
federal payments to groups lobbying to change foreign governments'
abortion policies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, the spokesman added, is ``working
hard'' to get legislation containing payment of U.N. arrears
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. diplomats and other advocates also say the Clinton
administration failed to fight hard enough for timely confirmation
of Richard Holbrooke as the chief U.S. delegate, which was delayed
for more than a year but now is expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and other advocates point to what they call a
pattern of blaming the United Nations for American policy missteps,
citing as an example the furor surrounding the death of American
soldiers on a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations did not even know what those soldiers were
doing, much less authorize it,'' a senior U.N. official said. But
senior administration officials thought they could protect
themselves against conservative attacks by ``undermining an
institution they should be strengthening for the good of the
country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. official said American resentment was stronger under
the Clinton administration than it was even during the presidency
of Ronald Reagan, who made no secret of his low opinion of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least with Reagan we knew where we stood and the United
States more or less paid its bills on time,'' the official said.
``But Clinton has made so many unfulfilled promises, then he stabs
us in the back and tells us that he feels our pain.''
</P>
<P>
   What had been quiet grumbling about Washington erupted into open
fury when Defense Secretary William Cohen complained that the
United Nations was moving too slowly to create a police force and
civil administration in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In response, John Ruggie, the senior-ranking American adviser to
Annan, took the unusual step of rebutting the Pentagon charges at a
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and State Department tried to distance the
administration from Cohen's remarks, taking pains to publicly
praise the United Nations and Annan himself. But several diplomats
and U.N. officials said the causes of disenchantment with Clinton
and his administration ran far deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense at the United Nations that people in
Washington who should be paying attention are not, due to their
concentration on budget and other issues and on the coming
election,'' said William Luers, head of the United Nations
Association, a private group that supports the organization.
</P>
<P>
   No issue has caused more resentment than Washington's failure to
pay its dues. ``We need money,'' said Joseph Connor, the American
former accounting executive who is now a U.N. under
secretary-general. ``We've had a zero-growth budget for eight
years. We're running on empty here and patching it all together.''
Connor said that to keep its vote in the General Assembly, the
United States must pay at least $350 million to the United Nations
this year on top of the money already approved by Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Kosovo. The United States has been assessed an
extra $40 million to pay for the initial peacekeeping forces. The
police, Connor said, ``must be paid or they'll leave.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bolton, an analyst at the conservative American Enterprise
Institute, said he was not surprised by liberal complaints that
President Clinton was not spending political capital on the
organization or by feelings of depression at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has consistently been willing to sacrifice
their long-term principles for short-term gain,'' he declared.
``Bill Clinton sees all foreign policy through the prism of
domestic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since partisan lines are now sharply drawn and are likely to
become even firmer as the national election approaches, Bolton said
he did not believe that relations between Washington and the United
Nations would improve. But unlike his liberal counterparts, he
partly blamed the United Nations for the growing tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans see the United Nations as an instrument of
foreign policy,'' he said, ``but neither as the dominant nor
indispensable one. As long as Kofi Annan wants his organization to
be the sole authorizer of force in the world _ which is what he has
said _ there will always be disappointment with any White House.''

CLINTON AGAIN PLEDGES TO VETO GOP'S TAX BILL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton promised to veto the $792 billion
Republican tax cut bill Wednesday even as GOP leaders were putting
the finishing touches on their plan to use $1 trillion in projected
non-Social Security budget surpluses over 10 years to give every
taxpayer a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they conclude this plan and send it to me I will have to
veto it,'' Clinton said of the final measure negotiated between the
House and Senate late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the plan ``risky and plainly wrong for America,'' the
president described it as ``a proven failure'' as he sought to
compare it to the massive 1981 tax cut pushed by then-President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped short, however, of labeling it ``Reagan II,'' as some
Democrats have done in an effort to portray the new GOP plan as
similar to the 1981 tax reductions backed by Reagan that Democrats
say contributed to the huge budget deficits of the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters after a meeting with his economic
advisers, Clinton suggested that the new Republican tax cut plan
could restart ``a vicious cycle of budget deficits and high
interest rates'' if surplus projections fail to materialize. He
said the plan would end up costing Americans more in the long run
than any tax cut over the next 10 years could return to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has come a long way in the last seven years _ from
recession to recovery; from economic disorder to a fiscal house
finally in order. We have even begun to pay down our debt,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should move forward with an economic strategy that is
successful and sound, not revert to one that is a proven failure,''
the president said, touting his own economic policies as helping,
along with many other factors, to erase the $290 billion budget
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The president called on Republicans to open negotiations with
him aimed at producing a more ``sensible'' tax cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to work for it and hope we can achieve it,'' he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has suggested a $250 billion tax cut over 10 years,
coupled with increased education and defense spending, and up to
$50 billion in new Medicare funding to help finance a prescription
drug program. He also has proposed earmarking more surplus money
for shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier this week if a deal was possible with the
president, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated
that there was little chance a deal could be struck because both
sides are so far apart on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes inaction is better than the wrong action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton threatened a veto and extended his olive branch as
Republican leaders wrapped up the details of their plan to provide
$792 billion in tax relief by lowering each of the five income tax
brackets by one percent, eliminating the so-called marriage
penalty, phasing out estate taxes, cutting the personal capital
gains tax rate and providing credits for everything from education
expenses to home care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,R-Texas, the
principle author of the House version of the bill, dismissed
Clinton's criticism, saying it was time to ``get this tax
overcharge out of Washington'' before the president and Congress
can spend it on new programs that will increase the size of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Republicans were proud to ``have kept our commitment
to protect the taxpayers and not the tax takers,'' despite
Clinton's warnings that the GOP plan would be bad for the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said the bill would help secure America's future by
providing ``meaningful tax relief'' and still leaving surplus money
from discretionary funds to shore up Social Security, strengthen
Medicare and help pay down a good chunk of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and other Republican leaders said they planned to move
the bill to the House and Senate floors for a final vote Thursday
and Friday, respectively. Although there is some resistance to the
large size of the tax cuts among some Republican moderates, the
bill is expected to pass by narrow margins in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the bill would be sent on immediately to Clinton for
his signature, but GOP leaders plan to wait until after Congress'
month-long summer recess, which runs from Aug. 7 through Sept. 7,
before sending it to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that most Americans favor earmarking surplus funds
for Social Security, Medicare and increased spending on defense,
education and other domestic programs. The delay in sending the
bill to the president is aimed at buying time for Republicans to
convince the American people of the benefits of a tax cut at a time
when they don't appear interested.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said they hope the numbers will speak for
themselves. Under their plan, each of the five income tax brackets
would lower gradually by 1 percentage point. For example, the
lowest 15 percent rate would fall to 14.5 percent in 2000 and 14
percent in 2006. The highest rate of 39.6 percent would be
gradually reduced to 38.6.
</P>
<P>
   The bracket reductions, the heart of the GOP bill, would cut
about $300 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also calls for doubling the standard deduction and
widening the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples filing
jointly, so that some joint income taxed now at 28 percent would
fall into the 15 percent category.
</P>
<P>
   That provision was pushed in large part by Republican Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and would return an estimated $100
billion to taxpayers over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping to use the elimination of the ``marriage
penalty'' as a key promotional element in their campaign to
persuade Americans to back their bill.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to use the cut in the personal capital gains tax
rate to sway opinion. Under the bill, the 20 percent capital gains
rate would fall to 18 percent on most sales and to 10 percent to 8
percent on others. The rate also would be adjusted annually for
inflation, and the effective date for receiving it would be changed
from July 1, 1999 to Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Archer had hoped to include a cut in the corporate capital gains
rate as well, but Senate negotiators refused to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Other key provisions of the bill include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expanding IRA contributions from $2,000 a year to $5,000,
which would save taxpayers an estimated $35 billion over the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the limits on Education IRAs from $500 to $2,000
for grades K-12, making the interest on some state and private
school pre-paid tuition plans tax free and extending the exclusion
for employer-paid educational assistance. The estimated savings
would be about $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost
of their health insurance premiums and giving people who care for
elderly relatives in their homes an additional personal exemption
of $2,750. The cost would be about $45 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing pension contribution limits on pre-tax salaries
from $10,000 to $15,000. This provision would increase portability
by permitting more rollovers among different plans and shrinking
vesting schedules for employer matching contributions from an
average of five years to three years. The cost would be about $15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination of the so-called death tax, phasing out the
federal estate, gift and generation-skipping tax. The cuts would
amount to $65 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bill would provide another $5 billion in tax
relief by promoting new economic growth initiatives in 20 targeted
communities around the country and indexing the adjusted gross
income and qualified expense limits for inflation.

 SEATTLE: _ so far.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris West, a spokesman for the Northwest Forestry Association,
an industry group, said Wednesday that the judge's ruling was just
``the tip of the iceberg'' and that it could eventually lead to a
ban on logging for lumber that could be used to build nearly
100,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would not in itself be likely to significantly affect
building activity or drive up the cost of lumber in general, but it
would curtail the amount of the old-growth wood on the market. Many
builders and prospective home owners, both here and in overseas
markets, consider it particularly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists say there is no good reason to allow
logging of the old-growth forests at all, and concern over the
forests is what sparked the first of the legal battles that have
been revived by the judge's ruling this week.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Dwyer issued a sweeping ruling that temporarily
halted all logging in the spotted owl's habitat region under
federal jurisdiction, nearly 25 million acres in all.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by both environmentalists who wanted the logging
permanently stopped and by industry officials who described the
judge's ruling as economically devastating, Clinton moved shortly
after he took office in 1993 to broker a compromise. He did,
permanently setting aside about 10 million acres of federal land on
top of millions of acres of owl habitat that were already protected
because they were in national parks or other wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, including the requirement for the wildlife
surveys, cleared the way for Dwyer to lift his ban. But it
satisfied neither side, and there is still a debate over whether
the plan is sufficiently protective of the owl.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service estimates that there are about 8,000 pairs of
owls in the Northwest. A recent federal survey found that the owl
population is declining at about 3.9 percent a year. Agency and
industry officials said the decline rate was significantly less
than what it had been and was in fact an indication that the
long-term plan for recovery of the species was working.
Environmental groups said the continued decline called into
question the whole plan, and they renewed their push for a halt to
all logging on old-growth land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it is committed to shifting
forest policy toward conservation. It announced earlier this year,
for instance, that it would continue its suspension of logging-road
construction in most of the national forests. So the judge's ruling
will also set the stage for a likely battle within the
administration over how the Forest Service should respond _ in
other words, whether it should contest the ruling or use it as a
continuing reason to halt logging projects.
</P>
<P>
   Heiken, of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said that the
group was not opposed to the 1994 plan, as long as it was
scrupulously followed. And he disagreed with the forest industry's
contention that it was being subject to renewed and unfair judicial
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the courts are here for,'' Heiken said.
``The point is, the agencies are going to have to come up with a
way to do it right. And as soon as they figure out how to do it
right, the judge will be out of the picture.''

SCARY MOMENTS, SMART SCRIPT SEE THIS GHOST TALE THROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Though it's hardly the jolt ``The Blair Witch
Project'' was, ``The Sixth Sense'' is a similarly pleasing, eerie
surprise. It's an unusually well-told ghost story, more a
parapsychological study than a horror movie, with solid internal
logic and a terrific twist ending that's beautifully, even
rigorously, set up.
</P>
<P>
   And even though fright is not the main agenda here, ``Sixth
Sense'' boasts a good half-dozen scary moments. That's six more
than ``The Haunting'' remake could manage.
</P>
<P>
   On the minus side is a slow-starting early section and one of
those ``sensitive'' Bruce Willis performances in which he whispers
most of his lines and employs one of two facial expressions (smirky
or lost-in-thought) for practically every scene. This even proves
to be a sound approach by the time we learn what's really going on,
but that doesn't make it any more engaging to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the movie's true star is expressive enough to carry
the piece just fine on his small, fragile shoulders.
Eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment, who played Forrest Gump Jr. and
Murphy Brown's son, brings complete conviction to haunted Cole
Sear, a boy with the ability to see dead souls but who only wants
to be normal.
</P>
<P>
   Understandable enough. But the way Osment plays him _ often
frightened yet empathetic, in an almost responsible way, to the sad
shades that reach out to him _ is immensely compelling. He creates
a spooked but brave little boy whose courage doesn't really come
from facing down the supernatural but from accepting the gift
that's the source of all his more mundane problems.
</P>
<P>
   Willis is Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a Philadelphia child psychologist
who becomes obsessed with trying to help Cole overcome his apparent
delusion. Crowe himself is driven by a recent trauma _ a former
patient (Donnie Wahlberg, overdoing it) broke into his home and
shot the doctor before taking his own life. Now, neglecting his
wife (Olivia Williams, from ``Rushmore'') to the point of driving
her into severe depression, Crowe lavishes attention on the
fatherless boy, determined not to fail another young patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Sense's'' writer and director, M. Night Shyamalan, comes
from a medical family, and what can only be called an inbred
bedside manner informs this sensitive, probing film. Cole's
relationship with his single mother, Lynn (Toni Collette, the fine
Australian star of ``Muriel's Wedding''), is observant and terribly
touching. The fact that the boy can't confide in her like he feels
he can with Dr. Crowe _ he just couldn't take her thinking that
he's a freak, like all the kids at school do _ honestly breaks your
heart.
</P>
<P>
   So even though it starts out like a slow-motion ``Omen,'' ``The
Sixth Sense'' is well worth sticking with. It's got story sense to
spare, which is about as rare as ESP in Hollywood these days. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``The Sixth Sense'' (PG-13; violence, language, children
in jeopardy). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.

 &HT;    Jones ready to play bodyguard for Bengals
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ His job title is left offensive tackle for the
Bengals _ the man who protects quarterback Jeff Blake's blind side.
</P>
<P>
   But Rod Jones envisions himself as a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Kevin Costner,'' Jones said. ``I'm a bodyguard. I'm
protecting Jeff Blake and, when he signs, Akili Smith. Those are
some high-powered folks, some big-money people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a 6-foot-4, 325-pound Detroit native whose mother grew up
in Dayton and attended Central State, has always been a solid run
blocker. But his vast improvement in pass protection has made him
one of the early stars of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   It took Jones four years to get his active hands in concert with
his quick feet so he could be comfortable against rushing defensive
ends. Why so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't figure out why `pass-pro' was such a hard thing for
me because I knew I had the feet to recover,'' Jones said. ``I just
couldn't hit the man like I wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a number of years, I've been carrying my hands a lot lower
than I should. But going home and talking to my father, we just
worked on my hands. He said, `You've got to keep 'em up.' It's just
like boxing. You've got to keep your hands up in the fighting
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is ready for the fight of his life as he enters his
contract season. A big year could yield big money when he becomes
an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   With incumbent left tackle Kevin Sargent sidelined with a
cervical strain, Jones suddenly becomes first string. If he
struggles, new acquisition Jamain Stephens could be inserted at
right tackle and Willie Anderson could move to left tackle. So
there's plenty of pressure on Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continually talk to myself and say, `Just stay consistent,
stay focused and stay concentrated on what you're doing,' '' Jones
said. ``The older I get, the more important my career becomes to
me. I'm studying my plays and watching extra film. I should have a
breakout season.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bruce Coslet sees room for more improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like he's establishing himself,'' Coslet said.
``His athletic ability is as good as anybody on our team for their
position. He's a stud _ a physical specimen. But he's got to bring
the complete game every snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said a tongue lashing from Steelers head coach Bill
Cowher on Friday night turned his life around. Stephens practiced
with the Bengals on Wednesday after being claimed Tuesday. He
weighed in at about 360 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got (my focus) back the night Cowher called me in his office
and notified me that I was released,'' Stephens said. ``He said he
felt I wasn't committed to the team with the way I came in camp and
struggled with conditioning. That's when I started doing a
self-check. I had to do a gut check.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said he sank into a ``pit of pity'' in Pittsburgh.
``But I'm revived. I was embraced from the time I got here. I want
to show this organization they definitely made the right move by
choosing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet wants NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue to make a decision
on kick-return star Tremain Mack so the team can adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, in trouble with the NFL for a series of alcohol-related
arrests, was allowed to report to training camp. But he could still
be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our understanding they'll give us a decision quickly,''
Coslet said. ``I would hope it would be before the week is out.
When you don't know what's going to happen, it's not good. So let's
just make the decision and go forward.''

 &HT;    Shepard plans to work vertical offense
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ Leslie Shepherd says he can't go anywhere in the
Washington, D.C., area without at least one fan wondering why he
isn't still playing for the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he knows the answer, but he can't really be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Shepherd says. ``A lot of people ask
that question. I think, considering what I did and what I brought
to the team, they knew what they had to pay me to keep me there.
They never offered me a contract. I guess they figured, instead of
giving me a lot of money, they could spread the wealth and let a
lot of guys play the role.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of featured receiver, that is. The role the Cleveland
Browns expect him to play this season after signing him as a free
agent and making him part of their start-up operation. Head coach
Chris Palmer told Shepherd he expects him to catch at least 80
passes, knowing full well he's never caught more than 43 in any one
season since beginning his career in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really predict you're going to do it, but just to
hear him say that is encouraging,'' Shepherd said. ``It means
they're going to try to get me the ball as much as they can in
different situations. So it's exciting. (Palmer) can't throw it to
me. He can't make the offensive line block for the quarterback and
he can't control the weather, but you like to hear things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from what Shepherd heard from the Redskins after
establishing a career high in receptions last season and scoring
nine touchdowns, eight through the air. Make no mistake, Shepherd
is glad to be gone from an organization seemingly awash in
confusion under the direction of embattled head coach Norv Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Titanic over there, man,'' Shepherd says.
``That's what we all say.''
</P>
<P>
   One team on the way down, another theoretically on the way up?
From where Shepherd sits, the move to Cleveland can only help his
career, especially if the Browns are true to their playbook and
throw the ball down the field regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vertical game,'' Shepherd said of the Palmer offense.
``You're going to see me catch a lot of stuff underneath and around
the zone because of the nickel defenses and three-wideout sets. But
for the most part, our first read is vertical. You're going to see
us take shots deep, maybe five or six times a game. And maybe you
catch two. You can't get it without taking a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the Redskins last season became frustrating,
Shepherd said, because the offensive line was young and struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught 43 balls in Washington because I got 43 balls thrown
my way,'' he said. ``When I was open, our quarterback was on the
ground. You don't get credit for being open. I'm looking forward to
this season. Every opportunity I get, I'm going to make some
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd may have some extra motivation for the Sept. 12 opener.
It's against Pittsburgh, the team that waived him in 1994 just
before the season started. He had all but made the team after
spending the previous season on the practice squad, but the
Steelers needed to make room for tight end Eric Green, who had been
holding out. Before spending a full day on the waiver wire, he was
claimed by the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Shepherd found himself on the move again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult and somewhat surprising to me,'' he says.
``It's puzzling to me and my family. But you've got to go with the
flow. I had to go somewhere where somebody wanted me and where I
could be productive and help them.''

RALLY IS TOUCHED OFF BY CUT IN DEBT SALES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of long-term Treasuries rose for the first
time in five sessions Wednesday, giving momentary relief to a bond
market that has been bracing for higher interest rates ahead of an
important employment report that will be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The market rally was touched off by Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers' announcement that the government would cut its debt sales.
Summers said that while the Treasury would go ahead with its $37
billion sale of new notes and bonds next week, it would eliminate
the May auction of 30-year bonds and limit their sales to February
and August. The Treasury is also planning to curtail sales of
one-year bills and two-year notes and will propose rules to buy
back selected issues of high-yield government debt.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 25/32, to 88
16/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, fell to 6.09 percent from 6.16 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Any reduction in supply has a tendency to bolster prices,
traders noted. But while bonds rebounded Wednesday, some market
participants do not think that the yearlong decline in prices is
about to reverse itself. Weighing on the market is the sale of
about $54 billion in government and corporate debt scheduled for
the coming weeks and the deep-rooted concern that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy-making
meeting, on Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the corporate sales will be this week's $5.5
billion issue from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which could reduce demand
for Treasury securities as investors sell Treasuries to make room
for the higher-yield paper.
</P>
<P>
   The government report Friday will contain details about
employment and wages in July. If the number shows the economy grew
at a strong clip, it could worry financial markets by increasing
the likelihood of an interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   The market is nervous and any economic data that show a
stronger-than-expected economy are not going to be taken well by
Wall Street. The warning by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, in
congressional testimony that the central bank would move quickly if
there were any signs of a resurgence in inflation was not lost on
investors who had thought that inflation was dormant and that no
rate increase was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank raises interest rates to avert potential
inflation, although such actions tend to hurt stock prices by
taking money out of the economy as it becomes more expensive for
companies and consumers to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability of a Fed tightening at the Aug. 24 Federal
Open Market Committee meeting has increased markedly in the
aftermath of Greenspan's comments during his Humphrey-Hawkins
testimony and a plethora of data indicating continued economic
buoyancy coupled with a perceptible pickup in the overall rate of
inflation,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Fine says that if the consensus projections of a 200,000
increase in payrolls, an unchanged unemployment rate and a rise of
0.3 percent in average hourly earnings are close to the mark, the
expectation of a Fed tightening toward the end of the month will
become even more firmly entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said the bond market had already priced in a small
increase, giving the Fed a green light to make another pre-emptive
strike later this year to ward off inflation. ``Quite clearly,
market observers will now require upcoming data to persuasively
suggest that a tightening move will not be forthcoming at this next
FOMC forum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In when-issued trading ahead of next week's quarterly refunding,
$15 billion of five-year notes to be auctioned on Tuesday were
being offered at a price to yield about 5.78 percent, while $12
billion of 10-year notes being sold on Wednesday were priced to
yield 5.88 percent and $10 billion of 30-year bonds for sale on
Thursday were priced to yield 6 percent.

 Frank Petrilli Backs Out Of Position at E-Trade  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In an embarrassing turnabout, the executive hired by E-Trade Group
to head its retail brokerage business has decided not to take the
job.
<P>
   Frank Petrilli, the No.2 executive at rival broker TD Waterhouse
Group, said in a statement released yesterday that he is keeping
his current job in New York for ``personal and family reasons`` and
won't jump to E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Petrilli's change of heart came less than two weeks after Menlo
Park's E-Trade, the nation's second-ranking online broker,
announced his appointment with great fanfare, stressing that he
would play a critical role in charting the company's strategic
course.
</P>
<P>
   The job Petrilli spurned, president of E-Trade Securities, is
one of the company's most important positions. The unit houses
E-Trade's main brokerage operations. Petrilli, 48, also was
promised a range of additional responsibilities, including
supervision of the firm's securities-processing and wholesale
brokerage businesses.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade said Chief Operating Officer Kathy Levinson, the
company's second-ranking executive, temporarily will continue her
dual role as head of the brokerage unit until a replacement for
Petrilli can be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is best for both companies that he came to this conclusion
now before coming on board with E-Trade,'' chief executive Christos
Cotsakos said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Petrilli's move, while humiliating, isn't likely to derail
E-Trade's rapid growth, analysts said. Fueled by tens of millions
of dollars in advertising, the brokerage boosted customer accounts
by 37 percent, to 1.24 million, in the three months ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was unfortunate, but it was not a deadly torpedo
to the hull,'' said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Bill
Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incident cast a spotlight on the hazards of E-Trade's
helter-skelter management style, which has seen the firm plunge
headlong in several directions, such as expansion into Internet
banking, wholesale brokerage and international operations all at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical E-Trade maneuver, the company got Petrilli's
acceptance on a Friday and rushed out with a detailed press release
the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When Petrilli's appointment was made public, ``I don't think he
had fully thought it through,'' said Burnham after speaking to the
executive by telephone yesterday.

 PUC May Drop Plan to Require 11-Digit Dialing  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
California consumers who have been dreading the upcoming area code
``overlays'' could get a reprieve from state regulators, who may
consider suspending 11-digit-dialing across the state.
<P>
   A draft decision issued by the state Public Utilities Commission
late Tuesday would require state regulators to reconsider whether
customers who have gotten area code overlays should have to dial 1
plus the area code and phone number for every call they make.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for a study to make sure that phone carriers
actually are using all the phone numbers they have been assigned
and aren't hoarding unused numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is expected to vote on the proposed decision on
September 2, but an alternate proposal may be introduced by one of
the five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposed decision is approved, it could be good news for
the Bay Area, which is supposed to get overlays in the 408, 415,
510 and 650 area codes during the next two years. The first Bay
Area overlay goes into effect this October in 408.
</P>
<P>
   Overlays are one way to deal with the growing shortage of area
codes. Instead of dividing a region geographically and giving
customers in one half a new area code, an overlay plan lets
existing customers keep their area code and assigns a new area code
to new phone lines. The downside is that everyone in the overlay
area must dial 1 plus the area code and phone number for every call
_ even those calls made to a neighbor across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC has approved a handful of overlays over the past few
years, but public outcry, pressure from state legislators and a
potential change in federal policy has prompted the commission to
take another look at 11-digit dialing.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators have imposed overlays to deal with the area
code shortage, but also to make sure that all phone companies are
treated equitably. With competition growing among local phone
providers, regulators have tried to make sure that new entrants
aren't disadvantaged by the area code changes.
</P>
<P>
   In a geographic split, the incumbent phone company keeps the
majority of phone numbers in the old area code while a new entrant
must assign a new area code. Because the majority of calls in a
split will be made to the old area code _ at least initially _
customers in the new area code often will have to dial 11 digits.
</P>
<P>
   That could discourage customers from switching to a new carrier.
In an overlay, everyone has to dial 11 digits, so it's seen as a
more fair proposition for new carriers who want to attract
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the PUC decision says that 11-digit dialing may not be
necessary in the near future because the numbering crisis soon
could be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including California, have asked the Federal
Communications Commission to change the way phone numbers are
assigned. Right now, phone companies get numbers in blocks of
10,000, regardless of how many customers they serve. For example,
if a company has only 500 customers, it still must get 10,000
numbers _ 9,500 of which would go unused.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is considering whether to assign numbers in blocks of
1,000 and have phone companies return their unused portion. That
would alleviate some of the problem and give new carriers access to
phone numbers in the old area code.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also is considering a petition from California that asks
for a ``technology specific'' area code for wireless phones and
pagers. That also may free up numbers if it's approved.
</P>
<P>
   Because these changes might happen, the PUC decision stated,
there may not be as much of a need for 11-digit dialing.
</P>
<P>
   But before California could suspend 11-digit dialing any place,
it must get a waiver from the FCC. Right now, federal law requires
11-digit dialing for any area code with an overlay. Several states
have asked the FCC for a waiver, but so far, the agency has not
granted any.
</P>
<P>
   However, that soon may change, given the pressure that states
are putting on the FCC to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do seem to be willing to at least consider it, which is a
significant movement,'' said Natalie Billingsley, a
telecommunications expert with the PUC. ``This is coming at a
critical juncture when both states and the federal government are
trying to jump start competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The PUC's draft decision is in response to a request from
Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, to halt the area code
overlay in the 310 region of West Los Angeles. Knox, who has a bill
pending in the state Legislature to change the way area codes are
assigned, said the overlay causes hardship and said phone companies
have not proven that they are running out of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed decision denies Knox's request to halt the area
code, saying the overlay must go forward in the 310 region to avoid
running out of phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers in 310 began dialing 11 digits in April, and a new
area code, 424, was supposed to go into effect in July. However,
the PUC temporarily suspended implementation of 424 last month so
that it could decide whether to do away with the overlay. The
proposed decision would require that the 424 area code be assigned
starting October 16.
</P>
<P>
   However, the proposed decision states that if the FCC lets
California eliminate 11-digit dialing then it also might be
rescinded for the West Los Angeles region and other areas in the
state.

EMERGENCY SPENDING MEASURES WOULD EAT UP MOST OF NEXT YEAR'S
SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also TAX-CONGRESS and DEBT-BUYBACK) 
(sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Wednesday night moved closer to
spending most of the projected surplus in next year's budget with
two ``emergency'' measures to aid farmers and conduct the 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, preparing to pass a $61 billion agriculture spending
bill for fiscal 2000, approved a separate $7.4 billion emergency
measure for farmers. The House, debating a $36 billion spending
bill to finance the Commerce, State and Justice Departments next
year, included a $4.5 billion emergency measure to pay for the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Next year was supposed to bring a federal budget surplus of
about $14 billion, the first in 30 years. Wednesday's emergency
measures, which total nearly $12 billion and are likely to pass in
some form, are a strong sign that the surplus may be largely spent
before it materializes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is already gone,'' said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin,
the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency spending, intended to address unexpected problems, is
a device that allows Congress to spend money beyond its budget. The
money can come from two places: cutting other programs or spending
out of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   But most domestic programs, except for the military, already
have been cut or frozen. There are surplus Social Security funds,
but Congress has deemed them untouchable, for now. That leaves one
alternative: tapping into next year's projected black ink.
</P>
<P>
   The House also scheduled debate on Wednesday night on yet
another emergency spending measure. It would allot $270 million to
cover $1.5 billion in loan guarantees for steel, oil and gas
companies. A fourth emergency measure is pending: $125 million to
back about half a billion dollars in loans for oil and gas
companies. The money would come from across-the-board cuts in
domestic programs in the current fiscal 1999 budget. The Senate has
approved these emergency measures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Obey called the Republicans' designation of the census
funds as an emergency a crime against common sense and ``a
prescription for chaos.'' The law says emergency spending is
supposed to finance unforseeable crises. The Constitution says the
government must carry out the census every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wholesale breach of the emergency designation would not be
too smart,'' said Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and the chairman of
the Appropriations Committee. But the creative accounting for
census funds was commanded by the House Republican leadership as a
way of appearing to hew to the strict limits on spending created by
Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has not declared financing the census an emergency.
Nor has the House matched the Senate's emergency measure for
farmers. The issues, like most of this year's spending bills, will
be resolved in a House-Senate conference in September.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to complete debate on the $36 billion
Commerce, State and Justice Department spending bill on Thursday.
The bill is more than likely to be vetoed by Clinton, according to
White House officials and House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It cut the president's spending request by nearly $3 billion. It
withheld $1 billion from the Commerce Department and another $1
billion from Clinton's program to help pay for local police forces.
It denied $506 million sought by the State Department and cut $329
million requested for the Department of Justice, including $182
million from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also bars the FBI from spending money on a program
called Fidnet, a new initiative to create a computer monitoring
system with the stated intent of combating ``cyberterrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill places legislative roadblocks against paying part of
the $1 billion in back dues the United States owes the United
Nations and also cuts back programs for civil rights and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, as written, slashed the budget for the Legal Services
Corp., which defends poor people in court, from $300 million to
$141 million. But on Wednesday the House voted, 242 to 178, to
restore most of that money, leaving the legal-aid group with a $250
million budget, a $50 million cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate earlier approved by voice vote a $7.4 billion
emergency aid package for American farmers. Republicans blocked two
attempts by Democrats to pass larger emergency aid packages, just
as they stymied an even bigger $10.8 billion plan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency aid package contains $5.6 billion in direct
payments to farmers, $400 million in crop insurance, and hundreds
of millions of dollars in various subsidies for livestock, cattle,
sugar beets, soybeans and other crops.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes, the Senate set aside an amendment, by a vote of
66 to 33, that would have ended price supports and loans for
American sugar growers. Senators also failed to break a filibuster
on a bill that would extend the Northeast Dairy Compact, which lets
farmers set milk prices, by another year.

SEATTLE ZOO'S AD CAMPAIGN BRINGS OUT THE ANIMAL IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You may have seen those cutesy commercials where the
chimp in the bellboy suit plays a mean game of chess, does the jig
and flashes a toothy, banana-stained grin.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo is flipping that notion on its
head - and offering a measure of revenge to furry actors
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its ballyhooed new ad campaign ``Find Your Inner
Animal,'' humans are being portrayed as being downright beastly.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the guy with eyes - a la Jack Nicholson in ``The
Shining'' - unfurl a beefy tongue and lap it up with the lions at
the ol' watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the woman in khakis scale a cliff and strike a regal pose
with the mountain goats.
</P>
<P>
   See the lady in the swank restaurant dis her steak-grubbing
dinner buddy, rocket to the dining room aquarium and thrust her
head in the tank. Ker-plunk!
</P>
<P>
   After splashdown, the woman resurfaces - with a giant fish
betwixt her teeth. The name of the spot? ``Grizzly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign takes a humorous approach to the zoo's philosophy
of immersing people into the world of animals and wildlife,'' says
Mary Lee Hanley, director of marketing at Woodland Park Zoo. The
zoo began the public service announcements on radio, TV and city
bus boards this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have animal instincts,'' Hanley points out. ``People
laugh when they see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those few nattering nabobs of negativism -
those people who say they don't like seeing homo sapiens being
portrayed so undignified, so raw.
</P>
<P>
   (Yeah, but those same people probably laugh their ascots off
when they see a fedora-wearing duck waddling with ``War and Peace''
under its wing!)
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Madison Avenue is praising the zoo's campaign -
the brainchild of Elgin DDB, a Seattle advertising company that
offered its creative services pro bono for the public service
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Adweek Magazine recently heralded the ``Grizzly'' spot as being
among the best in the country - right up there with ad spots from
Nike and Lexus. In addition, the campaign has made about 10 million
gross impressions (No, not what you are thinking!). Gross
impressions are an ad term for the number of people who see or hear
a spot.
</P>
<P>
   And this fall the zoo plans to push the gross by unveiling yet
another spot in which humans unleash their inner animals.
</P>
<P>
   In it, a housewife is cooking and gazing out a window while her
baby sits nearby in a high chair. When the baby knocks over a cup,
mom ambles over, vigorously licks the infant on the side of the
face and picks the baby up by its neckline. The spot is called
``Lioness'' - naturally.
</P>
<P>

advertising campaign humorously juxtaposes humans in animal-like
settings.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES BARKLEY OF INJURING HOUSTON MAN AFTER NIGHT AT
TOPLESS BAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A lawsuit accusing Houston Rockets forward Charles
Barkley of injuring a Texas man by causing a car accident went to
trial Wednesday with Barkley's attorney attacking the plaintiff's
motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What used to be the American dream has turned into the
American scheme,'' Richard Joseph told jurors in state District
Judge Dale Wainwright's court. ``The best tort reform is the 12 of
you (jurors).''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said plaintiff Jason Buckingham, 23, of Houston has
turned a ``minor accident into a $50,000 lawsuit'' to try to cash
in on Barkley's fame.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham claims he suffered a bulging disk in his neck when
his head hit the steering wheel in the Feb. 26, 1998, accident. He
is seeking reimbursement of $11,000 medical expenses as well as
unspecified damages for pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging disk put him in constant pain, he said, but his
condition improved after expensive steroid injections. He said he
still has recurrent flare-ups and ``can't play basketball any
more,'' something he said he used to love to do.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 2:15 a.m. CDT as Barkley, 36, was
driving out of the parking lot of a topless bar, where he had spent
a few hours with Minnesota Timberwolves players.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham testified he was driving his 1975 pickup westbound in
the right lane of a three-lane street in southwest Houston and
could not avoid hitting Barkley's Toyota Four-Runner during the
drizzly early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said Barkley, who is to testify Thursday, did nothing
wrong and that Buckingham had plenty of time to avoid the accident
by moving over a lane.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham said a car to his left prevented his moving over, but
in a January deposition he gave conflicting testimony as to whether
there was a car to his left.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by his attorney, Theresa Snodgrass, Buckingham
implied that Barkley had been drinking at the topless club, saying
the player told him immediately after the accident ``no sobriety
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said Barkley only drank Diet Coke that night, because he
had publicly stated he would not drink at all to see if it helped
his game. He denied that Barkley said ``no sobriety test'' and that
if anyone was impaired from alcohol before the accident, it was
Buckingham.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham said he had two beers hours before the accident and
that his driving was not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Police records said the accident was minor and Buckingham
reported having no injuries. Both cars suffered heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham testified he told police he was OK but ``felt like I
was going to be sore.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, he said, he contacted a lawyer, who referred him
to a chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever have to call a lawyer before to find a doctor?''
Joseph asked Buckingham sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham explained that he was referred to the lawyer and
``was in a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he missed two weeks of work as a cable technician and
was eventually fired because his injuries prevented his doing
strenuous physical tasks. He said he is employed in the same field
today without any changes in job description.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said no doctor ordered Buckingham to take time off from
work and that employment records showed he was fired for lying to
his boss about car insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham said he had never before seen the employer's note
about why he was fired, but contended he did not lie because he did
not know he was not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph also said Buckingham's medical records are inconsistent
about the kind of symptoms he complained of. Buckingham said a
doctor erred in describing the symptoms.

   NEW YORK _ Even as plans to create a Hollywood-style movie
studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard have seized all the attention,
Kaufman Astoria Studios is expanding its entertainment complex and
quietly solidifying the position of western Queens as the center of
New York City's flourishing television and film production
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Astoria Studios said Wednesday that its $8.3 million project
would include an 18,000-square-foot sound stage and support space
in a new building. The complex already has the largest sound stage
east of Hollywood and is home to the CBS television comedy
``Cosby'' and the Children's Television Workshop programs ``Sesame
Street'' and ``Cinderelmo.'' Feature films shot there include
``Ransom,'' ``First Wives' Club'' and ``Marvin's Room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as close to a Hollywood studio as you're going to get on
the East Coast,'' said Hal G. Rosenbluth, president of Kaufman
Astoria Studios. ``I'm thrilled. It's a project we've been working
on for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Astoria Studios dates from the 1920s, when the film industry was
based in New York and more than 110 silent movies were made there.
After a drought in the early 1990s, film and television production
is booming in New York. The number of films shot in the city jumped
to 221 last year, from 69 in 1993; television shooting days rose
113 percent to 7,680.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Astoria Studios comes only three months
after Silvercup Studios in nearby Long Island City began work on a
$20 million expansion. Silvercup, Kaufman Astoria Studios, Paris
Film Productions in Long Island City and Broadway Studios in
Astoria account for about two-thirds of the film and television
production space in New York City, according to industry
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several other proposals for television and film
studios, including the Navy Yard plan, which was unveiled in May by
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He said at the time that the city would
subsidize a $150 million project by the actor Robert De Niro and
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films, to turn a 15-acre
site into a glamorous film factory.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry welcomed the idea, but questioned the
wisdom of building a dozen large and expensive sound stages all at
once. They say that the ambitious project at the Navy Yard could
turn out to be a white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Walter L. McCaffrey, the city councilman from western Queens who
helped get the Astoria Studios project off the ground, is among
those who questioned the Giuliani administration's touting of a
project in Brooklyn that could undermine the film and television
industry in Queens. Astoria Studios, in particular, operates under
a long-term lease on city-owned land, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been mind-boggling to me that we were sort of
undercutting our own investment with the Navy Yard proposal,''
McCaffrey said Wednesday. City officials say they can handle all
the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although the De Niro project has been mired in disputes and has
yet to lock down its financing, the City Council is providing a
$2.5 million grant toward the $8.3 million expansion at Astoria
Studios, while the Empire State Development Corp. is contributing
$1.7 million in grants and loans and the city's Economic
Development Corp. is lending $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a genuine shortage of sound stages in New York,''
said Charles Gargano, chairman of Empire State. ``Unfortunately,
sound stages aren't moneymakers. But without them, you could choke
off the industry in New York.''

   SEATTLE _ Five years after the Clinton administration hammered
out a landmark plan to settle legal and environmental disputes over
logging across the Pacific Northwest, the region's timber wars are
flaring up again.
</P>
<P>
   The same federal judge who once issued rulings to protect the
northern spotted owl has now blocked nine major logging deals and
threatened to stop dozens of others by declaring that federal
officials have failed to take proper steps to ensure that other
species are being protected as well.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with environmentalists and enraging the forest industry,
U.S. District Judge William Dwyer of Seattle ruled Monday that the
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management had
unlawfully neglected to conduct detailed wildlife surveys on
federal forest land, as required by the 1994 compact, before
approving contracts allowing logging of parcels in old-growth
forests west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon and
in northwestern California.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who in 1994 had released the land agencies from court
oversight by approving the so-called Northwest Forest Plan,
declared that the agencies' actions were ``arbitrary and contrary
to the plain language'' of that plan. Under pressure from
environmentalists and the logging industry, the Clinton
administration brokered that compromise allowing logging on about a
third of remaining federally owned old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling this week effectively put the land agencies back
under a degree of court jurisdiction until they can show they are
doing a better job of monitoring logging's effects on 77 animal and
plant species, including rodents, snails, salamanders, mollusks and
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the species are considered indicators of the overall
health of the old-growth forest ecosystem. Under terms of the 1994
plan, all were supposed to be intensively surveyed by the federal
agencies, which say they believe they have followed those terms.
But the environmentalists, in their suit, said the agencies had
failed to do complete surveys before granting logging permission.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling has the immediate effect of blocking logging
plans for about 100 million board feet of timber. But even more
broadly, the judge indicated that his court's approval would be
needed before new logging could occur under about 200 other deals
in the region. If upheld on appeal, after a likely challenge from
the industry, the ruling could significantly curtail logging in the
majority of contracts approved by the federal officials in the last
three years in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was hailed as a ``blockbuster victory'' by one of the
lawyers for the 13 environmental groups who joined forces in the
lawsuit. A spokesman for the timber industry said it was
``disappointed that the judge feels he knows the plan better than
the professionals in the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The forest service said it was still studying the ruling to
assess its impact. But Rex Holloway, a spokesman for the agency in
Portland, Ore., said the forest service believed it had correctly
followed the guidelines of the 1994 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it is unclear whether the red tree vole, a small
rodent favored as food by the spotted owl, or the blue-gray
tail-dropper, a tiny snail, will acquire the emotional symbolism
that the owl brought to the fight over old-growth forests. Both are
among the species at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But it is certain that the fight is renewed, and that
environmentalists are again on the offensive, trying to move toward
a much broader ban on logging in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so little old-growth left, there's no good place to
cut it anymore at all,'' Doug Heiken, western Oregon field
representative for the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday. ``All of it should be protected for
future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit, says that
only 10 percent of the region's old-growth forests are left, and
that about 30 percent of that area remains eligible for cutting
under the 1994 plan.
</P>
<P>
   The industry, meanwhile, says the judge's ruling imperils
hundreds of logging jobs and the local economy in some pockets of
the Northwest and many are pressing Congress to relax the survey
regulations. U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has sponsored
legislation to relax some of the requirements of the environmental
surveys, making it easier for many of the timber deals to go
through, and the judge's ruling is likely to intensify the fight
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the region as a whole is far less dependent on logging
than it once was _ in Oregon, for example, the high-tech industry
is now a bigger source of jobs than forest-products companies. And
even in some places that were once deeply reliant on logging,
tourism built on the area's natural beauty is now a mainstay of the
economy, which leads at least some local business people to oppose
the logging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messes up the area, big-time,'' said Tom Vuyovich, owner of
the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Ore., on the edge of the
Cascades, who said much of his clientele consists of tourists drawn
to the area's natural beauty and its many recreational
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them look around, there are clear-cuts visible all
around, and they say, `What happened here. Where are the trees?'
They want to know where the old growth is, and I can carefully
point them out to the last few spots that have been saved _ so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris West, a spokesman for the Northwest Forestry Association,
an industry group, said Wednesday that the judge's ruling was just
``the tip of the iceberg'' and that it could eventually lead to a
ban on logging for lumber that could be used to build nearly
100,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would not in itself be likely to significantly affect
building activity or drive up the cost of lumber in general, but it
would curtail the amount of the old-growth wood on the market. Many
builders and prospective home owners, both here and in overseas
markets, consider it particularly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists say there is no good reason to allow
logging of the old-growth forests at all, and concern over the
forests is what sparked the first of the legal battles that have
been revived by the judge's ruling this week.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Dwyer issued a sweeping ruling that temporarily
halted all logging in the spotted owl's habitat region under
federal jurisdiction, nearly 25 million acres in all.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by both environmentalists who wanted the logging
permanently stopped and by industry officials who described the
judge's ruling as economically devastating, Clinton moved shortly
after he took office in 1993 to broker a compromise. He did,
permanently setting aside about 10 million acres of federal land on
top of millions of acres of owl habitat that were already protected
because they were in national parks or other wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, including the requirement for the wildlife
surveys, cleared the way for Dwyer to lift his ban. But it
satisfied neither side, and there is still a debate over whether
the plan is sufficiently protective of the owl.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service estimates that there are about 8,000 pairs of
owls in the Northwest. A recent federal survey found that the owl
population is declining at about 3.9 percent a year. Agency and
industry officials said the decline rate was significantly less
than what it had been and was in fact an indication that the
long-term plan for recovery of the species was working.
Environmental groups said the continued decline called into
question the whole plan, and they renewed their push for a halt to
all logging on old-growth land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said it is committed to shifting
forest policy toward conservation. It announced earlier this year,
for instance, that it would continue its suspension of logging-road
construction in most of the national forests. So the judge's ruling
will also set the stage for a likely battle within the
administration over how the Forest Service should respond _ in
other words, whether it should contest the ruling or use it as a
continuing reason to halt logging projects.
</P>
<P>
   Heiken, of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, said that the
group was not opposed to the 1994 plan, as long as it was
scrupulously followed. And he disagreed with the forest industry's
contention that it was being subject to renewed and unfair judicial
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the courts are here for,'' Heiken said.
``The point is, the agencies are going to have to come up with a
way to do it right. And as soon as they figure out how to do it
right, the judge will be out of the picture.''

 &HT;    `I lost it all:' Debt fueled calculated shootings
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last Christmas, Mark O. Barton sat down with his
estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day
trader in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost it all. I need help,'' he told Leigh Ann Barton, one of
the 12 people he would kill in July in a bloody rampage that
spanned three days and about 30 miles, from Stockbridge to the
office suites of Buckhead, ending in his suicide at a BP service
station in Acworth.
</P>
<P>
   As the story unfolds of a man haunted by mounting debt and
persistent accusations he had killed his first wife, new details
emerge daily about the astounding losses Barton suffered in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Barton lost as much as $450,000 gambling on Internet stocks in
the past year, ventures financed by money he obtained from his
first wife's life insurance settlement and possibly by tapping into
a trust fund set up for his two children, according to family
members and police.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt
to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he
methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock
trading offices in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he
got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't
afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his
sister-in-law, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, about the time his wife left him, Barton went to a
Macon suburb to see Argo and her husband, Gary, Barton's confidant.
</P>
<P>
   The Argos said Barton told them he had lost $250,000 and had
only about $20,000 left. ``He's called Gary before in tears when he
has lost big amounts of money,'' Kelly Argo said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Barton faced Leigh Ann at Christmas, the losses were
approaching $300,000. She was furious with him, Kelly Argo
recalled. But Barton couldn't stop his day trading, nor stem the
losses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, according to his sister-in-law, Barton told Gary Argo
that he had tapped the children's trust fund and that he was facing
a repayment deadline. If he missed it, he thought he would go to
jail. Later, the Argos said, Barton told them he had obtained the
money and met the repayment deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Barton left All-Tech Investment Group, the
first place he had traded, and went to Momentum Securities Inc. He
eventually gunned down five people at All-Tech, including four
traders, before going across Piedmont Road to Momentum, where he
killed four more.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Barton's debts at the trading offices could not be
verified, because such trading information is not public record.
But the Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, has reported
that Barton lost $400,000 at All-Tech before leaving there in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead
shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts,
according to Atlanta police. Police declined to say how much money
Barton had borrowed from his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the
Buckhead shooting rampage before Barton fled and killed himself
when cornered by police in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to
kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and
to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8,
the same way the next day _ the day before he packed his van with
four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager,
purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve
Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no money,'' Walden said Wednesday. ``He had no
intention of going to pay off his debt _ he knew exactly what he
was going to do over there''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police that the Momentum manager was not
available when Barton first arrived. Barton waited about 25
minutes, exchanging small talk with other traders in the room, and
then could wait no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he began shutting the blinds in the office,''
Walden said. ``Then he closed one of the doors in the office. He
turned around and whipped out two guns, one in each hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire was not erratic or ill-planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a shooting spree,'' Walden said. ``His shots were
intentional. Everyone was shot at close range. Some people had gone
under their desks and he just stepped up to them and fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Atlanta homicide commander Lt. Tony Biello. ``He was
proficient with his firearms and he was methodical.''

NO FISHERMAN IS AN ISLAND
</HEADLINE>

By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Make your voice heard; idleness is worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The state Fish and Game Commission, on Friday in Long Beach,
will for the first time consider adopting policy proposed for
developing marine ecological reserves _ areas where angling is not
permitted, to allow for the recovery of overtaxed fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   Any action ultimately will impact two separate proposals to ban
commercial harvesting and recreational fishing along no less than
20 percent of the shorelines of the six northernmost Channel
Islands and out to one nautical mile.
</P>
<P>
   You may have read about the often-heated Channel Islands issue
in these pages, where it's been covered for the past 18 months. But
the debate has apparently suffered from lack of public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe the environmental catch phrase,
``marine protected areas,'' is critical and will mold the future of
angling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, marine biologists use a standard I call the
``theory of 20s'': By the year 2020, 20 percent of the world's
fisheries must be closed to angling in order to maintain their
natural populations. It is upon this hypothesis that the National
Park Service and a citizens' panel calling itself the Channel
Islands Marine Resource Restoration Committee based their proposals
that 20 percent of the islands be off-limits to fishing.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the energy in March 1998 that led to a peaceful
protest of the proposal at the Channel Islands National Park
headquarters in Ventura? That was preceded by sharp criticism from
commercial fishermen and divers, who called the recommendation too
drastic and misguided during a meeting of the Ventura County Fish
and Game Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the opposition has waned more recently; the
commission has heard little feedback, and even less from critics,
since its proposed policy regarding marine protected areas was
introduced in May and public comment was first entertained in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we haven't received that many letters, but the
ones we have gotten have been supportive of it,'' said Bob Treanor,
since 1990 the executive director of the five-member state Fish and
Game Commission's staff. ``Even the detractors like the concept
that has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are supportive of a marine ecological reserve policy or
position, and how you implement that will be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   (On Friday, the Fish and Game Commission also will hear public
comment on how and where such policy would be enforced, if
approved; it will consider adopting proposed ``implementation
regulations'' Aug. 27 in Bridgeport.)
</P>
<P>
   Hey, anglers, I thought I'd be writing stories with more balance
from BOTH camps for some time to come. Since this issue came to the
forefront early last year, I've been deluged with comments and
concerns. Some have been in favor of marine protected areas, but
the vast majority oppose them. I guess it's the company I keep.
</P>
<P>
   If you have something to say about such reserves, shame on you
if you don't take it directly to the source _ the commission that
decides such issues. Friday's meeting may be your last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too late. This is the process that we go through. I
want the message to be clear that the public still has the
opportunity to comment,'' Treanor said. ``You have to let the
people know that their voice is important and we need to hear it
and the commissioners don't have their minds made up.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups most concerned about the establishment of
marine protected areas _ and specifically the Channel Islands
fishing-ban proposal _ is United Anglers of Southern California, a
group of sportfishermen helping to restore ocean fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to show up,'' UASC president Tom Raftican said about
Friday's commission meeting. ``Let's get the input into the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly, the Fish and Game Commission is one of the state's
most accessible government agencies, routinely hopscotching around
California _ San Diego, Sacramento, Riverside, Visalia, Oakhurst,
Point Reyes Station, Redding _ to hold its monthly meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no small coincidence that the policy regarding
reserves was first scheduled as an action item for the meeting in
Long Beach, where interest is keen regarding its impacts on the
Channel Islands fishing-ban proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people there,'' Treanor said. ``That's why the
commission moves around, sort of to bring government to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And, quite apart from the marine reserve issue, Friday also
represents the final opportunity to submit recommendations for
revisions to the state's sport-fishing regulations for the years
2000 to 2002 as they pertain to size and bag limits, gear
restrictions and angling hours and seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion I hear most often is raising the minimum size
limit on slow-growing calico bass from 12 inches to 14 inches or
greater. Another thought being bandied about is the option to start
spearfishing salmon.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a notion, no matter how fishy, take your case to the
proper authorities and push the agenda; it may be the best way to
get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. &QL;

FOR SOLITUDE, TRY LIEBRE MOUNTAIN

<P>
   GORMAN, Calif. _ It might not be the most picturesque the
Angeles National Forest has to offer, and the modest elevation
provides little solace from the heat, but if it's solitude you
crave, look to the lonely outpost that is Liebre Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Accessed by a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Pacific Crest Trail
marker on a back road that doesn't have much of an excuse for
existing, the 9-mile hike gains nearly 2,000 feet of elevation up a
dozen switchbacks through pine- and chaparral-lined Horse Camp
Canyon. It's a striking eye-opener for anyone who thinks Los
Angeles County is all glitz and glitter.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is an afterthought. Expect infrequent bursts of wind and
an occasional airplane, but the only other man-made sounds you'll
hear are the crunch of wafflestompers hitting tinder-dry earth and
the heavy breathing that comes with climbing a grade that is steep
in places.
</P>
<P>
   The route south from Pine Canyon Road in the forest's northwest
sliver happens to be the first chronicled in John W. Robinson's
preeminent guidebook ``Trails of the Angeles,'' but I guarantee the
list is laid out according to geography and not order of
preference. Still, the remote track has its qualities _ a quaint
pond favored by waterfowl, sporadic shade from black oak, digger
pine and big-cone spruce, a surprising bounty of wildlife and an
unrivaled northerly view of the Tehachapi Mountains and the extreme
western reach of the Mojave Desert and its Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers might even liken the stretches toward the top to the
Midwest. ``It's almost like prairie grass up there,'' said Rich
Martin of Los Angeles, my hiking partner on this cloudless day and
a former Minnesotan who knows something about prairies.
</P>
<P>
   But this can be too good a thing, for the locale is drowning in
foxtails, as evidenced by the 20 minutes it took me to get the
grass' pointy seeds out of my socks and bootlaces.
</P>
<P>
   Another inconsiderate part of the trail _ ``where the Coast
Ranges, the Tehachapis and the San Gabriels all meld together in a
wrinkled jumble,'' Robinson writes _ is that there really isn't a
top. Like Sawmill Mountain and Sierra Pelona, its brethren to the
southwest, Liebre (Spanish for hare) doesn't have a prominent apex.
Instead, it is a lengthy hogback, or whaleback, that continually
frustrates visitors with its many false summits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hike is nice, but you don't get that peak-bagging
sensation,'' Martin pointed out. We can't be certain that we
actually reached the 5,759-foot high point, but even if we didn't,
there wasn't much more altitude to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
   From where the Pacific Crest Trail bisects Pine Canyon Road at
an elevation of 3,845 feet, the track moves westerly past a marshy
lake for nine-tenths of a mile to primitive Horse Trail Camp (3,980
feet). Here it picks up vintage Horse Trail, in an earlier day
employed to drive horses from Tejon Ranch to Los Angeles. It is
also here where the last segment of the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest
Trail from Mexico to Canada was blazed in 1993. Look for gnarled
mountain mahogany, brightly hued thistle, a variety of birds and
lizards and the antlered deer that bounded up the trail before us .
. . oh, and the initial wave of those endless foxtails. At the
first significant switchback (4,120 feet), look to the west for
Quail Lake, a fishing haven that is nothing if not windy.
</P>
<P>
   The grade picks up steadily for 2.5 miles from Horse Trail Camp,
passing another dry camp featuring a picnic table, fire ring, grill
and garbage can (4,923 feet) before reaching an uneven jeep track
(5,140 feet).
</P>
<P>
   The trail widens and it's not too far to the summit . . . or so
you would think. Not.
</P>
<P>
   This minirange goes on and on, never seeming to expose its
crown. The course rolls over gentle, honey-chestnut hills until
reaching a screeching halt to its unusual ride 1.1 miles ahead at a
wire fence that is flagged by a sign pointing the way to further
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Return whence you trod and enjoy the Tehachapi Mountains, which,
on crystalline days, usher in their big brothers in the Sierra
Nevada. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IF YOU'RE GOING ...''
</P>
<P>
   To reach the outset of the Pacific Crest Trail route to Liebre
Mountain, drive north on the Golden State Freeway (5) and exit at
Highway 138 west. Travel 4{ miles and turn right onto County
Highway N2 (Old Ridge Route). Drive another 2.3 miles and turn left
onto the continuation of Highway N2 at Pine Canyon Road. From here,
it's 5.1 miles to the PCT trailhead on the right side. Watch for
the tiny marker after passing a water tank and a sign that reads
``Fire Restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow at least four hours to complete the 9-mile hike. Visitors
must purchase a National Forest Service Adventure Pass ($5 for
day-use parking; $30 for the year) ahead of time. Information:
Angeles National Forest, (626) 574-5200.

Hyman gracefully, if a bit too self-referentially, connects the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ State officials are on the verge of settling a
lawsuit involving the landmark Apollo Theater, and are working out
the final details of a deal that would include a controlling role
for Time Warner in rescuing the Harlem auditorium and a $1 million
repayment to the theater by former Manhattan Borough President
Percy Sutton and his associates, said several people close to the
case Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is expected to be presented to the Apollo's board
at its meeting Monday. It would resolve more than a year of
investigation and litigation over the relationship between the
theater and a company controlled by Sutton that produced ``It's
Showtime at the Apollo,'' a weekly variety program for television.
The settlement would also include a financial contribution from
Time Warner, estimated at $400,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Rep. Charles Rangel, a powerful
Harlem Democrat, would step down as chairman of the theater's
nine-member board and would be replaced by actor Ossie Davis, and
Time Warner would add 10 people from the entertainment industry to
the board, expanding it to 19 members, said Time Warner president
Richard Parsons. The theater, once Harlem's golden stage on 125th
Street, is owned by the state but operated by the nonprofit Apollo
Theater Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The close involvement of Time Warner _ the world's largest
entertainment and media company, with revenues last year of nearly
$27 billion _ was supported by state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
as a way to bail out the long-deteriorating Apollo, where Duke
Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat ``King'' Cole and other famous
entertainers performed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development
Corp., the agency that owns the theater, said the state had
approved Time Warner's plans to take control of the board and was
eager for the rescue effort to begin. Gov. George Pataki also
supports the settlement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit's settlement has been stalled for weeks while lawyers
for Rangel and Sutton negotiated with the state attorney general's
office over how to resolve the accusations made last November in a
lawsuit filed by then-Attorney General Dennis Vacco. Rangel and
five other board members were accused of failing to collect at
least $4 million from a company controlled by Sutton, a friend and
political ally of the congressman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rangel had repeatedly said he would not sign an agreement that
did not exonerate him. He said Wednesday that the precise wording
was still being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need anybody to vouch for my honesty,'' said the
congressman, a 15-term House veteran and the senior Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who in July became a defendant in the lawsuit at his own
request, is also seeking language that would clear his name.
``Percy Sutton has acted honorably at all times in his relationship
with the Apollo Theater,'' said Peter Parcher, one of his lawyers,
``and if there is a resolution, it will reflect that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said Sutton was required to give the theater 25
percent of his gross profits from the show, which would have
amounted to $4 million over a five-year period. But Sutton and
Rangel said the contract they signed included confusing language
that had been misinterpreted, and that the show had consistently
lost money.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Spitzer, who had succeeded Vacco as attorney general,
came up with another figure, saying the theater was owed ``well
over'' $1 million. Spitzer said in a letter to the foundation's
lawyers that this figure was derived from an audit commissioned by
the theater. But lawyers for the foundation have said he misread
the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer would not speak on the record about the proposed
settlement Wednesday. But lawyers working on the case said that an
agreement was expected to be reached before Monday's meeting of the
Apollo Theater Foundation board. The new members would be added at
that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner officials provided details of their role for the
first time Wednesday. The company's involvement is not a surprise.
Rangel and Parsons, who have worked together on Harlem economic
development issues, have said they have long wanted to bring Time
Warner into the Apollo. In March, the company said it was eager to
adopt the Apollo, but only if the allegations of wrongdoing had
been cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining his company's plans Wednesday, Parsons said George
Wein, the jazz impresario who created the Newport Jazz Festival,
and six other people, three of them officials of Time Warner, had
agreed to join the board.
</P>
<P>
   The new board members will also include Val Azzoli, the
co-chairman of Atlantic Records, a Time Warner subsidiary; Keith
Clinkscale, the former chief executive of Vibe, a publication owned
by Time Warner; Byron Lewis, the founder of Uniworld, an
advertising and marketing agency aimed at African-American
consumers, and Jonelle Procope-Terrell, a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time Warner will control the board, Parsons denied that
the company was taking over the theater. ``It's definitely not a
takeover,'' he said. ``It's a partnership that we're forming
between Time Warner and the Apollo Theater Foundation.'' Company
officials said the entertainment company would not run the theater,
and would not hire or fire its executives.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first issues facing the new board will be whether to
approve or rebid a multi-year contract for Sutton's Inner City
Broadcasting Theater Group to distribute ``Showtime at the Apollo''
for forthcoming television seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A rival distributor, Frank Mercado-Valdes, president of the
African Heritage Network, whose charges of favoritism led to the
state investigation last year, said Wednesday that he had
considered it futile to bid on a new contract under the existing
board, but said he would like to do so now with a new board in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner will also contribute $400,000 to $500,000 to the
theater, part of a financial package that will include Sutton's
settlement as well as some government money and charitable
contributions. About $400,000 is expected to come from the Upper
Manhattan Empowerment Zone. Parsons is the chairman of that
program, which uses federal, state and city money to stimulate
economic development. Gargano said the Empire State Development
Corp. had already agreed to give the theater $300,000, but the
money was held up pending resolution of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the sums were small, Parsons said his company
would help start an endowment campaign to raise more money for the
theater, which he described as a cornerstone for economic
development in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can bring life back to Harlem without
bringing life back to 125th Street,'' he said, ``and you've got to
start with the Apollo.'' Reviving the theater would also spur other
development, including new restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed agreement, Sutton and some his associates in
the Apollo deal would be responsible for repaying the $1 million
that Spitzer contended last April was due the Apollo foundation out
of profits reaped by the distributors, according to an audit by the
accounting firm KMPG.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco had contended that as much as $4.4 million was owed to the
foundation, but after reviewing the audit, Spitzer said that $1
million was a fairer figure.
</P>
<P>
   The initial dispute between the state and Sutton and Rangel
centered on whether the percentage due the foundation was to come
from net or gross profits. The foundation later sued its lawyers at
White &AMP; Case, an action not affected by the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money going to the Apollo will be used to replace
the theater's dilapidated marquee and broken-down seats and to
create a souvenir shop, Parsons said. But he said that the theater
was in ``functionally sound shape'' and needed to attract
high-profile performers and audiences even more than it needed
renovation. Most nights, the famous theater is dark.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons said the goal was to bring ``interesting and inspired
multi-dimensional programming'' to the theater, perhaps by using it
for a new talk show starring Queen Latifah or for movie premieres
or televised beauty pageants.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said he was delighted that Time Warner was finally
getting involved in the theater, but emphasized that he, and not
the attorney general, should be given the credit for bringing in
the company.

by overhauling the way the Government handles its finances. (Paul

assurances that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's election has

collection is full of valuable and specific knowledge. Hyman isn't

Hyman gracefully, if a bit too self-referentially, connects the
dots of a historical line that can be hard to follow. (Linda

BURNSES' LATEST CHAPTERS: WOMEN'S RIGHTS, NYC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Burns brothers are at it again. And
though their sibling rivalry may make for wordy and grandly
eloquent toasts at family reunions, their documentaries almost
always make for put-the-book-away-and-watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Both Burns boys _ Ken and Ric _ met the press here a few days
ago at the PBS portion of the twice-annual meeting of the
Television Critics Association.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Burns previewed his typically tasteful take on two pioneers
of women's rights, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and SusanB. Anthony,'' airing Nov. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Ric presented his latest work, an epic (12-hour)
examination of the nation's most beloved-despised city, ``New York,
New York,'' which begins Nov. 14 and concludes some time next ye
ar. The next-year part is not a joke _ PBS is holding the series'
two-hour finale for an undetermined date in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Burns, producer of ``The Civil War'' and ``Baseball,''
long-form PBS documentary milestones, said the Stanton-Anthony
piece is the fourth installment in a five-part, shorter-form series
</P>
<P>
   of biographies. He's already visited Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and
Clark, and Frank Lloyd Wright. The final installment, which Burns
has just begun, will have Mark Twain as its subject. Meanwhi le,
Burns is also working on a long-form documentary about jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Anthony are ``quite simply, the two most important
women in American history,'' he said. ``They changed, for the
better, the lives of a majority of American citizens. The are
responsible for the largest social transformation in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a universal story whose themes and messages and
emotional force speak to everyone. It is not only the moving
narrative of a half-century friendship between two remarkable,
clearly opposite women, it is also the anatomy of a political
movement, inevitably filled with tensions between pragmatism and
ideology, courage and compromise, loyalty and betrayal, failure and
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it becomes, in the end, a story about the very meaning of
independence itself, not just on a broad political scale but in an
intensely personal, psychological _ indeed spiritual _ level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ric Burns' biggest hurdle in attracting a crowd to his massive
history of New York will be persuading the nation's New York haters
to even care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's hatred and there's`` hatred,'''' he said.
``There's the worst form of hatred, which is a kind of an
indifferent shrug and you walk away. No one feels that way about
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Other PBS highlights for fall, in order of air date on local
affiliate Channel 8 (KAET):
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Trail of Mark Twain,'' with Peter Ustinov _ The
dependably witty actor retraces the more-or-less equatorial
circumnavigation that Twain documented in his 1897 book ``Following
the Equator.'' Stops include Hawaii, NewZealand, India and South
Africa. A two-parter, airing Aug. 25 and Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Playhouse: An American Love Story'' _ Filmmaker
Jennifer Fox lived with an interracial couple and their two
daughters for 18 months, shooting 1,000 hours of tape. The result
is a 10-hour visit to one family's sometimes hard life. Sept.
12-16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking Solutions with Hedrick Smith'' _ The Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist fills three hours of air time seeking
workable solutions to the modern woes of urban violence and crime.
Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Files ''_ The post-Cold War information explosion
continues in this four-part series. Included are segments about KGB
spies, the Soviet space program, its competitive sports industry
and propaganda machine. Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline: John Paul II: The Millennial Pope'' _ By following
Karol Wojtyla's journey from Poland to the Vatican, producer Helen
Whitney offers context for the current pope's achievements and
failures. The 2{-hour special airs Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Photography: A Century of Images'' _ All the expected
exposures are featured amid the history and context in this
three-hour snapshot of the photographer's art form. Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonders of the African World,'' with Henry Louis Gates Jr. _ A
six-part journey, ``Wonders'' was conceived as an African
equivalent of the PBS series ``Kenneth Clark's Civilisation.''
Gates is head of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University. Oct.
25-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Masters: Hitchcock, Selznick &AMP; the End of Hollywood''
_ Producer-writer-director Michael Epstein sees the Hollywood
intersection of Hitchcock and Selznick as a turning point for the
American movie industry. Producer David O. Selznick brought English
director Alfred Hitchcock to America in 1939. Their seven-year
professional relationship produced`` Rebecca,'', ``Spellbound'' and
``Notorious,'' but ultimately imploded under the weight of ego and
creative differences. N ov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Beyond Earth'' _ Science writer Timothy Ferris, who
produced the sounds-of-Earth phonograph record packed aboard the
Voyager space probes, asks the big question _ Is anybody out there?
_ by examining the evolution of terrestrial life, then the origins
of human intelligence. Interstellar mileage is, as always, a
discouraging constant, but Ferris makes all the cosmic connections.

MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER TURNS TO NFL FOR NEW COMMISSIONER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After spending the last three years trying to
convince people outside the United States that a football was
oblong and not round, Don Garber Wednesday accepted the task of
selling pro soccer to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Garber replaced Doug Logan as commissioner of Major League
Soccer after working 15 years as a NFL executive. Since 1996 Garber
was chief executive responsible for managing business activities of
the NFL outside the United States. With the creation of NFL
International, the 41-year-old Garber oversaw an organization that
grew from five employees based in New York to a global organization
of more than 130 with offices in Australia, Canada, England,
Germany, Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport is a global community,'' Garber said Wednesday at news
conference, ``and soccer is the premier sport in the world. I took
a sport to places where there were no participants. There are a lot
of participants in soccer in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 18 million people, mostly young, who play soccer
in the United States, but the MLS has averaged about 15,000 a game,
and few watch on television. The crowd figures include
doubleheaders with the recently completed Women's World Cup and
other international games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to make a change at this time so that another year
would not be lost,'' said Stuart Subotnick, the league's chairman
of the board. ``Every business goes through various phases, and the
league is no different. We tried to establish soccer where previous
ventures failed, and we are not where we want to be. Don is a
person who has all the qualifications to take us where we want to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber has virtually no background in soccer. He said that the
league had plenty of soccer experts and that he planned to assist
them in doing their part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to my success in the international business was to
surround myself with experts of the sport, and to make sure they
had the resources they needed to do their job,'' Garber said.
</P>
<P>
   Garber said he had no intentions of rehiring Sunil Gulati, who
was dismissed by Logan six months ago, reportedly after a dispute
with MetroStars management over the contract renewal of Tab Ramos.
Gulati served as the deputy commissioner in charge of signing
players and allocating stars to the league's 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The league operates its 12 teams under a concept in which
individuals or companies invest in the league and receive the
rights to operate a club. The league owns the contracts of all
players and pays them from a central fund as a single entity.
</P>
<P>
   Garber said one of his priorities was to establish a broader fan
base for the league and develop closer communication with the
players and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now come back to the U.S. sports world with a profound
respect for the power and potential of the game of soccer,'' Garber
said. ``Today is the beginning of a new stage of growth for soccer
in the United States.''

`DICK' IS WACKY TAKE ON WATERGATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Nixonian comedy ``Dick'' poses this political
question: Was President Nixon brought down by investigative
reporters or two teenage girls with a major crush on Bobby Sherman?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years after the Watergate scandal rocked the White
House, ``Dick'' counters with a funny account of political
shenanigans that's as tricky as Dick himself.
</P>
<P>
   One tricky part is that you need a good refresher course on the
particulars of Watergate to appreciate the movie's best jokes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it's essential to remember:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plumbers'' were blundering operatives who broke into
Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex.
</P>
<P>
   CREEP was an acronym for a Republican group, the Committee to
Re-elect the President.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Throat'' was the code name of the still-secret source who
guided two ``Washington Post'' reporters to the condemning evidence
that the president of the United States was involved in an illegal
cover-up of political crimes.
</P>
<P>
   There were 18{ minutes mysteriously missing from the White House
tapes, recordings that Nixon kept of his private conversations
about the Watergate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Haldeman, John Dean and G. Gordon Liddy were White House
aides involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   With these facts in mind, you can settle back and enjoy a clever
romp through the rewriting of history because ``Dick'' is even
funnier than real-life events, which reached levels of humor that
satisfied absurdists for years.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) are two
ditsy 15-year-olds who stumble, Forrest Gump fashion, onto the
crossroads of history.
</P>
<P>
   When they get lost in the White House on a field trip, President
Nixon (Dan Hedaya) and his aides think that the girls may have seen
evidence of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what the girls know and divert them from telling
anyone, Nixon hires them to be official White House dog walkers.
What ensues is a funny account of how two naive girls, not knowing
what they're doing, undo the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick'' is a politically savvy comedy, irreverent, enjoyable
and demanding political awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Director Andrew Fleming (``The Craft'') keeps the movie loose
and flip while demonstrating how home-baked cookies can avert
nuclear destruction. He neatly captures the look and mood of the
'70s with a more interesting take on Washington politics than
Oliver Stone's serious ``Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya, who played the put-upon father in ``Clueless,'' does a
great Nixon impersonation, catching not only Tricky Dick's look and
voice but the sense of a leader who is always one step away from
going over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls are funny without playing overly dumb. Dunst shows
off more of her comic moves than she does in ``Drop Dead
Gorgeous.'' Williams (from TV's ``Dawson's Creek'') balances her
character's dopiness with teenage determination, creating a
formidable foe to anyone w ho crosses her.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming makes some mistakes in casting, particularly in
overloading the movie with current ``Saturday Night Live'' cast
members, who take us out of the '70s and into the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The overused Will Ferrell, as reporter Bob Woodward, is
particularly disconcerting. While everyone else plays the
situations for laughs, Ferrell and Bruce McCulloch, as reporter
Carl Bernstein, break the comic boundaries of the story by hamming
it up in silly and unfunny fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its faults, ``Dick'' is one of the most unusual
comedies of the year.Rated PG-13, ``Dick'' should have received an
R for profanity and a string of sex jokes.  &QL;

AS MRS. CLINTON RETURNS UPSTATE, HER MARRIAGE IS HOT TOPIC
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTONS) 
(nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMESTOWN, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton resumed her exploratory
trip through New York state on Wednesday, listening to an
assortment of complaints about the sluggish economy of western New
York and facing a barrage of media questions about comments she
made in a magazine article about her husband's marital infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Clinton's first public comment on the subject of her
marriage since the appearance of the article, published this week
in the premiere issue of Talk magazine. In the article, Mrs.
Clinton said she thought President Clinton had overcome his
womanizing 10 years ago. She also said that he was scarred by abuse
he suffered as a child and had not examined those problems enough
to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   Many news reports and columns have linked Mrs. Clinton's remarks
about the president's womanizing and his childhood, saying that the
first lady attributed her husband's unfaithfulness to his early
traumas. But while Mrs. Clinton's comments on the two subjects
appear in the same part of the article, she is not quoted citing
cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in response to reporters' questions, she said she had
not intended to offer her husband's childhood problems as an excuse
for his behavior. ``Everyone is responsible for their behavior,''
she said, without elaborating. ``I am strong proponent and believer
in personal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that anyone who read the article ``would come away
believing that my husband and I love each other very much and we
are very committed to one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a lot, like most marriages I'm aware of.
And I really believe strongly that this is an issue that the
country has put behind us, and I have as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Washington, the president said much the same,
avowing that he and Mrs. Clinton ``love each other very very
much,'' and saying that nobody ``could fairly read the article and
think that she was making any excuses for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After answering questions about her marriage, Mrs. Clinton, who
has avoided discussing her personal life publicly, said she would
no longer entertain such questions. When asked why she had decided
to speak about her marriage in a magazine interview, she said:
``Well, I'm not going to anymore. I've said all I'm going to say on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments came during Mrs. Clinton's fourth so-called
``listening tour'' of the state since she began contemplating a run
for the U.S. Senate. Her trip took her to the Crawford's Furniture
factory here to listen to local business leaders, entrepreneurs and
workers, as well as to a series of private meetings with local
politicians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prior to taking questions from reporters _ most concerning the
magazine article _ Mrs. Clinton conducted her meeting with local
citizens in a style very much like the others she has undertaken
since forming an exploratory committee early last month to consider
running for the Senate seat being vacated next year by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   She sat in the middle of a semicircle of a few local leaders,
facing a group of about 50 citizens _ registered Democrats and
Republicans who were selected by the furniture plant's owner and
Chautauqua County Executive Mark Thomas, who is a Democrat. On a
plant floor covered with sawdust, Mrs. Clinton heard a wide range
of concerns, from the high prices for airline travel to and from
western New York, to the lack of trained personnel for highly
skilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The format offered Mrs. Clinton a chance to speak at length on
some issues, such as her criticism of the inequality of federal
funds that flow into New York compared with other states. ``It may
be that we'll never get a dollar-for-dollar exchange,'' she said.
``But we sure ought to get more than we're getting now. Were I in
the Senate, I would try to create a coalition of the big states to
stand up for our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, playing the role of mere listener allowed her to
brush aside other topics. For example, one woman offered a lengthy
complaint about what she considered to be the detrimental effect of
the North American Free Trade Agreement; Nafta passed in 1993,
championed by President Clinton. To criticism that the trade
agreement contributed to unemployment in the region, the first lady
offered only a brief but courteous, ``Thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The listening tours have all the trappings of a campaign in the
weeks before an election _ complete with people lining the routes
of Mrs. Clinton's events and a media caravan of dozens of
reporters. But several of the people invited to Wednesday's
discussion said they were keenly aware that Mrs. Clinton has not
yet declared her candidacy for the 2000 election and they wondered
whether she was serious about running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get more interested in running every day,'' Mrs. Clinton
said, responding to a reporter's question. ``And I especially get
interested when I can talk with people about the real issues that
are confronting them and their lives. The more that I go around
listening to New Yorkers, the more excited and encouraged I get
that I might be able to make a contribution in the Senate on behalf
of the people of New York.''

EDITORIAL: BIGOTRY IN THE BOY SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court has issued a powerful ruling
against anti-gay bigotry in the Boy Scouts of America. No
organization that recruits schoolchildren and says it is guided by
honesty and respect for others has any right to ban homosexuals.
While courts in other states like California have allowed the Boy
Scouts to skirt civil rights laws, the New Jersey court showed
wisdom in refusing to sanction bigotry by this important civic
institution.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court affirmed an earlier state
appeals court ruling that the Boy Scouts violated New Jersey's
anti-discrimination law in ousting an assistant scoutmaster, James
Dale, solely because he is gay. Dale, who joined the Scouts when he
was 8 and eventually reached the highest rank of Eagle Scout before
becoming an assistant scoutmaster, was expelled in 1990 when a
local newspaper published an article identifying him as a leader of
the Rutgers University Lesbian/Gay Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey state law prohibits discrimination against
individuals in public accommodations based on sexual orientation.
The Boy Scout organization argued that it is a private group not
subject to anti-bias laws that apply to public facilities. But the
New Jersey court has sensibly rejected that view. The organization
has had more than 87 million members nationwide in its history,
recruits publicly and is ostensibly non-selective in its
membership, and its troops are sponsored by schools and other
public service organizations. As an organization with an important
role in the civic life of communities, it cannot be allowed to
operate outside laws designed to eradicate bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts contend that the application of the
anti-discrimination law would violate its First Amendment rights.
But as the court explained, dismissing an individual solely because
he is homosexual is ``an act of discrimination unprotected by the
First Amendment freedom of speech.'' Expelling Dale, a young man
with an exemplary Scouting record, because he did not hide his
homosexuality runs completely counter to Scouting's purpose to
promote truthfulness and courage. The Boy Scouts are expected to
seek review of the decision by the United States Supreme Court. The
organization would serve its mission better by ending its ugly
prejudice against homosexuals, and adding to its list of Boy Scout
qualities the virtue of tolerance.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective it is easy to see how a federal arbitration
panel, in a binding 2-1 vote, could conclude, as it did this week,
that the Zapruder film of John F. Kennedy's assassination was worth
$16 million, or more than $615,000 a second. That is what the
Justice Department will have to pay the Zapruder family to
compensate it for permanently retaining, as law now requires, the
home movie shot by Abraham Zapruder, who died in 1970. If the only
standard of the film's value is what the market will bear, then $16
million may turn out to be something of a bargain. Auction fever
and Kennedy fever are both running high, and there is no telling
what price the Zapruder film would have brought had it been put up
for public sale.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Justice Department has bought is an expensive
paradox _ a six-foot length of original film strip that is too
fragile to be projected and yet so familiar, from repeated viewing
of the copies made from it, that many Americans know its 26 seconds
by heart. It is a unique historical artifact, the sole filmed
record of the fatal moment that day in Dallas, and yet its
existence is wholly accidental. So, in fact, is its uniqueness,
which is a function of the technological instant _ a time when
home-movie cameras were available, but balky and cumbersome, and
the now-ubiquitous video cameras lay far in the future.
</P>
<P>
   History is always partly a matter of accident, the convergence
of the unexpected and the unplanned, as well as a matter of will.
It is this disparity between what happens by accident and what
happens with intent that makes $16 million seem a very high price
for the Zapruder film. The cultural objects that command such
prices _ and very few do _ are pre-eminently works of sober
artistic intent. To date, moreover, no American artifact of any
kind, especially one so evanescent in itself, has commanded
anything like this price.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that what Abraham Zapruder filmed that day
is of surpassing historical interest. But it is hard to escape the
feeling that what has raised the price of this film so high is its
generational interest, the sense that this is history that defined
our lifetime, history caught in a medium that has defined our age. &QL;

EDITORIAL: DAY TRADERS AS GAMBLERS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in
which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil. But it is a
reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat
stock trading as something like casino gambling. It must be closely
regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia
on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum
Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick
purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no
stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage
of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in
changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a
stock. Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago,
but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves
in volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do
little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach
people how to be successful day traders. Barton took one such
class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web
site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know
anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day
trader. Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try
day trading lose money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need
to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not
make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules
that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading. But the
regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money
away.

STRAWBERRY IN COLUMBUS: TWO HITS AND A STOLEN BASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Enough members of the Columbus Clippers know
first-hand the zoo that can be the Bronx, and the local fans have
seen first-hand the traveling circus that is the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   So the arrival of Darryl Strawberry caused only a slight
commotion here, which makes central Ohio the perfect setting for
what Strawberry said will be a last, low-key shot at resurrecting
his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be my last go-round,'' Strawberry said Wednesday
before suiting up for the Clippers for his first regular-season
game since he contracted colon cancer last Oct. 1. He was arrested
on solicitation and drug possession charges in Tampa, Fla., on
April 14 and then was suspended by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is my last season; but if I'm feeling
sick at all, I have to move on,'' he said. ``I love my family. I
have to move on to a place where there's not the same pressure. My
family is too important for me to keep facing that kind of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who started at designated hitter and batted fourth,
singled twice and stole a base in his first three at-bats, each of
which drew a loud mix of cheers and boos. After singling to center
on an 0-and-1 pitch to lead off the second, he broke up a potential
double play at second base. After striking out on a full count in
the fourth, Strawberry singled to right in the fifth, stole second
and went to third on a throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Hillman, the Columbus manager, said the plan was to rotate
him between designated hitter and left field until he was ready to
play left field on a daily basis, with the goal of getting him into
the Yankee lineup as soon as possible. But Hillman said he was
never given a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be plenty of eyes on him during his time
here,'' Hillman said. ``If they ask me for my opinion, I'll give it
to them. But there will be a lot of guys with a lot more baseball
experience than me looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Michael, the Yankees' director of scouting, was in Columbus
Wednesday, in part because the Clippers' opponent _ the Norfolk
Tides _ is one of the teams he is responsible for scouting. George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, is expected in Columbus
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were not many more people watching Strawberry Wednesday
night. In the last two years, pitchers Hideki Irabu and Orlando
Hernandez have drawn large crowds to Cooper Stadium. But tonight's
game drew only 5,570, only slightly more than any other Wednesday
night. The mood in the Clippers' clubhouse was similarly subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had him in Norwich with me in '97, and the players were a
little enamored of the fact he was with the team,'' Hillman said of
Strawberry. ``But I don't think the enamored level will be as high
with guys at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be an ideal setting for Strawberry, who said his focus
is on ``my health and my alcoholism.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Those are the most important things in my life. I
don't care if I ever play baseball again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is attempting another comeback because retiring
``would mean I would quit on a sour note. I want to quit on a
positive note. This is a frustrating time for myself, my wife and
my children. The most important thing is seeing myself turn around,
not slipping backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillman said his priority was making sure Strawberry stayed
healthy. The Clippers coaches will read his conditioning after
Wednesday night's game to decide where and how long Strawberry can
play on Thursday. ``I don't want him to do anything physical this
first night that might slow the progress he's made,'' Hillman said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry had been working out at the Yankees facilities in
Tampa for a few months and proclaimed himself in top shape. Before
leaving Tampa for Columbus, he met with Steinbrenner. ``He told me,
`Don't screw up again,''' Strawberry said. ``I told him I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said the arrest in April was because of depression
over not making the major league roster, which, in turn, was the
result of trying to return too soon from cancer treatments. He had
surgery in October and again in January and continued to work out
while receiving chemotherapy. After the arrest, Strawberry was
suspended for 120 days by Commissioner Bud Selig, who on Monday
shortened the suspension by a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a human being,'' Strawberry said. ``I don't look for
sympathy. I admit my mistakes.''

HOT CITIES SLOW TO COOL OFF  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix is doing almost nothing to counter rising temperatures
caused by so-called urban ``heat islands.''
</P>
<P>
   While other cities across the country are working to cool off
burning expanses of asphalt and buildings that add an average of 6
to 8 degrees to city temperatures, Phoenix has ignored invitations
to join the effort, scientists and federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is planting rooftop gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City is putting in shade trees and reflective roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson is repaving parking lots and reroofing a city building.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix the hottest of big city hot spots is far behind,
even though one study shows that Arizona's largest city could save
$37 million a year in energy costs simply by replacing dark roofs
with reflective ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a climate and a population and a smog condition that
would gain the most with the reflective roofing,'' said Mark Decot
of the U.S. Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Phoenix officials have showed no interest, Decot said,
``I don't know. We're very much interested in getting Phoenix
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   City of Phoenix spokesman Mark Hughes said the city ``is'' doing
something planting trees, although the tree program was not aimed
at reducing heat island effects.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade of study shows that Phoenix and other cities
are getting hotter, researchers say. Rising temperatures lead to
more energy consumption, more pollution and ultimately, more health
problems, such as asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The primary impact of a heat island like Phoenix is not that the
average daytime temperatures soar as open space is replaced with
buildings and concrete; it's that the nighttime temperatures don't
cool as much as in rural areas, so city heat continues to build
over time.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the land area in any given city is composed of
roofs, parking lots and roads. Only 1 percent of an area is made up
of lakes and other bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to realize that we can't continue this
urban sprawl,'' said Jeff Luvall of the Marshall Space Flight
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of longer commutes, poorer air quality is just too
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Luvall is working on a pilot project to study heat island
effects. The project flies planes with thermal remote-sensing
equipment over three cities: Baton Rouge, La., Salt Lake City and
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to measure the temperatures of parking lots,
rooftops and open spaces so city planners can use the data.
</P>
<P>
   The project follows a broader satellite imaging study of 10
cities, including Phoenix. DOE encouraged Phoenix to participate in
the detailed study, but it never showed interest, Decot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anybody actively trying to get that data
(remote temperature sensing), but they ought to,'' Decot said,
``because Phoenix is one of those who could use this cool
communities initiative more than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also failed to become one of the country's nine ``cool
communities,'' a program aimed at bringing ecological balance by
planting more trees in cities.
</P>
<P>
   The cool communities project, which includes Tucson, was
established by the non-profit group American Forest in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory more than a year ago looked at energy savings for cities
that replace dark roofs over time with materials that reflect light
rather than absorb it.
</P>
<P>
   Like wearing a black T-shirt in the sun, dark-colored roofs
absorb heat, becoming up to 70 degrees hotter than reflective white
surfaces. The heat is then transferred inside the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that Phoenix would save $37 million a year by
replacing dark roofs with reflective ones over time on existing
homes and buildings. The savings were highest for Phoenix when
compared with 10 other cities, including Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' Decot said. ``It's incredible what
foolish things we've done as we've built the infrastructure in our
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   While Phoenix officials are ignoring the problem in their
building codes, so are their counterparts at the county and state.
Asked what it was doing to reduce heat island effects and to
improve air quality, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality referred a caller to a researcher at Arizona
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County air officials also said they are participating
in an ASU study, adding that they have yet to do anything other
than collect data.
</P>
<P>
   Like DOE, Environmental Protection Agency officials report that
they asked Phoenix about getting involved in a 1997 study of the
relationship between heat islands and smog problems.
</P>
<P>
   To cut pollution, communities must reduce volatile organic
compounds and nitrogen oxide. Another strategy is to control
temperatures in the atmosphere, where those two gases mix and
create unhealthy ozone gases.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has had four ozone alerts so far this summer,
compared with none last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached Phoenix because we figure they could benefit in
terms of energy savings,'' said Virginia Gorsevski of EPA, ``but no
one seemed that interested.''
</P>
<P>
   As city temperatures rise, so do ozone-depleting gases. Even
when cars aren't running, they generate pollution because the gas
in the tank is evaporating, said Greg McPherson, project leader for
the U.S. Forest Service at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotter it is, the faster the rate that hydrocarbons
evaporate and the faster the formation of ozone or smog,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, which McPherson has studied, automobiles
contribute half of that city's hydrocarbons. Twenty percent of that
amount is from parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results would even be more dramatic in Phoenix because
it's warmer,'' McPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Phoenix's lack of interest does not surprise researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In L.A., computer simulations have shown that light-colored
surfaces and shade trees would reduce smog (as much) as if they
made all the cars in the city electric,'' said Hashem Akbari of the
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pounding on their doors for the past 15 years but
they haven't done much.'' &QL;

IN DANBURY, UNION CARBIDE WORKERS FEAR CUTBACKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (With DOW-UNION-CARBIDE) 
(nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. &UR;  &LR; _ The quarter-mile-long headquarters of the
Union Carbide Corp &UR; . &LR; , which soars out of the Connecticut woods
with such angular, metallic starkness that locals call it the
Battlestar Galactica, had symbolized the resilience of a city that
once was ``The Hat Capital of the World'' but lost manufacturers
decade by decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday another trend, corporate consolidation, arrived when
Dow Chemical Co. announced that it was buying Union Carbide for
$9.3 billion in stock and would run the merged company from Dow's
headquarters in Midland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Although the companies said they had not yet determined where
they would cut, Union Carbide workers said they felt it was a
virtual certainty that operations here would be cut back sharply or
even shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only have so many chiefs,'' said Beth Donofrio, 41, an
administrative assistant, who said she might take this opportunity
for a career change into foot massage.
</P>
<P>
   To many, Union Carbide was synonymous with the 1984 poisonous
gas leak at a company pesticide plant in Bhopal, India. Employees
here were drawn closer together as they saw their company's name
vilified around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like survivors,'' said Ginny Chiapel, 47, an associate
in the treasurer's office who has worked at the company for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide's revenues make it the fourth-largest public
company in Fairfield County. The company moved its headquarters
here in 1980. It has 850 employees in Danbury, down from a peak of
3,300 in the mid-1980s. About half of the building's 1.3 million
square feet have been taken over by other tenants, including
divisions that Union Carbide spun off.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gene F. Eriquez said that because of Union Carbide's
gradual cutbacks, the city of 68,000 was feeling ``concern, not
panic.'' He said he still had hopes for more development on the
company's 645 acres, still largely wooded, in part for the same
reasons that brought Union Carbide here in the first place: a safe
and clean setting just 70 miles northeast of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way of Northern Fairfield County, based in Danbury,
said it would assist employees who are dismissed from Union
Carbide, which is currently the third-largest contributor in annual
fund drives. Marty Milkovic, the president of the local United Way,
said he was preparing to help arrange counseling, day-care,
job-search, mental-health and substance-abuse services.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Bull, president of the Greater Danbury Chamber of
Commerce, said that from Boy and Girl Scouts to schools to housing
projects, ``there is hardly a group in the area that doesn't have
Union Carbide's fingerprints on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't just write checks,'' he said. ``Their corporate
culture encouraged them to sit on the boards and get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's developments dismayed David J. Burke, a finance
director who has worked for Union Carbide for 18 years. Like some
others, he said he was excited about the potential opportunities at
the huge new company. But this was mostly a day for looking back.
``People are very dedicated to the name Union Carbide,'' he said.

CLINTONS DENY THEY'RE MAKING EXCUSES FOR HIS INFIDELITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add final grafs 12-17, beginning `in New York...')  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton both
said Wednesday that they were not trying to make excuses for his
marital infidelities, as may have been suggested by Mrs. Clinton's
recent comments that he was abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady delivered their similar messages
separately as they tried to quell the controversy raised by Mrs.
Clinton's recent insinuations to Talk magazine that her husband's
adultery was rooted in the conflict between his mother and
grandmother that he witnessed as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that anybody could fairly read the article and
think that she was making any excuses for me,'' Clinton said in the
Rose Garden in response to reporters' questions after he made a
statement on the federal budget. ``I have not made any excuses for
what was inexcusable, and neither has she, believe me,'' he said,
arching his eyebrows for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Mrs. Clinton, who was meeting with voters at a
furniture factory in Jamestown, N.Y., where she was campaigning for
her all-but-certain Senate race, told reporters she had not meant
to imply a link between the president's abuse as a child and his
infidelities as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is responsible for their behavior, and I am a very
strong proponent and believer in personal responsibility, so I hope
that people will take that message away from this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she believed that the country had moved on from
questions about her husband's adultery, which led to his
impeachment last year by the House, although he was acquitted by
the Senate. ``I have as well,'' she said, adding that she and her
husband ``love each other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In comments widely perceived as an attempt by Mrs. Clinton to
pre-empt questions before the Senate race about her marriage, Mrs.
Clinton had told Talk magazine in its debut issue: ``He was so
young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse that he can't even
take it out and look at it. There was terrible conflict between his
mother and grandmother. A psychologist once told me that for a boy
being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst
possible situation. There is always the desire to please each
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But these comments only stirred up pundits who said that Mrs.
Clinton _ who once said that the allegations of her husband's
philandering were the product of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy''
and then attributed the allegations to discrimination because they
were from Arkansas _ was making excuses for him once again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Wednesday that his childhood, with an
alcoholic stepfather who was sometimes violent, was no ``bed of
roses'' but that he was loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that every child needs to know,
growing up, that he or she is the most important person in the
world to someone,'' he said. ``And I knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that anyone reading the article would have to draw
two conclusions about Mrs. Clinton: ``One is that my wife is an
extraordinary person with a passionate commitment to public service
and a genuine record of important achievement,'' he said. ``And the
second is that we love each other very, very much.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the author of the article, Lucinda Franks, said
that she felt that Mrs. Clinton's comments had been misinterpreted
by commentators who linked Mrs. Clinton's statements about the
president's childhood to her remarks about his infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two separate parts of her interview about the sexual
infidelities and her feelings about her husband, it's all being
squashed together,'' Ms. Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that very few people have carefully read the
article,'' she added. ``If they had, they would understand that she
never makes a connection between his chaotic childhood _ which was
full of alcoholism, physical abuse by his stepfather towards his
mother and conflict between his mother and his grandmother _ and
his sexual infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton never made that connection,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Franks said she has been on at least 25 talk shows, and
``there has not ever been anything discussed and discussed and
discussed except this whole sexual stuff. It's just bewildering to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if wrote a half-page article,'' she said. ``I'm mighty
sick of talking about half a page. I never thought I'd be sick of
talking about sex, but that's all I've done''

SEC SEEKS TO CURB PENSION FUNDS' POLITICAL ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of `Levitt' in 6th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday
proposed a rule to curb political contributions by managers of
public pension funds in a bid to prevent a practice called pay to
play.
</P>
<P>
   An internal review conducted by the SEC's Division of Investment
Management found that money managers who are seeking to deal in the
more than $2 trillion in public pension funds make political
contributions aimed at influencing the politicians who control
decisions about lucrative pension management contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule is similar to a much-disputed rule adopted in 1994
by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, a self-regulatory
group, in response to pay-to-play practices in the municipal bond
market, SEC officials said. The rule faces a 75-day comment period
before final consideration by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Like the existing rule, called G-37, that restricts political
contributions from investment firms to public officials who select
underwriters, the new rule bars a firm from seeking
asset-management contracts for two years after it or its executives
make a political contribution. It also prohibits them from donating
more than $250 to state and local officials who have the power to
grant government contracts _ far less than the $1,000 limit on
individual contributions set by federal campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year timeout imposed by the new rule is not a flat ban
on doing business with a government client. Rather, it prohibits an
adviser or an investment firm from receiving compensation for
advice for two years after a contribution has been made. The
timeout period could also be started by a manager's employees,
consultants or family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measure is a natural extension of our longstanding
efforts to stamp out pay to play in the municipal finance world,''
said the SEC chairman, Arthur Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule would apply to all financial advisers
registered with the SEC and to many unregistered advisers,
including advisers of hedge funds, venture capital funds and other
private investment companies that manage public money. Advisers
with government contracts must keep records of their political
contributions and those of their partners. But the proposed rule
does not require advisers to report their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   State and municipal officials have been critical of Rule G-37,
which does not apply to federal officials, arguing that it violates
First Amendment rights to make and solicit political contributions.
But in 1996, the Supreme Court turned down a challenge to the rule
by William B. Blount, a municipal bond broker from Montgomery,
Ala., who served as the state's Democratic Party chairman, leaving
the rule intact.
</P>
<P>
   The government Finance Officers Association, which represents
state and local financial officers, opposes the rule regulating
contributions from bond managers as well as the new SEC rule. An
association spokeswoman said limits on all contributions should be
consistent with federal election law, which permits $1,000 from an
individual donor to a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Rule G-37 will put constraints on several prominent candidates
in the 2000 elections. As governors who could influence municipal
bond decisions, George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey,
seeking a Republican Senate nomination, would be limited in
receiving contributions from people affiliated with investment
firms. Wall Street is already gushing $1,000 political
contributions to their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The rule has not slowed Bush's fund-raising, but Charlie Smith,
executive director of the Whitman campaign, said, ``Anytime people
are excluded who want to contribute, it affects the campaign, but
you adapt to the climate.''
</P>
<P>
   The current rule has a couple of clear loopholes, especially in
the area of so-called soft money, the large unrestricted
contributions to the national political parties. Investment firms
and their executives are still among the biggest donors to both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public
Integrity, a research organization, called the SEC proposal ``good
news'' in the current landscape of campaign finance but questioned
whether it would ``actually be a significant and meaningful rule.''

   DOW CHEMICAL TO ACQUIRE UNION CARBIDE FOR $9 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   Dow Chemical said it was buying Union Carbide for $9.3 billion
in stock in a deal that would join two household names and create a
chemical giant second only to DuPont in size. Although neither
company makes consumer products any longer, names they made famous,
like Dow oven cleaner and Prestone antifreeze, are still common
sights on supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Declining profit and a slump in chemicals prices put Union
Carbide in the market for a partner, and Dow hopes to reduce its
already low costs even further to help it compete in a rapidly
consolidating market.

   CADBURY BOTTLER'S FUTURE UNCERTAIN
</P>
<P>
   A pair of acquisitions by Cadbury Schweppes 18 months ago was
supposed to have ended the company's heavy dependence on a
fragmented network of independent bottlers to get its Dr. Pepper
and 7-Up soft drink brands onto store shelves. But the Cadbury
venture, called American Bottling, has run into problems and
analysts say it may go on the block.

   Strong demand for automobiles and electronic equipment helped

   NEUBERGER BERMAN REVEALS RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger Berman, a New York-based money manager planning to

this fall, said in a regulatory filing that net income for the
first six months of the year was $141.1 million, a 5.8 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
   AGENCIES TAKING A REGIONAL FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   A deal that will create a new agency owned by Omnicom Group is
indicative of efforts by giant agency companies to augment their
offerings in regional markets like Atlanta. The new agency,
Bayless/Cronin, will result from the merger of Bayless &AMP; Partners
with Merley Newman Harty's Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   MERRILL PLAINTIFFS SEEK MEDIATION
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs in a sex discrimination case against
Merrill Lynch plan to pursue mediation for all 900 claims against
the firm, rejecting its assertion that only a third of the claims
may have merit. The claims involve female Merrill employees who
said discrimination curbed their earning potential.

MCCAIN'S BOOK TO BE EX CERPTED IN GQ MAGA ZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's father blended heroics in
uniform with a tendency to swear, drink too much, and make
indiscrete comments, according to excerpts of a new book by McCain
about his family history.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, R-Ariz., the son and grandson of four-star admirals,
describes a background that clearly sets him apart from his
presidential rivals, particularly the two frontrunners _ Republican
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and Democratic Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore were the products of public life; Bush's father
served as both president and vice president of the United States,
while Gore's father was a U.S. senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, McCain's hard-charging, cigar-chomping dad seemed
to speak a little too bluntly, a dangerous quality in both navy and
civilian politics but one that nevertheless won him admirers, his
son wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McCain's candor ``occasionally lacked the rhetorical
courtesies that attended the first attempts at detente,'' said an
excerpt of the forthcoming book, ``Faith of My Fathers. A Family
Memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt is published in this month's edition of GQ magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This often caused anxiety in the State Department, prompting
complaints in cable traffic about Admiral McCain's indiscretion.
That indiscretion also concerned some of his civilian and military
commanders in the Pentagon, but it won him admirers as well as
detractors ... '' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His dad once ransacked an officers' club that had refused to
serve submarine officers, McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The admiral, who had dedicated himself to the ``annihilation''
of communism, addressed the Naval Academy's graduating class in
1970, a period of anti-war protests.
</P>
<P>
   He responded to the anti-war slogan `'Make love, not war'' by
saying that naval officers ``were men enough to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war divided the country
politically, there was no conflict about it within the McCain
family, McCain's mother, Roberta, told the Arizona Republic in a
rare interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   She said they believed it was critical to stop the encroachment
of communism and to ``stand up and be counted for what you believe
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The GQ excerpt is mostly about McCain's father, who died in
1981. He commanded a submarine during World War II that was hunted
and almost destroyed by Japanese destroyers. He eventually became
commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which will also include chapters on his grandfather
and on McCain himself, is due out in September. It was co-written
with Mark Salter, the senator's top aide.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Random House, has promised that it won't be
simply self-promotional, but rather will tell the story of three
``imperfect men'' who faced adversity and emerged ``with their
honor intact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, like his dad, has been known to make
indelicate remarks. Last year, he apologized to President Clinton
after making a crass joke at the expense of Clinton's daughter,
Chelsea, and wife, Hillary Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told the Republic in 1996 that did not possess the
natural courteousness and diplomacy of his hero, the late Arizona
congressional legend Mo Udall. ``I think that Mo was born with some
of these natural attributes which, in my case, took time to
develop,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his staff aren't conducting interviews about the book
until it is released. The senator plans a September book publicity
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The book is to feature descriptions by McCain, a former naval
aviator, of his being held as a prisoner of war in Hanoi after his
plane was shot down in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   To help him recall that period, McCain requested and received
his debriefing papers from when he was released in 1973. The
Pentagon won't release the papers publicly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aide, Salter, would ask McCain questions based on
events McCain had described in the classified papers 26 years ago.
Then, Salter would type up the notes and give them to McCain for
his approval before they went into the book.

ATLANTA GETTING NEW ADVERTISING AGENCY TO TAP STRONG MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
 - AD-COLUMN-NYT  (yn) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Remember the Four Way line of cold products? Now a four-way deal
is creating an agency in an advertising market that is growing hot.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is Bayless/Cronin, formed by the merger of Bayless &AMP;
Partners, an Atlanta shop founded in 1992, with the Atlanta office
of the New York agency Merkley Newman Harty. The other two elements
of the deal are two Jerrys _ one a well-known copywriter, Jerry
Cronin, the other a longtime Atlanta adman, Jerry Brown _ who will
join Bayless/Cronin in top posts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to create what will formally be known as
Bayless/Cronin, a Merkley Newman Harty Co., is indicative of the
efforts by giant agency companies like Omnicom Group, which owns
Merkley Newman, to augment their offerings in regional markets like
Atlanta. Since late 1997, a principal rival of Omnicom, the
Interpublic Group of Companies, has acquired two Atlanta mainstays,
Austin Kelley Advertising and Fitzgerald &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta and the Southeast are home to roughly 20 percent of
the largest advertisers, making it a very fertile region in terms
of client needs,'' Stephen Harty, managing director at Merkley
Newman, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this creatively focused agency as a terrific
opportunity,'' he added, ``to provide a really interesting
alternative in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Merkley Newman office in Atlanta was opened in December 1995
as a service office for the BellSouth Corp. account that the agency
landed five months before. The office was upgraded in 1996 to full
service; last year, Rick Rabe, a creative director from Merkley
Newman in New York, was sent to Atlanta as managing director.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Atlanta office had grown to only $10 million to $13
million in estimated billings, mostly from BellSouth, of the total
estimated billings for Merkley Newman of $240 million. The bulk of
the BellSouth account, with total billings estimated at $60
million, is in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, ``we evaluated the situation,'' Harty said,
``and determined that we were good enough, but that there was a lot
more potential in the Atlanta market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we made a couple more bold moves, there'd be more
opportunities,'' he added. ``So we began to seek a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And all roads led to Tim,'' Harty said, referring to Tim
Bayless, who has been chief executive and creative director at
Bayless &AMP; Partners, which has an estimated $30 million to $32
million in billings from clients like BellSouth, Johnston &AMP; Murphy
and Wachovia Bank. Bayless has previously worked for agencies like
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, now part of
Interpublic, and the BBDO South unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Merkley Newman ``wanted to add some juice to its presence in the
Atlanta market,'' Bayless said, ``to help create a free-standing
entity that would be part of the Merkley DNA but grow its own
business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayless &AMP; Partners has been successful in a regional way,'' he
added. ``Together with Merkley, we hope we will be attractive to a
wider range of possibilities.'' Bayless/Cronin will have billings
of $40 million to $45 million and about 40 employees from both
predecessor shops.
</P>
<P>
   At Bayless/Cronin, Bayless, 47, will be chief executive and
relinquish his duties as creative director to Cronin, who will also
be managing partner. Cronin, 41, left Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland,
Ore., in March after a decade working on accounts like ESPN, Miller
Genuine Draft beer and Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 10 years at Wieden were a great time, but I'd gone as far
as I could,'' said Cronin, who worked with Bayless at Hill,
Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I faced a choice,'' he added, ``to make a lateral move, to
go to a lousy agency and sell out, to start my own agency or to
work with a friend to try to create the place you want to work
at.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Jerry, Brown, has been working for Merkley Newman in
Atlanta for a couple of months. He ``brings deep experience in the
region,'' Harty said, at shops like BBDO South. Brown, 55, will be
director for strategic development and new business.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless and Cronin will co-manage Bayless/Cronin, which will
operate as an autonomous unit of Merkley Newman; Bayless will
report to Parry Merkley, president at Merkley Newman. Rabe, 35,
will probably return to New York, Harty said, in a creative role.
</P>
<P>
   Bayless/Cronin has already landed its first account: Security
First Technologies in Atlanta, which provides back-end services for
Internet banks. Billings were estimated at $5 million for the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That winning streak, alas, has stopped at one. The agency fell
short in a review that ended Wednesday for the account of Church's
Chicken, a unit of AFC Enterprises in Atlanta. The Church's
account, with billings estimated at $10 million, was awarded to
Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
PLC. The review also included the incumbent agency, Austin Kelley,
as well as Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York, part of the Lowe Group
unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the coincidence of Cronin and Brown both being named
Jerry, it is even more coincidental than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both Jeremiahs,'' Bayless said, laughing.

 &HT;    Elway brings star power to MVP.com
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ There's nothing like a star athlete to boost
a quiet company's profile.
</P>
<P>
   JWGenesis Financial Corp., a stock brokerage and investment
banker based in Boca Raton, said Wednesday it will launch a Web
site with former Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   JWGenesis Vice Chairman Joel Marks said JWGenesis and Elway each
invested about $1 million in the site, dubbed MVP.com. The site
will offer online trading and information about health, fitness and
personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common thread is lifestyle,'' Marks said. ``No one's
really done that yet. We think there's a unique opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is scheduled to debut the day of the 2000 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company that runs MVP.com is seeking other
investors. Marks said the site will aim to take advantage of
Elway's corporate connections to drum up advertising and content.
</P>
<P>
   Elway endorses Reebok, Coors and Pepsi. The Denver car
dealerships Elway sold to AutoNation of Fort Lauderdale still bear
his name.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal, Elway will be JWGenesis' spokesman.
JWGenesis won't pay Elway a salary, the company said, but he'll get
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Marks said Elway will speak at company conferences to recruit
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting in June, JWGenesis officials complained
about the brokerage's low profile. One sports marketing expert said
the deals with Elway could boost its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing an athlete certainly can do is raise name
recognition,'' said Jeff Chown, of The Marketing Arm, a sports
marketing firm in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a little-known Boca Raton firm land a deal with the
most valuable player of the 1999 Super Bowl? The manager of
JWGenesis' Denver office is Elway's neighbor, Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   The company and Elway began discussing possible deals after the
Broncos won the Super Bowl in January.
</P>
<P>
   JWGenesis (Amex: JWG, $13.25) has 850 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another star athlete launched his own lifestyle Web
site on Wednesday. Golfer Greg Norman, a Jupiter Island resident,
unveiled shark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's site includes information about golf, fitness,
nutrition and travel.

MORE WHO LEAVE WELFARE ROLLS IN NEW YORK ARE FOUND TO GET JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)  (bl) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two-thirds of the people who left New York
state's rapidly declining welfare rolls found jobs in the year
after they stopped receiving public assistance, according to a new
study commissioned by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done by independent researchers using state data,
also found that of the people who left welfare in New York between
January and March 1997, more than 80 percent were still off public
assistance a year later, although many did not report wages.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by the Rockefeller Institute at the State University
of New York in Albany for the Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance, the study examined the fate of roughly 9,000 single
mothers whose cases were closed in early 1997 and followed them
throughout the next year. It has not been published, but it has
been circulating among policy-makers and a copy was provided to The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the federal government to determine
the initial impact of the 1996 federal welfare overhaul, which gave
states sweeping new powers to impose new requirements and
restrictions on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the most detailed analysis to date of what has
become of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who have left
welfare in recent years. It also offers the first documentation of
claims by Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani that new welfare policies intended to push people off the
rolls have moved them toward self-sufficiency, not destitution.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, experts say, suggest that the combination of a
robust economy and tough new policies aimed at nudging people off
welfare have led many former recipients to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the report does not answer many crucial questions, like the
types of jobs that former recipients have secured, how much they
are earning and whether they are advancing in the workplace. Nor
does it say how many of the people who were tracked are working
part time or how many are working off the books.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both opponents and proponents of New York's new
welfare policies found something in the study that supported their
positions. While state officials pointed to the employment figures
as evidence that their policies were helping former welfare
recipients become self-sufficient, advocates for the poor said the
study showed how difficult it was for former recipients to hold
onto jobs, even in flush times. The report, they noted, indicated
that about 20 percent of those who left welfare returned to the
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that people who left welfare in New York may
actually be doing better than former recipients in some states that
have been celebrated for their welfare-to-work efforts, like
Wisconsin and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey released last January, Wisconsin reported that 62
percent of former welfare recipients surveyed were working full
time or part time when they were interviewed and that 83 percent of
respondents had worked at some point since leaving welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wisconsin survey deliberately excluded anyone who had
left welfare during the first three months of 1998 and then
returned over the next nine months. By excluding those who returned
to welfare, Wisconsin officials got significantly better results
than if they had included former recipients who were unable to find
work and went back on the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, New York included people who returned to the
welfare rolls, and it achieved largely the same results.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 690,000 people have left the state's two main welfare
programs _ Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Home Relief
_ since 1995, according to state social-services data. About
470,000 of them left welfare in New York City in that period.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like a family that suddenly finds itself with
enough cash to pay off both its credit cards and its mortgage, the
Clinton administration moved on Wednesday to take advantage of
projected federal budget surpluses by overhauling the way the
government handles its finances.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1972, the Treasury Department wants to
buy back debt, a change in its strategy for handling the $3.6
trillion it owes to the public in the form of Treasury bonds and
other securities as it seeks to minimize its interest expenses.
</P>
<P>
   With the government already running a budget surplus if its
excess Social Security revenues are included, the Treasury has been
using much of the extra money for the last two years to reduce the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The debt will decline by about $87 billion this year, and if the
surplus grows as projected over the next decade, the pace of debt
reduction could accelerate substantially.
</P>
<P>
   As with most issues involving the surplus, this one is caught up
in politics. President Clinton used the prospect of cost-efficient
debt reduction as an argument on Wednesday against the $792
billion, 10-year tax cut that the Republican-controlled Congress
plans to pass in final form this week in the face of his veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the administration's debt-reduction plan
would allow the Treasury to buy back some high-interest-rate debt
from investors before it matures and to replace it with new
securities that carry lower interest rates. Much of the debt issued
by the Treasury over the last three decades carries interest rates
higher than those for government securities being issued today.
</P>
<P>
   While arcane, the changes have substantial implications for the
bond markets, where the government and private companies compete to
borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan are still being worked out and it is
unlikely to take effect until next year. Whether and when the plan
might be carried out will depend in large part on interest rates
remaining low enough for the debt buybacks to make sense. It would
not require approval by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, swapping high interest-rate debt for lower rate debt
would not accelerate the pace of reducing the national debt, which
depends on the growth of the surplus. But in general the Treasury
is issuing progressively less new debt relative to the amount that
is maturing or that might be repurchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prepayments _ in many ways analogous to a homeowner
refinancing a mortgage or a company refinancing its debt _ would
hold out the prospect for reducing federal borrowing costs over
time,'' said Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Under its current policy, the government has simply been paying
off Treasury securities when they mature, regardless of their
interest rate, and issuing smaller amounts of new debt in their
place, an approach that limits its ability to swap higher cost debt
for low-rate debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not bought back debt in any way since the
Nixon administration, and it has not repurchased debt for cash at
least since World War II and probably not in this century, Treasury
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And the changes are the leading edge of what could be even
broader shifts in the nation's financial strategy as it confronts
the possibility that it could substantially reduce or even wipe out
the government debt held by the public over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the government
will generate $2.9 trillion more in revenues over the next decade
than it needs to pay for its programs under current law. Of that,
$1.9 trillion is nominally earmarked for Social Security, but in
practice it is likely to go to reducing the debt held by the
public. The two parties are fighting over what to do with the other
$1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Treasury plan was a common-sense approach to
making the most of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely doing the right thing,'' said John
Youngdahl, an economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the debt plan could run into questions from some Republicans
because it would require that the government absorb some costs in
the short run _ in the form of the premium it would have to pay to
convince investors to sell their Treasury bonds _ in order to reap
the interest savings in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration did not say how big a debt
repurchase plan the Treasury Department might undertake, or even
when it might begin, analysts said the short-term costs could be
substantial enough to be a factor in the battle over the surplus,
since the Republicans are counting on as much as possible of it for
tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much prefer to use that money for reductions in marginal
tax rates,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, an economist and former Reagan
administration official who is influential with conservatives in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But in an appearance in the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday
afternoon, President Clinton argued that the Treasury's plan
``would, in effect, allow us to refinance old debt and pay it down
on the best terms possible, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in
the process,'' President Clinton said during an appearance in the
White House Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying down the debt creates wealth, creates jobs, creates
opportunity,'' he said. ``It's the right and responsible thing to
do, and we have the chance of a lifetime to do it.''

 WASHINGTON: do it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To protests from Republicans, who say their budget plans do more
to reduce the national debt than his plan, Clinton has sought to
frame the current debate over the surplus as a choice between an
irresponsible Republican tax cut for the wealthy and a prudent
division of money between debt reduction, increased spending and
modest tax cuts for working people.
</P>
<P>
   The debt securities issued by the Treasury generally are not
callable _ that is, the government cannot demand that investors
sell them back. Instead, under the Treasury's new plan, the
government would announce that is interested in buying back a
particular bond issue, and then ask the investors who own it to
name a price. The Treasury would accept those offers that made
sense to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gensler, the undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic
finance, used the following example to illustrate how the debt plan
would work. In November 1991, the government sold a 30-year bond
carrying an interest rate of 8 percent. The bond currently trades
in the market at an interest rate of 6.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury could repurchase that bond, Gensler said, and
replace it with a combination of 30-year bonds, which currently
carry a rate of 6.16 percent, and 10-year bonds, which currently
trade at 5.95 percent, giving an average rate of around 6.07
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, even tiny reductions in interest costs could
yield substantial savings to the government. Summers said on
Wednesday that for every three one-hundredths of a percentage point
in reduced interest rates on the total debt, the government
ultimately saves $1 billion a year in interest costs.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond just swapping high-rate debt for lower-rate debt,
Gensler said, the plan would increase the volume of new bonds being
issued by Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Because new bonds are more actively traded than older ones, and
can be more easily bought and sold, investors are willing to pay a
bit more for them, meaning their interest rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   It is that increase in the tradability of the bonds, and the
corresponding decrease in interest rates, that could bring the
biggest benefits to the taxpayer, Gensler said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the market for the bonds active is a major goal of the
plan, Gensler said, because as the national debt falls, the
Treasury is issuing fewer and fewer new bonds and other securities.
Over the last 12 months the Treasury had made 26 debt offerings, he
said; in the prior year the number was 39. On Wednesday Gensler
announced that Treasury would sell its 30-year bonds twice a year
from now on instead of three times.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the problem of keeping an active market in
government securities could become more acute if the national debt
eventually approaches zero. The market for U.S. securities is the
worldwide benchmark for safety and security in investments, and if
the market were to dry up it could make it more difficult to judge
the relative risks of various investments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Treasury would want to find a way to keep an
active market in government securities in case a war, a deep
recession or some other event led the government to need to borrow
a lot of money quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to figure out how you maintain an active market
if the Treasury's net borrowing needs are close to zero,'' said L.
Douglas Lee, an economist at HSBC Washington Analysis, an
investment firm.

ECONOMIC SCENE: OIL AND THOSE SLIPPERY ANTI-DUMPING LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday the Commerce Department is scheduled to weigh in on a
trade dispute that a number of economists say could take the
country's fair-trade laws to new heights of absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve independent oil producers that take nearly depleted wells
from major oil companies and pump out the last remnants have
accused Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Iraq and Venezuela of selling oil in
the United States for less than what they spend to produce it. That
is a violation of the trade rules that is known as dumping. The
plaintiffs are calling for the United States to impose taxes of up
to about 170 percent of the price of oil imported from these
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Economists often mock anti-dumping laws because they punish
foreigners for doing something kind for consumers: selling products
at low prices. Dumping would be a genuine threat if foreigners
could credibly drive American competitors out of business in order
to take over an industry and raise prices later on. But such cases
occur rarely, if ever. In the case of oil, the dumping accusation
makes even less sense.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is a commodity that is priced in a world market. One
producer, even if willing to absorb losses for a time by selling at
below-market prices, could never expect to recoup its losses by
raising prices above market levels in the future. Other suppliers
would strip away its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is hard to make the case that dumping is occurring
when one of the accused exporters, Saudi Arabia, spends only about
$1.50 or so to produce a barrel of oil that sells for about $15.
</P>
<P>
   Economists point out other holes in the dumping charge. The oil
market is worldwide. It does not matter whose oil goes where. A tax
slapped on four oil exporters will drive down imports from them.
But it will not drive down imports over all. Other exporters will
take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Oil that Saudi Arabia would have sent to the United States will
go instead to Europe; oil that Kuwait would have sent to Europe
will come to the United States. Once the markets figure this out,
oil supplies and prices will not change very much. ``Victory,''
said Philip Verleger, an economist for the Brattle Group, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., ``cannot help domestic
producers.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem that a flawed case would be swiftly rejected by
the government agencies that administer the trade laws. Not so,
Verleger said. The plaintiffs could easily triumph on Monday.
``When it comes to dumping, economically ludicrous cases prevail
all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Verleger's point is that the anti-dumping laws are so stacked in
favor of domestic companies that the government agencies in charge
of adjudicating trade cases almost always side against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is a common practice during times of economic
slack for U.S. companies, including oil companies, to cut prices
simply to generate enough cash to cover their operating costs even
if they lose money over all. This is perfectly legal. But when
foreign companies engage in similar price-cutting, even as a
defensive move to meet prices charged by concerns in the United
States, they end up violating anti-dumping laws.
</P>
<P>
   A second bias creeps into the process in this case because under
the law, the Commerce Department does not even have to establish
that Saudi Arabia's price falls below production costs. Instead, it
need only find that Saudi Arabia charges less in the United States
than it does somewhere else. The plaintiffs say that Saudi Arabia
sets lower prices in this country than it does in Japan. Maybe so.
But how that practice harms the United States, or proves that Saudi
Arabia is selling oil below its cost, remains unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs take advantage of another oddity in the
anti-dumping rules when they accuse the Mexican government of
subsidizing the sale of exports by Pemex, the state oil company.
But the plaintiffs conveniently ignore, as the United States laws
may allow, the offsetting amounts of money that Pemex routinely
turns over to the Mexican government. According to figures provided
by the Mexican government, it provides no net subsidy to Pemex.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stein, a lawyer representing a group of domestic oil
producers that oppose the complaint, says the behavior of oil
exporters hardly fits accusations of dumping. ``I have fought to
enforce the anti-dumping laws, first as a long-time government
official, then as lawyer for plaintiffs in anti-dumping cases,'' he
said. ``But this time I'm lining up against the plaintiffs because
they are abusing the trade laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein points out that the plaintiffs represent a small fraction
of the oil industry, yet they seek to raise prices for everyone.
The major oil companies opposed the case. So do many independents.
The anti-dumping laws are supposed to require that plaintiffs
account for a substantial proportion of the domestic industry. But
the law gives the Commerce Department wide discretion to ignore
production by Mobil, Exxon and other large domestic companies that
do business with foreigners when it determines the fraction of
domestic production provided by the plaintiffs. Commerce is
expected to decide on Monday whether the plaintiffs in the oil case
meet the law's threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Though economists often belittle the economic case for
anti-dumping laws, they acknowledge a coherent political rationale
for the laws. Low-price imports benefit hundreds of millions of
consumers, but threaten a small number of domestic producers,
driving them to seek cover from Congress. The laws mitigate
anti-trade fervor by committing countries to rules of fair play.
The laws also dilute opposition to open trade by channeling
plaintiffs into a legal mechanism stacked in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic arguments are so weak in the oil case that some
of the economists and lawyers opposed to the plaintiffs speculate
that their real purpose might be to negotiate with the Clinton
administration for a tax break or some other consolation prize if
they dropped their charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, an ardent critic of
the anti-dumping laws, best exposes the peculiarity of the case
when he considers the consequence of a victory by the plaintiffs.
``There is a silver lining in an otherwise dark cloud,'' he said.
``The absurdity of the result might finally cause Congress to amend
the dumping law in a pro-consumer direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there is any reason for thinking that the government
might side with consumers this time, it is that the Commerce
Department's normal anti-import stance could cause Vice President
Al Gore severe embarrassment. He no doubt wants to kick off his
presidential campaign with something other than an announcement
from the administration that it thinks Americans don't pay enough
at the gas pump and the home heating depot.

A WARNING ABOUT IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Saddam Hussein obtains nuclear weapons during the current
absence of UN inspectors from Iraq, then allowing him to end the
inspecting and monitoring of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
last December may become the most perilous failing of US foreign
policy in the 1990s _ and the most unpardonable act of appeasement
by the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Because the stakes are so high, it is crucial to understand how
Saddam was able to keep his prohibited weapons while bribing or
bluffing Security Council members into violating the terms of the
UN resolutions of 1991, which required him to declare all his
weapons of mass destruction within 15 days and destroy them within
one year.
</P>
<P>
   This is the desolating story told in the new magazine Talk by
Richard Butler, former head of Unscom, the UN Special Commission
established to carry out those unambiguous resolutions. Butler's
account has been publicized for its damning charges about the role
that the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, played in permitting
Saddam to break free of the weapons inspectors. Annan does look
foolish or disingenuous in Butler's version of the UN capitulation
to Saddam, and the secretary general needs to respond more
seriously than he has to Butler's persuasive brief. But the import
of Butler's indictment encompasses much more than incompetence in
the UN's top bureaucrat.
</P>
<P>
   Butler describes how Russian diplomats and ministers worked hand
in glove with Iraq to thwart Unscom. France and China played
supporting roles in the Security Council's rescue of Saddam. And
although Butler defends the Clinton administration against charges
that it permitted Unscom to be terminated, there is no doubting
that Washington allowed its ally France, a bankrupt Russia, and a
China that benefits from a $70 billion trade surplus with the
United States to help Saddam become the most dangerous terrorist in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's Cassandra-like warning about Iraq had better be heeded
soon. Independent inspectors must return to locate and destroy all
of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction, whether chemical,
biological, or nuclear.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you're going to mess up an ad, don't mess up
a lawyer's ad.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson that Alliance Media Group Inc. of San Antonio
learned the hard way Wednesday when a judge approved a temporary
injunction that bars Alliance from distributing its new Austin
Areawide Directory. The company had agreed to the injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Austin lawyers _ including Mayor Kirk Watson and Bill
Whitehurst, a former president of the State Bar of Texas _ sued
Alliance Media two weeks ago because the new directory had what
purported to be their ads in the yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   Free ads are not necessarily a bad thing, but in this case, the
ads were not only out of date but contained unprofessional slogans
that the lawyers said they would never use and could get them in
trouble with the State Bar _ slogans like ``Make Money the Easy
Way'' and ``Easy Money!'' Alliance Media officials did not respond
to requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Alice London, one of the lawyers who sued the company, said the
company had indicated that the ads had been sabotaged by an
employee.

AN ANEMIC FOOD STAMP PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government says food stamps are ``the first line of defense
against hunger.'' Unfortunately, years of bureaucratic delay are
punching holes in that defense, according to a report from the
General Accounting Office. The US Department of Agriculture, which
runs the food stamp program, must fix the holes.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes a sharp drop in food stamp use _ a 27
percent decline in participation over the past 3 1/2 years. The
main reason for the drop is a strong economy; other factors are
welfare reform and tighter food eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also voices concern that state efforts to reduce
welfare caseloads ``may have diminished eligible children's
participation'' in the food stamp program. The statistics concur.
The number of children helped by food stamps has dropped more
sharply than the number of children living in poverty. This
suggests that the program isn't meeting the need. Proof turned up
in New York City and Milwaukee, both of which have violated federal
law with unduly strict food stamp policies, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem is that states are in a federal policy
vacuum. Three years ago the federal welfare reform law changed the
rules on food stamps, giving states more leeway in setting up
procedures. But the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service still hasn't
published the rules. The department attributes the delay to a
reorganization. In addition, required yearly examinations on how
states are running their food stamp programs do not always occur
because of a lack of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare is no longer an entitlement program, but food stamps
are. And they are essential to low-income families as well as to
welfare recipients who are expected to find and keep jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Watkins, The USDA's undersecretary of food, nutrition,
and consumer services, is expected to testify in a congressional
hearing. The best thing she could do is announce a major overhaul
that will cut through the bureaucratic barbed wire that keeps
eligible citizens from getting this crucial aid.

 &HT;    Construction tops work fatality list
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The number of workers killed in on-the-job
accidents jumped 14 percent in Texas last year, primarily because
more fell to their death, were attacked or came in touch with
harmful substances.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the number of workplace deaths nationally fell to
the lowest level since the U.S. Department of Labor began keeping
track in 1992. Nationally, the number of job-related deaths fell to
6,026 in 1998 _ about 17 fatal injuries each day _ down from 6,238
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for 1998 were released Wednesday by the Texas
Workers' Compensation Commission and the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 523 workers died on the job in Texas last year, up from
459 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The increase statewide showed up in Central Texas as well.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County had 12 on-the-job fatalities last year, the
highest since 1995, when there were also 12. In 1997, there were
nine work fatalities in Travis County and there were six in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Williamson County, there were 10 work fatalities
last year, the highest since 1995, when there were 12. There were
two in 1997 and one in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Richardson, chief of safety information systems at the
state commission, said many of the Texas deaths involved the
construction and transportation and public utilities industries,
all surging areas because of a strong economy. There were 143
fatalities in the construction business last year and 99 in the
transportation and utilities industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a lot of construction going on and crews need to
be pulled together quickly, sometimes people on those crews don't
have the requisite skills or safety training, and you tend to see
an increase in fatalities,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents involving transportation, particularly on the
highways, remained the single most common type of fatality,
accounting for 213 of the 523 deaths statewide.
</P>
<P>
   However, reflecting the increase in deaths in the construction
industry, the largest increase in the type of deaths came from
falls, with 59 in 1998 compared with 40 in 1997. The number had
declined the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of people dying because of violent assaults on
the job _ those killed during a robbery while working at a
convenience store, for example _ jumped to 79 last year from 63 in
1997. However, that was still better than the 103 deaths recorded
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Len Riley, executive director of the commission, said that the
``good news is that the number of fatalities in agriculture and of
workers hit by vehicles and moving objects went down _ the latter
change may be the result of legislative action to increase fines in
highway work zones.''
</P>
<P>
   But other types of transportation fatalities went up along with
those in construction, Riley said, so the commission is focusing
more of its safety training programs in those two areas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in total number of fatalities, Richardson
said, Texas workers overall are not more at risk than they were in
1997. That's because the rate of fatalities _ the number of deaths
per 100,000 workers _ barely rose. But one industry did show a
noticeable jump in the rate of deaths: construction went up from 18
deaths per 100,000 workers in 1997 to 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _The number of women killed, 46, was the highest ever, up from
42 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _Agriculture, mining and wholesale trade recorded the lowest
annual fatality totals since the study began in 1991, while
construction and transportation-public utilities recorded the
highest totals ever.
</P>
<P>
   _The total number of fatalities in 1998, 523, was not the
highest ever; there were 536 in 1992 and 529 in 1992.

CONGRESS'S EMPTY TAX PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly hidden in all the tax cut posturing on Capitol Hill are
welcome signs that Congress might actually give the people a
sensible tax reduction, which they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far from a sure thing. It will certainly not be
found in the package agreed to by Republican leaders of the House
and Senate late Tuesday. That package was fashioned in the teeth of
a veto threat from President Clinton, which it richly deserves. Its
cuts, estimated at $792 billion over 10 years, are far too large,
disproportionately kind to the wealthy, and woven of gossamer
economic projections, especially in the later years.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken a lot of brass for Congress to assemble these tax
cuts, which depend on projections that the current budget caps will
be maintained at the same time Congress is circumventing those caps
by pretending that health benefits for veterans and the census are
``emergency'' items to be funded outside the normal budget.
</P>
<P>
   This transparent pretense, together with the leadership strategy
of keeping the bill from the White House until after the
congressional recess, shows that the work to date has been
overwhelmingly political.
</P>
<P>
   We hope that this posturing is only a preliminary skirmish in a
process that will eventually produce a compromise tax cut. The GOP
package contains some reason for optimism, including its acceptance
that across-the-board decreases in the income tax rate would have
to stop if the national debt cannot also be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the maneuvering produces only stalemate and
ammunition for finger-pointing, there will be serious consequences.
For one thing, several existing tax incentives, including credits
for research and development, will expire unless reenacted.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the public will rightly feel manipulated. One would think
elected representatives would rate their constituents' sagacity
highly; after all, the voters were smart enough to elect them. If
only gridlock results, people will not look kindly on this week's
posturing in Washington.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Troy Aikman once said he would leave the NFL at
the age of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his 33rd birthday looming in November, Aikman says he
expects to play another three to five seasons. The Cowboys
quarterback, a lock for the Hall of Fame when he does decide to
hang up his cleats, is driven by one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out on top is the way everybody would like to do it,''
Aikman said. ``But I'd like our football team to get back to the
respectability we once had. I think we're on track for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the need for respect, there's a fear of failure. He
suffered through a 1-15 season as a rookie. He struggled with the
6-10 mark in Barry Switzer's final year as coach. And he's not over
the humiliation of the Cowboys' wild-card loss to Arizona in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of losing, the fear of embarrassment, is really what
motivates me every year,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's convinced the Cowboys are heading in the right
direction. It's the reason he signed a six-year contract extension
in April worth $85.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time not too long ago when the thought of playing
three to five more years wasn't appealing and Aikman was
considering walking away. The Cowboys' problems were mounting as
they went from Super Bowl champions to 6-10 laughingstocks in two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Aikman might not have enjoyed going to work, but
there was never a question about his competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as intense and driven and as passionate about the game as
I've ever been,'' Aikman said. ``Sometimes I wish I wasn't as
intense about it. Maybe some of the push that I have, sometimes I
wish it wasn't quite as strong as it is. But it is what it is, and
that hasn't changed. I don't think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys don't win an NFL title this season, it will be
the longest drought of Aikman's career. The Cowboys won the Super
Bowl after the 1992 season, Aikman's fourth year at the helm. They
added a ring in '93 and another in '95. But the Cowboys haven't
been beyond the divisional playoffs in the three years since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to back off a little bit and not be quite as
competitive as I am in certain situations,'' he said, ``but that's
just my makeup, and I want to win the Super Bowl as bad today as
before I won the first one. It's still important to win, and I
would be highly disappointed if I didn't win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the loss to Arizona to avenge. Sure, the Cowboys
improved last year from 6-10 to 10-6. They won their division by
sweeping their divisional foes during the regular season. But they
ended the season with a downward spiral that began in New Orleans
on Dec. 6 and was completed when they were humiliated at home by
Arizona 20-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is you don't want to come off the field
embarrassed,'' Aikman said. ``I don't worry about what my numbers
have been in the playoffs. I don't concern myself with where my
place is in history. I really don't care about any of that stuff.
What I do care about is that I want to go out and do everything I
can to help my football team win. Leave the field with the respect
of my teammates, my peers and the coaches around the league, and I
will feel like I had a successful career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the disappointment last year one, it was a playoff
opportunity for us to go to the Super Bowl, and we failed to do
that. More importantly, we didn't play as well as we could've
played. I didn't play as well as I could've played, and it was
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   His place in history is well established. His numbers are more
than respectable. He has thrown for 28,346 yards in his 10-year
career. He has 141 touchdown passes and has completed 61.8 percent
of his passes.
</P>
<P>
   The only number that really matters, however, is three. Aikman,
Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana are the only quarterbacks in NFL
history to lead a team to three Super Bowl victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Cowboys owner) Jerry (Jones) pays me to go out
and throw for 400 yards a game,'' Aikman said. ``We're all here to
win. I hear a lot of people complaining about not getting the ball
enough or not being used enough. And you hear about this on winning
football teams. Could I have put up bigger numbers? Sure. But I
don't know that I could've and we could've had the success that
we've had. It's always been about the team. It's always been about
us winning. And we've been able to win while I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is still not sure what went wrong last year. The Cowboys
won early with coach Chan Gailey's new offense, yet failed to
execute late when the offense was more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to be critical over the last four or five
games,'' Aikman said. ``But we finished eighth in the league in
offense, and at one time we were third in the league in offense.
You can't lead the league in offense if you're not throwing the
ball that many times a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at us offensively last year, really the only area
where we struggled was third-and-five or -six. If we convert those,
we're not answering any questions about what happened to the
offense. I don't know why we didn't have more success in those
situations. We just didn't throw and catch the ball. That's kind of
it in a nutshell.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not age, Aikman insists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like my best years are ahead of me,'' Aikman
said. ``I feel good about my season last year. I don't feel like I
had a poor year. If I hadn't missed five games due to injury,
statistically it could've been my best year. I don't feel that my
game has slipped. I still feel like I can go out and play at a high
level and compete and do the things that I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly precedent for older quarterbacks doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around 11 years, and, barring any injuries, I think
I can play another five,'' Aikman said. ``(John) Elway played 16
years, and Dan (Marino) is on his 17th year. Some of these people
are ancient. Three to five is a realistic time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say `ancient' respectfully. I'm a huge Marino fan. I would
never want to see him retire. I enjoy watching him play. And from
the game's point of view, the game's going to miss something with
Elway not playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The position is not an easy position to play, and it takes
time for a young quarterback to work himself into playing at the
level the team needs the quarterback to play at in order to be
successful. The position is not so much a physical position but
more mental. As you get older, as long as you can still make the
throws and remain healthy, then teams have a good chance with an
older quarterback or a more experienced quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And with a full season in the new offense, plus a couple of key
player acquisitions, Aikman is truly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a time when that might have been the case,''
Aikman said when asked if he had trouble believing his own words.
``I think maybe a few years back. But I believe that we should be
better this year. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   And if desire translates into results, there should be at least
one more ring on his hand before Aikman hangs it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I want more than to win another Super Bowl,''
Aikman said. ``If in five years we didn't win another Super Bowl
and it came time that I didn't feel I had it anymore _ I would be
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won one this year, would that then mean we've climbed
the mountain and we're back on top and I'm ready to walk away from
the game? I don't think that would be the case either. I still have
a lot of years in me. But there's no question there's nothing I'd
like more than to be able to walk away at the top.''

DASCHLE SAYS IT'S OK FOR MEDIA TO PRESS BUSH ON `COCAINE QUESTION' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle suggested
Wednesday that the media had gone easy on pressing Texas Gov.
George W. Bush about details of his private life and said it was
appropriate to ask the Republican presidential front-runner if he
had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a legitimate question,'' Daschle, of South Dakota,
said in answer to an inquiry at a breakfast with journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush has detailed a drinking problem that he says ended
about 14 years ago, the governor has refused to answer questions
about drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the session with reporters, Daschle, reflecting on
close media attention paid to President Clinton's personal life,
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The media in general seem to be respecting far more (Bush's)
privacy and his lack of willingness to discuss his past than you
might have been with others.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Daschle said he was referring to ``not just drugs
_ his whole past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I made mistakes,' and it appears that the media
seems to accept that as fact and they're ready to move on,''
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally in Iowa, Bush dismissed Daschle's remarks as
a difference of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news media has explored a lot, as you well know,'' Bush
told reporters. ``Mr. Daschle can have his opinion and I can have
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, as he has before, that he does not want to answer the
drug question because it would send the wrong signal to his
children and other teen-agers. He declined to say whether it was
inappropriate for Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic
front-runner, to admit to marijuana use as he did in his 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got to play it the way they want to play it, but
times have changed in politics. There's a game of vicious gossip
and I'm not going to participate in the game of vicious gossip. If
the voters don't like that, they can find someone else to be for.''
</P>
<P>
   Several news organizations, including the Houston Chronicle,
have investigated wispy allegations about Bush and drugs. Two major
publications have published stories over the last three months
about the issue without offering proof of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal, in May, ran a story whose findings were
summed up in one of its headlines: ``Tales of Wildness are Easier
to Spread Than Back Up.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of lengthy stories last month about the governor's
life, The Washington Post included a Bush answer to what one of the
paper's reporters called ``the cocaine question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think you believe that a politician should not let stories
fester,'' a Post reporter told Bush in an interview. ``So why won't
you just deny that you've used cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about what I did years ago. This is a
game where they float rumors, force a person to fight off a rumor;
then they'll float another rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, Daschle's press secretary, said Daschle was
seeking to draw a distinction between public figures ``who are
pressed by the press and those who aren't.... This wasn't sort of a
sly way of trying to get folks to say Daschle thinks (Bush's)
cocaine use needs to be investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   After saying that questions of drug use were legitimate for a
presidential candidate and should be answered, Daschle added: ``The
second question is that if a person denies it, how many press
people, how many investigators do you put on his tail to find out
whether he's telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said that no matter whether a candidate answered
questions about drug use, voters would ``have to make a judgment as
to how important that question is in the overall scheme of whether
this person is competent to hold office or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he did not believe drug use was ``a competency
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said that ``because you have a right to ask me have you
ever taken cocaine, the answer is no I haven't. I'm not sure I've
ever seen it, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also told the crowd in Clear Lake, Iowa, that Republican
members of the U.S. House and Senate are moving in the right
direction on tax cuts, and he urged President Clinton to sign the
bill Congress produced. Clinton has vowed to veto the $792 million
tax cut bill Congress passed this week.
</P>

RIGHTS GROUP SUES NEW JERSEY OVER CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A children's rights organization filed a
class-action lawsuit in federal court in Trenton Wednesday charging
that New Jersey was jeopardizing the safety of children in its care
because of an inadequate child welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by Children's Rights Inc., a New York City
nonprofit group, comes at time when the New Jersey has taken a
number of steps to improve its child welfare system, and some
advocates questioned Wednesday whether the lawsuit would interfere
with that process.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Robinson Lowry, executive director of Children's Rights,
said that children removed by the state from their parents' home
languished in foster care too long before being returned home or
before a permanent adoptive home was found for them. The suit also
charges that children in foster care are often worse off than in
the homes of their parents because of the lack of vigilance by
state investigators and caseworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly don't have a serious approach to solving their
problems,'' Ms. Lowry said. ``We consider a lawsuit a last resort.
We proposed a process to the state to seriously discuss what could
be done to resolve these problems. But they rejected us.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's Rights has filed lawsuits against 11 other states and
cities based on similar complaints, including New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But New Jersey officials and advocates for children here point
out that the state began a reform plan prodded by the death of
several children in its care several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of those deaths, Gov. Christie Whitman appointed a
blue-ribbon panel to study the state's system. The panel issued a
scathing report in February 1998 that enumerated the child welfare
system's failings and recommended changes.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, according to Charles Venti, director of the
Division for Youth and Family Services, the state had added $77
million to its budget of $550 million and used the money to hire
227 more caseworkers, 18 deputy attorneys general and other
personnel to speed up the proceedings to sever parents' legal
rights. The agency has also instituted more training for
caseworkers and foster families.
</P>
<P>
   The state has also begun to cut the time children spend in their
care. Children who were returned to their families last year had
spent an average of 20.9 months in foster care, down from 22.8
months in 1997. Those who were adopted last year had spent an
average of 23.5 months in foster care, down from 24.4 months in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view, they're compelled to file the lawsuit because
that's what they do for a living,'' Venti said. ``We don't want to
divert our attention, our time, energy and resources from these
massive reforms we're trying to make to doing battle in court. We
think it will drain our system, not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has also torn apart the community of advocates for
children in New Jersey, who agree with Children's Rights that
changes were needed in New Jersey. Most of them say the lawsuit is
not the best way to bring about change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cases detailed in the complaint are compelling,
devastating and they are representative of what exists here,'' said
Cecilia Zalkind, a lawyer and the associate director for the
Association for Children of New Jersey, a nonprofit advocacy group
that helped Children's Rights gather data. ``Our concern is whether
litigation is the most effective strategy for change at this time.
We think it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that her organization had talked to advocates for
children in other states where Children's Rights had filed lawsuits
and that ``the results were a mixed bag.''

HARDAWAY TENTATIVELY AGREES TO JOIN THE SUNS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway, the Orlando Magic's four-time All-Star guard,
has tentatively agreed to a seven-year, $86 million contract with
the Phoenix Suns. The deal must be approved by the Magic and the
NBA before Hardaway is signed by Orlando and traded to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Magic officials were looking at last-minute offers for Hardaway
Wednesday night, but the club seemed to be leaning toward parting
with Hardaway, its franchise player, for Phoenix forwards Pat
Garrity and Danny Manning and a pair of first-round draft picks. It
was unclear late Wednesday night whether the deal had been made
final.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' owner, Jerry Colangelo, courted Hardaway more
aggressively than any other team did, and he said Wednesday that
Phoenix was merely waiting for the Magic to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   On the Suns, Hardaway would team with point guard Jason Kidd to
form one of the league's most potent backcourt tandems. And Phoenix
should still have forward Tom Gugliotta, the club's leading scorer
last season, whom the Magic had wanted in exchange for Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Hardaway is another clear sign that the Magic has
decided to rebuild. Orlando parted with Nick Anderson on Tuesday in
exchange for Sacramento's Tariq Abdul-Wahad.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity and the two first-round picks were the most enticing
commodities for Orlando in the Hardaway deal, while the aging
Manning was thrown in for salary-cap purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In what was shaping up to be an active day in the NBA, the
Cleveland Cavaliers acquired forward Lamond Murray from the Los
Angeles Clippers for swingman Derek Anderson and forward Johnny
Newman in a sign-and-trade deal. Derek Anderson wanted more money
than the Cavaliers were willing to pay, forcing the team's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a free agent, re-signed with the Clippers, who then
shipped him to the Cavaliers. He reportedly signed a seven-year
deal worth $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 187 free agents available for signing since Sunday,
Hardaway attracted the most interest. Along with Washington's Mitch
Richmond, he was considered the most sought-after free agent on the
market who might actually leave his current team.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway had three years left on his current contract with
Orlando before exercising a clause that made him a free agent. He
averaged 15.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists a game during
the lockout-shortened regular season, his sixth in the league. But
his petulant behavior often drew the ire of teammates and
management the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, 28, spent most of the regular season feuding with the
veteran coach Chuck Daly over the handling of point guard duties.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-9 Garrity averaged 5.6 points in 39 games for Phoenix
during his rookie season out of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charles Oakley, the Toronto Raptors free agent and
former Knick, was headed to the Bahamas Thursday after spending two
days in Los Angeles with the Lakers' president, Jerry West.
Oakley's business manager, Billy Diamond, said he would wait at
least a week before making a decision.

HENRY W. SAWYER III, 80, LAWYER IN LANDMARK CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Miss.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry W. Sawyer III, who successfully argued two landmark
Supreme Court cases that have helped define today's boundaries
between church and state, died July 31 at a hospital in
Philadelphia, where he lived. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said a close friend and
colleague, David Bruton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, in Schempp vs. Abington School District, the court, in
an 8-1 decision, held that state-ordered recitation of the Lord's
Prayer and Bible readings in public school classrooms were
unconstitutional but that religion could be taught as an academic
subject. Sawyer represented the Schempp family in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, in Lemon vs. Kurtzman, in which Sawyer
represented several nonprofit groups and individuals in
Pennsylvania, the court, in an 8-0 decision, set forth a three-part
test for deciding whether a law or government program that
conferred a benefit on religion passed muster under the First
Amendment to the Constitution, which says that there can be no
state-established religion.
</P>
<P>
   The three criteria are that the law or program must have a
secular legislative purpose; that its principal or primary effect
must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and that
it must not foster an excessive government entanglement with
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both terribly important cases, and to be an attorney
in both of them is to be someone who has helped shape the debate
over religion in schools over the last third of the 20th century,
and, more important, into the 21st century,'' said James Fraser,
dean of the school of education at Northeastern University in
Boston and the author of ``Between Church and State: Religion and
Public Education in a Multicultural America (St. Martin's Press,
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer also won a court battle in Philadelphia in 1979
representing citizens who opposed Mayor Frank Rizzo's decision to
use city money to pay for an altar and platform used for a Mass
celebrated by Pope John Paul II during a visit to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was born on Dec. 23, 1918, in Philadelphia. He graduated
from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of
Pennsylvania Law School. He also served five years in the U.S. Navy
as a lieutenant commander during World War II and as a commander
with the U.S. Naval Arctic Expedition for the Korean War in 1951.
He then served in the State Department from 1951 to 1953, first on
the political staff of the U.S. delegation to NATO, and later as
the assistant general counsel to the U.S. special representative in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the law firm of Drinker Biddle &AMP; Reath in 1948. He
later became a managing partner and head of the firm's litigation
department. He retired from the firm in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and early 1960s, Sawyer was known for his
representation of several people who were investigated and
prosecuted by the government because of political activities.

   In another Supreme Court case, U.S. vs. Deutch, in 1960, Sawyer
obtained a reversal of a contempt of Congress conviction for a
physicist, Bernhard Deutch, who testified before a congressional
committee about communist affiliations but refused to inform on
others.

   In a 5-4 decision, the court held that there was a limit on the

   He argued that the questions were not relevant to any
legislative or investigative purpose and therefore did not have to
be answered,'' Bruton said.

   Sawyer traveled to Mississippi in 1965 to defend the right of
blacks to register to vote. In 1969, he started a federal case that
exposed racial discrimination in hiring for the Philadelphia Police

hiring by the department.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Bernard E. Simon, the last of a group of American
plastic surgeons who donated their services to help the ``Hiroshima
Maidens,'' 25 disfigured and maimed survivors of the American
bombing of Hiroshima, died on Aug. 1 at Mt &UR; . &LR;  Sinai Hospital in
Manhattan, where he had worked for more than 40 years. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of bringing the 25 badly scarred young women to the
United States for treatment originated in 1955 with Norman Cousins,
the editor of The Saturday Review.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, then clinical professor of surgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital,
and two of his colleagues were deeply moved when Cousins showed
them photographs of the women's injuries and told them that some of
the women habitually wore masks while others were afraid to be seen
in public.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Mt. Sinai surgical staff members agreed to donate their
services, Cousins raised the money to bring the women to New York.
Some of them stayed for only a few months, but the more seriously
injured underwent a series of operations over a period of 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the surgeons performed 140 operations, rebuilding
lips, noses, hands, eyelids and other damaged tissues.
</P>
<P>
   At a reunion in 1996 with some of the women, one of them,
Michiko Yamaoka, said of Simon: ``He hasn't changed a bit. He's
still the loving and caring man that operated on me years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Shigeko Sasamori, another of the women, who flew to New York
last month when she learned Simon was in failing health, said she
could not imagine what her life would have been like had it not
been for Cousins and Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One third of my body was burned, especially my neck and
hands,'' she recalled Tuesday. ``Dr. Simon and his colleagues
operated on me more than a dozen times. I was then able to marry
and give birth to a son.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons made a difference not only by healing the women but
also by instructing Japanese surgeons in plastic surgery, a field
virtually unknown in Japan in the years just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the program inspired some similar efforts to heal
the wounds of war. Cousins later brought a number of Polish
survivors of Nazi medical experiments at the Ravensbruck
concentration camp to the United States for treatment. Another
effort, chiefly organized by a Mt. Sinai colleague of Simon's,
Arthur Joseph Barsky, was the Children's Medical Relief
International, which treated 1,200 injured Vietnamese children a
year from 1969 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Simon received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins Medical
School in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Everett Simon was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 9, 1912, the
son of immigrant parents who had lived near Kiev in Russia. He
graduated from Columbia College in 1932 and then entered Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. After graduating
from Johns Hopkins, he did his residency at Mt. Sinai and remained
on its staff throughout his career. He retired as chief of the
division of plastic surgery at Mt. Sinai in 1979, but continued to
teach and write until the year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's wife, Bitten H. Simon, died in 1995. Simon is survived
by his daughter, Cathy Simon of San Francisco; his son, John Robert
Simon of Salt Lake City, and one granddaughter.

 &HT;    Smoltz battles but Braves stumble
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A loss in the first game of this series and it was
simply a rough start. A second loss in this series and it's a
full-out flounder.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Braves' 3-2 loss to the Pirates on Wednesday
night cost them another half-game in the NL East standings as they
fell to the NL Central's fourth-place Pirates for the second
consecutive night.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped the Braves to 9-11 since the All-Star break,
including 5-9 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite another gutty pitching performance by John Smoltz, the
Braves couldn't keep pace offensively. With their manager in the
clubhouse serving his two-game suspension, the Braves bats were
apparently tucked away, too.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an offensive spark, the Braves inserted newcomer
Jose Hernandez into the lineup. He added two strikeouts to up his
season total to 101. He grounded into a double play to quell a
fifth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the lineup didn't fare much better against Todd
Ritchie, who's been tough on the Braves in a start and a relief
appearance this season, allowing only two earned runs in 8 1/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves scored an unearned run off him in the fourth on an
errant throw by Kevin Young at first base to score Brian Jordan,
who'd gotten the first hit of the game off Ritchie when he lined a
double past Abraham Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   The second Braves run came on a Greg Myers home run, his second
in four games with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz at partial strength has not been enough lately. He has
not won since June 18, six starts ago. On Wednesday night, it
wasn't necessarily his doing as the Pirates scored a pair of
unearned runs in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone had a great chance at a double play on an Al Martin
grounder but threw past Hernandez into left field instead. That
allowed the Pirates to collect runs on a sacrifice bunt and a
sacrifice fly for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz allowed leadoff singles on the first pitch of the first
and third innings and each time that runner came around to score on
a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   He limited the Pirates to five hits, one for extra bases. He
pitched much more effectively than his last outing against the
Phillies, probably because he threw the slider in spots, despite
the strain it puts on his sore elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He also mixed in an occasional curve to keep the Pirates from
looking for his fastball.

EDITORIAL: NORTH KOREA'S DANGEROUS MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, August 5:
</P>
<P>
   North Korea threatens to escalate tensions in Asia and heighten
its own isolation if it goes ahead with another long-range missile
test in the next few weeks. The Taepodong 2 missile, first tested
last August, has a range of 3,700 miles, which makes it capable of
hitting Alaska and Hawaii as well as Japan and U.S. military
targets throughout the Western Pacific. A second test would rightly
be taken as a return to belligerent behavior by a country that
recently seemed to be signaling an interest in more constructive
relations with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Japan and South Korea have warned North Korea
not to go ahead with the test. All three countries have been
exploring improved relations with Pyongyang through diplomatic
encounters, trade discussions, humanitarian relief projects and
tourism. Such efforts would be stopped short by a missile test.
Further, Japan could be pushed to strengthen its air force and add
missile defenses, which some of its neighbors, including China,
might find troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, North Korea has learned to use threats of
menacing behavior as a bargaining tactic to extort economic and
diplomatic rewards. That approach began in the early 1990s when
Pyongyang appeared ready to reprocess nuclear reactor fuel into
bomb ingredients. Washington responded imaginatively to that crisis
by negotiating a useful agreement that committed the North to
abandon reprocessing. In exchange, the United States, South Korea
and Japan agreed to finance fuel-oil imports and construct a new,
more safely designed reactor. But North Korea later renewed its
threatening behavior. Last year it began excavations for what
appeared to be a new reprocessing plant and then demanded increased
food assistance for allowing inspection of the suspect site. As it
turned out, no new reprocessing plant was built. Now the North may
be trying to win new concessions with its missile test
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   In both earlier cases, North Korea backed off in time to avoid a
crisis. But if it now proceeds to a missile test, it should get a
very chilly response. Washington should withdraw its recent
proposal offering the North an end to most economic sanctions and
steps toward diplomatic recognition. That offer is conditioned on
constructive North Korean behavior and is not compatible with
long-range missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Seoul should suspend its new tourism arrangement
with the North and Tokyo should block payments home from North
Korean citizens living in Japan. America's reaction should not
include military steps or suspending the nuclear agreement, which
continues to serve the interests of the United States and its Asian
allies.
</P>
<P>
   A missile test would not violate any international treaty or
agreement with the United States. But it would be a clear sign that
North Korea is more interested in developing its military strength
and capacity to export dangerous weapons than in pursuing U.S.
offers of help and cooperation. North Korea should think carefully
and draw back.  &QL;

A FOURTH TRY AT STATE AID FOR HASIDIC VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite court rejections of three earlier laws intended to
accomplish the same goal, the New York state Legislature passed
provisions in its budget bills early Wednesday morning intended to
provide funds for a public school district for handicapped Hasidic
children in the upstate village of Kiryas Joel. A spokesman for
Gov. George Pataki said he would sign the new provision.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Kiryas Joel initiative was passed overwhelmingly
after midnight as the Legislature rushed to complete work on the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation does not identify Kiryas Joel by name. Rather it
gives any town, village or other municipality of between 10,000 and
125,000 inhabitants that is contained within a larger school
district the right to petition for creation of a discrete school
district and to receive state assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Any new district would have to be approved in one of two ways,
by voters or by governing boards in the breakaway municipality and
in the larger school district.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office said the terms of the new provision were broad
enough to potentially affect 29 municipalities _ not just Kiryas
Joel but Elmira, New Rochelle, Lockport, Middletown, Kingston,
Saratoga, Westbury and others. There has been no indication that
those municipalities have sought to secede from larger school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state courts have thrown out earlier state laws
passed on behalf of Kiryas Joel _ in 1989, 1994 and 1997. The
courts found them unconstitutional because they amounted to a favor
for a single religious group. The first law named Kiryas Joel
specifically while the other two would have applied only to Kiryas
Joel or just one other municipality in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said Pataki
considered the new provision to give ``school districts a menu of
options for reorganization _ to annex, merge, partition, centralize
or consolidate.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was more
willing to say that the provision was tailored for Kiryas Joel, a
village of 15,000 Hasidim in the Monroe-Woodbury school district in
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The village's nonhandicapped students have always attended
private yeshivas, but through the mid-1980s, its handicapped
children attended special education classes in Monroe-Woodbury
schools. After the village decided that those children, with their
distinctive appearance, were subjected to ridicule, it formed its
own public school district and has sought state special education
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Severely handicapped children need to be served,'' Silver
said. ``The surrounding school district, Monroe-Woodbury, has
indicated they support a separate district. They don't want the
burden _ I emphasize the burden _ of providing for those children.
And knowing the culture and the heritage of the parents, those
children would be kept in the closet, not provided services, if
this district was not provided.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents within Kiryas Joel, who want the handicapped children
educated in religious settings rather than secular public schools,
no matter what the cost, were unhappy with Wednesday's legislative
actions. ``This is a political kickback for a leadership which
delivered them a bloc vote,'' said Joseph Waldman, the spokesman
for a dissident faction of the Satmar Hasidim in Kiryas Joel.

UPPER HUDSON FISH UNSAFE, EPA WARNS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By   RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a major step toward a possible order to dredge
the Hudson River, the Environmental Protection Agency reported
Wednesday that PCBs pose an unacceptably high risk of cancer and
other ills in people who eat fish from the river's northern
reaches.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are bad news for the General Electric Co., which
discharged an estimated one million pounds of PCBs into the river
from the 1940s to 1977 _ the practice was legal at the time _ and
could be forced to pay for a cleanup that might cost hundreds of
millions of dollars and take a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   GE has argued for years that there is no evidence that PCBs pose
any health risk to people and that the river is growing steadily
cleaner on its own. Wednesday, the company said it would review the
EPA findings.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, when it banned PCBs, the EPA has called them
probable carcinogens. But Wednesday's report represents by far the
most detailed attempt to quantify the risk to humans from exposure
to PCBs in the Hudson. The agency's one previous attempt, a much
sketchier study in 1991, reached similar conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on experiments on laboratory animals, the federal agency
calculated that someone who eats fish from the part of the Hudson
north of Troy once a week for 40 years would face a one in 1,000
chance of getting cancer as a result, 10 times the maximum risk
level it considers acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also concluded that this fish eater would ingest 116
times as much of the contaminant as the maximum amount it believes
is safe for noncancer ailments like neurological damage and low
birth weight in babies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the problems associated with ingesting PCBs, the
study said that there was a limited cancer risk to people who wade
in the river but do not eat the fish. And it reported a high risk
to wildlife in and around the river.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups seized on the report as crucial evidence of
the claims they have made for years: that PCBs pose a significant
threat to people living along the river. And they said that the
report makes it highly likely that the environmental agency will
order that the contaminated sediment in the river be dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the piece that we've been waiting for,'' said Cara
Lee, environmental director of the conservation group Scenic
Hudson. ``They have made the case that it's a significant health
risk, which is a necessary part of ordering a cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency has struggled for a decade with the
questions of whether contamination of the river constitutes a
threat to people, and if so, what to do about it. The agency says
it will make a preliminary decision on dredging by the end of 2000,
and a final decision in mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the future of the Hudson is part of a larger
dispute over what risks, if any, are posed by PCBs. On Tuesday, a
panel of experts convened by the National Research Council at the
request of federal agencies and Congress reported that there was
not enough evidence to say whether there is any health risk from
ordinary levels of environmental exposure to a group of chemicals
called endocrine disrupters, a group that includes PCBs.
</P>
<P>
   Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, are a group of 209 related
chemicals that were once widely used as insulators in transformers
and other electrical equipment because of their ability to
withstand tremendous heat.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-mile portion of the river covered by Wednesday's report,
on the southern fringe of the Adirondacks, is sparsely populated,
and officials advise against eating any fish caught there.

LEGISLATURE WILL CONSIDER TIGHTENING REGULATION OF LOBBYISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Legislative leaders said for the first time
Wednesday that they would support tighter restrictions on lobbying
state lawmakers, abruptly shifting course after it was disclosed
that lobbyists for Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette
maker, had spent tens of thousands of dollars in recent years on
gifts for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The majorities in both the state Senate and the Assembly had
been quietly planning to push through a renewal of the current law
governing lobbying, which expires at the end of the year. The law
was first approved in the 1970s, when lobbying expenditures were
far smaller than they are now, and some advocacy groups contend
that it is so feeble that lobbying is hardly regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the leaders put off a renewal this week, the last of
the regular legislative session, and are to consider the law's
future in the fall, when the Legislature is to return for a few
days to tackle unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   What shape reform might take was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who first announced that he backed changes in the
lobbying law last week, reiterated his stance Wednesday. ``We
should have a tougher law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has rebuffed calls for an overhaul for years and
could still simply renew the current law. But it appeared that some
lawmakers were concerned about the publicity surrounding the Philip
Morris gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that Philip Morris had
spent tens of thousands of dollars on gifts for lawmakers in recent
years as part of its largely successful effort to derail
antismoking legislation in Albany. At least 115 current and former
members in the 211-member Legislature accepted the gifts, which
ranged from expensive meals to choice tickets at sporting and
cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that in numerous instances, the company should have
reported the gifts on its lobbying disclosure statements, but did
not. The gifts also raised questions about whether some lawmakers
had violated ethics rules, which bar them from accepting gifts
worth more than $75 if they are intended as a reward or to
influence decisions.

   In the ``Lethal Weapon'' movies, Rene Russo played a tough cop
who knew karate and was a match in macho and battle scars with Mel
Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   For ``In the Line of Fire,'' she was a Secret Service agent who

</P>
<P>
   Opposite John Travolta's hood-turned-moviemaker in ``Get

in B movies.
</P>
<P>
   When you need an actress to play cute or helpless, there are
plenty from which to choose. If you want someone who can be
convincing as a strong, mature woman with an edge, call on Russo.
</P>
<P>
   Producer-star Pierce Brosnan and director John McTiernan (``Die
Hard'') did just that to re-create Faye Dunaway's classic tough
investigator role in their remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a certain strength to me,'' Russo said. ``I
didn't have a father growing up, and I was raised with all women,
and I didn't really understand men. I thought they were like women,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``What a disaster that could be going into a relationship,'' she
added.

   Russo has quite a background. Born in Burbank, Calif. _ she went
to high school with Ron Howard, who later directed her in
``Ransom'' _ she was 2 when her father left the struggling family.
From ages 10 to 14, Russo lived in a body cast to correct
scoliosis.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the tall, gawky girl the kids made fun of had
changed. She became a top Ford Agency model and was frequently on
the cover of such magazines as Vogue and Cosmopolitan.

<P>
   Her relatively long modeling career ended when she was 31, and
she found herself posing for maternity catalogs _ not a bad job,
but a letdown from the sort of modeling stardom she had enjoyed
before.
</P>
<P>
   So Russo made a late career change, becoming a film actress at
the ripe old age of 35 in 1989's ``Major League.'' She met her
husband, screenwriter Dan Gilroy, on the 1992 film ``Freejack.''
They have a daughter, Rose, age 5.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' remake, opening this weekend
nationwide, Brosnan has the Steve McQueen role of a rich, bored
financial wiz who plans a big heist just to have something to do
besides making millions and playing high-stakes golf.
</P>
<P>
   He swipes a Claude Monet painting from a New York museum. Police
are stumped, but an insurance investigator (Russo) shows up, and
she's on to him in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Thief and investigator play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse
(sometimes she's the cat, sometimes he is). Romance _ real or
faked? _ becomes a major weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russo's character, Catherine Banning, has a different
name from the one Dunaway played in the original, she's still
smart, beautiful, tougher than nails, and a risk-taker. Once again,
Russo is required to portray a self-reliant woman in an action
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' she said with a giggle that quickly turned into a
long, full-throated laugh. ``I'd much rather play sort of a dingy
comedy, to tell you the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved `Tin Cup' (in which she co-starred with Kevin Costner)
because even though that character had her own career and was
strong, she was pretty confused. I think she was my favorite
character because she was well-rounded. She didn't have it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Banning, on the other hand, seems to have everything together.
But she's not without an Achilles' heel. Or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was interesting for me is that she was a tough woman on
the outside and had this real edge and got what she wanted in any
way she could. The one area she really wanted, she was hiding. That
was to have someone love her and to open herself up in a vulnerable
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine's in it for the game and money, and that's her life,
as opposed to children and relationships,'' Russo said. ``She
probably did that to escape the things that were really scary to
her. It's easier for Catherine Banning to play a dangerous game
than to open up her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's cool, that she's not perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Banning is not the only one who puts herself in a vulnerable
position in the movie. The original film was sexy for its time,
famous for a long, passionate kiss, and this film tries to match it
in modern terms. That meant nude scenes for Russo for the first
time in her film career.
</P>
<P>
   But she looks perfectly comfortable on screen without clothes
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't,'' she said, self-mockery in her voice. ``In fact, in
one scene on the beach, I remember thinking, `I cannot act, because
I'm too busy feeling naked.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like love scenes, I really don't. They're really
nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm really not very much like Catherine
Banning. This is a woman who leads with her sexuality and
sensuality. If I lead with anything, it's humor _ probably to cover
up when I'm feeling insecure or shy.''
</P>
<P>
   The former model gave a lot of thought to whether she would take
this role. But if she was going to do it, she decided, she was not
going to second-guess herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big challenge for me to be this woman, trying to dig
into a space where I wasn't afraid. I wasn't going to cover it up
with humor or a cute remark or turn shy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Russo, Brosnan usually matched her nude scenes
with his own. That helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely did,'' she said. ``And it was a closed (private)
set, and the lighting was low, and it was nicely lit. It was done
in good taste. I didn't feel really awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierce is so wonderful. He came in with a bottle of champagne.
We were kind of nervous, but it worked out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Husband Gilroy was also supportive of her role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny grew up in an entertainment family, so he's been around,
and it doesn't really bother him,'' she said of her love scenes.
``He knows it's part of the business. He'll make fun of it, but I
don't think he's concerned about it. He knows how hard it is for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, it's not that sexy. You're in these
uncomfortable positions half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from playing strong characters, Russo's religion and age
has also set her off from the Hollywood norm.
</P>
<P>
   She calls herself a born-again Christian _ she's been noted for
often carrying and reading a Bible _ but she is quick to define her
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Christian for years and years now, and what that
means to me is I have a relationship with God and faith. But I
separate myself from the judgmental Christians who feel their way
is the only way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God for C.S. Lewis, because when I was getting into
Christianity, I read a lot of his books and it helped me to
understand God is a loving God, not a judgmental God. C.S. Lewis
said what kept him away from Christianity for so many years was
Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   At 45, just a year younger than Brosnan, Russo has defied
Hollywood's apparent taboo against casting mature actresses in
sexy, romantic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give the credit to (director) John McTiernan on this one,''
she said. ``He really fought for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She has no objection to films with men much older than their
romantic co-stars _ as long as the tables are sometimes turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why I couldn't play with someone in his 30s,'' she
said. ``My husband is six years younger than I am. I just wish
Hollywood wasn't so conventional.''

ABDUL WAHAB AL-BAYATI, 73; IRAQI POET AND INNOVATOR IN HIS ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: In 3rd graf, `15 centuries' is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Abdul Wahab al-Bayati, an Iraqi poet who was a major innovator
in his art form, died on Tuesday in Damascus, Syria. He was 73 and
had lived in Damascus since leaving Amman, Jordan, earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, reported The Associated Press,
which said that he was hospitalized after an asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al-Bayati led Arabic poetry beyond the constraints of
classical Arabic poetical forms, transcending the traditional rhyme
schemes and conventional metric patterns that had prevailed for
more than 15 centuries,'' said Bassam K. Frangieh, a professor of
Arabic language and literature at Yale University, in a preface to
his poetry, which differed from classical Arabic poetry in content
as well as form and reflected a wide range of interests.
</P>
<P>
   Translations of poems by Bayati _ as well as the Arabic
originals _ ``Love, Death &AMP; Exile: Poems Translated From Arabic''
(1991, Georgetown University Press) brought praise for Bayati and
for Frangieh, the translator.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Solomon I. Sara, professor of Linguistics at
Georgetown, said the book ``recreates the passion and the
revolutionary fervor of the poet.'' The title reflects perennial
elements in Bayati's poetry.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of his life outside his homeland and was living in
Amman when he said in a 1992 interview that he thought many Arab
artists had lost touch with their own societies, crippled by
censorship and repression and seduced by desire for a comfortable
way of life. But at that time he refused to write polemics on
social or political problems. Instead he focused on spiritual
malaise. ``From beneath the ruins,'' he wrote in one poem, ``the
people view the destroyers.''
</P>
<P>
   His birthplace was the sprawling Iraqi capital, Baghdad, which
he wrote about in his poem ``Elegy to the Unborn City.'' He earned
a degree in 1950 in Arabic language and literature from the
Teachers Training College. That year his first collection of
poetry, ``Angels and Devils,'' was published, in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   He became a teacher, but his leftist views soon cost him his
job. He criticized the Iraqi monarchy as contributing editor for a
new Iraqi magazine, New Culture. The magazine was shut down, and he
was imprisoned for a time.
</P>
<P>
   A second collection of poems, ``Broken Pitchers,'' was published
in 1954 to applause. But it was truly revolutionary, and he had to
take flight in 1955. He lived in Syria and then in the Soviet Union
and Egypt. In 1958, Iraq was proclaimed a republic after an army
coup d'etat. King Faisal and the crown prince were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bayati returned to Iraq, but disagreements with the government
ensued and he fled again. A decade later, after another coup, he
returned, but went into self-exile again after the government
started a harsh campaign against the left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, shortly after Saddam Hussein became Iraq's president,
he tried to placate Bayati by appointing him to an Iraqi diplomatic
post in Madrid. But Bayati was appalled by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Iraqi government canceled his citizenship after he
traveled to the conservative Saudi Arabia to take part in a
cultural festival.
</P>
<P>
   Bayati is survived by his wife, Hind Al-Bayati, of Bakersfield,
Calif.; two sons, Ali and Saad, who live in Iraq; a daughter, Asma,
of Syria, and 13 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 , he said that his many years of absence from his
homeland had been a ``tormenting experience'' that had great impact
on his poetry. He added, ``I always dream at night that I am in
Iraq and hear its heart beating and smell its fragrance carried by
the wind, especially after midnight when it's quiet.''

`FORTUNATE' MAXWELL TAKES TIME TO GROW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Maxwell is cq) 
(Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maxwell thinks he knows what's wrong with contemporary rhythm
and blues: The artists aren't given time to develop properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Ray Charles had. He had his development moment.
Marvin (Gaye) had his moment to be developed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't have that kind of patience now. The energy of
music now is like, `I need it to be a hit ... now.' It's not about
cultivating music that will change lives, affect the times and make
people feel a lot better about living. It's about getting people by
with whatever is going to make them feel good for that instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell says he's approached each of his albums from the
standpoint of artistic development. But he's also been ... aware of
the need to come up with a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of times with my records, people tend to
jump to conclusions about what they really are, when what they
really need are moments; they need your life and your time and your
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His two albums, 1996's ``Urban Hang Suite'' and last year's
``Embrya,'' have sold more than 1 million copies each, establishing
Maxwell as one of the leading voices of the retro-soul movement.
He's also released an ``MTV Unplugged'' EP.
</P>
<P>
   But his biggest hit, ``Fortunate,'' is not on any of his albums.
Written by R. Kelly for the soundtrack to the movie ``Life,'' the
song debuted at No. 1 on the R&AMP;B singles chart and remained there
for eight weeks. It's still at No. 2 more than five months after
its release, and the CD/cassette single has been certified gold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Fortunate'' is the main reason Maxwell's Friday and Sunday
concerts at the Aerial Theater at Bayou Place in downtown Houston _
the opening dates on his summer tour _ are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy that after it was all done, mixed and R. Kelly
finally heard it, he felt my perspective on the song,'' Maxwell
said. ``It was very big of him to show me that respect, and I will
never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell _ he goes by his middle name professionally _ was born
in Brooklyn 25 years ago. Both his parents had arrived in New York
from the Caribbean. His father, who died in a plane crash when
Maxwell was 3, was Puerto Rican; his mother is from Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up surrounded by Caribbean salsa and calypso, and his
mother also loved such American country singers as Johnny Cash and
Dolly Parton. But Maxwell's first love was the hip-hop he
encountered on the streets of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in New York,'' he said, ``even though I went back
and forth to Puerto Rico to see family when I was little. I was
just crazy about what was happening when I was growing up. I wasn't
really a fan of my mother's music. It just seemed really
super-island. It was like, `Oh, it's Sunday, so everybody's got to
break out their heritage.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's since gained a greater appreciation for his Caribbean
roots. He and salsa star Marc Anthony plan to record a duet as soon
as their schedules permit. But Maxwell doesn't envision authentic
Puerto Rican music entering mainstream American culture, despite
the current success of Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my observation, that's more about Latin artists finding
their way in pop music rather than a `Latin craze,''' he said. ``It
just sounds like rock 'n' roll to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's first instrument was a harmonica given to him by his
grandmother. In high school, he obtained a cheap Casio keyboard and
soon was spending his days locked in his room, figuring out how to
create little symphonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban Hang Suite'' is a concept album about a weekend romantic
encounter that leads to a marriage proposal. ``Embrya'' _ a word he
made up to represent a female embryo _ mixes spiritual and
science-fiction overtones with the ideal of romantic renewal. (One
reviewer dubbed it a ``combination of Marvin Gaye's `Let's Get It
On' and Stevie Wonder's `Journey Through the Secret Life of
Plants.''')
</P>
<P>
   Lyrical pretensions aside, both albums play like mood-music
suites custom-designed for late-night love-making. Maxwell's
longish hair, disarming smile and chiseled physique certainly
haven't hurt his image as a sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sexual person,'' said Maxwell, who is single but admits
to being involved in a romantic relationship. ``I think we all are,
and I definitely am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my music focuses in on that. But at the end of the
day, I want my music to come off being therapeutic, helping people
through their experiences. The rest is all just lure. I mean, I'm a
pretty regular person. It's not like I'm walking around in satin
underwear all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said he's moving away from the mood-suite concept. He's
currently working on three new songs for the upcoming movie ``The
Best Man.'' The soundtrack also will include new songs by the
artist formerly known as Prince and Lauryn Hill, singing with a
tape of the late Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   ```Urban Hang Suite' had a sort of viable commercialness that
people can get into. I know `Embrya' doesn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me, it's always about being different every time out.
It's not about always being on the radio. It's about allowing me to
focus on what I'm trying to become, eventually. I think every
record is part of that process. It's not finished, ever.''

WHEN YOU GO: SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA &HT;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Getting there: Prepare for a long flight. On a recent trip, we
broke the journey by overnighting near Los Angeles International
Airport prior to a 1 p.m. Qantas departure that required almost 15
hours nonstop from LA to Sydney. (Return time is usually about an
hour quicker because of favorable winds.)
</P>
<P>
   Qantas' service was excellent, with meal recipes created by
acclaimed Australian chef Neil Perry of Rockpool in Sydney. The
airline also markets a ``Boomerang Pass'' that allows international
travelers to book domestic flights within Australia at sharply
discounted prices; this pass must be purchased before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   A boon to many Houston-area travelers is that Qantas is
associated with Continental's OnePass program, and the
trans-Pacific round trip alone merits 14,974 frequent-flyer program
miles (with bonuses for passengers in first and business classes).
Consult a travel agent or call 800-227-4500. Access www.qantas.com
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Air New Zealand (800-262-1234) and United (800-241-6522) also
offer nonstops from the U.S. West Coast to Sydney and can provide
discounts for intra-Australia flights on Ansett Australia airline.
</P>
<P>
   Package tours: First-time travelers to Australia are encouraged
to use a tour packager _ either directly or through a travel agent
_ familiar with lodgings and attractions on the continent. Winging
it, while appealing to independent travelers, can be time-consuming
and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies offer a range of packages that focus solely on
Sydney or extend throughout Australia and/or New Zealand and
elsewhere in the South Pacific. Many include discounted air fares.
Customized packages also can be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   We used Austravel, which has an office in Houston. All hotels,
tours, rental cars and other services were delivered as promised.

</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can advise about other options. Or contact the
Australian Tourist Commission by calling 800-369-6863.
</P>
<P>
   When to go: Australia's seasons are reversed from those in the
United States: Our summer is winter Down Under. Our fall (their
spring) and spring (their fall) are ideal for travelers who
appreciate decent weather but like to avoid crowds. Sydney is a
year-round destination _ seldom too hot or too cold, with rain
possible any time but most prevalent from March through July. If
your plans also include the Great Barrier Reef or the Outback, keep
in mind that temperatures can sizzle there during our winter.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation: A valid U.S. passport and an Australian visa are
required. But unlike in some countries, a visa costs nothing and is
easy to acquire: Your travel agent can handle details, and an
electronic visa is processed. No paperwork is required. The visa is
valid for up to three months in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging: Dozens of high-quality hotels _ including chains
familiar to Americans _ are scattered about Sydney, and others are
under construction in preparation for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Our base was the Sebel of Sydney (known to locals as Sebel
Townhouse), a 200-room ``boutique'' hotel within walking distance
of Potts Point restaurants and Kings Cross nightlife and convenient
to bus lines. Because of its intimacy and high service level (but
lacking the views of hotels situated nearer the water), the Sebel
is favored by celebrities; you may well recognize a familiar face
in the hotel's small lobby bar. Room size varies, but prices are
surprisingly inexpensive ($124 U.S. per night for a double room
through Austravel). The lobby-floor Encore Restaurant is highly
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Top choices in the Rocks District include the Park Hyatt
(ideally situated with every room facing the harbor), the Regent
Sydney and the Observatory, all upscale in service and price.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can provide brochures and advise about other
lodgings that satisfy most budgets. (Don't be confused when a
neighborhood pub is identified as a hotel. To satisfy
liquor-licensing laws, minimal rooms are often available.)
</P>
<P>
   Currency: The Australian dollar has been trading at about $1.55
to $1 U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Sydney time is 15 hours ahead of Houston. If it's 9 a.m.
Sunday in Sydney, it's 6 p.m. Saturday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing: Casual attire is favored almost everywhere in Sydney
and throughout Australia. Only the most elegant restaurants require
jackets for men (though nightclubs frown on jeans). Shorts are
common on ferries and throughout the Rocks and Darling Harbor
districts. Topless bathing is accepted at most beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping: Some guidebooks offer confusing information. We found
that gratuities of 10 percent (or less) were expected only in
upscale restaurants when service was exceptional. Elsewhere, most
diners left only small change. Taxi drivers do not expect a tip,
but are appreciative if you round off fares to the next highest
dollar figure. Hotel bellmen expect small monetary gestures. But
overall, tipping is not the custom in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Accessibility: With some exceptions, Australia is not as
advanced as the United States in accommodating travelers with
disabilities. It's best to inquire in advance about wheelchair
access at restaurants and attractions.
</P>
<P>

MURRAY DEMANDS INVESTIGATION OF PIPELINE SAFETY AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying the more she learns about pipeline safety,
the more unhappy she gets, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is demanding
a federal investigation of the agency that is supposed to protect
the public from gas and oil leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has asked the Department of Transportation's Inspector
General, who is an independent auditor within the agency, to launch
an investigation of the Office of Pipeline Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Her action is the latest illustration of growing congressional
concern in the wake of a deadly explosion in Bellingham, Wash., on
June 10, in which two 10-year-old boys and a teenage fisherman
where killed after liquid gasoline leaked into a creek and caught
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has asked for an investigation by
the General Accounting Office, which is the investigatory arm of
Congress, while Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., has promised to hold a
congressional hearing to investigate what went wrong in Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot more questions than answers,'' Murray said in an
interview Wednesday. ``At this point, I have not been happy with
the responses I've received.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to the Inspector General, Murray said she wants an
investigation of the effectiveness of pipeline inspections and
accident-prevention activities by the Office of Pipeline Safety.

<P>
   She asked that the investigation include a review of the
agency's oversight of industry operations, efforts to develop tools
to detect pipeline defects, efforts to address the problem of aging
pipelines, and oversight of training and testing for pipeline
workers.
</P>
<P>
   She also asked for an assessment of the agency's failure to
comply with a 1992 law requiring special safety requirements for
pipelines in densely populated and environmentally sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   The agency says it hopes to test a partial response to that
requirement later this year, five years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our towns and cities are ill-equipped to deal with the
potential threats of underground pipelines, as was demonstrated in
the Olympic gasoline pipeline tragedy in Bellingham,'' Murray
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Murray released a copy of her letter late in the day, and
officials from the Office of Pipeline Safety and the Inspector
General's office could not be reached for comment.

G'DAY Y'ALL: SYDNEY MELDS FAMILIAR SPIRIT, FOREIGN APPEAL 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Almost 9,000 miles from home, the menu at
the posh Darley Street Thai proves more than a tad intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I suggest a soup of duck liver and winter melon and the
lacquered pigeon and oyster salad?'' the immaculately groomed
waiter launches into a well-rehearsed spiel.
</P>
<P>
   A pause. Then, a diner's hesitant question. ``I don't suppose
you serve spring rolls?''
</P>
<P>
   A gasp. But one of recognition, not reproach, ``Hey, you sound
just like my Uncle Leroy,'' the waiter exclaims, abandoning all
pretense of formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``And where does your Uncle Leroy live?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lufkin, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes throughout a first-time exploration of the Land
of Oz, where at times you must pinch yourself as a reminder that
you are in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which credit cards do you accept?'' you ask the cashier at a
wine shop in the lush Hunter Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them. Which card gives you the most frequent-flyer
miles?'' the cashier replies.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine hearing those words in London or Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Texans won't discover the familiar Outback Steak House
as they meander about the continent. In Geelong, gateway to the
Great Ocean Road, we must settle instead for the Lone Star Steak
House &AMP; Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in a sense, Australia is just like home. Folks even speak
English, albeit an unrecognizable variation at times.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait! G'day, what's this?
</P>
<P>
   A kangaroo hopping across a golf-course fairway. A rainbow
lorikeet perched in a treetop. A baby koala clinging to Mama's
back. A crocodile slithering along a sand dune.
</P>
<P>
   A vast system of living organisms _ the spectacular Great
Barrier Reef _ beneath the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Australian-rules football.
</P>
<P>
   And the riveting Sydney Opera House, acclaimed by Time magazine
as one of this century's five outstanding architectural
accomplishments and even more beautiful than in all those magazine
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Sydney. In almost every survey, international travelers rank
this cosmopolitan city as their favorite vacation destination. With
the 2000 Summer Olympics on the horizon, its popularity almost
certainly will escalate.
</P>
<P>
   So let's settle into a chair beside an open-air table at Doyle's
at the Quay, a waterfront landmark situated almost in the shadow of
the Opera House. Order a Balmain bug salad _ say what? _ and soak
in the fresh sea air, somehow therapeutic even in the heart of a
huge metropolis. And allow yourself to become mesmerized by green
and yellow ferries, one after another, filtering through the harbor
and representing one of the world's most romantic _ and yet
practical _ means of urban transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the fringe of Sydney's historical Rocks District, begin
to understand why _ Balmain bugs and pigeon salad and driving on
the wrong side of the road notwithstanding _ we and the Aussies
have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   First, an orientation.
</P>
<P>
   As an entity, Australia _ essentially an independent nation with
the Queen of England as titular head _ is almost the same size as
the United States' ``lower 48.'' Yet its total population is only
18 million, and more than 20 percent (4 million) live in Sydney,
with another 3 million in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Escape to the center of the continent, to the rugged Outback,
and you may go hours without encountering another human. But the
pulse beats rapidly in Sydney, on Australia's southeast coast in
the state of New South Wales. As the main arrival and departure
point for international flights and cruise ships, it's the first
stop for almost all vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   To best become acclimated, make four immediate decisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget about driving a car. Even if maneuvering on the left
quickly becomes routine, Sydney is lacking in parking facilities
and, at the moment, its streets represent one mass construction
project in preparation for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest in a Sydney Pass, the best bargain in town. For about
$55 U.S. (with discounts for children and families), this pass
allows unlimited travel on all regular buses, ferries and central
rail services for any three days within a five-day period. It also
covers three separate ``explorer'' bus services, Sydney Harbor
scenic cruises and a return bus trip to the airport. It's available
for longer durations, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hop aboard the Sydney Explorer. These red vehicles blanket the
city, stopping at 24 attractions. Get off anywhere, stay as long as
you wish or board the next bus 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make one complete Explorer tour, formulating priorities but
resisting the urge to pause at the Australian Museum or Royal
Botanic Gardens or Sydney Aquarium _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Debark instead at the Rocks. Chances are, you're exhausted
following a 15-hour flight from Los Angeles or San Francisco, and
there is no better place to gain new inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this is where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Australia is even younger than the United States
in terms of European settlement, largely ignored until after the
American Revolution when Britain _ no longer able to prey on North
America and with overcrowded jails _ needed an outpost to ship
convicts.
</P>
<P>
   The first fleet of 11 ships arrived in Sydney in 1788, bringing
700 prisoners _ primarily petty thieves, including women and
children caught pickpocketing _ and officers who together
represented Australia's first colonists.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, Sydney was considered a fate worse than
death,'' says Bob Charlesworth, who conducts tours here. ``The
whole area was nothing but sandstone. Starvation was rampant. The
British officers were corrupt. The main currency was rum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until the 1850s, after almost 170,000 convicts were
dispatched to Australia, did the practice cease. By then, Sydney's
long-established Aboriginal culture had disappeared, the natives
either succumbing to illness or retreating into the countryside.
And the colonists, much like early American pilgrims, had
persevered over initial adversity, building a community from the
rocks and learning to cultivate crops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the 20th century began, this remained a cesspool of
rundown warehouses, brothels and bars, soon rendered even more
unlivable when bubonic plague struck the area. Several times city
officials considered razing the district, then as recently as the
1960s preservationists offered a convincing argument that the aging
buildings could be given new purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Wander the streets and alleyways of the Rocks today, and you
discover a remarkable blend of the old and new.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is the Sidney Visitor Center, in the Old
Sailors Home at 106 George St. Guided tours form here, or the staff
can provide directions.
</P>
<P>
   Three pubs _ the Lord Nelson, continually licensed since 1841;
the Hero of Waterloo; and the Fortune of War _ lay claim to being
the city's oldest watering holes, and each offers a distinct
personality. Some buildings, constructed with slate and wrought
iron in traditional English styling of the era, have stood for
almost 200 years. And here, as in the United States, there is no
shame in designating an early 19th-century edifice ``historical.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rocks is also home to several of Sydney's newest _ and
fanciest _ hotels; more than 70 restaurants, including many of the
city's toniest; and a bustling outdoor marketplace on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   From here, walk onto _ and across _ the majestic Sydney Harbor
Bridge, a significant work project completed in the early 1930s
when Australia shared our financial distress during the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Or venture far above vehicular level and partake in a new
``Bridge Climb,'' a 4,921-foot ascent to the structure's upper arch
_ a challenge preceded by mandatory breath tests and one
successfully undertaken recently by Australian actress Nicole
Kidman, presumably with eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Savored one too many Aussie beers to qualify? The Rocks is only
steps away from Circular Quay, pronounced ``kee'' and rectangular
in shape, not circular, with the Opera House and the Rocks on
opposite ``arms'' between the ferry terminal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time to take to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's bus and inner-city rail services compare with those in
most large cities. But many residents rely on a system of passenger
ferries for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is practicality: Suburbs are located on either side
of the harbor. Bridges provide road connections, but traveling by
boat is usually faster.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, natives here cherish an almost magnetic relationship
with the sea. They flock to Bondi Beach _ or any of the area's 70
sun-splashed beaches _ to swim and surf. They sail in Rushcutter's
Bay. Their main icons, the Opera House and Harbor Bridge, hug the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Any visitor should allow time for at least one ferry ride, and
options are abundant with eight routes serving 36 wharves.
Especially recommended are inexpensive excursions from Circular
Quay to Manly, a resort community on the ocean (30 minutes by
ferry), and to the Taronga Zoo (15 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Each offers a bonus: a close-up view of the billowing white
``sails'' of the Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   You could easily spend an entire day in Manly. Indeed, many
tourists make this narrow, fashionable strip _ ``Seven miles from
Sydney and a thousand miles from care,'' locals say _ their
overnight base, choosing to day-trip into the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving from the harbor, a likely first impression is, ``What's
the big deal?'' But once on land, proceed along a wide promenade
known as the Corso, and 10 minutes later _ longer if you detour for
coffee and pastries at a sidewalk cafe or to inspect kangaroo key
chains at a souvenir shop _ you are gazing upon one of the area's
loveliest beaches and the pounding surf of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   People-watching doesn't get much better than this either:
Hikers, bikers and inline skaters parade along a boardwalk that
fronts the beach for about a mile. Families savor extended picnic
lunches. Romantics cuddle beneath shade trees.
</P>
<P>
   The daring dive with sharks at Oceanworld. The energetic stroll
through bushland along the Manly Scenic Walkway. An extended hike _
or bus ride _ leads to North Head, a bluff overlooking the harbor
entrance. On a clear day, views are magnificent, and a fortunate
few may glimpse a resident colony of fairy penguins or a colony of
long-nosed bandicoots.
</P>
<P>
   Taronga Zoo is a must-stop for anyone eager to see Australian
wildlife. Don't be misled by promotions that lead you to imagine
kangaroos and koalas eagerly awaiting your inspection directly
outside a hotel door: Truth is (or fair dinkum, in Aussie English),
koalas are almost impossible to see in their native habitat. And
although Australia's kangaroo population is twice that of humans,
many a tourist has never witnessed one outside a zoo or preserve.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see plenty of kangaroos at Taronga Zoo. And a large
exhibit area is dedicated to koalas that feed on fresh eucalyptus
leaves as zookeepers present informative talks each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Other native species here include wallabies, wombats, echidnas,
platypus and dingoes, and entire sections are reserved for native
birds _ among them multicolored parrots and cockatoos, the regal
Australian pelican, the long-necked emu and the ``laughing
kookaburra'' we sang about in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   But what distinguishes Taronga Zoo isn't its collection of 2,000
animals from around the world but a dramatic setting on a hillside
overlooking the harbor and Opera House on the opposite bank. (Tip:
Take a short bus ride or the zoo's gondola up from the ferry stop
to a hilltop entrance, then climb down.)
</P>
<P>
   Back in the city, take a guided tour of the Opera House _ home
to 1,200 musical performances and other events each year _ and
discover a maze of 1,000 rooms, including a 2,679-seat concert
hall, a 1,547-seat theater for opera and ballet, a 544-seat drama
theater, a 398-seat playhouse and the elegant Bennelong restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated by Queen Elizabeth in 1973, its construction required
16 years, an odyssey that increased the cost from an anticipated $7
million Australian to $104 million and resulted in designer Jorn
Utzon's resignation midproject. The butt of jokes as its 10 roofs
took _ or didn't take _ shape, the Opera House is now a beloved
symbol for Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Many other neighborhoods beckon: lively Darling Harbor, teeming
with museums and shops and connected to the city center by a
glittering new monorail; restaurant-rich Potts Point; bawdy Kings
Cross; handsome Paddington.
</P>
<P>
   Then, perhaps an after-dinner stroll in the Rocks.
</P>
<P>
   About dinner.
</P>
<P>
   You've been wondering about those bugs, haven't you? They're
actually delectable snub-nosed Australian crustaceans available at
many good seafood restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, it's hard to find bad seafood in Sydney, although any
request for Crocodile Dundee's ``shrimp on the barbie'' may elicit
this response: ``We call them prawns here.''
</P>
<P>
   Appreciate innovative cuisine? Temptations at acclaimed chef
Neil Perry's upscale Rockpool in the Rocks include John Dory in
Indian pastry. Morsels of ocean trout dipped in coconut cream is a
favorite at much-honored Tetsuya's in the suburb of Rozelle. At the
Bathers Pavilion, where magical views overlook Balmoral Beach, tuna
tartare is topped with shallot shreds and black olive paste.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's, with locations at Circular Quay and Watson's Bay, is
more informal. But generations of families have been addicted to
its sweet rock oysters and beer-batter fried fish fillets.
</P>
<P>
   As in other great cities, dining is an integral part of Sydney's
culture. Years back, Australia was chastised for rigid immigration
policies, but Sydney is now home to people of 140 ethnic
backgrounds, and this diversity shows in its cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Darley Street Thai _ located on Bayswater Road, not Darley, in
the Potts Point neighborhood _ reflects a rich Asian influence on
the population and mores. Owner-chef David Thompson's freshwater
salmon dumplings with coconut cream and basil are renowned, and the
pigeon and oyster salad is ... let's just say an experience.
</P>
<P>
   For those with less adventuresome palates (or tighter budgets),
Thompson has opened Sailor's Thai in the Rocks, where one option is
a heaping bowl of noodle soup served at a communal table just
inside the front door.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't necessary to spend big to enjoy a meal in Sydney _ and
have fun doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Join hordes of locals, for instance, at the Pig and Olive on
Macleay Street, also in Potts Point. You could feast on simple
pepperoni here. But why not roll the dice _ or the Tums and Rolaids
_ on a pizza of marinated octopus, goat cheese and tomatoes. Too
ambitious? Maybe try a roasted pumpkin pizza with spinach, feta and
garlic. A small version of each costs less than $10 U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even less expensive is Harry's Cafe de Wheels, a Sydney
institution now situated on Cowper Road in the (say it fast)
Woolloomooloo district a short bus ride from almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the legendary Harry began as a pushcart vendor more than
half-a-century ago, wheeling about town selling mystery-meat ``pies
'n peas'' at bargain-basement prices. Now, the cafe is fixed to the
pavement, but devotees _ construction workers in hard hats,
business executives in dark suits _ line up from 7 a.m. into the
wee hours of the morning to sample treats from what is described as
``the same menu since 1945.''
</P>
<P>
   Meat pies 'n peas cost $2.50 Australian (about $1.60 U.S.). Add
10 cents for gravy. Chicken and mushroom pies are an even better
deal at about $1.40 U.S. Still got those Tums? Curry pie with chili
sauce is another 20 cents cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easy enough to find a, gulp, kangaroo steak or
crocodile burger in Sydney; Reds, on Argyle Street in the Rocks, is
recommended (and serves beef and seafood, too, in case you stumble
over that 'roo order).
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly in every neighborhood, too ... well, let tour guide
Charlesworth explain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Australians love Americans, in part because we've got so much
in common, but the U.S. is responsible for our newest crisis. We've
survived starvation and the plague, but now we're faced with the
invasion of the golden arches. We've got more McDonald's per capita
than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Leroy would feel right at home.

SUSPECT'S DEATH ENDS CASE, BUT NOT QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAWNA A. HAMEL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Brouse was looking for some quick cash and an easy
target.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Schroeder just wanted to vacuum her car.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths intersected July 10, police say, at the Dr. Spotless
Car Wash in Liberty, Mo., just north of Kansas City. The next day,
relatives found the 18-year-old woman's body in a pond south of
town.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours between that chance meeting and the time her body
was spotted, something compelled Brouse to fire the single gunshot
that ended Schroeder's life. The details, though, were lost Tuesday
when Brouse, 25, died in a burst of gunfire as police in Texas
closed in on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know why he decided to kill her, except that
she would be able to identify him, and that's speculation on our
part,'' said Clay County, Mo., Sheriff's Lt. Steve Wright. ``
`Why?' is a question we would have liked to ask him, but no one
will have that chance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that, beginning 90 minutes after Brouse
approached her at the car wash, Schroeder withdrew a total of $200
from four automated bank tellers. When her body was found, that
money was gone, along with her ATM card. But she was still wearing
jewelry and had a small amount of cash that police believe she had
from earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what has been told to us, Brouse went to the car wash
looking for someone to rob and no other reason,'' Wright said.
``Simply, Christy pulled into the wrong place at the wrong time.
She was driving a nice, expensive car and she was alone. She looked
like an ideal target.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Brouse may have wanted to rob someone was clear,
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been unemployed for several months,'' Wright said. ``He
needed money, and it doesn't appear to any of us that he had any
visible means of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Two key pieces of evidence pointed toward Brouse as the suspect,
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape police recovered from the car wash showed Brouse
driving up to the business on a motorcycle and approaching
Schroeder's car. Videotape recovered from the banks Schroeder
stopped at revealed that she was not in the car alone, Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, police say, Brouse had told at least one person that he
committed the murder after robbing Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing was being done on evidence recovered from the scene
and from the autopsy. Ballistics testing will be done on the gun
police recovered from Brouse in Texas, Wright said, to determine
whether it was the weapon used to kill Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Brouse was spotted shortly before 4 p.m. Tuesday in a shopping
mall parking lot in Plano, Texas, and local authorities confronted
him. Police in Plano say that he raised a handgun at officers and
that two of them fired their weapons. Brouse died of several
gunshot wounds, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before they learned that Brouse had been killed,
prosecutors were preparing to file an array of charges against him,
including murder, kidnapping, robbery, and three counts of armed
criminal action, said spokesman Jim Roberts of the Clay County
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they know little about Brouse's background. He had
spent four years in the military after high school, both of his
parents were deceased, and he had no siblings, Wright said. But
investigators were unsure whether he grew up in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   A felony arrest warrant for Brouse had been issued July 21 in
connection with the burglary of a Liberty business. Authorities
confirmed Wednesday that Brouse also was a possible suspect in
robberies in Cameron and Parkville, two nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   With Brouse's death, local law enforcement agencies say that,
save for a few loose ends, the case is closed as a police matter.
But for Christy Schroeder's family, it will remain an open mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unanswered questions that'll stay with us,
and so many questions we'll never be able to ask,'' said Lisa
Evans, Schroeder's older sister. ``We're angry and unbelievably sad
that we'll never know these answers, and in some ways we wanted him
to live so he could be as scared as Christy must have been that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In everything we do, we think of Christy,'' Evans said. ``I'll
still be out at the cemetery, sometimes four or even five times a
day, trying to get some sense of peace and understanding of why
this happened. She didn't deserve this.''

By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The historically based perception that the Los
Angeles Clippers are incapable of extracting something from the
jaws of nothing was jolted Wednesday when they acquired Derek
Anderson and Johnny Newman from the Cleveland Cavaliers in a
sign-and-trade deal for free agent Lamond Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helped us tremendously,'' said Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chris Ford shared this perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're able to get guys who can play in this
league,'' Ford said, ``it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing Cleveland improved its initial offer
(big-ticket bust Bob Sura), because Murray was considering a
one-year, $2 million exception offer from the San Antonio Spurs.
Murray reportedly will make $25 million over seven years in
Cleveland. But the Spurs' exception would have required no
sign-and-trade finesse and would have sent Murray, the seventh pick
in the 1994 NBA draft, packing without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after Murray lost his starting job to undrafted
rookie Tyrone Nesby last season, he made it no secret that he
desired to be somewhere else. The Clippers were prepared to simply
wave goodbye and welcome the cap room. Instead, they have added a
shooting guard with great potential in the 25-year-old Anderson,
and a valuable reserve in Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek is a very athletic guy,'' Baylor said of the 6-foot-5
Anderson, who averaged 10.8 points per game in his second pro
season with the Cavs. ``He's an up-tempo player with speed and
quickness. He's a good defender and a very fierce competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Knee injuries have kept the former University of
Kentucky star in street clothes for 28 games over the past two
seasons. He also has just one season ($1.4 million) left on his
initial three-year deal, and one Clipper source said the team
expects Anderson to make an immediate inquiry about a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get to know Derek Anderson better,'' Baylor said
when asked about making Anderson a long-term offer.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, 35, is not exactly a stranger, especially to Ford, who
coached the 13-year NBA veteran in Milwaukee during the 1996-97
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Newman is the consummate pro,'' Ford said of the 6-7
small forward who will be paid $1.1 million in the last year of his
current contract. ``He's a great person to have in your
organization. I definitely feel he can help each and every member
on our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman helped the Cavs last season by providing 6.1 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal removes some of the sting from Tuesday's
collapse of a possible swap involving Clippers free agent Lorenzen
Wright and new Atlanta Hawks shooting guard Jimmy Jackson. The
Clippers were prepared to sign Wright and trade him to the Hawks
for Jackson, who had been acquired along with shooting guard J.R.
Rider from Portland in exchange for Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle was Wright's agent, Robert Fayne, who asked the
Hawks for a staggering $8 million per season. But after Fayne
reportedly was talked back down to this planet, Hawks coach Lenny
Wilkens convinced general manager Pete Babcock he'd feel more
comfortable with Jackson just in case the controversial Rider
whipped up more controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few teams are still calling,'' Baylor said of
continued interest in the 6-11 Wright, who turned down a six-year,
$30 million offer from the Clippers last March. But the players
proposed thus far do not interest the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the Clippers lost point guard Darrick Martin,
who signed a free-agent contract with the Sacramento Kings. Martin,
28, averaged 8.0 points, 3.9 assists and 1.16 steals in 37 games
with the Clippers last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' next moves should include re-signing shooting
guard Eric Piatkowski, coming to terms with free-agent point-guard
prospect Jeff McInnis, matching the best offer Nesby's agent can
come up with, and finding a backup for center Michael Olowokandi.

SINGLE-A LEAGUE TO BEGIN PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ONTARIO, Calif. _ As with its Single-A team, the JetHawks front
office wanted its California League Fall League club's name to
reflect the Antelope Valley's aviation background.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Lancaster franchise announced its name _ the
Stealth _ and coaching staff, along with the other fall league
franchises: the Lake Elsinore Land Sharks, Rancho Cucamonaga
Surfers and San Bernardino Sand Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd McClendon, the hitting coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
was selected as Lancaster's manager. The rest of the staff: Jerry
Cram (Colorado) and Jeff Carter (Minnesota), both minor-league
coaches. Current JetHawks trainer Troy McIntosh was named a
co-trainer for the Stealth.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing Stealth as a name was easy for Lancaster considering
the proximity to Edwards Air Force Base. Four years ago when team
owners Mike and Matt Ellis moved their Cal League team from
Riverside, they considered Stealth before agreeing on JetHawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come up with something that encompassed the area.
There's a rich tradition of aerospace and technology in the
Antelope Valley,'' assistant general manager Kevin Younkin said.
The Stealth's logo and cap design includes a streaking Stealth
bomber with a red, black and silver background. ``We think it's
slick.''
</P>
<P>
   A 42-game schedule featuring Single and Double-A prospects
representing 26 of 30 major-league organizations begins September
23. Oakland, Philadelphia, Kansas City and the Chicago White Sox
are the only teams not participating.
</P>
<P>
   Rosters won't be announced until later this month, but each team
will be able to draw from at least six big-league farm systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Stealth's affiliations include the JetHawks' parent-club
Seattle Mariners, the Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Pittsburgh
Pirates, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Dodgers manager Bill Russell, now serving as a manager for
Tampa Bay's Double-A Orlando team, will manage Rancho Cucamonga.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over a project that struggled in Hawaii and Maryland the
past two years, California Fall League president Joe Gagliardi said
this league can be a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get fans a good picture of future talent for the
major leagues,'' Gagliardi said. &QL;

HORSE LOVERS WERE RESCUING, NOT RUSTLING, DEFENDERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two horse activists were rescuing, not rustling, when they took
four horses from a farm in Ray County, Mo., an equine group says.
</P>
<P>
   Enzo Giobbe', chief executive officer of the International
Generic Horse Association and a co-founder of HorseAid, said a
contract allowed Kansas/Missouri HorseAid chapter coordinator Becky
Burns and volunteer Angela Williams to rescue four horses July 13
from Don and Sally Stokes' farm near Lawson, Mo., a few miles
northeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ray County Prosecutor Stanley Thompson said the contract with
the Stokeses was void, and charged Burns and Williams each with
second-degree burglary and four counts of stealing. The women
appeared in Ray County Court on Wednesday and requested a
preliminary hearing, which was set for Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   HorseAid, a subsidiary of the Generic Horse group, helped save
more than 200 sick, starving hackney ponies from a ranch last year
in nearby Miami County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The Stokes family adopted three of the neglected animals. One
later gave birth. The Stokeses signed an adoption contract with
HorseAid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't check on them, we haven't rescued anything,''
Giobbe' said. ``We've just taken a horse from one place and taken
it to another place, which could be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Generic Horse group is asking visitors to its Web site
(www.igha.org) to donate to the women's legal defense fund and to
urge Missouri officials to take action against Ray County
authorities for arresting and charging Burns and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Giobbe' said the contract with the Stokeses gave HorseAid
ownership of the animals, ``the right of unconditional trespass''
to inspect the animals, and the right to remove them ``without
prior notification, demand or due process'' if HorseAid determined
the ponies were ``in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he doubted that a lawyer drafted that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think anyone can consent to a felony,'' he
said. ``You can't waive your constitutional rights in advance when
you don't even know what someone is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's attorney, Farrell Hockemeir, said Wednesday that his
clients were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Stokes disputed the Generic Horse group's allegations that
she failed to castrate one stallion, moved the ponies without
notice and that a mare had an infected eye.
</P>
<P>
   She said Burns knew that castrating the stallion would take
longer than expected because of medical complications and because
the horse was wild. She also said a veterinarian had treated the
mare's eye infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no abuse or neglect,'' Sally Stokes said. ``It there
were, those deputies never would have returned those ponies to
us.''

KANSAS GOVERNOR VISITS FARMS TO PROMOTE PROGRAM THAT COMBATS WATER
POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYSVILLE, Kan. _ That was, indeed, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves
tramping through a grassy field and across a creek Wednesday, drawn
to a northeast Kansas farm by an unusual government-aid program he
helped start.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new conservation program, the type of deal that can spawn
a political ruckus. But not in this case. This program wins
endorsement from farmers and environmental activists, from
Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, if everything goes well, the Kansas River probably
will be cleaner as it flows through the Kansas City area. Tuttle
Creek Lake and Perry Lake will be cleaner, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep pushing this awfully hard, because we
think this is a way to protect water,'' said Graves, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The $80,000 state program offers financial incentives to farmers
who plant strips of vegetation along streams instead of using the
land for crops. The so-called buffers combat water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Graves emphasized that it was voluntary for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we're better off to create cooperative programs
that they buy into, as opposed to having government regulations
forced upon them,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The buffers _ strips of land planted in grass, and sometimes in
trees _ act as filters. Up to 100 feet, or more, in width, they
prevent sediment, agricultural chemicals and manure from entering
creeks and rivers.
</P>
<P>
   So far 504 acres along about 50 miles of stream banks have been
enrolled. Only parts of six counties are eligible. Farmers are
signing up almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been recommending it a lot,'' said Dan Duever, who farms
with his brother Gary Duever and created a buffer Graves visited
Wednesday. ``The No. 1 reason is to keep herbicides out of
streams.''
</P>
<P>
   The government financial incentives, Duever said, make the
buffers economically possible, particularly in these times when
farmers receive such low prices for their crops.
</P>
<P>
   To promote the program, Graves went to several farms in the
Marysville, Kan., area Wednesday. About 75 persons accompanied him
in two charter buses: everyone from landowners interested in the
program to state politicians and federal agriculture experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffers are really the buzzwords in conservation these days,''
said Tracy Streeter, executive director of the Kansas Conservation
Commission, which administers the program.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering statistics to prove their value will take years. But
research elsewhere shows that buffers do succeed, Streeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of the program is political. Unlike some
anti-pollution efforts, this one doesn't spawn heated controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that normally stand on opposite sides of conservation
issues lined up behind the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for everybody,'' said Charles Benjamin,
legislative coordinator for the Kansas Sierra Club and the Kansas
Natural Resource Council, which backs the buffer initiative.
</P>
<P>
   County extension agent Mike Vogt of Marysville predicted the
program would find increasing support among farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what government is learning, that voluntary programs
are a lot more successful that mandates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A state representative from the Marysville area, Democrat Bruce
Larkin of Baileyville, joined with Republican lawmakers to endorse
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's farm is not eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have jumped on it in a minute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say other states offer similar incentives to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Conservation Department does not offer a program
comparable with the one in Kansas, said Bob Miller, an agriculture
services supervisor for the agency. But the department has been
studying the issue, he said, because streams in the state could
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The program in Kansas piggybacks off the federal government.
Several years ago Congress decided to offer farmers money if they
set aside buffers along streams.
</P>
<P>
   Federal payments, however, were not large enough to offset the
income from crops in rich Kansas soil found along streams.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped Graves and the Kansas Legislature. They enacted a law
in 1998 offering state matching funds and tax incentives for
planting buffers.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a farmer can receive $70 an acre from the
federal government, the state kicks in an additional $21 an acre.
Combined with the promise of lower property taxes, that can make
the whole idea attractive enough for the farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't figure out a way to create these kind of buffers
between chemical applications and our water,'' Graves said, ``I see
some much more punitive measures imposed upon agriculture producers
in the future. I don't think that works well.''

 HAPPY TAIL: INJURED DOG FINDS A GUARDIAN ANGEL-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tux the Italian greyhound, a small dog who found himself in
front of a moving car last month in Kansas City, is a lucky little
pooch.
</P>
<P>
   The dog darted into nighttime traffic as Jon Weis, a Kansas City
man who considered veterinary school before going into investment
banking, happened to be watching. By the time the evening ended,
Weis had shed a little of his own blood to help an animal he had
never seen before _ and committed his finances to the dog's
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's just one of those stories where there's a lot of
nice people in the world but you never hear about them,'' said Bev
Bilotta, Tux's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Tux pushed his way to freedom when Bilotta opened her door about
3:30 p.m. July 18, a day after she bought him. She chased the dog
but lost sight of him within two blocks of her home in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later and five blocks away, Tux ran into traffic near
51st Street and Brookside Boulevard and was struck by a car that
didn't stop. Weis rushed to the injured animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was still dazed, then he ran up to me limping with his paw
up when I bent down and he jumped into my arms,'' Weis said.
</P>
<P>
   Weis bundled Tux into an old blanket in the back of his car and
headed to the Mission MedVet clinic, a 24-hour emergency care
facility. When Weis parked and reached for the dog, Tux bit his
hand and drew blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Liska, a veterinarian at the clinic, told Weis that Tux
probably had a fractured left forelimb and a bruised lung. Liska
put the dog's leg in a splint but decided further treatment could
wait until the owner was contacted in the morning. Someone had
tattooed Tux's name on his inner thigh and groomed him like a show
dog, so there was a good chance the owner would be found quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't good enough for Weis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just pulled out his cash, took out everything in his wallet
and said, `This will serve as a good deposit. Keep him overnight,'
'' Liska said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Weis, who had given $140 the night before, said he
learned that it could cost $1,500 to have a metal plate put on
Tux's broken bone and a cast around the leg, plus $75 a day for
follow-up care. The clinic still didn't know who the owner was, so
Weis agreed to pay for the care if the owner didn't arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bill came due, the Lost Dog Registry put Bilotta in
touch with Mission MedVet. Bilotta took over responsibility, and
Tux had his cast removed Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Weis wouldn't let Bilotta repay the $140 and told her to make a
donation to an animal charity with the money she would have given
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel good about doing that,'' Weis said. ``Now I kind
of wish I'd gone to veterinary school.''

UNIV. OF WASHINGTON JOINS EFFORT TO FIGHT ABUSE OF CLOTHING LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The University of Washington wants to make sure that
Husky sweat shirt in your gym bag isn't the product of sweatshop
labor.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, UW officials this week followed the lead of more
than 100 colleges across the country who have joined the Fair Labor
Association, an organization backed by the White House to address
consumer concerns about sweatshop labor.
</P>
<P>
   The association's goal is to set minimum standards for labor
conditions around the world and monitor the progress in factories
that send their products back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders in a national student movement protesting the use of
sweatshop labor in the production of collegiate gear are less than
impressed by the UW's move. They view the Fair Labor Association as
weak and ineffective and vow to continue their protests this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Where the UW and more than 100 of its academic colleagues see
themselves sending a message, the students see them running for
cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that universities are looking for a way out, they're
looking for a way to avoid criticism,'' said Eric Brakken, a recent
graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a leader of United
Students Against Sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Universities across the country make money by licensing out
their trademarked logos and mascots to outside manufacturers who
put them on everything from key chains, to notebooks, to vinyl
spare-tire covers. The universities then get a percentage of every
sale.
</P>
<P>
   But these universities say they know little about where the
sweat shirts and mugs that bear their insignia are made. A U.S.
company like Champion may contract factories all over the world to
produce their goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know a whole lot about how their products have been
produced or where they're produced,'' said Norm Arkans, associate
vice president of university relations at the UW. ``Part of this is
insulation, in a way, against the chance that some of them might be
(using sweatshop labor).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the UW sells a lot of fan fare. The university last year
made between $400,000 and $450,000 in royalties for the use of its
university and Husky logos. The UW earns 8 percent on the sale of
the items and has licensing agreements with nearly 500
manufacturers, Arkans said.
</P>
<P>
   WSU last year earned about $425,000 in royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The UW is a late-comer in responding to a national student
movement aimed at cracking down on the producers of licensed
college gear. The past year has seen protests and sit-ins at
college campuses ranging from Georgetown and Duke, to Ivy League
schools, to big state universities in Wisconsin and California.
</P>
<P>
   At most Northwest schools, however, graduation came and went
without seeing any student activism against sweatshop labor.
Washington State University, the University of Oregon and Oregon
State University have all held off making a decision about joining
the Fair Labor Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it hasn't been a huge issue here, we would rather wait
and let the problems get worked out before we sign a code,'' said
Alyce Anderson, the trademark licensing officer at WSU.
</P>
<P>
   The Students Organizing Against Sweatshops say the code of
conduct created by the FLA doesn't go far enough. Chief among the
student group's complaints: The code doesn't force companies to
disclose the locations of their factories; lets the companies
choose their own outside monitors, and doesn't require companies to
pay a ``living wage,'' relying instead on sometimes very weak wage
laws in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The FLA code does outline acceptable standards for laborers and
their working conditions, including ages and hours. It also
stipulates that 30 percent of an apparel-maker's factories be
monitored in the first year, and 5 percent to 15 percent each year
after that.

   ``It's an issue that makes sense to us,'' said Arkans, the UW

   The push to have universities join the FLA, a group already
established to monitor apparel and athletic shoe production, is
viewed by some as a way of establishing a uniform standard. But
students have succeeded in pushing places like Duke and Harvard to
agree to more stringent labor and monitoring requirements than
those offered by the FLA.

   Other universities have reservations about signing on.

   ``The FLA certainly seems to have the momentum in the
industry,'' said Matt Dyste, director of trademark licensing at the
University of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   He remains concerned, however, about the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the all-important issue,'' Dyste said. ``We can all ask
that our products are made under certain conditions, but without
the mechanism to monitor it, it doesn't have any teeth in it.''
