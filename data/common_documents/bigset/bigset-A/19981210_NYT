EDITORIAL: CENSURE FITS THE OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 2nd graf to correct number of Democrats who drafted censure
resolution.) (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Dec. 10:
</P>
<P>
   At long last, the House Judiciary Committee has before it two
resolutions _ one for censure and one for impeachment _ that define
the choices before Congress and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The censure resolution, drafted by three Democrats, needs more
direct language about President Clinton's lies under oath. But it
represents a vehicle for Democrats and moderate Republicans to
deliver what the public properly wants, which is to condemn Clinton
strongly and then allow him to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the censure resolution out of the committee and to
the House floor as an alternative to the impeachment indictment
will be difficult. The dueling resolutions emerged in late
afternoon, bringing a hectic end to a day when the committee's
usual raucousness was replaced by a somber sense of history in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy presentation by White House counsel Charles Ruff
brought into clear focus the overriding question. Do Clinton's
offenses rise to the level of requiring impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   We reject Ruff's argument that the president ``believed that
what he was doing was being evasive but truthful'' under oath. The
evidence of Clinton's statements and conduct supports the view that
he planned to lie, knew he was lying and took actions to cover up
his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ruff framed the constitutional issue well. Even if
all the charges are true regarding lying about a certain definition
of sex or where hands were placed, he argued, the scale of the
offenses does not warrant overturning an election. We believe that
these offenses warrant censure, the sterner the better.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' four-count impeachment resolution argues,
in contrast, that Clinton should be tried in the Senate on charges
of lying to the grand jury, lying in the Paula Jones case,
obstructing justice and abusing his power to disrupt the legal
process.
</P>
<P>
   The grand-jury count is the most dangerous to Clinton. Moderate
Republicans might vote for it in the absence of a chance to vote
for censure. For that reason, GOP hard-liners will do their best to
kill the censure resolution in committee and impose rules that
prevent it from being brought later to the House floor. That would
be a disservice to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and the designated House speaker, Bob Livingston, are
ever going to exert leadership in this historic confrontation, they
need to use all their influence to keep censure alive as an
alternative for a House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although we favor censure, we do not share the view that all
pro-impeachment Republicans are zealots. Certainly some Judiciary
Committee Republicans are driven by political antipathy, just as
pro-Clinton Democrats have prejudged the case. But as many
committee members suggested in their thoughtful questions, it is
not easy to overlook Clinton's conduct and his decision to contort
the law rather than uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   But as Ruff pointed out, impeachment should be used when a
president's offenses against the state are so grave as to allow no
response other than removal. The obvious alternative of censuring
Clinton and making him acknowledge the condemnation with his
signature must be made available to the House members.
</P>
<P>
   History will judge a bipartisan vote for censure to have been a
rebuke far more stinging than a partisan vote for impeachment that
hits a dead end in the Senate and is heedless to a sense of
constitutional proportion.

DEFENSIVE PRESSURE IS WORKING FOR MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ First, they invariably attack the passer with more
than the usual four rushers. At the same time, their cornerbacks
are sticking to the opponent's wide receivers like chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the two strategies that have catapulted the Miami
Dolphins almost overnight into the National Football League's most
productive interception team.
</P>
<P>
   They blitz and they press, and the combination has produced 26
interceptions, 16 more than all of last season and just six away
from the team record set in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Dolphins, who face the Jets in Miami on Sunday
night in a battle for first place in the AFC East, have yielded an
NFL-low 14.2 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami did a fair amount of blitzing last season. ``But now
that's like our base defense,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley said
Wednesday. ``We bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's new is Coach Jimmy Johnson's decision to simplify pass
coverage by assigning his regular cornerbacks _ Terrell Buckley and
Sam Madison _ to a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it allows us to play better defense,'' Johnson said.
``With the people we have, with the talent we have, it prevents
teams from taking the ball and driving it and keeping it away from
our offense. We make more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: Buckley and Madison have become Pro Bowl candidates
with seven interceptions each. In fact, Johnson recently called
Madison _ a second-year pro from the University of Louisville _ the
best cornerback he has ever coached.
</P>
<P>
   The best part for Johnson is that seven of his players have made
interceptions. Even stubby inside linebacker Zach Thomas has three,
two returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it takes a special player to get out there and do what
we do,'' Buckley said. ``We're up in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Madison: ``We press every play, every down, when we're
tired, sweaty, when it's raining, in sleet, snow, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied that his team was giving up too many easy passes,
Johnson huddled with defensive coordinator George Hill in the off
season. Pressing coverage had worked for Johnson in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to tighten our coverages,'' Hill said. ``He felt
like we needed to be more aggressive there. You know, some people
don't realize what a bright football coach Jimmy is. They think of
him as a head coach, but he was a fine defensive coach before
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The press technique is not for the faint-hearted. The danger
exists on every play that with a slip here, a bump there, someone
could be running for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have given up 22 pass plays of at least 25 yards
this season, and Buckley was burned for a 56-yard game-loser
against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when evaluated as part of the big picture, Johnson and Hill
are almost giddy about the move. The Dolphins also have 42
quarterback sacks, which is within seven of the team record, set in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Dolphins' interceptions came last week against the
Oakland Raiders. Thomas and fellow linebacker Robert Jones had two
each, with a touchdown apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Rodgers was asked Wednesday why he was the only Miami
starting linebacker who failed to produce a touchdown in the game.
``I don't know,'' he said, smiling. ``I guess it's a conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the Dolphins had in beating the Raiders, they
understand that defending against the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson and
Wayne Chrebet on Sunday likely won't yield as many chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a good job of feeding those guys,'' Buckley said.
``They do a lot of different things to get them open _ more than
most teams. Sure this looks like one of our biggest challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it was pointed out that the Jets have scored 80 points
in the last two games, Buckley grew feisty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a lot of teams that scored a lot of points the
week before,'' he said. ``Teams play a different type of defense
than we do. So it's an opportunity to go out and prove we have a
good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's height _ he's 6 feet 3 inches, compared to the 5-9
Buckley and 5-11 Madison _ didn't seem to faze Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since pee wee ball, Sam and I have played guys 6-3, 6-4,'' he
said. ``That doesn't matter. What matters is whether you can play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison isn't shy about acknowledging his and Buckley's
contributions to the Dolphins' success. He noted that the team is
leading the league in pass defense primarily because of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get it done,'' he said, ``most of the time the team
comes out victorious.''

TOLEDO HAS COLLISION WITH REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ The bright yellow balloon was bobbing in the
passenger seat of the red Buick Regal, a giant smiley face grinning
at UCLA football coach Bob Toledo and his assistant, Mark Weber. As
the balloon grew bigger and bigger and bigger, so did the two men's
pupils.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a scene straight out of a Farrelly brothers
movie. You see a giant smiley face right before your life flashes
in front of your eyes. Bruins offensive lineman Kris Farris, an
amateur movie critic, would pan the sight gag as a cheap use of
irony.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a movie Toledo was talking about Wednesday at
the Rose Bowl headquarters, it was his life. Or rather, his near
death.
</P>
<P>
   It was Monday afternoon, less than 48 hours after the the Bruins
had been broadsided in Miami on their way to an undefeated season
and a national championship. Toledo and Weber were traveling in the
slow lane of a six-lane highway, heading toward the Atlanta airport
after visiting a punting recruit in nearby Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   Weber was driving their rental car, a four-door Chevy Malibu.
Toledo, 52, was sitting beside him, sipping a soda. They were
babbling about what good time they were making when the red car
appeared out of nowhere. It was bearing down on them from their
left, the female driver's view clearly obstructed by the balloon
riding shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of haranguing and hand-wringing over the Bruins'
49-45 loss to the Hurricanes, it took only a split second for the
blown call on Brad Melsby's late fumble and the defense's dismal
display throughout to be totally trivialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man,'' Toledo had time to scream before the woman struck
their car on the driver's side, between the front and rear doors.
Weber was traveling 50 miles an hour at the time. Had he been
going, say, 49.9, they probably would have had to pick Weber off
the front grill of the woman's car.
</P>
<P>
   The impact turned the Malibu into a flicked bottle top that spun
and spun in traffic until it came to a standstill, facing oncoming
cars. It was all over in a matter of seconds but it seemed to
Toledo that he and Weber would never stop spinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never spun around like that. It was like in slow
motion,'' Toledo said. ``That was a scary moment in my life. I
thought I was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   When he realized, to his immense relief, that he was mistaken,
Toledo reached for his cellular phone. But his fingers were
trembling so, he couldn't punch in 9-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. Within minutes an ambulance, a fire truck and
squad cars were parked at the scene. One of the police officers
eyed Toledo quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look familiar,'' he said, sizing up Toledo warily. ``Did I
arrest you before?''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's tongue was working about as well as his fingers, and as
he fumbled for a response the cop's expression softened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who you are,'' he said. ``You're that coach that was on
TV the other day. The guy from UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course. Toledo's shellshocked expression was a dead
giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaken, scared, nervous'' is how Toledo described his emotions
after his second pile-up in three days. Not that there's any
comparing a football collapse with a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   No one in a uniform hauled away in handcuffs any of the
offending Bruins defensive backs, as the police did the other
driver after determining she had a suspended license and no
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the degree of devastation. As he watched the tow
trucks haul off the demolished rental car and the destroyed red
car, Toledo couldn't help thinking, that wasn't a life-altering
loss he and the Bruins had suffered Saturday, it was simply a
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Weber and I, we're just lucky to be alive,'' said
Toledo, who escaped with a stiff neck, a separated left shoulder
and a headache that refuses to recede. ``It put that game in Miami
in perspective, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   When a cab came and whisked Toledo and Weber to the airport _
amazingly, in time to make their scheduled flight to their next
recruiting port of call _ Toledo thought the worst of the day was
behind him. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at his hotel, his message light was flashing
ominously. The UCLA football program had been involved in a
hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   A report had been filed on the Internet earlier in the day
claiming the football team was racked by dissension, with players
of different races divided over the issue of affirmative action.
Toledo was dumbstruck.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the allegations remained an open sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Toledo said during a press conference that
also featured Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, whose team will face
the Bruins on Jan. 1. ``We've done so many good things. Then we
lose one game and everybody gets emotional and upset and says
ridiculous things. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   What's regrettable is a team that strung together a
nation-leading 20-game winning streak with 18 starters that graced
the school Honor Roll is having to defend itself at all. It's a
good thing the Bruins are smart enough to distinguish fact from
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   After the week Toledo has had, you can be sure he'll drive home
to his players the difference between sports and life. &QL;

2 ASTRONAUTS INSTALL ANTENNAS ON SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA's astronaut construction workers on Wednesday
added communications antennas and removed unneeded equipment from
the exterior of the space station in another space walk from the
shuttle Endeavour.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force and Dr. James Newman, a
physicist, completed a seven-hour space walk on Wednesday night
after emerging from Endeavour's airlock earlier than planned, at
3:33 p.m. ET. They accomplished all of their tasks, including
improving the communications systems aboard the two station
sections docked to the shuttle's cargo bay and freeing a stuck
antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The main objective was to install two, 100-pound communications
antennas on opposite sides of the American-made Unity connecting
module. The astronauts wrestled with the suitcase-size antennas as
they pulled them through a narrow tunnel into the cargo bay. Then,
with Ross riding the shuttle's robot arm and Newman moving up the
side of the module on a tether line, they moved the antennas
halfway up the 35-foot-tall module.
</P>
<P>
   Each astronaut installed an antenna, and Newman hooked his to a
video cable running down from the Russian-built Zarya module. On
Thursday, when the six-member crew enters the station modules for
the first time, the astronauts will hook the antennas to equipment
on the inside and test a video conferencing system that will be
used in the early stages of station construction.
</P>
<P>
   Wedneday's space walk was the second of three planned for the
12-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   The new antennas also will give NASA's Mission Control at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston the ability to monitor Unity and to
have direct control over operations on the station without having
to go through Russian ground stations.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts quickly moved through the other objectives of the
walk, including erecting a folding sunshade over a computer mounted
outside of Unity and bundling loose cables along the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Working around the 7-story, 35-ton Zarya-Unity stack, the
astronauts also removed restraints used to stablize four Unity
hatchways during launching. These hatches will be docking ports for
other station modules, including the framework for a solar array
and a cupola viewing port, that will be added in the station's
five-year construction period.
</P>
<P>
   As the astronauts worked their way around the station's aluminum
exterior, bright sunlight illuminated the blue-lettered ``Unity''
emblem, which includes small representations of the American Flag
and NASA's insignia. Noticing it, Ross remarked to his partner,
``Kind of neat working up here right by the Unity sign, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the space walk, ground controllers gave the
astronauts permission to try to unstick one of two rolled-up
antennas on Zarya. The astronauts confirmed on Monday that
explosive bolts that were to unfurl the four-foot long antennas had
fired after Zarya was launched on Nov. 20 but failed to deploy the
devices, to be used to help dock ships to the Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   Newman tapped the antenna free with a 10-foot-long extendable
grappling hook. The astronauts will try to free the other antenna
on the third space walk on Saturday.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Former Alabama coach Gene Stallings has been offered the job
of replacing Dave Roberts as Baylor's head football coach, sources
said Wednesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Also, Dallas Highland Park coach Scott Smith has been contacted
about taking the position of defensive coordinator, sources
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, who won the 1992 national championship at Alabama,
wants some time to consider the offer and how he would handle a
prior commitment to the USA World Cup team, which is scheduled to
play in Europe next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor athletic director Tom Stanton decided to reassign Roberts
on Sunday, two weeks after Roberts and the Bears had completed
their second consecutive 2-9 season. Rumors concerning Stallings,
63, surfaced the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 40, is a former player and assistant coach at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if an announcement is coming soon, Smith said, ``I
don't know how much I can say. All I can say is what I've said
before: I love Baylor University, and I certainly would be
interested in Baylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Connally, the Highland Park athletic director, said it
was ``a little premature right now'' to say Smith was leaving the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings, who has a ranch in Paris, Texas, was in Jacksonville,
Fla., Monday and Tuesday on a book tour but flew to Dallas on
Wednesday and stayed at the home of one of his daughters. Sources
said Stanton was in Dallas on Wednesday on business.
</P>
<P>
   Stallings is scheduled to be at a news conference this morning
in Granbury to announce the site of the USA team's training camp
for the first World Cup of American Football, which will be played
in Italy in July. Stallings was selected by the American Football
Coaches Association to coach the team of college all-stars.
</P>
<P>
   But NCAA rules will not permit an active coach to participate in
the World Cup, so Stallings likely would have to resign his
position as coach of the USA team if he took the job at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bell, the director of media relations for the AFCA, said
Wednesday night he still expected Stallings to be at the news
conference, and the announcement in Granbury would take place
whether or not Stallings was present.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now, he is still the coach of the team,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor officials hope to make an announcement on a new coach as
soon as possible, because each day without a head coach essentially
is a lost day in the recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said Stanton still plans to interview Southern
Mississippi coach Jeff Bower, who is believed to be Baylor's second
choice if Stallings turns down the school's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor in this equation is Smith, who is a highly
respected high school coach who could be groomed to take over the
Baylor program under a veteran tutor like Stallings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played quarterback and defensive back at Baylor from
1977-81 under Grant Teaff before coaching defensive backs for Teaff
for three seasons. Sources said Teaff has highly recommended Smith
to Baylor officials.
</P>
<P>
   If Stallings takes the job, he will be working with his
son-in-law, Keith Gunn, who is an administrative assistant coach at
Baylor.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
Wednesday evening formally called for President Clinton's removal
from office in four draft articles of impeachment accusing Clinton
of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed charges were disclosed even before the White House
had finished presenting its two-day defense of the president to the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the White House, top Democrats and a handful
of Republicans intensified their push to let the full House vote
next week on censuring the president as an alternative to
impeachment. But Republican leaders are resisting such a vote,
fearing it would siphon the votes of some moderate Republicans away
from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In harshly worded language, the proposed articles pressed beyond
the grounds for impeachment outlined in the independent counsel's
report sent to Congress three months ago, which accused the
president of lying under oath about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, of obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee folded the many
allegations into four counts: two counts of perjury, one of
obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power. The perjury count
was divided into two parts, one on the president's testimony to the
federal grand jury and one for his deposition in the Paula Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The split was devised to address the concerns of some
Republicans who are reluctant to support a charge of perjury
stemming from a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of this,'' the eight-page draft of the articles
concluded, ``William Jefferson Clinton has undermined the integrity
of his office, has brought disrepute on the Presidency, has
betrayed his trust as President, and has acted in a manner
subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury
of the people of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which had for weeks demanded to know the
specific charges the Judiciary Committee was considering to prepare
its defense, immediately dismissed them as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the articles, there's nothing in the
allegations, there's nothing in the record, there's nothing in the
Constitution that brings anything here up to the standard of an
impeachable offense,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And committee Democrats immediately issued a 13-page rebuttal to
the articles of impeachment, denouncing the Republicans for
releasing the charges before the committee begins hearing closing
arguments on Thursday. Charge by charge, the Democrats' rebuttal
attacks the credibility of several witnesses, pointedly assailing
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on several different matters.
</P>
<P>
   Citing grand jury testimony; the report by the independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr; and FBI interviews, all of which were made
public by Congress, the Democrats' rebuttal says Ms. Lewinsky ``is
not always truthful.'' It goes on to say that her memory was
``impaired by prescription drugs'' she had used since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky, insisting on anonymity, said
Wednesday night that the Democrats' assertions were unfounded. The
associate said Ms. Lewinsky began taking an anti-depressant,
Zoloft, in the spring of this year, after she had given a proffer
of her testimony to prosecutors. But the associate insisted that
Ms. Lewinsky's proffer, an offering of her testimony given to
prosecutors in February, was ``entirely consistent'' with her grand
jury testimony in August.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also said that Ms. Lewinsky had told others she had
``lied her entire life'' and that she forged a letter while in
college. In most other ways, the rebuttal largely echoed points
made by the president's lawyers in their 184-page defense report.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed articles of impeachment will form the basis for the
committee's deliberations this week. On Thursday, the investigative
counsel for the Republicans, David Schippers, plans to show
Clinton's videotaped deposition in the Jones case as part of his
closing arguments. His Democratic counterpart, Abbe Lowell, also
will give a summation on Thursday. On Friday, the 37-member panel
begins debating the articles and is almost certain to vote along
party lines for impeachment by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the panel's draft articles capped an extraordinary
two days of testimony by the president's top lawyers and legal
scholars and former federal prosecutors who argued that Clinton's
misleading statements and misconduct in the Lewinsky affair did not
rise to the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Few opinions were swayed as sharp exchanges marked the hearings,
with committee Republicans challenging Clinton's representatives
over and over to acknowledge that the President had committed
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., was among those who pushed the
president's defenders for more information. ``Your presentation has
helped point us to the portions of that record before us that you
believe are relevant to your client's defense,'' Canady said. ``But
let me say that I am still frustrated by what I consider to be
legal arguments that don't really meet the test of common sense and
human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a counterattack, committee Democrats issued a censure
alternative that would condemn the president for ``making false
statements concerning his reprehensible conduct'' and wrongly
taking steps to ``delay the discovery of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure proposal _ drafted by Reps. Rick Boucher
of Virginia, Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts and Tom Barrett of
Wisconsin _ also states that Clinton ``remains subject to criminal
and civil penalties for this conduct.'' Clinton would be obligated
to sign the censure. The proposed wording does not include
imposition of a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, said he would allow a
committee vote on the measure, but then added that he would vote
against it. Even the measure's sponsors conceded that censure has
no chance of passing the Republican-controlled panel. But Democrats
voiced hope it would win enough support from moderate Republicans
to force Republican leaders to allow a floor vote on some form of
censure.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum for censure received a boost from a prominent
Republican, former Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, who
announced his own version of an alternative at the committee
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's plan, which White House officials said they did not know
of in advance, mirrors the Democratic alternative, but would also
include a fine to penalize Clinton for his misconduct. Democrats
say they would be open to the president's negotiating a fine, to
get around constitutional hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of the House would be upheld if something like
that were to be approached,'' said Weld, who testified in defense
of the president on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift, the White House moved from a crouch to
aggressive support of a censure option. ``The president's general
position is that he's done something blameworthy,'' Lockhart said.
``If members of Congress want to come to him with an idea short of
impeachment, it's something he would consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the majority of the House wants a vehicle to vote on some
other option than impeachment, then they should be given that,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined to comment on the details of any censure
motion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who support a censure option still face an uphill battle.
Rep. Robert Livingston, the speaker-designate, has not ruled out a
censure vote on the floor, but the Republican whip, Rep. Tom DeLay,
is actively blocking any attempt to let lawmakers vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 31 Democrats who in October voted for the
Republican impeachment inquiry resolution _ Tim J. Roemer of
Indiana, Ellen Tauscher of California and Jim Moran of Virginia _
collected signatures from the group for a letter to Livingston,
urging a floor vote on a censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic
leader, started calling the 31 Democrats to see how they would vote
on impeachment. Between three and five Democrats might vote for
impeachment, Democratic aides say, meaning that 14 to 16
Republicans would have to oppose impeachment to kill it on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, the Democratic whip, was calling to make sure
all Democrats _ even those who are retiring or who lost re-election
bids _ are planning to return for next week's momentous vote on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The draft documents were released as the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff, was finishing an eloquently meticulous defense of why
Clinton should not be removed from office for his admitted
misconduct in the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said the timing of the release of
the articles of impeachment was clear evidence of the partisan
nature of the judiciary proceedings and of closed-mindedness on the
part of the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hearing room after the proceedings, Hyde told
reporters that he planned to vote for all four articles of
impeachment, and he predicted that at least one of the perjury
counts would be approved by the full committee.
</P>
<P>
   The first article in the drafts charges Clinton with perjury
before the grand jury on Aug. 17, and outlines four accusations.
Among them, Clinton is charged with ``false and misleading
testimony'' about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and his
efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses in the Jones sexual
misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   The second article on perjury charges Clinton with signing an
affidavit in the Jones case on Dec. 23, 1997, pledging to tell the
truth and then lying about whether he had a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. The article also accuses the president of giving
false statements under oath in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The third article of impeachment accuses Clinton of obstructing
justice in an effort to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal the
existence of evidence'' in the Jones case. The article lists seven
acts that the Republican committee staff believes bolster the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on Dec. 17, the article charges, Clinton
encouraged Ms. Lewinsky, who is not named in the draft, to lie in a
sworn statement and to give false testimony. The article also
accuses the president of helping create a plan to hide evidence _
the gifts that he gave Ms. Lewinsky _ and of successfully pressing
to get Ms. Lewinsky a new job in New York to buy her silence in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth article of impeachment charges that the president
``misused and abused his office,'' laying out four instances. Among
them, the article charges, is that Clinton lied to the American
people, gave false and misleading statements to White House aides
and his Cabinet officers, and ``frivolously asserted'' executive
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The committee reorganized the 11 main charges contained in the
report by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. In addition, the
committee added at least three supporting instances.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice article, the committee charged
that Clinton did not correct his lawyer, Robert Bennett, during the
Jones deposition, when Bennett asserted that Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit proved that ``no sex of any kind'' had occurred and
should foreclose any questioning of Clinton on that matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the article alleging abuse of power, the committee added the
accusation that the president lied to the American public and that
the president committed perjury by lying in his answers to 81
questions submitted by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These four articles of impeachment reflect the evidence we
have had before us and the testimony we have had before us,'' said
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders have tentatively set aside Dec. 16
through Dec. 19 for debate and votes, Republican aides said.

UCLA'S YOUNG READY TO RUN AND GUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Freshman guard Ray Young is one of UCLA's best
athletes, with strength, quickness and an anti-gravity vertical
jump. But until recently, he couldn't scale a tall wall.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't so much tall as long _ two hours long.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, we'd practice about two hours and go all
out,'' Young said. ``Here, it's a different philosophy. We go three
or three-and-a-half hours. I'd hit the wall about after two hours.
I had to break through it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he did, and the results were immediate: He was
tougher, more confident and more productive. After a slow start,
Young, from Alameda, has become a quiet contributor and one of
UCLA's best defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three weeks, he's played as well as anybody in
practice and in games,'' coach Steve Lavin said. ``He's been very
productive without a lot of minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn ankle ligaments made Young's transition to college
practices doubly difficult. He spent part of the summer on crutches
and was several strides behind when the Bruins began practice in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir came against San Francisco in the Puerto Rico
Shootout. Young didn't play, but his high school rivals, Ali Thomas
and LyRyan Russell, got plenty of time for the Dons.
</P>
<P>
   Young considered transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely came into play,'' he said. ``I saw those kids
I knew from home getting more playing time. But I'm here, and I
believe in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Young gradually played himself into shape, over the wall and
onto the court. He had five points and three rebounds in six
minutes against Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come the furthest since Oct. 15,'' Lavin said. ``There
was a point where he was buried.... But he kept working. We have to
find a way to get him more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to basics: Freshman forward JaRon Rush has been removed
from the starting lineup because nagging back pain limits his
practice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has less to do with performance and more to do with
practice time,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rush injured his lower back several years ago and never
strengthened the muscles in his lower back and stomach. Bruins
trainer Jeff Smith has prescribed a series of exercises, including
sit-ups, to strengthen the muscles in Rush's ``trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon just has a weak trunk,'' Smith said. ``It'll probably
bug him most of this year. But once we get into the offseason,
that's all he'll be doing and it should improve.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice check: Sophomore guard Ryan Bailey has been placed on
scholarship. Bailey, the brother of ex-Bruin Toby, transferred from
Penn State last season as a walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV update: UCLA's opponent Saturday, Nevada-Las Vegas, is a
talented but chaotic team with a 4-3 record that includes losses to
USC (71-68) and Arizona State (79-70).
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't playing exceptionally well, but they're a
dangerous team,'' Lavin said. ``They're searching for their
identity, like ourselves.''

KINGS ASK FANS TO BE PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Concerned about the effect of the Kings'
struggles on their season-ticket holders, team president Tim
Leiweke recently dropped them a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe in this team and we are still confident that
we will be back in the playoffs once we get our key players back on
the ice,'' Leiweke wrote in a letter sent to the team's 8,500
ticket-holders. ``Hopefully, you will judge us on the entire
season, not just last month.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first period of Wednesday night's sparsely attended
game against Washington at the Forum, Leiweke explained the
decision to write the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are at is not where we wanted to be,'' he said. ``I
felt really bad for them.... I think if the fans hang in there, the
team will be there at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said he'd already gotten responses from some recipients
of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some said, `Class act,''' Leiweke said. ``Others said, `If you
don't make the playoffs, it will be our last year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen sits: For the second time since he was recalled from the
minors more than a month ago, rookie center Olli Jokinen was a
healthy scratch Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said he didn't want both Jokinen and fellow
rookie Josh Green playing on the top two lines, and Robinson added
that Green was better suited than Jokinen to go into the corners
and battle along the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see is him getting in there and battling
more,'' Robinson said of Jokinen, 19. ``He is a playmaker, but I'd
like to see a little more grit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen's ice time has declined in his last five games. In his
first nine appearances, Jokinen averaged nearly 18 minutes a game,
and he had four goals, eight points and a plus-6 rating. In his
last five games, he has averaged about 11 minutes, had no points
and is minus-3. In his last game, a 4-3 loss Saturday to Detroit,
Jokinen played a season-low 6:41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about why I don't play,'' Jokinen said. ``I have
to work hard every game and practice.... It's pretty hard when you
only go on the ice every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: The Kings activated winger Steve McKenna before the
game, and he returned to the lineup for the first time since
suffering an abdominal strain Nov. 5 in a fight with Tony Twist of
the St. Louis Blues.... The roster stands at the 24-man limit,
meaning that when defenseman Rob Blake returns from his broken foot
_ perhaps as soon as Saturday _ the Kings will have to make a move.
There's a chance the Kings will opt to keep eight defensemen on
their roster, meaning they may send a forward to the minors.

ARTIST'S WORK ADORNS LOTTERY TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When's the last time you were given carte blanche
to scratch the artwork of a world-renowned artist, let alone one
from Los Angeles?
</P>
<P>
   Never?
</P>
<P>
   Well, grab that penny because for the holiday season, lottery
players can scrape and scratch away on the first California ticket
ever to feature the design of a published artist.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket was designed by Jane Wooster Scott, an American folk
art painter who lives in the suburban Los Angeles community of
Studio City in the San Fernando Valley. More than 4.8 million
Holiday Greetings Scratchers, which sell at $3 apiece, feature her
``Christmas Traffic Jam'' painting.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who was not paid for her lottery design, said it took no
convincing to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all in favor of it because I think the lottery is a
worthwhile cause -- where the money goes (to education) -- not to
mention how much fun it must be to win,'' she said in a telephone
interview Wednesday from her other residence, in Sun Valley, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Scratcher, which debuted in late October, has become
a hit with customers in recent weeks, according to local stores
that sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love the design,'' said Allen Youssef, manager of
Ringside Liquors in Studio City. ``They use it as a Christmas card
because it has a design like a Christmas card.''
</P>
<P>
   In a touch of irony, the ticket's name, ``Christmas Traffic
Jam,'' depicts a winter holiday scene from a turn-of-the-century
American town, complete with horse-drawn carriages, Christmas trees
and children playing in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   It's unusual for state lotteries to use published artists in
their lottery designs, but this season Scott's work has become the
rage, according to the company that prints lottery tickets for
states across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island and Virginia also are using Scott's work for their
holiday lottery tickets, said Carla Schaefer, director of new
business development for BABN, an international security printer
and marketer based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a time when more lotteries have
simultaneously used the same artist,'' said Schaefer, adding that
the only other such artist whose work was used by state lotteries
is American illustrator Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The creative and marketing teams at the Sacramento-based
California Lottery came across Scott's work in a catalog and
discovered that her work also had been used by the Idaho lottery
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really happy with the way it turned out -- It's a really
beautiful ticket,'' said Cathy Doyle Johnston, spokeswoman for the
California Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who owns an art publishing company in Northridge, Calif.,
called Scott Arts Graphics, has exhibited her oil paintings and
serigraphs in Japan, Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Her buyers range from actors Paul Newman, Carol Burnett and Kirk
Douglas to singer Kenny Rogers and producer Aaron Spelling,
according to her publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've lived most of life in California I thought the
lotto ticket was appropriate,'' said Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays are the peak selling season for lottery tickets, so
state lotteries look for ways to package their ticket in the most
appealing way, said Schaefer. ``Our product is the ticket,'' she
said. ``And (Scott's) work just lends itself to this. It emits the
true holiday spirit and it looks more like a holiday greeting card
than a lotto ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's important for state lotteries to maintain a clean
image, they are very selective in the artwork that is used in
designs, said Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody that can say (Scott's artwork) is not the most
wholesome piece of holiday spirit,'' said Schaefer. ``It appeals to
all segments, all groups, all markets.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Toronto Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said Wednesday he has
received at least one acceptable offer for pitcher Roger Clemens.
But it isn't believed to have come from one of the three teams _
the Astros, Texas Rangers and New York Yankees _ considered the top
contenders for his services.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So who is this mystery team?
</P>
<P>
   Ash did not identify the club, nor, he added, have the Blue Jays
accepted an offer for baseball's only five-time Cy Young Award
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an offer from a club that from a player point of view
satisfies our needs,'' Ash said. ``What I've suggested to that club
is that they get guidance from Roger's representatives
(Houston-based agents Alan and Randy Hendricks) on how they should
proceed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was rumored Wednesday as the likely team, but Indians
GM John Hart quickly shot down any reports that the Indians were
the club. Anaheim, Colorado, Atlanta, Los Angeles and the New York
Mets were not believed to be the clubs, either, baseball sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ash said the club that made the proposal did not contact him
Wednesday and that he talked with just two teams during the day,
one of which was the Rangers. Texas general manager Doug Melvin met
with Ash for 90 minutes Tuesday, and the two had breakfast
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I'm directing that club to do is make sure they
qualify,'' Ash said. ``They had a lot of questions for me that I
couldn't answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens on Dec. 2 asked for a trade closer to his home in
Houston or to a contender after concluding the Blue Jays were
unwilling to spend money to build a competitive club. He can block
a trade or force potential clubs to renegotiate his contract, which
calls for salaries of $5 million next year and $6.35 million in
2000. Toronto owes $5 million in deferred money from the first two
seasons of the deal, which currently guarantees a minimum of $31.5
million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran traded in the midst of a multiyear contract,
Clemens could file an official trade demand after the 1999 season
if he decides not to ask for renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Ash had hoped to finalize a deal for Clemens, 36, prior to
leaving tonight for the winter meetings in Nashville, Tenn.,
although that seems unlikely after Wednesday's slow progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say from the lack of conversation today, this is going
to drag into the weekend for sure,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Ash said he had narrowed the number of teams
the Jays might deal with to six. Apparently, however, the field has
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on their bid to lure free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown,
the St. Louis Cardinals have reportedly expressed interest in
Clemens, who went 41-13 and won a pair of Cy Youngs in two seasons
with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have made a late push with a deal that would feature
infielder Edgardo Alfonzo as the centerpiece of a package that also
could include righthander Bobby Jones and either pitching prospect
Octavio Dotel or outfield prospect Jay Payton. And Colorado is said
to be offering second baseman Mike Lansing, righthander Darryl Kile
or righthander Pedro Astacio, and one other player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked, but we're not optimistic,'' Rockies GM Bob
Gebhard said. ``But we are talking, and I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, too, joined the picture late Wednesday night. The
Orioles have reportedly offered Toronto a package that includes
lefthanded reliever Arthur Rhodes and two prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is believed to have pulled out of the bidding, as Braves
GM John Schuerholz is likely finished with any additions after
acquiring Bret Boone, Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon during the
offseason. The Braves are currently operating with what would be a
$72 million budget for next season, $5 million more than the club
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams believe it will take at least three players to pry
Clemens away from the Blue Jays. There is also the possibility of
the Clemens sweepstakes turning into a three-team deal, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. has said his team has put one
offer on the table. The identities of the players involved have not
been disclosed, but the Blue Jays have shown interest in outfielder
Derek Bell and pitcher Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Shane Reynolds was at one point mentioned as a trade
possibility, but the Astros are said to be working toward a
contract extension for the righthander that could come as early as
today. Reynolds, who won 19 games in 1998, has one year remaining
on his current contract.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN Roger Staubach was in his prime, and the Dallas Cowboys all
but had their own church, he once said that he pictured heaven as a
place where quarterbacks ``completed all their passes.''
</P>
<P>
   One writer, a cynical sort as most of them are, asked, ``What
about defensive backs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no defensive backs in heaven,'' Roger replied,
kidding on the square.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, there must be a special place somewhere for
college coaches. A place where quarterbacks play on one leg and a
team given no chance to win rallies from 15 points behind to claim
a championship.
</P>
<P>
   R.C. Slocum found such a place last weekend in St. Louis. His
Texas A&AMP;M Aggies were coming off a killer loss to the Texas
Longhorns, as dominated as a team can be when it loses by two
points. And Saturday, the Aggies fell behind by margins of 17-3 and
27-12 and trailed by 15 points going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They had started their backup quarterback, Branndon Stewart, who
strained a knee in the first quarter and had to be helped to the
bench. On the Aggies' sideline, the punter, Shane Lechler, loosened
up his arm. He would go into the game as the emergency quarterback
if Stewart were unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Aggies, and their grandkids as yet unborn,
Stewart made it back onto the field and then produced one of the
great and gritty comebacks in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Aggies fans would love it, we can't repeat the
play-by-play of the fourth quarter and overtime in the space
available to us. But in a quarter and a fraction, Stewart completed
11 of 20 passes for 235 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to
Sirr Parker, including the game-winner. The same pair combined for
a two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   For those watching at home, or on their bar stools, it was
exciting listening to the announcers, Brent Musburger and Dan
Fouts, remind us that Kansas State was 30 minutes away from
qualifying for the Fiesta Bowl and a national-championship game.
Then the Wildcats were 15 minutes from Tempe, and now 10. Then they
stopped counting.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies, down all day, were roaring back. Stewart, who had
struggled for three years, suddenly looked like Unitas or Marino or
Peyton Manning, whose large shadow caused Stewart to transfer from
Tennessee. After all the criticism and all the disappointments,
Branndon was rifling his passes to Chris Taylor, Derrick Spiller
and Leroy Hodgel. Suddenly, he was the can't-miss guy. In overtime,
Max Baumgardner made a circus catch to set up Parker's final dash
in a 36-33 stunner.
</P>
<P>
   Sirr might have scored in the first half, except that he began
to celebrate at the 15-yard line, which is not often mistaken for
the goal line. But oddly, in a year when they won 10 in a row and
upset then-second-ranked Nebraska, the Aggies' celebrations have
been short-lived. They were buried by many of the fans and all of
the media after falling to Florida State in August, and again after
Ricky Williams did his tap dance on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, in spite of injuries and the odds and all that
Kansas State had going for it, the Aggies wouldn't surrender. Every
time the Wildcats thought they had nailed the coffin shut, the
Aggies jammed their first through the lid.
</P>
<P>
   One game might not be compensation for three years of waiting,
but Stewart in the clutch was the quarterback of Aggie dreams. And
Parker, who was hurt at the start of the season and never quite
found his role in a sputtering Aggies offense, topped K-State's
Michael Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   In Bishop, the Wildcats might have the most exciting player in
college football, a quarterback who can beat you running or passing
or thinking. But his fumble gave the Aggies a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   You won't convince anyone on the Kansas plains that this is what
makes college football great, this kind of whiplash shift of
fortune, but R.C. Slocum believes it.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum's teams have averaged 9.3 wins a year since he succeeded
Jackie Sherrill 10 years ago. The Aggies were undefeated for three
straight years in the Southwest Conference. Now, after finishing in
the Top 10 five of the past seven years, they have won their first
Big 12 title.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the winningest coaches in the land, and least
recognized, Slocum has never been a finalist for the Bear Bryant
Coach of the Year Award. The 1998 trophy will be presented at the
Westin Galleria tonight at the annual dinner for the benefit of the
Heart Association. You recall the praise heaped upon K-State's Bill
Snyder from the TV booth in St. Louis. Musburger quoted Barry
Switzer, no less, as saying, ``He ought to be Coach of the
Century,'' for turning around a program that was almost deceased.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies might stop short of claiming the only title left,
Coach of the Millennium, for their man. But one fine day, R.C.
Slocum ought to have a place at the table.

PATAKI MAKES APPOINTMENT TO COURT OF APPEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seizing a chance to reshape a court he has repeatedly assailed
as too sympathetic to criminal defendants, Gov. George Pataki
Wednesday nominated Albert Rosenblatt, a state appeals court judge
and a former Dutchess County prosecutor, to replace one of the
state's most liberal jurists on New York's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the state Senate _ a step that is all but
certain _ Rosenblatt, who sits on the Appellate Division of state
Supreme Court in Poughkeepsie, would become Pataki's second
appointment to the seven-member Court of Appeals. Rosenblatt would
replace Judge Vito Titone of Staten Island, the court's
longest-serving member, who had been appointed in 1985 to the
position by his friend, Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's selections to the Court of Appeals are closely
watched, both because of the court's historic stature as one of the
nation's most influential and once liberal benches, and because of
Pataki's obvious dissatisfaction with some of its views. Pataki has
long identified himself with criminal justice issues and campaigned
in 1994 on a pledge to reinstate the death penalty. He has often
criticized Court of Appeals decisions, such as one making it harder
for police officers to gather evidence against criminal defendants.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Albany, Pataki chose not to reiterate
his frequent criticism of the court and instead cast his decision
in broader terms than judicial ideology. The Republican governor
invoked Rosenblatt's breadth of experience, particularly his two
years as the state's chief administrative judge, in addition to his
judicial writings and personal bearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at his opinions,'' Pataki said, ``they are just
really thought out and intelligently written and have that
combination of judicial wisdom and common sense that I think makes
for an outstanding judge.''
</P>
<P>
   All seven members of the Court of Appeals who were sitting when
Pataki took office in 1995 had been appointed by Cuomo, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, 62, began his legal career as a prosecutor in
Dutchess County in 1964, where he worked until he was elected a
county judge in 1975. He also was the last judge in New York to
sentence a defendant to death prior to the reinstatement of the
death penalty: Lemuel Smith, for killing a prison guard, in 1981.
Smith's sentence was converted to 25 years-to-life in prison after
the state's highest court overturned the portion of the death
penalty law under which he had been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was far from certain that Rosenblatt's arrival on the
bench would be a sign of a significant shift in the court's
direction. For one thing, the Court of Appeals is no longer viewed
as being as sympathetic to the rights of defendants as it was in
the 1980s, when it was led by Sol Wachtler as chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   And at least in the way it presents itself to the public with
its written decisions, it has been relatively free of the kind of
sharp ideological discord that is associated with the U.S. Supreme
Court. Last year, for example, 93 percent of the New York high
court's decisions were unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Titone resigned Sept. 1 at the age of 68 to take a position with
a private law firm. At the age of 62, Rosenblatt is nominated to a
14-year term with a mandatory retirement age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt was selected from a list of seven candidates provided
to Pataki by an independent judicial screening committee. He had
been recommended once before to Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   He is a registered Republican. With his appointment, the court
will consist of three Republicans, three Democrats and an
independent.

   LONDON _ In the eight-year war that followed Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Iran in 1980, Iran suffered 750,000 casualties and
endured savage trench warfare, chemical and gas attacks, and
bombings of its cities and sacred mosques. The Iranian people not
only despise Saddam, they have the will to stand up to him.
</P>
<P>
   The key to enlisting Tehran in the fight against him is in
Washington. By encouraging those Iranians who want to modernize the
economy and moderate the society, the United States could go a long
way toward containing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Iran of today is nothing like helping the Iran
etched in the memory of many Americans during the 444-day hostage
crisis almost two decades ago. Today pragmatism, not ideology,
drives the post-Khomeini Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It is ruled by a good cop, bad cop, good-bad cop triumvirate,
consisting of President Mohammed Khatami, Supreme Leader Sayed Ali
Khamenei and the chairman of the Expediency Council, Hashemi
Rafsanjani. This alliance excludes the extremists.
</P>
<P>
   But these leaders face enormous problems.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has called Iran's economy ``sick.'' Inflation and
unemployment are rampant. Fewer than 100,000 of the more than
750,000 new jobs needed each year are created.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large enterprises are controlled by state or
para-state revolutionary foundations, or bonyads, which, despite
efforts to rein them in, remain a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation for the Deprived and War Veterans, which took
over all the assets of the shah and his family, now mismanages some
400 banking, commercial and industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Guard has increasingly become involved in
business dealings, as the prime contractor for railways, pipelines
and factories.
</P>
<P>
   The only real economic leverage that President Khatami has is
his control of oil, which accounts for three-quarters of the
country's foreign exchange but whose price has fallen through the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's major economic advantage is the strong entrepreneurial
spirit among its large merchant class. The current budget proposes
privatizing most state-controlled-enterprises, including many of
the bonyads.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders like A.N.S. Khamooshi, head of Iran's Chamber
of Commerce, will be central to privatization efforts and to
convincing voters that the pragmatists can create real economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections next February and parliamentary elections in May
2000 will determine the future. The key to these elections is
Iran's young people.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the population is under age 25. Most were
not even born when the shah was driven from power, and few remember
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   A young man told me when I visited this year that he wants to go
dancing, hold hands with his girlfriend and watch movies in public.
Like teenagers everywhere, he and his friends see ``Made in the
USA'' as a status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Those who shout the ``Death to America'' slogans are wearing
Michael Jordan T-shirts. They have access to books, newspapers,
magazines and other information on the Internet. In the Middle
East, only Israel and Turkey have a greater addiction to spending
time on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should not be duped by the recent acts of extremists
who view the opening up of Iran with alarm. Desperate men take
desperate measures. The assassination of opposition leader Dariush
Forouhar and the attack by Islamic militants on a bus carrying a
group of Americans will not impede the slow movement toward the
rule of law and democracy. Only the United States can do that.
</P>
<P>
   America must recognize that changes in Iran offer new
opportunities to reduce the tensions in a region vital to its
interests.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Washington to end its efforts to isolate and
contain Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton should reach out to Iran's conservative
spiritual leader as well as to its liberal president; he should ask
the United Nations to invite the Iranians to join in a regional
conference to discuss the future of Iraq; he should lift the trade
embargo, and Congress should repeal economic sanctions that hurt
U.S. companies and alienate America's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a large American energy company invests in Iran,
other investors are sure to follow. And the United States should
assist Iran in its efforts to control the $7 billion narcotics
trade from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   An economically strong and respected Iran would not only be good
for the Iranians, it would help contain Iraq. &QL;

business dealings, as the prime contractor for railways, pipelines
and factories.
</P>
<P>
   The only real economic leverage that President Khatami has is
his control of oil, which accounts for three-quarters of the
country's foreign exchange but whose price has fallen through the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's major economic advantage is the strong entrepreneurial
spirit among its large merchant class. The current budget proposes
privatizing most state-controlled-enterprises, including many of
the bonyads.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders like A.N.S. Khamooshi, head of Iran's Chamber
of Commerce, will be central to privatization efforts and to
convincing voters that the pragmatists can create real economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections next February and parliamentary elections in May
2000 will determine the future. The key to these elections is
Iran's young people.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the population is under age 25. Most were
not even born when the shah was driven from power, and few remember
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   A young man told me when I visited this year that he wants to go
dancing, hold hands with his girlfriend and watch movies in public.
Like teenagers everywhere, he and his friends see ``Made in the
USA'' as a status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Those who shout the ``Death to America'' slogans are wearing
Michael Jordan T-shirts. They have access to books, newspapers,
magazines and other information on the Internet. In the Middle
East, only Israel and Turkey have a greater addiction to spending
time on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should not be duped by the recent acts of extremists
who view the opening up of Iran with alarm. Desperate men take
desperate measures. The assassination of opposition leader Dariush
Forouhar and the attack by Islamic militants on a bus carrying a
group of Americans will not impede the slow movement toward the
rule of law and democracy. Only the United States can do that.
</P>
<P>
   America must recognize that changes in Iran offer new
opportunities to reduce the tensions in a region vital to its
interests.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Washington to end its efforts to isolate and
contain Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton should reach out to Iran's conservative
spiritual leader as well as to its liberal president; he should ask
the United Nations to invite the Iranians to join in a regional
conference to discuss the future of Iraq; he should lift the trade
embargo, and Congress should repeal economic sanctions that hurt
U.S. companies and alienate America's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a large American energy company invests in Iran,
other investors are sure to follow. And the United States should
assist Iran in its efforts to control the $7 billion narcotics
trade from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   An economically strong and respected Iran would not only be good
for the Iranians, it would help contain Iraq. &QL;

<P>
   FRANKFURT _- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer,
Wednesday heralded plans to expand its aggressive discounting
strategy across Europe by nearly quadrupling the number of
``hypermarkets'' it operates in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The retailing giant with its sprawling ``Supercenters,'' which
has transformed U.S. shopping habits at the expense of smaller Main
Street merchants, acquired 74 stores from the big German retail
group Spar Handels AG, adding to the 21-store Wertkauf GmbH chain
it acquired a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart now threatens to change Europe's shopping culture as
well, analysts said. Cutting prices on everything from clothes and
car parts to food and toys, Wal-Mart already has unleashed brutal
price wars in Germany in the 12 months since the Wertkauf
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart's strategy and unique ability to provide low prices
and service will transform the retail landscape over time in
Europe,'' Jeff Feiner, retailing analyst in New York for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Spar acquisition catapults Wal-Mart to the fourth biggest
discounter in Germany, mushrooming the number of such stores in
Germany from zero to nearly 100 in under a year, Feiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of retailing is changing, and the customer is
winning in the long-term,'' said Bob Martin, president of
Wal-Mart's international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day I hope we can serve a good deal of Europe,'' Martin
said. ``Europe is open across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Criado-Perez, senior vice president of Wal-Mart
International, said, ``We are looking for any open door that could
open in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Wal-Mart's strategy has won new customers and increased
sales, the company will change the names on both of its German
chains to Wal-Mart, starting next year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest Wal-Mart expansion, German retailers have
been forced on the defensive. German-based Metro AG, Europe's
largest retailer, last month decided to sell a third of its
businesses in a dramatic measure to help it compete with Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Because Metro is the world's second-biggest retailer behind
Wal-Mart, the latest acquisition raises the stakes in what has
become one of the most fierce corporate rivalries in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart cut prices ``across the whole assortment'' of
everything on offer at Wertkauf, said Ron Tiarks, president of
Wal-Mart's German operations. It will continue to ``drive costs out
of the business'' in its German stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   German retailers also have suffered a six-year slump, and the
price wars only add to their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   German shopkeepers, who long have enjoyed the protection of
competition barriers, now see those under threat by Wal-Mart.
Although German shopping hours are strictly regulated, Wal-Mart has
managed to extend its hours without violating regulations by
opening earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In May, it began to open its Wertkauf stores at 7 A.M. instead
of the German convention of 9 A.M., which has found ``an excellent
customer response'' and increased business, said Rom Tiarks,
president of Wal-Mart's German operations.
</P>
<P>
   German merchants already complain their costs will rise if they
are forced to hire more staff to lengthen store hours and
simultaneously add staff to compensate for Wal-Mart's emphasis on
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   And because Wal-Mart saves costs by buying in bulk, each new
acquisition adds to potential new pressure on European merchants.
</P>
<P>
   For its own European buying binge, Wal-Mart refused to specify
where it will strike next. Analysts suspect that Wal-Mart will seek
an acquisition in France, with Promodes SA mentioned as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers suggest that Wal-Mart has its eyes on other
German discounters like Aldi Einkauf GmbH and Lidl &AMP; Schwarz GmbH
along with Austrian retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic about a long-term engagement for Europe; it
is a very attractive place,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which has over 2,800 discount stores in its home
market in the United States, has been expanding internationally. It
also has stores in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
China and South Korea. &QL;

WINDS KNOCK OUT POWER IN LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN   AND JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Powerful Santa Ana winds blew across Southern
California on Wednesday, toppling trees, littering streets and
knocking down power lines, leaving thousands in Los Angeles without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   With humidity low and winds as high as 76 mph in the San Gabriel
Mountains, 69 mph in suburban Calabasas and 58 mph in Malibu,
firefighters were on critical-level alerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern California is a tinder box and we're never really out
of danger,'' said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian
Humphrey. ``We are certainly ready to move in a moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Glendale battled a wind-whipped blaze in the
steep Hillcrest Avenue area Wednesday afternoon, and downed power
lines were blamed for two small brush fires in La Canada Flintridge
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Those fires burned about an acre of grass at 7:50 a.m. About 100
firefighters had them out by 8:13 a.m., said Inspector Henry
Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a high-wind warning for the
entire region through today.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anas are caused by high pressure building up from the
Great Basin, including Idaho, Nevada and the western parts of Utah,
said Dennis Tussey, a meteorologist for the Weather Service in
Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The high winds snapped trees like toothpicks, temporarily
blocking lanes of traffic in suburban Burbank and Woodland Hills,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunland, a one-acre grass fire reported at 12:45 p.m. at
Mount Gleason and Big Tujunga Canyon roads &UR;  &LR; was out in 13 minutes,
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. The cause was
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   City and county fire departments Wednesday declared red-flag
alerts -- a warning issued when winds hit 25 mph or higher and
humidity levels dip below 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of November, city fire officials called an end to the
wildfire season because of rains.
</P>
<P>
   With the Santa Anas back, officials predeployed extra equipment
and firefighters to the more volatile areas in the San Fernando and
Santa Clarita areas.
</P>
<P>
   West Los Angeles Basin firefighters were sent to the Porter
Ranch, Sun Valley, Woodland Hills and Laurel Canyon areas, Humphrey
said. Teams from downtown were sent to Mission Hills, Sherman Oaks
and West Hills in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The highly flammable chaparral along the Santa Monica Mountains
from Griffith Park to Point Mugu is a particular concern, Humphrey
said.
</P>
<P>
   County fire officials also sent strike teams and equipment &UR;  &LR; to
Santa Clarita and Malibu, where winds gusted to 57 mph Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Malibu-Topanga chapter of the volunteer Community Arson
Watch went on full alert Wednesday, putting 40 monitors in the
field to watch for downed lines, spot fires and suspicious activity
in the Santa Monica Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any little fire when you have 40 or 50 mph winds going just
runs ahead of the fire department and you can't stop it,'' said the
group's coordinator, Allen Emerson. ``So we want to be able to jump
on it as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 4,000 customers were without power at 3 p.m. in
Tujunga, Woodland Hills, Eagle Rock, Hollywood and Los Feliz after
high winds snapped tree limbs that hit power lines, said Walter
Zeisl, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power.

   NEW YORK _ In the span of a generation, the most successful, or
top grossing, movies of the year have gone from films like
``Midnight Cowboy'' and ``The Godfather'' to ``Liar, Liar'' and
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the public taste sunk so low as to raise nary a hue and cry
about the abysmal quality of American popular culture?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has always promulgated American images and spread its
distinct view of American society throughout the world. Movies
exert the power they do because, to quote D.W. Griffith: ``The
motion picture is boundless in its scope and endless in its
possibilities. The world is its stage, and time without end its
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies intended for mass-market consumption have evolved over
the generations; post-World War II movie audiences became more
sophisticated than they had been in the past and were no longer
content with simplistic adventures, idealistic romances and
outmoded good-guys-versus-bad-guys tales.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of Auschwitz and the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki signaled the beginning of the end of the isolated idealism
of an earlier Hollywood. The war sobered Americans and gave them a
broader view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the complexity of character, the intricacy of
plot and the nuances of relationships that were ubiquitous in the
most popular and successful films 25 or 30 years ago are
extraordinarily rare in the current crop.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ``Godfather'' movies of the early 1970s were among the
top grossing films of those years. Francis Ford Coppola's first
``Godfather'' was not made for a select art-house constituency, yet
it is a brilliant study of ruthlessness and kindness, murder and
sentiment, violence and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the current entertainment climate, it is the rare movie
producer or director who regards the audience with the same respect
that Mr. Coppola and others of his ilk accorded the audiences of a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the top grossing films in the United States of the past
several years _ ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' ``Face/Off,'' ``Batman and Robin,'' ``George of
the Jungle,'' ``Independence Day'' _ there is remarkably little
impetus to think about complex issues of relationships, morality
and other existential topics.
</P>
<P>
   John Schlesinger's ``Midnight Cowboy'' was the third-highest
grossing movie of 1969 as well as that year's Academy-Award winner
for best picture and best director. It unflinchingly portrays an
aspect of the isolation and emptiness of contemporary urban life.
Yet for all the sordidness in this story of a male hustler, there
is caring and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   The darkening mood of the '60s, especially among young
Americans, and an angry, anti-establishment view may explain the
popularity of that era's thoughtful films.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional values were mocked, free expression was demanded and
youth identified with the anti-hero at odds with a social and
political system deemed corrupt and repressive. This search for
deeper meaning may have been reflected in movies that celebrated
outcasts and misfits.
</P>
<P>
   In that decade of racial upheaval, assassinations and a
counterculture of dissent, the moviegoing audience was satisfied
only by films exploring the subtleties of character, personal
choice and ethical scrutiny: ``Beckett,'' ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``The Lion
in Winter'' and ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
</P>
<P>
   In today's popular culture, a void is revealed by the endless
parade of comic-strip characters, superheroes, car chases,
explosions, witless comedies and hackneyed romances that is
currently the norm.
</P>
<P>
   America's most popular form of entertainment, which sets a
standard around the globe, has changed from an artistic medium to a
special-effects contest.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will always be made for discerning audiences who think
seriously about a film's theme, story or performance. One such film
is Atom Egoyan's ``The Sweet Hereafter'' (1997), which tells the
wrenching story of the effect on a small town of a school bus
accident that kills 14 children. Grieving parents and survivors,
and the town's secrets, are portrayed uncompromisingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite much critical praise, and Mr. Egoyan's nomination
for Academy Awards for writing and directing the film, its gross
receipts in the United States have by no means made it a huge
financial success.
</P>
<P>
   While in recent years movies such as ``Schindler's List,'' ``The
English Patient,'' ``Lone Star'' and ``Shine'' have not reached the
financial peak of, say, ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' that they
achieved the success they did may offer a glimmer of hope for those
of us who are despairing over the dumbing down of America. &QL;

   HIROSHIMA, Japan _ When Mazda Motor Corp. appointed its first
non-Japanese president in 1996 the reaction of some Japanese was as
if the ``Black Ships'' of Commodore Matthew Perry had docked at
Hiroshima and seized control of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. had just increased its stake in Mazda to 33.4
percent from 24.5 percent, and making Henry Wallace, a Scotsman
seconded to Mazda from Ford, seemed to Japanese nationalists the
beginning of the end for a proud company founded in Hiroshima in
1920.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with a second non-Japanese from Ford as new
president, the remarkable turnaround of Japan's fifth-largest auto
maker has banished such dark thoughts in a dazzle of its
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Giant Nissan Motor Co. posted a parent net loss of 32.5 billion
yen ($217 million) for the six months ending Sept. 30, down 71
billion yen from the same period in 1997, has sold its head office
in Tokyo's swank Ginza district, and sought public funds from the
Japan Development Bank to winch it out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda has swung into the fast lane. Net income of the parent
company for the first half was 5.5 billion yen, up 4.9 billion yen;
and on a consolidated basis for the whole Mazda group, 8.5 billion
yen, an increase of 18.2 billion yen. This was achieved in the
teeth of economic recession in most of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where auto sales are at their lowest level since 1985,
Mazda slightly increased its market share to 5.8 percent. It also
sold more vehicles in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to Gary Hexter, a Ford executive with Mazda
since 1994 and now a senior managing director and its chief
financial officer, is that Mazda can comfortably finance its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat here in 1994, we saw a parent company debt level
of a little over 580 billion yen, and in a relatively short period
of time, in 1998 and 1999, we saw almost 200 billion yen of bonds
maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a scenario unfolded where we couldn't fix the business as
quickly as we hoped, if we couldn't generate cash to the level
required, if there were a change in the liquidity situation in
Japan, we would be in serious, serious trouble as a corporation,''
recalls Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``So almost the first thing we did was to focus on cash-flow
management and debt reduction. This was an emphasis that
historically did not exist at Mazda, and at many other Japanese and
Asian companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowing rates were low; credit was readily available; and so
people tended to have the ability to very rapidly borrow their way
into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wallace and new Mazda President James Miller, who is also
from Ford, have occupied the limelight, insiders give most credit
for rebuilding Mazda's finances to 54-year-old Hexter, an
Australian apostle of Ford's ``bottom line'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Mazda, Hexter was based at Ford headquarters in
Detroit, and from 1991 to 1993 was instrumental in halting the cash
hemorrhage at Jaguar, the famous British luxury car maker purchased
by Ford in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hexter cautions against comparing Jaguar, ``a relatively small
operation'' which bottomed at 22,000 units a year in 1991, ``with a
company as large and complex as Mazda.'' He acknowledges, however,
that they both had ``excellent engineering'' and ``severe financial
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda also possesses the ability, ``consistent with many
Japanese companies,'' of bringing a new model from concept to
production in less time, and with ``substantially less'' financial
investment than Hexter had ``previously experienced,'' together
with a ``tremendously loyal, capable work force, supported by an
excellent union.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was unimpressed, however, by the freedom allowed Mazda's
engineers to indulge their dreams, rather than responding to what
most customers wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's long and costly love-affair with the ``revolutionary''
rotary engine in the 1970s and 1980s yielded a trove of patents,
but is now solely used in the RX-7 that sells only in small volume
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's nifty Roadster (sold as the MX-5 in Europe, and Miata in
the United States), was eulogized recently by the editor of Car
magazine as ``the world's most commendable open-top sports car,''
but as Hexter points out, ``you can't build a company on a niche
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The more conventional and less exciting 626/Capella ``global
car'' and the compact Demio, both introduced in 1996-97, are part
of a new strategy to ensure that Mazda has a ``good and strong
presence in the key segments of the market,'' says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   He traces Mazda's near-nemesis in the 1990s to an ill-conceived
``Five Sales Channel Strategy'' it launched at the start of the
asset-inflated boom of the 1980s to expand its volume worldwide,
especially in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded the number of its models to match the
multiplication of new sales channels for different types of car,
and built a new Mazda factory in Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and in
a joint venture with Ford, a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that led to a substantial amount of capital investment,
and added significantly to Mazda's fixed costs. Mazda had seven
consecutive years of negative cash flow, and debt almost tripled,''
says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the investment went in, all the cost was added, and with
the bursting of the bubble economy in Japan, and rapid decline in
(sales) volumes, Mazda never achieved the sales to justify the
original investment.
</P>
<P>
   That was compounded by a number of products that were less than
successful, which further exacerbated the problem of declining
industry sales. The net result was that in the year ended March 31,
1994, Mazda lost about 44 billion yen as a parent company.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda had also had structural weaknesses peculiar to large,
non-holding Japanese corporations: numerous affiliates and
subsidiaries with ``poor financial results and fairly high levels
of debt,'' and a large portfolio of shares held in other
companies. &QL;

ABE HIRSCHFELD INDICTED IN PLOT TO KILL BUSINESS PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abe Hirschfeld, the New York real estate developer,
millionaire and perennially aspiring politician, has been indicted
by a Manhattan grand jury in connection with a plot to kill his
longtime business partner, his lawyer said on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Theodore Kupferman, said that Hirschfeld planned to
turn himself in on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment centers on allegations that Hirschfeld tried in
late 1996 to arrange the contract killing of Stanley Stahl, a real
estate magnate with whom he was involved in a bitter feud and a
``survivor take all'' agreement covering several properties they
held jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, 79, and Stahl, 73, were partners in numerous
business ventures for decades, but have been engaged in acrimonious
civil litigation since 1993, when Hirschfeld sued Stahl, claiming
he had an ``unlawful bias against renting to blacks'' in three of
their buildings. Stahl denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Kupferman said he did not know the specific charge against
Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld did not return a call to his office on Wednesday, and
his home number is unlisted. But in interviews with several
television stations on Wednesday night, he denied the allegations.
``Everybody knows that I can't kill a fly,'' he told WWOR-TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld told WWOR that he had testified before a grand jury
for six hours two weeks ago, and that law enforcement officials
possessed a tape recording of a telephone conversation between him
and two men who were allegedly participants in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld said that the two men were collaborating to kill
Stahl. ``I told them I'm not paying nothing, I have no interest in
killing him, and I hanged up,'' Hirschfeld said in the television
interview. ``They seriously thought they were doing it for my
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not known that his telephone was being tapped,
nor did he call the police about the possible threat to Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I call the police?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview with WABC-TV, Hirschfeld implied that he
had been blackmailed: ``They had the guys call and said if you
won't give us half a million dollars to kill Stahl, we will notify
the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Stahl came to no harm. A law enforcement official said last year
that Hirschfeld had pulled out of the deal after an intermediary he
was using to arrange the killing _ and to whom he had paid a
substantial amount of money _ was roughed up by someone who may
have been a killer's contact. The intermediary had become a
cooperating witness, the official said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who the two people are in the tape-recorded
conversation Hirschfeld referred to, but Kupferman said the content
had been misconstrued, and that Hirschfeld, who made much of his
fortune developing parking lots, was talking to the two men about
finishing work on a parking garage. When Hirschfeld made a comment
like ``You didn't do what you were supposed to do,'' Kupferman
said, it was being wrongly interpreted as meaning the men had not
murdered Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking to them about a garage, and some people
misinterpreted the conversation,'' Kupferman said. ``He was talking
about they didn't finish the garage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupferman called Hirschfeld, who was born in Poland and
emigrated from Israel to the United States in his mid-30s, and
Stahl, the son of a Brooklyn butcher, ``one odd couple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't try to kill the other; they just keep arguing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, who is already facing charges that he avoided paying
state taxes for seven years, is a colorful figure in New York: he
has run quixotic and expensive campaigns for Congress, and
Manhattan borough president, among other offices, and had a brief
and stormy tenure as publisher of The New York Post. He recently
offered to pay Paula Jones $1 million to drop her lawsuit against
President Clinton.

STARS RELIEVED WITH TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ken Hitchcock admits he made a strategic mistake in his
handling of defenseman Darryl Sydor this season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Stars coach moved Sydor to left wing on two separate
occasions for extended periods, Sydor seemed to struggle when he
tried to move back to his regular spot on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screwed him up,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   After last night's performance, however, Hitchcock said that
Sydor is back on defense to stay. The 26-year-old, who was an
All-Star participant last season, had a goal and two assists to
lead the Stars to a come-from-behind 3-3 tie with the San Jose
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 15-5-4 with the tie and fall one point behind
the Phoenix Coyotes in the Pacific Division. The Coyotes were 4-2
winners against the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   With the three points, Sydor is tied with Larry Murphy of the
Detroit Red Wings for the NHL lead in defenseman scoring at 21
points. Sydor's eight goals are second on the Stars to Jere
Lehtinen's nine, and his points trail only Mike Modano's 24 on the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of confidence both offensively and
defensively,'' teammate Craig Ludwig said. ``He's skating well and
he knows he can take chances, because he has the speed to come back
and cover for it if the puck is going the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor simply calls it good solid defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to play sound in my own end,'' he said. ``The
points will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydor's effort helped the Stars overcome a horrendous first
period and survive with a tie that was needed after a long road
trip. After arriving Tuesday at 4 a.m. from Calgary, the Stars
looked as if they had jet lag in the opening frame. They trailed
3-1 after the first period and were obviously outplayed by the
Sharks, who are 5-13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock stepped in and delivered a heated sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can say any of it on the air,'' winger Jamie
Langenbrunner confided to the media's microphones after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then responded with another spirited second period as
they scored twice on the power play en route to a 3-for-5 night
with the man advantage. The Stars have outscored opponents 31-9 in
the second period this season and lead the NHL in power play goals
with 30.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor slipped his goal-scoring shot through the legs of Sharks
goalie Mike Vernon after a great setup off a faceoff win by Joe
Nieuwendyk. Sydor was given a clear path to the net after
Nieuwendyk won maybe his biggest draw in a night when he went 20-1
in the faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk also had a hand in the second power-play goal as he
and Tony Hrkac were setting screens in front of Vernon on a Sydor
shot. Hrkac ended up tipping the puck for his fourth goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor's other assist came on a first-period power-play goal by
Lehtinen. That was about the only good thing to come out of the
first period as the offensively-struggling Sharks, who came into
the game with the league's fewest goals, scored three times.
Patrick Marleau started things with a 4-on-3 power play goal at the
3:57 mark. Owen Nolan was credited with a gift goal after Stars
defenseman Derian Hatcher tipped a pass past Stars goalie Ed
Belfour at the 12:18 mark. And Mike Ricci scored just 28 seconds
before the first period ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the road, we knew we were going to be in trouble,''
Hitchcock said of the first period. ``But I thought this was a good
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars matched the Sharks' energy for the remainder of the
game and both teams played a third period worthy of a playoff game.
It was the fifth time the two teams have met this season (the Stars
are 3-1-1 in those games) and there was plenty of familiarity
between the players. That led to some borderline hits on both
sides, some great scoring chances and tremendous goaltending by
veterans Belfour and Vernon before the game was called a draw after
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And while critics might say there was nothing decided on the
scoreboard, Hitchcock said he has made a decision on Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I flipped him back and forth there _ as much as it helped
the team at that time, it probably hurt Syd,'' Hitchcock said. ``I
think he's back on now.''

   HIROSHIMA, Japan _ When Mazda Motor Corp. appointed its first
non-Japanese president in 1996 the reaction of some Japanese was as
if the ``Black Ships'' of Commodore Matthew Perry had docked at
Hiroshima and seized control of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. had just increased its stake in Mazda to 33.4
percent from 24.5 percent, and making Henry Wallace, a Scotsman
seconded to Mazda from Ford, seemed to Japanese nationalists the
beginning of the end for a proud company founded in Hiroshima in
1920.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with a second non-Japanese from Ford as new
president, the remarkable turnaround of Japan's fifth-largest auto
maker has banished such dark thoughts in a dazzle of its
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Giant Nissan Motor Co. posted a parent net loss of 32.5 billion
yen ($217 million) for the six months ending Sept. 30, down 71
billion yen from the same period in 1997, has sold its head office
in Tokyo's swank Ginza district, and sought public funds from the
Japan Development Bank to winch it out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda has swung into the fast lane. Net income of the parent
company for the first half was 5.5 billion yen, up 4.9 billion yen;
and on a consolidated basis for the whole Mazda group, 8.5 billion
yen, an increase of 18.2 billion yen. This was achieved in the
teeth of economic recession in most of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where auto sales are at their lowest level since 1985,
Mazda slightly increased its market share to 5.8 percent. It also
sold more vehicles in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to Gary Hexter, a Ford executive with Mazda
since 1994 and now a senior managing director and its chief
financial officer, is that Mazda can comfortably finance its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat here in 1994, we saw a parent company debt level
of a little over 580 billion yen, and in a relatively short period
of time, in 1998 and 1999, we saw almost 200 billion yen of bonds
maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a scenario unfolded where we couldn't fix the business as
quickly as we hoped, if we couldn't generate cash to the level
required, if there were a change in the liquidity situation in
Japan, we would be in serious, serious trouble as a corporation,''
recalls Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``So almost the first thing we did was to focus on cash-flow
management and debt reduction. This was an emphasis that
historically did not exist at Mazda, and at many other Japanese and
Asian companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowing rates were low; credit was readily available; and so
people tended to have the ability to very rapidly borrow their way
into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wallace and new Mazda President James Miller, who is also
from Ford, have occupied the limelight, insiders give most credit
for rebuilding Mazda's finances to 54-year-old Hexter, an
Australian apostle of Ford's ``bottom line'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Mazda, Hexter was based at Ford headquarters in
Detroit, and from 1991 to 1993 was instrumental in halting the cash
hemorrhage at Jaguar, the famous British luxury car maker purchased
by Ford in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hexter cautions against comparing Jaguar, ``a relatively small
operation'' which bottomed at 22,000 units a year in 1991, ``with a
company as large and complex as Mazda.'' He acknowledges, however,
that they both had ``excellent engineering'' and ``severe financial
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda also possesses the ability, ``consistent with many
Japanese companies,'' of bringing a new model from concept to
production in less time, and with ``substantially less'' financial
investment than Hexter had ``previously experienced,'' together
with a ``tremendously loyal, capable work force, supported by an
excellent union.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was unimpressed, however, by the freedom allowed Mazda's
engineers to indulge their dreams, rather than responding to what
most customers wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's long and costly love-affair with the ``revolutionary''
rotary engine in the 1970s and 1980s yielded a trove of patents,
but is now solely used in the RX-7 that sells only in small volume
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's nifty Roadster (sold as the MX-5 in Europe, and Miata in
the United States), was eulogized recently by the editor of Car
magazine as ``the world's most commendable open-top sports car,''
but as Hexter points out, ``you can't build a company on a niche
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The more conventional and less exciting 626/Capella ``global
car'' and the compact Demio, both introduced in 1996-97, are part
of a new strategy to ensure that Mazda has a ``good and strong
presence in the key segments of the market,'' says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   He traces Mazda's near-nemesis in the 1990s to an ill-conceived
``Five Sales Channel Strategy'' it launched at the start of the
asset-inflated boom of the 1980s to expand its volume worldwide,
especially in Japan.

   Mazda's nifty Roadster (sold as the MX-5 in Europe, and Miata in
the United States), was eulogized recently by the editor of Car
magazine as ``the world's most commendable open-top sports car,''
but as Hexter points out, ``you can't build a company on a niche
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The more conventional and less exciting 626/Capella ``global
car'' and the compact Demio, both introduced in 1996-97, are part
of a new strategy to ensure that Mazda has a ``good and strong
presence in the key segments of the market,'' says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   He traces Mazda's near-nemesis in the 1990s to an ill-conceived
``Five Sales Channel Strategy'' it launched at the start of the
asset-inflated boom of the 1980s to expand its volume worldwide,
especially in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded the number of its models to match the
multiplication of new sales channels for different types of car,
and built a new Mazda factory in Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and in
a joint venture with Ford, a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that led to a substantial amount of capital investment,
and added significantly to Mazda's fixed costs. Mazda had seven
consecutive years of negative cash flow, and debt almost tripled,''
says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the investment went in, all the cost was added, and with
the bursting of the bubble economy in Japan, and rapid decline in
(sales) volumes, Mazda never achieved the sales to justify the
original investment.
</P>
<P>
   That was compounded by a number of products that were less than
successful, which further exacerbated the problem of declining
industry sales. The net result was that in the year ended March 31,
1994, Mazda lost about 44 billion yen as a parent company.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda had also had structural weaknesses peculiar to large,
non-holding Japanese corporations: numerous affiliates and
subsidiaries with ``poor financial results and fairly high levels
of debt,'' and a large portfolio of shares held in other
companies. &QL;

GUSTY WINDS CUT SWATHE THROUGH L.A. PSYCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As hot, dry Santa Ana winds whipped through Los
Angeles on Wednesday, they stirred up more than fire danger and
dust devils: Anxiety reigned, headaches flared and sinuses clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Some people became unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to this emotional mayhem was the constant, unpredictable
threat of physical danger: A 30-acre fire burned in hills above
Glendale, a suburban community north of Los Angeles, briefly
threatening homes on the 10th anniversary of a blaze that destroyed
15 houses in the San Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch. The winds
toppled trucks, ripped signs, downed power lines and fanned small
fires across Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``devil winds'' are expected to remain through the
afternoon today.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days like this the anxiety curve accelerates, people's
minds are racing, their senses are on red alert and they burn up
adrenaline,'' said Glendale clinical psychologist Kim Shirin, who
added that our social values teach us to keep control of our world
and focus on completing daily tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the winds come, we realize we don't have control of our
world, so people need to spend . . . time relaxing and being
grounded, and they need to do it periodically through the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that the Santa Ana winds possess the same
curious power as a full moon, to which some law enforcement
officials attribute increases in strange crimes during that point
in the lunar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we do it in the frenzy called Los Angeles? How about a
therapeutic massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a huge influx of walk-in customers and phone
calls,'' said Maria Montoya-Kaye, an employee at Massage Masters in
suburban Sherman Oaks. ``People are complaining of headaches and
back spasms and sinus problems. We've got 70 customers booked today
when the average is about 45 -- it's like the full moon effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Minnehan, 24, of nearby Encino found temporary peace in a
mocha java and a menthol cigarette. He took the day off from his
auto-repair job to avoid the frustrations of working in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . It would just be too tough to work,'' Minnehan said,
standing in an alcove outside a Starbucks coffee shop in Encino.
``It's a better day for a jacket and a good cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-boiled crime novelist Raymond Chandler wrote of these devil
winds as enough to make your nerves jump. ``On nights like that,
every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge
of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While reality might not always be that extreme, experts agree
the key to keeping sane on these wild, windy days is to learn how
to relax; like director David Lynch wrote into the ``Twin Peaks''
television series: ``Every day, once a day, give yourself a
present.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Southern California professor Henry Gong Jr. said
people who work outside or have allergies probably should stay
indoors when the Santa Anas come. On such days, Los Angeles
residents are exposed to desert allergens and particles that they
don't normally experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies indicate that on the Westside, small particles get
inhaled and can cause inflammation of asthma, hay fever and
pneumonia,'' Gong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, people's moods can alter and in severe cases they
could go to the emergency room. It's good to stay inside if
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The same also might be said about braving the weather to get a
haircut and styling.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the belief that the winds might whip hair into a
frenzy, those gusts can become an integral part of your fashion
statement, said Richard Glen, a stylist at Juan A Salon in Sherman
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more wind-blown your hair is, the more beautiful it is,''
Glen said. ``We make sure we do more layering and tell people to
keep a bottle of hair spray with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday wasn't as relaxing for Christmas tree lot workers
dealing with droves of downed timber and tents. But one manager in
the San Fernando Valley's Woodland Hills remained optimistic about
his operation and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, as long as you've got the Christmas spirit, shopping for
a tree can be fun at any time,'' said Andy Santiago, manager of Mr.
Christmas Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we've got two huge tents here that let people shop
during rain, sleet or snow.''
</P>
<P>
   On the law enforcement front, California Highway Patrol Officer
Dwight McDonald said tensions on the road can become heightened
with flying debris and aggravation from other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to be patient, slow down and allow more time to
get to their destination,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could be blowing off of houses, or off the sides of
hills, so drivers need to also anticipate those problems and be
mindful of their surroundings.''

TAGLIABUE SHOULD CALL SCHRAMM FOR HELP, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One question for Mr. Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Why stop with Jerry Jones when you also could and should bring
back Tex Schramm?
</P>
<P>
   Funny, huh, how this stuff works? The NFL has itself a public
credibility crisis brewing because of an outbreak of officiating
goofs during games.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue seeks help by reaching for the phone
and dialing the 972 area code, meaning Irving. Tag-Man now wants
Jones next to him in the foxhole. Just a few short years ago, these
two were slapping each other around with lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with America's sports' media also seeking answers to
current NFL problems, the phone is ringing constantly at a home in
the 214 area code, meaning Dallas. Schramm lives there.
</P>
<P>
   There are people in the NFL of today who don't like Jones _ in
fact, that line would stretch all the way to Texarkana.
</P>
<P>
   There were people in the NFL of yesteryear who didn't like
Schramm. Way too much power, they thought, with then commissioner
Pete Rozelle.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jones and Schramm reside near each other, dinner dates
have never been exchanged in the 10 years since their hello-goodbye
at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Once Schramm was gone from the Cowboys and the NFL, an
executive-level leadership void developed that has never been
filled.
</P>
<P>
   What Schramm brought to the league was a strong personality, a
fertile and imaginative football mind, combined with a fierce and
protective love of the NFL. Texas E. Schramm never played the game
beyond his high school days in San Gabriel, Calif. But he was and
still is a ``football guy'' to the core, with modern on-the-field
ideas respected and accepted by the likes of Lombardi, Halas,
Shula, Paul Brown, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to Schramm among the NFL hierarchy of today?
Don't look now, but it's probably Jerry Jones. No, he's not in
Schramm's esteemed league, but he's the pick of a runt litter, so
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tagliabue turned to Jones this week, asking him, in
an unprecedented move, to be a December addition to be the NFL's
powerful Competition Committee. Tagliabue desperately needs
leadership as he plunges ahead with the sudden idea of adding an
instant-replay mechanism to supplement officiating during the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is a former Competition Committee member. This group, more
than the commissioner's office, is the actual governing body of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It says plenty about the current seven-member CC that Tagliabue
is calling in Jones. The commissioner needs a go-getter and doesn't
believe he has one in place.
</P>
<P>
   What does it also say when Schramm's phone won't stop ringing?
The media want to hear an expert opinion on instant replay and the
other ills of the NFL. Schramm's views are still respected, I'd say
far more than anyone in the current NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reason, I like to hear the phone,'' said Schramm
yesterday. ``I don't like sitting around on my butt, doing
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   At 78, Schramm remains sharp and in tune with the NFL. Elected
to the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, because of his contributions
to the league, Schramm would be a perfect wild-card member to
today's Competition Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Schramm is he always has more questions than
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy,'' he said, ``is to think of ideas, and then go
seek answers from a multitude of experts on how to best get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Schramm was the original chairman of the Competition Committee
and held the office for 25 years. His first committee members were
the threesome of Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown and Al Davis. Oh, to be
a fly on the wall in those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm is the daddy of instant replay, and is extremely irked
it didn't work right the first time. He strongly blames the
implementation, not the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The sideline radios in quarterback helmets? It was once
controversial, but now no one notices. That was Schramm's idea. So
were quicker games, where a 45-second play clock (now 40) started
immediately after the whistle blew on the previous play.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I also pushed for the elimination of the huddle,''
Schramm said. ``The huddle is useless and time-consuming. You could
run 20 additional plays a game. Maybe more.''
</P>

   Ralph Wilson, the owner of the Bills, went on a tirade against
Tagliabue and NFL officiating last week. Wilson charged there was
no longer an emphasis on football in the NFL, but on the bottom
line instead.

   Schramm said it best: ``This is now a league built around
marketing. It used to be a league built around the product on the
field. Marketing ain't worth a damn if you don't have the right
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tagliabue, you need to be hearing that. And often.

finding the latest last-minute purchase on the Web. On-line holiday
purchases are expected to double from last year, according to Nick

Ralph Lauren sweater, a Pioneer car radio, a Burton snowboard or
even the latest Beanie Baby from Ty Inc. will search high and low
in cyberspace without, in most cases, finding them. The reason?

   NY-FINANCIAL-DISTRICT (New York) _ At 8:30 on a Saturday night,
the holiday shooting stars suspended above Nassau Street are aglow,
illuminating blocks of rolled-down aluminum security shutters.
There are no coffee shops still open, no magazine shops, no bars _
and even more strikingly _ there are no people. ``When I moved in
last February, there was supposed to be a grocery store coming,''
said Tracey White, looking back pointedly at the still-black

   BLECKNER-BENEFIT (New York) _ ``I never invite people over _
it's so anxiety-producing,'' Ross Bleckner said, contemplating the
imminent arrival of 120 guests, many of them uptown swells who had
paid $1,000 for the privilege of climbing six flights of stairs for
cocktails and dinner with the celebrated artist. An avowed recluse
who resists forays north of Union Square, Bleckner was the host of
a benefit last week for Community Research Initiative on AIDS in

   TENEMENT-MUSEUM (New York) _ For the descendants of Abraham and
Fannie Rogarshevsky, history came between the dill pickles and the
corned beef sandwiches. Family memories, some of them coaxed over
lunch, have been vital in recreating the Rogarshevskys' vibrant,
three-room Orchard Street apartment, circa 1918, a permanent
exhibit at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. It is the fifth

tenement. By Patricia Lee Brown.

Pilot in lizard or saddle leather is part of the fervid culture
that has grown up around this digital record keeper, calendar,

   NY-WINTER-GARDEN (New York) _ After a visitor the clatter of
miniature electric trains and the Christmas tree with twinkle
lights that tickles the glass roof of the Enid Haupt Conservatory
came the moment of truth. ``It smells like winter out here,'' said
Ashali Bhandari, 7, of Manhattan. It should have: she was looking
at the winter solstice garden at the New York Botanical Garden in
the Bronx. By Mac Griswold.

DIFFERENCE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SHRINKS

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And here we thought the NCAA Tournament was unpredictable. The
double U factor _ Upset Uncertainty _ has seeped out of March and
into the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Arizona wins at Arizona State, Florida Atlantic wins at
Oklahoma State, Murray State wins at Oklahoma, Stephen F. Austin
wins at Texas Tech (note to Big 12 Conference: You don't have to
work so hard contributing to this trend).
</P>
<P>
   College basketball's Little Guys have grown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful for all schools of our size to do what Florida
Atlantic did,'' Valparaiso coach Homer Drew said about the Owls'
victory at Oklahoma State. ``It gives everyone an opportunity. It
brings the excitement back to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew's Valparaiso team might have started the trend last March
with their inspirational trip to the Sweet 16. And while Drew's son
Bryce is no longer the team's star, Valpo is 8-1 this season going
into tomorrow night's game at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening? The scholarship limitations continue to
spread the talent. More schools have more players.
</P>
<P>
   And, the teams being upset are not college basketball's royalty.
Kentucky has victories against Eastern Kentucky and Mercer;
Connecticut has defeated Quinnipiac and Hartford; Duke has beaten
Fairfield and South Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between No. 25 and No. 310 in Division I is
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask College of Charleston. Two years ago, the Cougars were
an NCAA Tournament darkhorse. The school from South Carolina's Old
South city upset Maryland in the first round before losing to
eventual champion Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Charleston returned five starters and moved up in
class to the Southern Conference. On Dec. 1, the Cougars beat
Massachusetts, a preseason Top 25 team. Last Saturday, they upset
No. 3 North Carolina in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. We know what this means,'' said Danny Johnson, a
senior guard who made the winning shot to beat the Tar Heels. ``I'm
from North Carolina, so I know all about the school's tradition,
with all the national championships and everything. For a team like
College of Charleston to come in and upset them is great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to shine and produce was certainly a stage we needed
on this occasion,'' Charleston coach John Kresse said. ``Programs
are made and schools are made because of victories of this
nature.''  &LR; tagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817) 390-7238

IN THE LANE
HOGS ROOT FOR TITLE RINGS The football team has had a marvelous,
surprising season that will end in a New Year's Day bowl. Now,
Arkansas' basketball team is hoping that it can reach back and
revive some of the glory of days past.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks (6-2) have a solid team that is led by three
seniors _ guards Pat Bradley and Kareem Reid and forward Derek
Hood. None of those players was involved with the Arkansas teams
that won the national championship in 1994 and finished second in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since then, the Razorbacks have yet to win a
championship. Not a Southeastern Conference West Division title nor
an SEC tournament title. Every player recruited by coach Nolan
Richardson who has stayed for four seasons at Arkansas has won at
least one championship.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who turns 57 this month, says he doesn't figure
he'll coach beyond 60. But while he keeps hinting at retirement, he
doesn't want to quit just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win another national championship before I retire,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Arkansas' three seniors, earning a championship ring _ what
kind doesn't matter _ is what this season is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Arkansas, teams are measured by the championships they've
won,'' said Bradley, the team's 3-point shooting threat. ``We want
to win a championship before we leave here. We don't want to be
known as the senior class that didn't win one.''
</P>
<P>
   The past three seasons, Bradley, Reid and Hood have played for
Arkansas teams that have won 62 games, played in two NCAA
Tournaments and made it to the NIT Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas figures to be the top team in the SEC West, which has
been dominated by Mississippi the past two seasons. Last season,
the Razorbacks fell apart down the stretch and watched the Rebels
erase a three-game deficit to win the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here three years, and we haven't tried on a ring
yet,'' Reid said. ``Last year, we had the ring in our hands and we
lost it. We're going to get the ring this year. If we don't, I'm
going to feel like we cheated the school and cheated ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   FREE THROWS
QUOTABLE
Utah coach Rick Majerus on his depleted team, which lost three
players _ including probable starter Britton Johnsen _ to two-year
church missions:
</P>
<P>
   ``If prayer counts, we should be winning games. But I don't know
if they're praying for us or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State guard Eddie House, who suffered a broken jaw Oct.
22 and spent about six weeks living on high-protein shakes, ice
cream and Cream of Wheat, on his first meal of a salad and two
cheeseburgers:
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to eat the salad first because my teeth and gums were
tender. Then I went straight for the burgers. Everything tastes
pretty good right now. I don't leave nothing on the plate
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   During its trip to Puerto Rico, UCLA wore black uniforms. Coach
Steve Lavin said the new unis were the players' idea and that they
could boost recruiting. Here's former UCLA coaching legend John
Wooden's opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter what I think, does it? I would have
stuck with the school colors. I don't think the inmates should run
be running the asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota coach Clem Haskins on 7-1 freshman center Joel
Przybilla, who is blocking five shots a game but whom Haskins
believes is not getting the breaks on officiating calls:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want officials to know that we have the premier shot
blocker in America. I don't want the officials to call any cheap
fouls on him just because he's 7-1 or because he's a freshman. Let
him play. . . . They need to let him block shots because Joel can
block shots. I want the officials to recognize that.''
BRIEFLY
Stanford reserve forward/guard Ryan Mendez, perhaps the Cardinal's
best outside shooter, could be out the rest of the month. Mendez,
from Burleson, is sidelined with a stress reaction in his right
knee, the same knee he had off-season surgery on to try to cure
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four seasons, Kansas is 43-6 in November and
December and 8-4 in NCAA Tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Houston plays at North Carolina State on Saturday. It's only the
second meeting between the teams since the Wolfpack upset the
Cougars in the 1983 national championship game. That was the last
collegiate game for current Houston coach Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes time to fill out your NCAA Tournament bracket for
the office poll, don't pencil in North Carolina or Syracuse for the
Final Four. Both are pretourney jinxed. The Tar Heels won the
Pre-Season NIT, the Orangemen the Maui Classic. Since 1989-90, none
of the 18 teams that has won either even made it to the Final Four
that season.

BLUE JAYS RECEIVE SATISFACTORY OFFER _ BUT NOT FROM RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Toronto Blue Jays, attempting to trade
right-hander Roger Clemens, received a proposal for the five-time
Cy Young Award recipient yesterday that ``satisfies our needs,''
general manager Gord Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   That trade proposal did not originate from Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   Ash yesterday spoke only to Melvin and New York Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman regarding Clemens, but the Blue Jays' general
manager later acknowledged the satisfactory proposal did not
originate from either of those organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros, New York Mets, Cleveland Indians and Anaheim
Angels remain in pursuit of Clemens, and the Colorado Rockies, Los
Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres also
could be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Ash plans to forward the proposal today to Clemens'
representatives, Alan and Randy Hendricks. Clemens, who resides in
the Houston area, informed the Blue Jays on Dec. 2 of his desire to
be traded to an organization closer to his home or a playoff
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess what I'm directing that club to do is make sure they
qualify,'' Ash said of Clemens' preference in locale. ``They had a
lot of questions for me that I couldn't answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, though, can veto any trade, empowering the 36-year-old
pitcher. Clemens, who will earn $8 and $8.1 million the next two
seasons, can force potential suitors to renegotiate his existing
contract _ in length and/or value _ before granting consent to any
trade made by Ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've suggested to that club,'' Ash said, ``is that they
get guidance from Roger's representatives on how they should
proceed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin returned from Toronto yesterday after meeting with Ash
for 90 minutes Tuesday afternoon and another hour yesterday morning
over breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a better sense of what they're looking for and had more
\Rdialogue\S than had I been doing it over the phone,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays seek three or four major-league players for
Clemens. This past weekend, Melvin called it ``very unlikely''
catcher Ivan Rodriguez or left fielder Rusty Greer would be
involved in the Rangers' proposal, and the Blue Jays' insistence on
receiving major-league talent likely rules out minor-league center
fielder Ruben Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez's contract contains a limited
no-trade clause that prevents him from being traded to the Blue
Jays, and first baseman Rafael Palmeiro's contract also includes a
no-trade clause. Shortstop Royce Clayton cannot be traded after
being signed this month as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Melvin few alternatives for trade proposals if the
Blue Jays seek young, major-league talent at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not want to part with right-hander Rick Helling,
and right-hander Aaron Sele's ability to become a free agent after
the 1999 season does not fit the Blue Jays' interests.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves right-hander Esteban Loaiza as a likely candidate to
be involved in the Rangers' proposal for Clemens. The Blue Jays
also seek power to replace designated hitter Jose Canseco, who
signed yesterday with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers designated hitter Lee Stevens, who earned only $1.2
million in base salary this past season, cannot become a free agent
until after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, would be required to offer more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern there when you're talking about giving up
that many players,'' Melvin said without reference to specific
players. ``You may be better on the days \RClemens\S pitches, but
you may not be better on the other 128 days when he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin appeared unsure whether the Rangers have a realistic
opportunity of acquiring Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really tell,'' he said. ``The problem is things can
change so fast, but our location keeps us in it. Our being a
contender keeps us in it.''
LEFTY TO TRIPLE A
The Rangers signed left-hander Rich Robertson yesterday and
assigned the 30-year-old pitcher to Triple-A Oklahoma of the
Pacific Coast League.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson made five appearances in relief for the Anaheim Angels
this past season and accumulated a 15.88 earned-run average during
those 5 2/3 innings. Robertson spent the remainder of the season
with Triple-A Vancouver of the PCL and went 11-12 with a 3.81 ERA
during 27 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson will compete for a berth in the Rangers' bullpen this
spring and earn $300,000 if he spends the entire season on the
25-man roster.

ODDS SLIM ON ROCKET LANDING IN ARLINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would have been the best Opening Day at The Ballpark in
Arlington since Van Cliburn played his grand piano at the inaugural
game back in 1994. It would have been the second coming of Nolan
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It might have even resulted in the first World Series in
Rangers' history.
</P>
<P>
   But we have to face facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballpark will not be The Rocket's next launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens will not be the Rangers' Opening Day starter next
April 5.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an official announcement, just a gut feeling based
on intuition, a little educated guesswork and reading between the
lines as the Clemens' affair has unfolded over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   These calculations have been computed by an experienced and
seasoned authority in hit-and-miss predictions. Do not attempt this
at home alone in a closed room or while imbibing anything stronger
than skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   This deduction has come despite Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin's impressive sneak attack on Toronto on Tuesday afternoon,
when he flew to Canada to meet with Blue Jays general manager Gord
Ash and personally deliver the Rangers' offer.
</P>
<P>
   You might have heard Ash's gales of laughter while hanging your
Christmas lights on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, there is no truth to the rumor that the
centerpiece of the Rangers' proposal was visiting clubhouse man Joe
Macko and a replacement knee surgery to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Like Juan Gonzalez, Pudge Rodriguez and Rusty Greer, Macko,
Rangers sources insist, has been deemed untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem. The Rangers had apparently hoped to
steal Clemens for the proverbial handful of beans. And they weren't
even throwing in the Beano.
</P>
<P>
   Here's who won't be traded:
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez: He has a limited no-trade clause that eliminates
Toronto as a possible future destination.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez: His agent, Jeff Moorad, left this polite, but pointed
little message on Ash's answering machine warning him that Pudge,
as is his right, will immediately demand a trade if he's sent to
the Blue Jays. Besides, he makes too much money for the Jays'
scaled-down budget.
</P>
<P>
   Greer: He fits every known Jays' criteria _ major-league tested,
relatively low salary, young and without enough service time to
force a trade, plus he's an offensive force _ but the Rangers adore
him for all the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in fresh signees Rafael Palmeiro and Royce Clayton, who
have new multiyear deals, and center fielder Tom Goodwin, too.
They're not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays don't want second baseman Mark McLemore or third
baseman Todd Zeile because both can be free agents after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   So, who does that leave for the Rangers to offer for Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   Minor-league outfield prospect Ruben Mateo? Not likely. He's a
year away and the Jays want help right now. Same with other
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won more games than anyone else in the American League in
the second half of the season,'' Melvin said. ``They believe they
can contend and they want players who can play at the major-league
level right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Deduction then leads us to left-handed hitting first baseman Lee
Stevens, right-handed hitting outfielder Mike Simms _ the Jays need
power _ and right-handed pitcher Esteban Loaiza, who has been
attracting interest from a number of teams.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of platoon DHs and a pitcher the Rangers hope can hold
down the No. 5 spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   You can imagine how bowled over Ash must have been, to have
Melvin fly 2,000 miles to lay that out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Rangers officials remain quietly confident they're in the
thick of the Clemens race, and why not? They've apparently survived
the first cut, from 16 interested teams to six.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Melvin and Ash have a long-standing relationship. Of
course, it could be that Gord appreciates Doug's sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, there must be more to this deal than this veteran
prognosticator can decipher, because without Rodriguez, without
Greer, without Mateo, I don't see how the Rangers have a prayer of
putting a better offer on the table than the Yankees, the Astros or
the Indians, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, reports last night indicated Ash had forwarded an
offer to Clemens' agent. It was not the one made by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   If Melvin is somehow slick enough, persuasive enough, to bring
Clemens to Arlington without doing major damage to his team, forget
Siegfried and Roy. The Rangers' GM will be the greatest magician in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \Rthe Clemens trade show\S is going to Nashville,''
Melvin said, referring to the resumption, after a long hiatus, of
baseball's winter meetings tomorrow in the country music capital of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   We wait then with bated breath.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, make our Opening Day.
</P>

USC ARRIVES LATE IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC trailing Loyola Marymount at halftime was
surprising enough. Then again, few probably realized the Trojans
hadn't trailed anyone this season after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was sloppy shooting or good defense, the Trojans shot
just 29 percent and were down by a point to the Lions, a fairly
embarrassing result for a USC team just starting to draw some
national attention.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the slow start, it did wonders for the
Trojans' intensity. They played their best half of the season and
outscored Loyola Marymount by 37 points for an eventually easy
79-43 victory over the Lions before 3,050 at the Sports Arena on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans (6-0) blistered the Lions in the second half,
outscoring them 50-13. Before USC coach Henry Bibby really cleared
his bench, USC had outscored Loyola Marymount, 43-5.
</P>
<P>
   So after three close victories over less-than-imposing
opponents, the Trojans finally enjoyed a blowout, even if it wasn't
that way in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in in the locker room and we shot real bad in the
first half,'' USC forward Brian Scalabrine said. ``I knew we
wouldn't do that another half.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. USC shot 59 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of we didn't make our shots early,''
Scalabrine said. ``We've just got to make our shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are off to their best start since going 8-0 in the
1974-75 season, heading to their big game Saturday night at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for USC's second-half blitz was guard Jeff
Trepagnier. The sophomore had a game-high 18 points, but more
impressively had a USC-record eight steals along with 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   He broke the record of seven steals set by Cameron Murray in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from watching the tapes that if they got trapped, they
would throw the ball anywhere,'' Trepagnier said. ``I just stepped
into the lanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier also blocked three shots, and has entrenched himself
as a starter, despite Bibby's penchant for changing the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything we haven't seen,'' Bibby said. ``Jeff is
playing consistent basketball. That's why he's in the starting
lineup. He's been great for us. We just need everybody else to play
at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount (3-4) was held to a season low in points, and
converted just five of 35 attempts in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense wasn't any different in the second half,'' Lions
coach Charles Bradley said. ``We're the ones who threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   USC had the same feeling about the first half. The Trojans
missed an extraordinary number of layups and easy shots, and for
the third straight home game, were in a neck-and-neck struggle with
a lesser team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to develop that pattern at all,'' Bibby said.
``We addressed that after the game. We can't wait until the second
half to set the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC forward Jarvis Turner needed stitches after the game,
after cutting his lip while intentionally fouling Loyola Marymount
guard Robert Davis. Also needing stitches was Trojans assistant
coach Dave Miller, who injured his lip when a ball hit him during
practice. Miller had a whistle in his mouth at the time, which
caused the injury.

TEXAS A&AMP;M COOKING WITH `FATS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M point guard Clifton Cook II has a ready answer to the
casual inquiry about how he acquired the nickname, ``Fats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tell people it's because my game is fat,'' Cook said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Howard College transfer has had a corpulent
impact on the Aggies, who improved to 7-1 by beating Tulane, 69-63,
last night at Reed Arena with Cook leading the way with 18 points.
A&AMP;M already has won as many games as it did all of last season and
is off to its best start since 1980-81. Going into last night's
game, Cook was averaging 14.7 points, 6.6 assists, 2.7 steals and
5.6 rebounds a game, in addition to shooting a respectable 39
percent from 3-point range. He has been honored as the Big 12's
rookie of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that has anything to do with the real origin of the
``Fats'' monicker, so says the man who bestowed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so overweight when he was a baby that he could barely
walk; he just kind of wobbled,'' recalled the senior Clifton Cook,
a real estate investor in the family's hometown of Dayton, Ohio.
``So, one day I called him a `big old fatso.' Everybody laughed and
the nickname stuck. His friends later shortened it to Fats. There
was a jingle we used to sing . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is enough about that, the younger Cook says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he begged me not to tell anybody about the jingle,'' Dad
said. ``Maybe after a while, he won't care.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is that the jingle for the time being remains locked in
the family vault of secrets. But Aggies coach Melvin Watkins has
another designation for his 6-foot-1 point-guard discovery:
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to imagine where we'd be without him,'' Watkins said.
``I hate to imagine taking him out of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook is a key ingredient in Watkins' rebuilding of a team that
lost its only semblance of a true point guard when Brian Barone
elected to transfer after Watkins replaced his father, Tony, as
A&AMP;M's coach in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clifton is a real point guard, and every team needs one,''
said Watkins, who played the position on a Final Four team as a
senior at North Carolina Charlotte. ``We're very fortunate to have
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were certainly lucky that Cook was available in April
after Watkins took the job. Kansas, Kansas State and TCU had shown
intense interest in Howard County's all-region player, who averaged
17 points, eight assists and four steals. Cook, however, remained
unsigned because he had not passed the TAAS test required of Texas
junior-college players in order for them to be eligible to play
Division I basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was unaware of Cook. But one of his first moves was to
hire then-TCU assistant Steve McClain. And though McClain stayed on
Watkins' staff for only a month before taking the head coaching job
at Wyoming, he left a valuable legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we definitely needed a point guard,'' Watkins said. ``I
immediately asked Steve who was still available, and Clifton was
the first name he brought up.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins set out for Big Spring and watched Cook play in a
pick-up game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it was only pick-up basketball, I saw two
things,'' Watkins said. ``Here was a kid who was advancing the
basketball and defending the basketball. I didn't know if he could
shoot or score. But I knew I wanted him because of those two
things. We were very fortunate to get a point guard of his caliber
so late. And the charisma he brings to this team just adds to his
value.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his reputation, Watkins' eye for talent proved true. And
Cook says he has found a kindred soul in his new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really fun playing for a coach who was a point guard,''
Cook said. ``We speak the same language. Sometimes I'm thinking
what he's thinking and sometimes he's thinking what I'm thinking.
We give each other ideas and we see things as one. He knows how to
get open, how plays should go and if you get into trouble, how to
break it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets onto me about my turnovers and says when he used to
play he never had turnovers like that. I can relate, but I told him
sometime maybe I'd better look at some of his old tapes and see if
he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins dubbed Cook a natural at the position, where conversions
seldom compare to those born with the knack _ like quarterbacks and
shortstops. Like many youngsters, Cook has been in love with the
game since he used to tag along with his older brother to the
neighborhood recreation center, where young Fatso amazed his
brother's friends and his dad by being able to loft the ball to the
rim as a 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw that, I put a goal up on the garage,'' Clifton's
dad said. ``Then I started having to leave my car out front when I
got home from work. I couldn't get into the garage because the
driveway was full of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Fats became too enamored with the game. His grades
suffered such that he couldn't qualify to attend a Division I
university. So, Dayton's player of the year went the JC route,
though that in itself was an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little off track,'' Cook admits. ``But something
dinged me and I said, `What am I doing? I'm throwing all this
away.' I decided I didn't want to be one of those `has-beens' who
sits around and talks about how he could have been this or that.''

GUSTY WINDS CUT SWATH THROUGH L.A. PSYCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Retransmitting to fix error in headline) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As hot, dry Santa Ana winds whipped through Los
Angeles on Wednesday, they stirred up more than fire danger and
dust devils: Anxiety reigned, headaches flared and sinuses clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Some people became unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to this emotional mayhem was the constant, unpredictable
threat of physical danger: A 30-acre fire burned in hills above
Glendale, a suburban community north of Los Angeles, briefly
threatening homes on the 10th anniversary of a blaze that destroyed
15 houses in the San Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch. The winds
toppled trucks, ripped signs, downed power lines and fanned small
fires across Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``devil winds'' are expected to remain through the
afternoon today.
</P>
<P>
   ``On days like this the anxiety curve accelerates, people's
minds are racing, their senses are on red alert and they burn up
adrenaline,'' said Glendale clinical psychologist Kim Shirin, who
added that our social values teach us to keep control of our world
and focus on completing daily tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the winds come, we realize we don't have control of our
world, so people need to spend . . . time relaxing and being
grounded, and they need to do it periodically through the day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that the Santa Ana winds possess the same
curious power as a full moon, to which some law enforcement
officials attribute increases in strange crimes during that point
in the lunar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we do it in the frenzy called Los Angeles? How about a
therapeutic massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a huge influx of walk-in customers and phone
calls,'' said Maria Montoya-Kaye, an employee at Massage Masters in
suburban Sherman Oaks. ``People are complaining of headaches and
back spasms and sinus problems. We've got 70 customers booked today
when the average is about 45 -- it's like the full moon effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Minnehan, 24, of nearby Encino found temporary peace in a
mocha java and a menthol cigarette. He took the day off from his
auto-repair job to avoid the frustrations of working in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . It would just be too tough to work,'' Minnehan said,
standing in an alcove outside a Starbucks coffee shop in Encino.
``It's a better day for a jacket and a good cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-boiled crime novelist Raymond Chandler wrote of these devil
winds as enough to make your nerves jump. ``On nights like that,
every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge
of the carving knife and study their husbands' necks,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   While reality might not always be that extreme, experts agree
the key to keeping sane on these wild, windy days is to learn how
to relax; like director David Lynch wrote into the ``Twin Peaks''
television series: ``Every day, once a day, give yourself a
present.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Southern California professor Henry Gong Jr. said
people who work outside or have allergies probably should stay
indoors when the Santa Anas come. On such days, Los Angeles
residents are exposed to desert allergens and particles that they
don't normally experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies indicate that on the Westside, small particles get
inhaled and can cause inflammation of asthma, hay fever and
pneumonia,'' Gong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, people's moods can alter and in severe cases they
could go to the emergency room. It's good to stay inside if
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The same also might be said about braving the weather to get a
haircut and styling.
</P>
<P>
   But contrary to the belief that the winds might whip hair into a
frenzy, those gusts can become an integral part of your fashion
statement, said Richard Glen, a stylist at Juan A Salon in Sherman
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more wind-blown your hair is, the more beautiful it is,''
Glen said. ``We make sure we do more layering and tell people to
keep a bottle of hair spray with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday wasn't as relaxing for Christmas tree lot workers
dealing with droves of downed timber and tents. But one manager in
the San Fernando Valley's Woodland Hills remained optimistic about
his operation and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, as long as you've got the Christmas spirit, shopping for
a tree can be fun at any time,'' said Andy Santiago, manager of Mr.
Christmas Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we've got two huge tents here that let people shop
during rain, sleet or snow.''
</P>
<P>
   On the law enforcement front, California Highway Patrol Officer
Dwight McDonald said tensions on the road can become heightened
with flying debris and aggravation from other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to be patient, slow down and allow more time to
get to their destination,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things could be blowing off of houses, or off the sides of
hills, so drivers need to also anticipate those problems and be
mindful of their surroundings.''

KINGS END SKID WITH SOLID EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ As Wednesday dawned, there was no guarantee
the gloom that has enveloped the Kings all season would dissipate
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   With thoughts of their struggles never far away, the Kings went
through their morning skate at the Forum, preparing for that
night's meeting with the Washington Capitals and hoping the outcome
would be different than it had been in 11 of the previous 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are trying to stay as positive as we can,'' Kings
coach Larry Robinson said following the morning skate. ``It's very
easy to be negative. Anytime you're (in a slump), you can't say
things are going rosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we've gone through probably the most difficult
part of our schedule. So at least now, we'll be able to have some
quality practice time, and travel fatigue won't be a question.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the day ended, things indeed were looking a little
brighter for the Kings (7-17-3), who snapped a five-game losing
streak with a 2-1 victory before an announced crowd of 9,816.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the third victory for the Kings (7-17-3) in 13 games
at the Forum this season, coming against a Capitals team missing
five injured players. The Capitals (8-14-3), Stanley Cup finalists
last season, have lost seven of their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset, playing in his 300th NHL game, stopped 32 shots
to record his first win since he and Manny Legace combined for a
4-0 victory Oct. 28 at New Jersey. The only dark spot of the night
was that winger Steve McKenna, back in the lineup after missing a
month with an abdominal strain, appeared to aggravate the injury
late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual aspect of the game was the Kings' first-period
offensive outburst, which accounted for both their goals. Entering
the game, the Kings had scored just one goal in their previous 10
opening periods.
</P>
<P>
   But 9:23 into the game, Luc Robitaille gave the Kings a 1-0 lead
_ their first lead since a 5-0 over Chicago 18 days earlier _ when
he beat Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig with a slap shot from the right
faceoff circle after receiving a cross-ice pass from defenseman
Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Robitaille's team-high 13th this season, just three
fewer than he scored last season. Robitaille needs nine goals to
reach 500 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, when things aren't going well, I think you're
tentative,'' Robinson said when asked about the Kings' first-period
offensive drought. ``You don't want to make foolish mistakes and
get down early. You have more of a tendency to be tentative, to do
more standing around and trying to think too much instead of
playing with the ease you normally play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes after Robitaille's goal, Glen Murray made
it 2-0, capitalizing when the Capitals made the sort of defensive
mistake that has been devastating the Kings all season.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington pressing for the tying goal, four of the five
Capitals on the ice got caught deep in the Kings' zone. This
allowed the Kings a 3-on-1 rush, with Murray completing the play
after passes from Robitaille and Yanic Perreault.
</P>
<P>
   Through 40 minutes, the Kings had the game under complete
control, a Jozef Stumpel in-the-crease violation costing Craig
Johnson a goal midway through the second period that would have
made the score 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 3:54 into the third period, Steve Konowalchuk cut the
Caps' deficit to one goal, scoring off a pass from Andrei
Nikolishin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings hung on, with Fiset robbing Kelly Miller's
point-blank shot with 3:15 to play. In the final minute, with
Kolzig pulled for an extra skater, the Capitals were unable to
mount a serious threat.

By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>

Notre Dame's Tim Brown attended Dallas' Woodrow Wilson High School.
</P>
<P>
   What was unique about the Heisman Trophies awarded from 1942-45?
</P>
<P>
   Because of World War II rationing, the Heismans were made of

the war, the winners received replacement Heismans.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the only Heisman Trophy winner to win the national
championship as a coach?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spurrier won the Heisman for Florida in 1966. The Gators

<P>
   Has a Heisman winner ever won the award without getting the most
first-place votes?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, twice. Paul Hornung in 1956 and Billy Sims in 1978. The
Heisman voters list their top three players, with the vote getters
receiving three points for first, two points for second and one
point for third.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Michigan's Charles Woodson the first defensive
player to win the Heisman Trophy, there was another distinction

undefeated and untied since Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Which are the only schools with Heisman Trophy winners in
consecutive years?
</P>
<P>
   Army and Ohio State. Army's Doc Blanchard (Mr. Inside) won the
award in 1945 and Glenn Davis (Mr. Outside) won it in 1946. Ohio
State's Archie Griffin won the award in 1974 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Who are the only players to finish in the top four vote getters
three consecutive years?

   True or false. A sophomore has never won the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   True.
</P>
<P>
   Which Heisman Trophy winner was not a consensus All-American?
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's Paul Hornung, playing for a 2-8 Irish team in 1956.
The consensus All-American backs that year were Syracuse's Jim
Brown, Tennessee's Johnny Majors, Oklahoma's Tommy McDonald and
Stanford's John Brodie.
</P>
<P>
   Which Heisman Trophy winner is the father of an actor?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Harmon is the father of actor Mark Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Which Heisman Trophy winner also played in college basketball's
Final Four?

<P>
   Notre Dame's Leon Hart, the 1949 winner, was 6-5. He's also the
heaviest, at 260 pounds.

KINGS ASK FANS TO BE PATIENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about the effect of the Kings' struggles on their
season-ticket holders, team president Tim Leiweke recently dropped
them a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe in this team and we are still confident that
we will be back in the playoffs once we get our key players back on
the ice,'' Leiweke wrote in a letter sent to the team's 8,500
ticket-holders. ``Hopefully, you will judge us on the entire
season, not just last month.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first period of Wednesday night's sparsely attended
game against Washington at the Forum, Leiweke explained the
decision to write the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are at is not where we wanted to be,'' he said. ``I
felt really bad for them. ... I think if the fans hang in there,
the team will be there at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiweke said he'd already gotten responses from some recipients
of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some said, `Class act,' '' Leiweke said. ``Others said, `If
you don't make the playoffs, it will be our last year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen sits (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   For the second time since he was recalled from the minors more
than a month ago, rookie center Olli Jokinen was a healthy scratch
Wednesday night, when the Kings played host to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said he didn't want both Jokinen and fellow
rookie Josh Green playing on the top two lines, and Robinson added
that Green was better suited than Jokinen to go into the corners
and battle along the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see is him getting in there and battling
more,'' Robinson said of Jokinen, 19. ``He is a playmaker, but I'd
like to see a little more grit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen's ice time has declined in his last five games. In his
first nine appearances, Jokinen averaged nearly 18 minutes a game,
and he had four goals, eight points and a plus-6 rating. In his
last five games, he has averaged about 11 minutes, had no points
and is minus-3. In his last game, a 4-3 loss Saturday to Detroit,
Jokinen played a season-low 6:41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about why I don't play,'' Jokinen said. ``I have
to work hard every game and practice. ... It's pretty hard when you
only go on the ice every 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   The Kings activated winger Steve McKenna before the game, and he
returned to the lineup for the first time since suffering an
abdominal strain on Nov. 5 in a fight with Tony Twist of the St.
Louis Blues. But McKenna aggravated the injury in the final two
minutes against Washington and will be examined today. ... After
the game, the Kings assigned center Brandon Convery to the Long
Beach Ice Dogs.

KINGS END SKID WITH 2-1 VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Esthetics? They didn't much matter.
</P>
<P>
   To Kings coach Larry Robinson and his players, it might as well
have been a 10-goal blowout with picturesque goals against a
powerhouse opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings hung on for a nervous 2-1 victory Wednesday
night over the injury-depleted Washington Capitals before an
announced crowd of 9,816 at the Forum, but when you've lost 11 of
your last 12 games, who cares what the score is so long as you're
on the right end of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win,'' Robinson said. ``It's much easier to build on a
win. They've been few and far between. It's a step in the right
direction. You've got to get confidence from wins, and we'll take
anything we can get right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a novel night in many ways. The Kings (7-17-3) scored
both their goals in the first period _ by Luc Robitaille and Glen
Murray _ after scoring just once in their previous 10 first
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Stephane Fiset, who has missed much of the season with
groin injuries, stopped 32 shots to record his first victory since
he combined with Manny Legace to defeat New Jersey on Oct. 28. And
the victory was just the third for the Kings in 13 home games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiset didn't give up many rebounds and their defense did a
good job after the initial shot at tying our players up,'' said
former Mighty Ducks coach Ron Wilson, the coach of the Capitals
(8-14-3), who have lost seven of nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings took the lead 9:23 into the game, when Robitaille
scored his team-high 13th goal _ three fewer than he had last
season _ off a cross-ice feed from Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the key,'' Robitaille said of the Kings' rare
quick start. ``The last two games before this one, we really played
hard, but we didn't come up with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five minutes after Robitaille's goal, they came up
with something else when the Capitals made the sort of defensive
mistake that has been devastating the Kings all season.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington pressing for the tying goal, four of the five
Capitals on the ice got caught deep in the Kings' zone. This
allowed the Kings a 3-on-1 rush, with Murray completing the play
after passes from Robitaille and Yanic Perreault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some of their films,'' Robinson said. ``We noticed
they do sometimes get four guys caught down low. One thing we
stressed was if we played well positionally, they'd give us enough
chances to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Through 40 minutes, the Kings had the game under complete
control, a Jozef Stumpel in-the-crease violation costing Craig
Johnson a goal midway through the second period that would have
made the score 3-0. The goal was denied by referee Mark Faucette,
whose ruling was upheld by the video goal judge even though
Capitals goalie Olaf Kolzig was lounging on top of Stumpel as
Johnson fired the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 3:54 into the third period, Steve Konowalchuk cut the
Capitals' deficit to one goal, scoring off a pass from Andrei
Nikolishin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings hung on, with Fiset robbing Kelly Miller's
point-blank shot with 3:15 to play. In the final minute, with
Kolzig pulled for an extra skater, the Capitals were unable to
mount a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're struggling, you can't pinpoint one thing,''
Robitaille said. ``The key thing the last three games is that
everybody is doing the little things. You see guys finishing
checks, making the right little plays. We're playing for each other
now. We want to be the hardest-working team in the league. If we do
that, we'll be OK.''

SATELLITES GIVE SCIENTISTS ADVANCE WARNING OF VOLCANO ERUPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists in Hawaii are exploiting the
heat-sensing eyes of satellites to warn when dangerous volcanoes
threaten to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are now monitoring many of the most active
volcanoes in North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   A global network of the specialized satellites could provide
advance warning of eruptions anywhere in the world, they said, and
also warn when wildfires threaten to flare out of control in remote
forests.
</P>
<P>
   In reports to the annual fall meeting of the American
Geophysical Union in San Francisco, the volcano experts said they
have successfully forecast eruptions on eight of the nine volcanoes
they are now watching regularly from space.
</P>
<P>
   Luke P. Flynn and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii
have developed a new system to process information from two weather
satellites flying 22,300 miles above the earth _ an orbit that
keeps them hovering over the same areas of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as GOES, an acronym for Geostationary
Environmental Satellites, and in addition to cameras that
constantly transmit images of the clouds and storms used on
television weather reports, they also carry infra-red sensors that
make them extremely accurate long-distance thermometers, Flynn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES satellite data is transmitted automatically every 15
minutes to the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey, and, when
cracks open in the bulging dome of a hot volcano's summit, or fresh
flames rise above the canopy of a rain forest, the images of the
``hot spots'' are sent instantly to Hawaii and then displayed on a
special Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites have already enabled the Earth-bound scientists
to forecast an eruption of the Pacaya volcano in Guatemala nearly a
week before it sent a huge ash cloud over the region, Flynn said,
and then spotted a new lava flow on the volcano's flanks in
September.
</P>
<P>
   On the big island of Hawaii the satellites continuously monitor
the Kilauea lava flow to warn scientists at the U.S. Geological
Survey's volcano observatory there when fresh lava is flowing over
the ground or when it is reaching the ocean through underground
lava tubes.
</P>
<P>
   At the famed Popocatepetl volcano in Mexico, the GOES satellites
detected new heat emerging from lava inside a rising dome on the
summit a full week before observers on the ground detected it,
Flynn said. And a fresh ``hot spot'' atop the remote Lascar volcano
in northern Chile has been under constant satellite observation,
although so far the volcano has not erupted.
</P>
<P>
   There is good news, too, from the satellite observations, for
they show that the deadly Soufriere Hills volcano that killed
dozens and ravaged the Caribbean island of Montserrat in an
eruption three years ago has been cooling steadily since last May.
Its dome now appears stagnant, Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   A global array of a dozen satellites like the GOES system could
monitor every active volcano in the world with a fresh warning of
increasing heat every 15 minutes, and provide warnings just as
rapidly when major fires break out unobserved in inaccessible
forests.
</P>
<P>
   GOES satellite images of volcanoes and wildfires from the
University of Hawaii are on the Internet at

WARNING SYSTEM LETS JETS AVOID DANGER FROM ASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ A sophisticated new international tracking
system has been set up to warn jet aircraft away from deadly clouds
of volcanic ash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists described a network of nine Volcanic Ash Advisory
Centers Wednesday during a meeting of the American Geophysical
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is in place, and it has been working,'' said Thomas
Casadevall, associate director of the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's busiest air traffic lanes, including the
so-called ``great circle route'' connecting North America and Asia,
fly over territory dotted with volcanoes. The main danger comes
from airborne debris jamming engines.
</P>
<P>
   No jets have crashed as a result of encounters with volcanic
eruptions, but there have been about 100 near-misses in the modern
era of jet travel, including nine incidents in which ash-clogged
engines stalled in midflight.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1989, for example, a Boeing 747 bound for Tokyo with
243 people aboard hit a volcanic cloud while approaching Anchorage,
Alaska, for a refueling stop.
</P>
<P>
   All four engines failed when the pilot tried to climb out _ now
regarded as exactly the wrong thing to do in such situations. The
plane came within about 60 seconds of slamming into a mountain
range before the pilot, on the 11th attempt, managed to get the
engines restarted.
</P>
<P>
   Now, methods are in place to detect restless volcanoes in
advance, quickly analyze trouble zones and issue detailed status
reports to commercial and military authorities. Along with training
in evasive maneuvers, pilots get printouts before every flight
showing what to watch out for.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists described the risk of air disasters as one of the
most significant volcano-related hazards of the modern age. Despite
the high-tech gear, experts concede that the danger has not been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, the pilot may be the first one to detect an
eruption,'' Casadevall said.

   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton's visit to Israel and
Palestinian-controlled areas, which begins this weekend, was
originally intended to cement the agreement he mediated in October
at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. Now it looks like Clinton
will have to push, yet again, for the Israelis and Palestinians to
keep the peace process moving.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON'S JOB ON HIS MIDEAST TRIP:
</P>
<P>
   _ Witness the Palestine Liberation Organization reaffirm that
the group's charter no longer calls for the destruction of Israel a
move demanded by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Convince Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to restart the
phased Israeli troop withdrawals from the West Bank. The next is
due on Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ Convince Arafat to quell anti-Israeli riots by Palestinians
that have occurred almost daily for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Settle a post-Wye argument between the two sides about the
kinds of prisoners Israel is supposed to release from jail.
</P>
<P>
   IN COMING MONTHS, PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS ARE TO NEGOTIATE:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether Israel will share Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   _ What kind of self-rule or statehood the Palestinians will
ultimately have.
</P>
<P>
   _ The final borders between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether 3.4 million Palestinian refugees will be allowed to
return to land their families lost in Israel.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court's winking at privacy issues an odd tack for
conservative justices
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court justices in a recent ruling seemed
shocked, shocked that Iowa police had got it into their heads they
could search any drivers and cars they pulled over for routine
traffic violations. But the court needed only to look at its own
rulings in recent years to see where the idea came from that
privacy claims have little standing against the claims of law
enforcement convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The court's record of indifference to privacy issues is not
perfect but it leans heavily against any but the most narrow and
literal readings of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment guarantees.
The court has been winking for years at supposedly forbidden
``unreasonable searches and seizures'' that violate the ``right of
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the justices needed to refer back only a week to their
ruling that guests in your home don't enjoy the protection that you
do from warrantless police searches. Perhaps overnight guests
would, some justices said, but not day visitors, a distinction
notable mainly for its arbitrariness. Your home may still be your
castle, but it could become a dungeon for drop-ins.
</P>
<P>
   As the court became more conservative with Reagan and Bush
appointees _ a condition little changed by Clinton's two _ it came
to favor the power of the state over the liberty of individuals.
(An odd tack for conservatism, one would think, but there you are.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the justices held that governments can outlaw and punish
even the homebound, consensual exercise of sex acts a legislative
majority chooses to proscribe. It would be difficult to imagine a
more intrusive extension of police power.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been increasingly indulgent of forced drug tests
in schools and workplaces even when no drug use is suspected. It
has shrugged off schoolhouse strip-searches of students. In an Ohio
case, the court endorsed the search of the car of a driver arrested
for speeding _ an obvious precursor to the Iowa law that permitted
such searches for any traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   That broad grant of police power finally was too much for the
court. It meant anyone driving in Iowa was subject to a search for
criminal evidence at any officer's whim. All that was required was
an officer's willingness to write a ticket charging the driver with
fudging a red light, creeping through a stop sign, beating the
speed limit by a few miles. Officers could, in practice, stop and
search motorists for spite, sport or just because they didn't like
a driver's looks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ruling gives only feeble cause for encouragement. Its
unanimity shows that the justices do, at the extreme, have some
sort of gag reflex against privacy violations, but the justices
made only a very fine distinction, one between searching drivers
``arrested'' for a traffic violation (OK) and merely ticketed (not
OK).
</P>
<P>
   The justices show no inclination to rethink their burdening body
of decisions that have steadily narrowed the zones and conditions
in which Americans can reasonably expect to be shielded from the
rummaging intrusions of a nosey state.

 &HT;    The once and always inimitable Herbie Hancock
 &HT;    By Michael Point
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Herbie Hancock visibly winces at the mention
that he might be the most widely imitated jazz pianist of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know about that,'' he says with a resigned sigh
that indicates he's heard the notion before. ``I guess some people
think so, and I do occasionally hear some familiar phrases when I
listen to other pianists. But I always wonder just which version of
me people think they're imitating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good question because the 58-year-old Chicago native
quietly has amassed one of the deepest and most diverse bodies of
work in the history of jazz. Only the work of his former employer
Miles Davis compares, and even Davis' work is beginning to lose
pace as Hancock expand-- and embellishes his artistic reach. Like
Davis, Hancock's endlessly exploratory nature consistently
exasperates old fans while adding new devotees. Each startlingly
new musical direction generates equal amounts of controversy and
commendation.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock views his chameleon-like musical mutations not as
stylistic contradictions but as expressions of his expansive, yet
unified, artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, or, at least, I hope, that all my music has my
personal creative imprint on it,'' the pianist explains. ``All of
it, no matter how different, is just part of a musical whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Jazz by nature always has been open to experimentation, but
Hancock's relentless quest for new expressions has set him far
apart from his contemporary peers while he has maintained his
mainstream significance. After all, how many jazz legends were
performing Mozart on stage with the Chicago Symphony as a preteen
or achieving MTV fame with a ground-breaking video such as
``Rockit'' while establishing themselves as the most copied jazz
pianist of the era?
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's mercurial music, always a conspicuous component of the
jazz world, quite simply has become the most pervasive sound on the
scene. The pianist/composer is in the midst of an unusually
prolific period, and his former record companies have taken
advantage of his ever-growing stature to reissue much of his
classic early work. As a result, Hancock's entire four-decade
career is currently on prominent display at your local CD store,
and the world is a much better and more musical place because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current attention to Hancock's artistry is a result
of the phenomenal success of ``Gershwin's World,'' the most
adventurous and successful of the torrent of tributes to the Jazz
Age classical creator. The brilliantly conceived and flawlessly
executed project has been at the top of the jazz charts since its
release and, in classic Hancock tradition, has introduced his
musicianship to yet another group of fans.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate production of the star-studded ``Gershwin's
World,'' which includes everything from African percussionists to a
symphony orchestra, follows Hancock's 1997 group recording ``New
Standard,'' a straight-ahead jazz outing _ with a typical twist.
Hancock's take on standards included compositions by the likes of
Peter Gabriel, Kurt Cobain and Prince, none of whom immediately
come to mind when the standard jazz repertoire is discussed. The
year before ``New Standard,'' Hancock reunited with fellow Davis
bandmate Wayne Shorter for ``1+1,'' a sublime album of
impressionistic acoustic piano-sax duets whose sensibilities were
as distant from Nirvana as Seattle is from Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hancock's pioneering funk-fusion reissues ``Thrust''
and ``Sextant,'' supersaturated with synthesizers and streetwise
beats, are back in the stores in CD form so that hip-hoppers can
discard the vinyl versions they've been sampling for years. And, in
addition to his own work, Hancock's music is front and center on
the new ``Fingerpainting'' tribute, an album featuring a trio of
the jazz scene's current young lions _ trumpeter Nicholas Payton,
bassist Christian McBride and guitarist Mark Whitfield _ performing
classic Hancock compositions.
</P>
<P>
   But all those tasty treats are merely appetizers for the musical
banquet of Hancock's core catalog. The stunning compilation ``Miles
Davis Quintet 1965-'68,'' the definitive documentation of what many
critics and fans feel was the most exceptional acoustic ensemble of
modern times, has been joined in the stores recently by its logical
companion set, the electrifying ``Bitches Brew.'' The beautifully
boxed and musically expanded ``Bitches Brew,'' one of the most
significant recordings in the history of American music, arrives
just in time for Christmas, but it will light up your speakers any
time of year with its trail-blazing ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's work in the Davis bands is the stuff of legend, but
his personalized jazz genius comes out clearest on his own
recordings from the period. And, again, just in time for Christmas,
they are freshly available via ``The Complete Blue Note Sixties
Sessions,'' a six-disc collection showcasing some of Hancock's best
work and some of the best jazz of the decade, if not some of the
best music the genre has produced in many decades.
</P>
<P>
   It's an overwhelming amount of powerful music, and listening to
it years later is a mixed, although overall positive, experience
for the musician who originally created it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you wish you had done differently, but
primarily you're pleased so many things turned out so well,''
Hancock explains. ``As a player you're more critical of your work
than as a composer, but I've always had the good fortune to work
with master musicians, so most of it still moves me.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Blue Note collection, an absolutely essential addition
to every jazz collection, best expresses the reasons Hancock is
held in such high regard in the jazz world, ``Gershwin's World'' is
undoubtedly the most impressive and representative example of his
remarkable eclecticism. Whether performing with Joni Mitchell and
Stevie Wonder or classical soprano Kathleen Battle, Hancock is
note-perfect in his playing and fearlessly inventive in his musical
vision. Two tracks with Hancock in front of the Orpheus Chamber
Orchestra and a grand finale of a solo interpretation of
``Embraceable You'' further exhibit his enlightened approach and
prodigious talent.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, but expect it to be new, different and masterfully
imagined and executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my career I'm very interested in special
projects, recordings that are events instead of just variations of
what I've already done,'' Hancock says. ``I've got a lot of ideas
and musical areas I'd still like to explore, and I'm very open to
to any ideas others might have. I really don't know where my music
is going next, and that's a very exciting feeling.''

   What Eva really likes is TV shopping. Some of those shop-at-home
shows have the best guests, such as Marie Osmond and designer Bob
Mackie. (``I just love it when he's on.'')
</P>
<P>
   That's how Eva got involved with dolls: She ordered one from TV.
That was about 20 years and 700 dolls ago. She wasn't thinking
about a collection, much less an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started buying them because they were cute, and it was
so easy to do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She still doesn't think like a collector. No selling, no trading
and, most definitely, no scrounging around flea markets. Eva just
tunes in, calls up and waits for more to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   When they do, she somehow manages to live up to her posted motto
``Always room for more,'' even though there are already dolls
everywhere in her Boynton Beach house beyond the double-size
bedroom she calls the Doll Room.
</P>
<P>
   Dolls on shelves, on cabinets, on ledges and floors. Dolls on
beds and bureaus. Dolls in the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dolls that dance. Dolls that wave their arms. Dolls that cry.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Doulton dolls that match her china. Barbie dolls in nearly
every dress and pose, including Barbie loves Elvis. She has six
Qqueens of England. One Eempress of Russia (her most expensive, at
$1,500). And, of course, lots of dolls designed by Marie Osmond and
lots more dressed by Bob Mackie.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is heightened this time of year, when Eva snuggles
her Santa dolls in with all the rest and turns the house into one,
big Christmas doll display.
</P>
<P>
   It's usually a treat reserved for family and neighbors, but this
season already brought a special visit from 71 new friends, members
of the Salvation Army Home League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those ladies had to use walkers, but they took their
time and looked at every doll,'' Eva says. ``They were so thrilled,
and I was so thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrills resulted from Eva's one annual exception to her mall
aversion. For nine years now, she and Mike, who owns a plaster and
stucco business, have been faithful visitors to the Salvation Army
Angel Trees. They pick paper angels with the names of children who
need toys.
</P>
<P>
   Eva has about 40 angels, one for each child who's gotten a toy
from them. This year, Eva made one extra and very personal
donation. She wrote a poem.
</P>
<P>
   The mall was filled with the Christmas spirit,
</P>
<P>
   We knew that God above could hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Now every year Mike and me
</P>
<P>
   Go to visit the Angel tree.
</P>
<P>
   The poem made such a hit with the local Salvation Army folks in
Broward County, where the Beckers used to live, that it's being
passed along to the national headquarters and may be published,
said volunteer coordinator Jean Gerber. Just knowing she touched
someone with her words has Eva excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not always sure where to put the punctuation, but every
once in a while something comes out,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has no training, she started writing poems as a
child with her father and hasn't stopped. They're in a big notebook
titled ``Daddy and Me.''
</P>
<P>
   She even wrote a few songs and made a record back in the
mid-'70s. A couple of newspaper clippings on the hallway wall
recount her brief career as a country singer in Nashville. Her
sisters even heard her songs on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting played all over the country,'' Eva says.
``The record company wanted me to do promotions. Travel around and
sing.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't appeal to Eva. Fame and fortune just didn't seem
like good enough reasons to leave home.

 &HT;    Women to march again in remembrance, revival of temperance
movement
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLSBORO, Ohio _ On Christmas Eve morning nearly 125 years ago,
70 scared but very determined women in this charming Southern Ohio
town emerged from the Presbyterian church and marched two-by-two
through the streets of downtown, singing the hymn Give to the Winds
Thy Fears .
</P>
<P>
   Some cried. Some trembled. Some stood tall with eyes upraised.
But all of them were of a single aim: with public prayer and
appeal, they vowed to shut off the flow of liquor from the town's
many saloons, drugstores and hotels and stop the hard-drinking,
brawling behavior ripping apart their families and their community.
</P>
<P>
   Today at 1 p.m., about 30 members of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union _ still alive and, its leaders say, still very
much needed _ will re-enact the march that gave birth to the
temperance crusade and led to the broader movement for child
protection and voting rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   After today's march, the members will walk the few blocks to the
quaint Colonial home of Mrs. Eliza Jane Trimble Thompson, the
descendent of two Ohio governors who was chosen the first leader of
the temperance movement in 1873. Later, they will lay a wreath at
her simple gravesite north of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women really owe a lot to the WCTU and its early organizers,''
said Sarah Ward, president of the Evanston, Ill.-based organization
that has promoted abstinence from alcohol for more than a century.
``Women who had been cloistered up to that point, but who saw the
need for change, found an avenue to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The early temperance crusade was the training grounds for many
of the nation's first women activists, including Susan B. Anthony,
who went on to lead the suffragette movement and the fight for
women's voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women suffered deeply because of men who drank up all
their wages. Remember, there was no safety net, no welfare back
then,'' said Gladys Beckwith, a Michigan State University professor
and head of the Michigan Women's Studies Association. ``Alcohol was
really a terrible foe to women, and that's a major reason (the
temperance crusade) allied with the suffrage movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Literally, as well as figuratively, the 70 women of Hillsboro
discovered a voice that would roar, generations later, as the
nation's voting majority. After being drafted by the other women as
their leader, ``Mother'' Thompson was so nervous and frightened she
couldn't bring herself to address the fledgling group until a
minister asked the men in the church to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women had no role models'' for public speaking, Ward
said. ``There were no women governors or mayors or even ministers
they could look to.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, though, the Hillsboro group caught its stride,
kneeling in prayer on sidewalks before the local liquor vendors,
pleading for them to abandon the trade. Within a few weeks, the
Hillsboro crusade had spread across half of America and closed
thousands of saloons.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the last century, the temperance union had
successfully lobbied to make the study of alcohol's dangers a part
of every public schoolchild's education. And in 1919, Congress and
the states enacted the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and
the nation's short-lived prohibition against alcohol began.
</P>
<P>
   The popular image of the early crusaders as dour, axe-wielding
zealots out to trample on personal liberties doesn't hold up to the
truth, chroniclers have said. Hugh S. Fullerton, a famed sports
writer in the early part of the century, grew up in Hillsboro and,
as a child, knew many of the women personally. ``They were the most
modest, quiet, home-loving members of the aristocracy of
(Hillsboro),'' he wrote in a 1919 national magazine article marking
the start of Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   What spurred the women to action, he wrote, was not only their
deeply-held religious values but a belly full of the town's public
drunkenness, especially on Stock Sales Day, when men gathered to
deal livestock and, afterward, hit the local saloons. ``(It) made
the village a drunken hell with brawling, cutting and shooting,''
Fullerton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women also knew the destructive force of alcohol in
their own families, Fullerton wrote, noting that the town's
aristocracy originated from Virginia, the Carolinas and Kentucky
and ``the men, after the manner of their class, drank hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A life-sized portrait of Judge James Henry Thompson, husband of
Mother Thompson, hangs in Hillsboro's Highland House Museum, where
it ``attests (to his hard-drinking) because, as you can see, his
face is all red,'' said Jean Wallis, assistant director of the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsboro Mayor Sandy Harsha, whose great grandmother marched
side-by-side with Thompson, says the town's major concern these
days is traffic congestion, not public intoxication. With Ohio
routes 42, 73, 124 and 138 all converging in Hillsboro, and
development booming north along U.S. 62, the downtown streets are
often snarled. Hillsboro plans to hire a traffic consultant, ``but
it's nothing we'll solve very quickly,'' Harsha said.
</P>
<P>
   From a peak of 250,000 members in the late 19th century, the
temperance union has dwindled to 8,000 members in 39 states today.
But Ward said the organization is ``still alive and well, and we
still feel we are needed. We continue our crusade, even though we
aren't using the same methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward noted that fetal alcohol syndrome, which develops when
women drink during pregnancy, is the leading cause of birth defects
in America. ``Then look at all the efforts to get drunk drivers off
the road, and yet drinking is still responsible for well over 40
percent of all traffic fatalities,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the union gave up the marches and demonstrations and public
prayer vigils long ago. Those are no longer effective tactics in
today's climate of individual rights at all costs, Ward said.
Instead, the group focuses on education by sponsoring anti-alcohol
literature and contests in the schools. And, as always, it remains
committed to promoting abstinence, one pledge at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're different from other groups today that say, `Don't drink
until you're 21,' or `Don't drink and drive,' `` Ward said. ``We're
still saying a safer approach is not to drink at all. You'll never
become an alcoholic if you never take that first drink.''

 &HT;    With asphalt on march, urban sprawl goes rural
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Dating back to the first Earth Day, every Junior
Ecologist could cite a glossary of environmental villains: DDT,
acid rain, CFCs, dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   It's time we started acknowledging that environmental dilemma
No. 1 is not nearly so exotic. Try asphalt. Asphalt takes green and
makes black. With changing lifestyles, it blackens more and more
green, miles removed from so-called asphalt jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Urban sprawl, commonly associated with major metro hubs, is
loosely defined as low-density development. Instead of high-rises
scraping the sky, we have sprawling super stores, strip centers and
fast-food hives scraping away undeveloped land. With development
chasing customers who have fled the city, the sprawl is not so
urban any more.
</P>
<P>
   Another characteristic: Urban sprawl is growth that doesn't
necessarily reflect increases in population. Rather, it reflects
changes in lifetyle _ principally Americans' willingness to hop in
the car, to spread out and to to abandon inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, from 1990 to 1996, developed land in Chicago
increased by 40 percent, but population increased by only 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Waco's own sprawl
</P>
<P>
   Waco is getting to know urban sprawl in the form of an explosion
of super stores and restaurants. To see this development along
Franklin Avenue, one would think that someone had just struck oil
in suburban Hewitt and spawned a land rush. No. As with most Texas
mid-sized cities, growth here has been modest and grudging.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say the key in our case is that the metro area in the
last five years eclipsed the magic 200,000 population threshold
that many chains require.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the city considers annexing land along the U.S. 84
corridor, a question looms: How much asphalt can an ecosytem stand?
</P>
<P>
   The City of Waco must build into any growth a plan to keep some
areas asphalt-free.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Kathy Rice talks about planning that would
incorporate green spaces to buffer subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this is a foreign language to mid-sized
communities butting up against rural frontiers. Hey, green we've
got. Look out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Give us some of that, you know, green.
</P>
<P>
   The latter translates, of course, into more asphalt, which means
more air pollution, more runoff (bearing pollution), more noise,
more life-giving soil entombed for eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Open space imperative
</P>
<P>
   If our lifestyles demand more asphalt, our environment demands
that we plan space where it can't reside.
</P>
<P>
   We also must invest in green belts and parks, just like
forefathers who set aside land for our benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which has pronounced ``Challenge to Urban
Sprawl'' as its signature campaign, has other key suggestions such
as stepped-up efforts to redevelop downtowns, not just as business
centers but also as places where people will want to live.
</P>
<P>
   To make asphalt all-powerful as public policy is nothing more
than to march backward into the dark ages before the environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an irony, consider this: Part of America's
accelerating sprawl is due to the fact that many people have fallen
out of love with the mall, which sapped many downtowns of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Save our mall'' doesn't sound like a chant for Earth Day, but
the fact is that anything that gets people out of their cars
between retail transactions is good for the planet, although
certainly the planet votes for green belts, hike-bike trails and
parks first.
</P>
<P>
   As Joni Mitchell wrote, you don't know what you've got until
it's under asphalt. She also wrote that we had to get back to the
garden. Get back to the, um, mall, Joni?

 &HT;    No bull for Mississippi's cutup coach?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ So, with the University of Texas playing Mississippi
State in the Cotton Bowl on New Year's Day, you're wondering what
surprise moves Jackie Sherrill has up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi State coach has hired Lorena Bobbitt as his
offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I just made that part up. But Sherrill has been known
to sit on the very cutting edge of football strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, he had a bull castrated on a practice field in
front of his Mississippi State players to get them fired up for the
team's season opener against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What a nutty guy. But that sort of demonstration would be a
great motivational tool for me. ``Uh, Kelso, if you don't stop
doggin' it out there . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches take the bull by the horns, but Sherrill got it
backwards and started at the other end of the animal. Actually, he
got someone from the vet school to do the dirty work for him.
Either way, the incident didn't get Mississippi State any bouquets
from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had almost forgotten about our little bull incident; I'm
afraid it's going to come back and rear its ugly head,'' said
Mississippi State Sports Information Director Mike Nemeth. Nemeth
said the school got a lot of calls from animal rights people around
the country. ``Most of them in outrage,'' he said. ``They came from
New York City and Boston and L.A. In the state of Mississippi, no
one called. This is such a farming state.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why the Mississippi State song is ``Old MacDonald
Had a Farm.'' Let's all sing along: ``And on that farm he had some
bulls, e-i-e-i-o. With a snip-snip here, and a snip-snip there. . .
. Old MacDonald had some steers . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering if Sherrill is going to rearrange any animals for
UT and the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Because surgery worked so well in 1992, with Mississippi State
beating Texas 28-10 in John Mackovic's first game at UT, you've got
to figure Sherrill might disturb the herd again, right?
</P>
<P>
   Nemeth said Sherrill had no such plans. He said Sherrill
arranged for the cutting the first time around because the UT
mascot, Bevo, is a steer and ``the players had asked what a
Longhorn steer was.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, buddy. In a corn-cob state like Mississippi, where
clean overalls is formal attire, the difference between a bull and
a steer is one of the few things you'd expect a college kid to
understand. If the Mississippi State players had asked Sherrill
what a flush toilet is, I'd believe it. But don't try to give me
some cock-and-bull story .
</P>
<P>
   The bull ploy caused some real problems for Mackovic, though.
Not only did he have to come up with a game plan, he also had to
figure out which wine goes with calf fries. I'd recommend a
chardonnay. And what happened to the evidence? Did Sherrill have
them laminated, then hang them from his rearview mirror?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people seem to think they taste like chicken,'' said
Rick Spencer, owner of Spencers' Mountain Bar &AMP; Grill in
Centennial, Wyo., where Friday nights are ``Nut and Gut Night'' _
all the Rocky Mountain oysters and chicken gizzards you can eat for
$5.95, cocktail sauce included.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your dining pleasure, it's too bad Sherrill's team
didn't open the '92 season against Montana. I would have enjoyed
watching the grizzly gnaw off his arm.

<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza The house painter says he is happy that
President Clinton is coming to town. But he doesn't look happy. He
frowns and is quick to raise his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work. That's why I look this way,'' grumbles Shaher
I'leewa(cq), a 30-year-old Gazan, as he leaned on a car in busy
Palestine Square. He has short-term work today, but he has five
kids and has not had a steady job in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Donkey carts make their way among the cars on the streets
nearby. Based on the overall Gaza population, three-fourths of the
people passing here are refugees and a third still live in refugee
camps. Worse still, they make about 20 percent less money than they
did before the peace process began. One out of five, like I'leewa,
is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the people Clinton seemed to be talking about in a
speech to international aid donors last month: A Palestinian who
feels like he has not seen the benefits of the five-year-old peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Clinton will become the first U.S. president to visit a
Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks to boost the faltering peace between the Gazans and
their richer neighbors in Israel. For all the diplomacy and peace
treaties, the chances for peace depend largely on whether people
like this painter think they can take care of their families better
now than before. So far, they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   I'leewa's problem is that he cannot work in Israel anymore.
Israel, concerned about security, has tightened the entrance
criteria and excluded, according to some counts, more than half of
the 150,000 Palestinians who used to commute in every day.
</P>
<P>
   I'leewa never cared much about politics, but he agrees with
Clinton that peace and prosperity are connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no work, you will go to the Hamas people,'' he says,
referring to the extremist group that sends terrorist bombers into
Israel and runs a social services network that serves the needy.
``If you have work, when Hamas comes to you, you will tell them, 'I
don't need you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Palestinian areas there are examples of the
complexities that stifle economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Khaled Rashadeh helped make
the 14,000 plastic U.S. flags that will drape across streets for
Clinton's visit. He cares about making money, not about politics.
But he has a political problem.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to work in neighboring Jordan a few years ago, he
lost his Israeli-approved West Bank identity card. He has rejoined
his family, but cannot buy a car or a house without an ID even if
he could on $340 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rashadeh, 36, is married and he would like to put his four kids
in private schools, rather than the school in their refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to just be dependent on Israel,'' he says. ``If
the Israelis and Arabs put their minds together, this would be the
greatest place.''
</P>
<P>
   And, there's the story of West Bank resident Amjad Bader, 30,
studying nearby and trying to rebuild his life after 28 months in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Bader was a college activist in the Palestinian uprising that
was known as the Intifada. He organized demonstrations and riots
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, the political activity is over,'' he says. ``The
dream of my life is to become independent financially.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a wife and daughter and was working two jobs about 16
hours a day. Hoping to sell cosmetics in Jordan, he won approval
from the Israeli supreme court to travel. But, something went wrong
and, in Jordan, he was arrested for having improper immigration
papers and was sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is learning to be a driving instructor. The class is run
by a group that rehabilitates former prisoners. They have 31,000
others like Bader getting, or waiting for, training, and they have
trouble finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Ex-Detainee Rehabilitation Center, gets its money
from European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Donor countries recently pledged up to $4 billion in aid over
five years to the Palestinian-controlled areas. The U.S. gives $75
million a year now.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a lot of money for a population of about 2.5
million people. On the other hand, world powers have long sunk
billions into this region, trying to buy an elusive peace.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. alone gives $3 billion a year to the 6 million
Israelis, who have a per capita income about 10 times that of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian per capita income has dropped 21 percent since 1992
to just $1,630, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Experts see potential in the Palestinian economy. Palestinians
are not as poor as their Egyptian or Jordanian neighbors. Also,
they are well-educated and entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   But, their tiny, $3.3 billion-a-year economy depends on access
to the $100 billion Israeli power house next door. Israel can
isolate their economy literally in minutes, by closing checkpoints
and shipping access.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip highlights one solution. He will fly by
helicopter into Gaza International Airport Monday. The $80 million,
donor-funded airport opened a few weeks ago and allows Palestinians
to travel and ship goods with less Israeli interference.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other donor-provided improvements over the five
years since the peace process started. Flood Waters and sewage do
not overflow into the narrow streets of Gaza's eight refugee camps
as much anymore, and the camps all have potable water. Major
streets are paved and dumpsters with ``European Community''
stenciled on the side help eliminate the litter.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern edge of The Gaza Strip, a 50-acre industrial park
is being built that could ultimately employ 15,000 people in
companies lured by tax incentives. The Palestinian Coca-Cola
distributor is the first big-name tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian economist Hisham Awartani said aid to the
Palestinians will help fix the roads and phone systems needed to
attract investment, but it should be used only in the transition
from occupied territory to a self-sufficient state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Palestinians are somewhat sensitive about aid,'' he says.
``We are not Bangladesh. Palestine is a relatively rich country.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants it to be easier for painters to get to their jobs, or
Palestinians to get identification cards that let them buy cars or
sell products in Jordan. A crucial sea port, envisioned in the
peace process, still does not have Israeli approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can help us more not just by giving aid, but by twisting
the Israelis arms,'' Awartani says.
</P>

   1. AGING BUT INTENSE: SENIOR TENNIS PLAYERS SPEAK OUT In 1993, a
group of veteran tennis stars joined to start a seniors tour. It
now includes players like Bjorn Borg, 42, Guillermo Vilas, 46,
Jimmy Connors, 46, John McEnroe, 39, and Yannick Noah, 38. McEnroe,
who in his prime won 161 tournaments and was ranked No. 1 for 170
weeks, now works as a TV commentator; the fiery player once known
as ``McNasty'' also runs an art gallery. Noah, the 1983 French Open
champ and two-time captain of victorious French Davis Cup teams,
lives in New York, like McEnroe, and is a successful pop singer. In
this interview, the two men discuss the senior tour, the state of
tennis today -- and old rivalries that have been slow to die.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHY WYE ISN'T WORKING
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 13.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You know that the president is playing with fire
by trying to cut a deal in the Middle East,'' his national security
adviser told me. ``It isn't only that those people don't trust each
other,'' he added. ``They loathe each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation took place 20 years ago, the day before Jimmy
Carter brought the leaders of Israel and Egypt to Camp David in a
bid to make peace between two nations that had been enemies for 30
years. To the surprise of the adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and his
press aide, Madeleine Albright, Carter managed to plant a cold but
lasting peace between the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did so without first having in hand a pre-cooked deal. It
is an axiom in this city that a president should never commit the
prestige of his office to a major foreign policy endeavor unless
the final outcome is known in advance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has embarked on a similar high-wire act by
seeking to rescue the tenuous land-for-security deal he brokered in
October between Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As he flies aboard Air Force One to Tel Aviv, Clinton could do
worse than to review what emerged from Camp David. The ``Framework
for Peace in the Middle East,'' signed by Menachem Begin and Anwar
Sadat, noted that their peoples ``yearn for peace so that the vast
human and natural resources of the region can be turned to the
pursuits of peace and so that this area can become a model for
coexistence and cooperation among nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes remain as elusive today as they were back then.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the 1978 document said that ``Egypt, Israel,
Jordan and the representatives of the Palestinian people should
participate in negotiations on the resolution of the Palestinian
problem in all its aspects.'' A three-stage timetable was invoked
for cutting a deal on the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   That timetable was never consummated. A later timetable, forged
in Oslo in 1993, is in deep trouble because Netanyahu &AMP; Co. reject
the notion of a sovereign Arab Palestine and because Arafat Inc.
will settle for nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye Accord that Clinton brokered supposedly hangs by a
thread in light of Israel's refusal to release Palestinian
political prisoners. These are one and the same folks whom Arafat
hails as ``martyrs and heroes'' and whom Netanyahu brands ``as
killers of innocent women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas, the
militant Muslim group, who is under Palestinian house arrest in
Gaza, is staging a hunger strike to affirm the ``sacred right'' of
the movement's detainees ``to freedom and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can't say in public what, in private, he knows to be
true: the real issue isn't a lack of freed prisoners but a lack of
real trust between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   With trust in hand, all else becomes either negotiable or
trivial; without it, nothing is possible. That's what Carter
learned at his daring Camp David summit and what Clinton must
discover anew in the aftermath of his equally bold Wye initiative.

NEW ANALYSIS WARNS OF COSTS TO TAXPAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent analysis released Wednesday of the proposed deal
to build a stadium for the New England Patriots in Hartford threw
cold water on earlier estimates that the state of Connecticut would
profit from the development, and warned that taxpayers may have to
pay millions of dollars to support the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut General Assembly's Office of Fiscal Analysis
also criticized a study done last month by hired consultants KPMG
Peat Marwick for failing to identify the level of interest in
professional football in Connecticut, which it said may not be as
strong as some believe.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the state will likely spend far more
on the luxury box guarantees made to owner Robert Kraft than was
estimated in the Peat Marwick analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KPMG Peat Marwick report does not provide empirical data
or information based on surveys in several key areas needed to
evaluate the Patriots stadium proposal,'' according to the Office
of Fiscal Analysis. ``Individual legislators will have to use their
own judgment about whether they believe that there is a
sufficiently high level of interest in professional football over a
30-year period to make the Patriots stadium project successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million plan to move the Patriots from their current
location in Foxborough is being touted by state leaders as
``revenue-neutral,'' meaning no direct taxpayer money will be
necessary for the state to afford the construction of a new
68,000-seat stadium in downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Peat Marwick said its conclusion that the stadium over 30 years
would pay for itself and then some was based partly on comparing
Hartford to other similarly-sized markets with National Football
League stadiums. The comparisons are made on the basis of
population statistics and disposable income, rather than any
research about the relative interest in professional football in
the particular region, the legislative office asserted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The current plan being debated by the Connecticut General
Assembly proposes that the Patriots will charge among the highest
rates in the NFL for luxury seats and club seats. A memorandum of
understanding between Governor John G. Rowland and Kraft says that
the average price for the 6,000 club seats will be $5,000 and the
125 to 150 luxury boxes wll sell for $100,000. But the state also
agreed to make up the difference for Kraft if the team does not
sell all of the luxury seats, an amount that could cost state
taxpayers as much as $175 million over the first 10 years of the
stadium's operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Peat Marwick summary of stadium costs and benefits
assumed no cost to the state for the premium seat guarantee and did
not sufficiently gauge the level of corporate interest in the
Hartford stadium for the high-priced seats, Wednesday's report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors such as fluctuating interest rates and payment
schedules could also conspire against the plan to significantly
drive up the cost of the stadium, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The project could lose as much as $322 million or make up to
$358 million over the 30 years of the plan, depending on those
variables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using OFA assumptions, the Patriots stadium project is changed
from a net gain to a net loss,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Barton, a Peat Marwick official, was questioned by
legislators Wednesday about the new numbers but said he had not had
time to review them.
</P>
<P>
   Barton did agree, however, with the legislative office's basic
criticism of the Peat Marwick analysis. ``It was not our intent to
make a report that would tell what the market will bear.''

 &HT;    WILLIE NELSON HONORED AT 'WASHINGTON'S OSCARS'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. For release Monday, Dec. 28.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attire for the Kennedy Center Honors is always
unflinchingly formal, so Willie Nelson arrived in a spiffy black
cowboy hat, shined black boots and black velvet binding the ends of
his braided reddish-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember the last time'' he was so dressed up,
admitted the tuxedoed Texas troubador, who was among this year's
honorees. ``But they sent me a little piece of paper that said,
'You will wear black tie.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nelson, the Kennedy Center's 21st annual recognition
for lifetime achievement in the performing arts went to Bill Cosby,
Shirley Temple Black, conductor Andre Previn and Broadway composer
John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb. The star-studded salute to the
honorees was videotaped Dec. 6 and will be broadcast on the CBS
television network on Wednesday (Dec. 30) at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``Washington's Oscars,'' the Kennedy Center
Honors have recognized 111 American artists ranging from Bob Hope
and Lucille Ball to Paul Newman and Roy Acuff over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   After hosting this year's honorees at a White House reception,
President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton joined them
in box seats at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
to watch a stage show recalling the winners' artistic careers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Academy Awards, the evening begins with fans and TV
crews gathered on both sides of a red-carpeted foyer to see the
honorees and other celebrities walk from their limousines to their
theater seats. This promenade featured familiar faces from Capitol
Hill and Hollywood, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dennis Hopper; Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; Michelle Lee;
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jack Lemmon. Interesting
couples ranged from Dwight Yoakam and Bridget Fonda to Howard Baker
and Nancy Kassenbaum Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only in Washington _ and certainly only in booming
economic times _ would some of the loudest applause go to Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. ``You da man,
Alan,'' shouted one onlooker as Greenspan passed, looking slightly
perplexed as he walked with his wife, NBC-TV correspondent Andrea
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite anchored the gala, which featured a videotaped
recap of the achievements of each honoree and then salutes from
their performing peers.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his outlaw brand of country music, Nelson has had some
well-publicized run-ins with the law over marijuana and with the
IRS over unpaid taxes. On this night, though, a lyrical Cronkite
called him ``a Texan whose Dust Bowl voice and songs in the neon
night made him a Walt Whitman of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows who he is _ and he knows he's from someplace _ and he
knows where that place is,'' observed Tommy Lee Jones, a fellow
Texan. ``That big bus is always going back to the Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, Nelson's tour bus, the Honeysuckle Rose,
was rolled onto the reinforced Kennedy Center stage for the segment
honoring the Red-Haired Stranger. Then Nelson was serenaded with
his own songs.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam sang ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain'' and ``Hello
Walls.'' Lyle Lovett sang ``Night Life.'' Shelby Lynne sang
``Crazy'' and provoked some nervous giggles in the audience when
the TV monitors showed the Clintons in their box listening to the
lyrics ``crazy for trying and crazy for crying and crazy for loving
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kris Kristofferson strolled out, declaring ``Of all of
Willie's songs, this is probably the best epitaph'' and launching
into ``On the Road Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nelson earlier told reporters he was taking his bus back
to Texas and might just drape his seven-ribboned Kennedy Center
Honors medal from the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For this one evening, record producer Don Was put together ``The
Willie Nelson Tribute Band'' featuring himself on bass, Mickey
Raphael from Willie's ``Family'' on harmonica, G.E. Smith from
``Saturday Night Live'' and Reggie Young on guitar, Clifford Carter
on keyboards and Steve Jordan on guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the show include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Broadway salute to Kander and Ebb featuring songs from two
of their top hits, ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago.'' Bebe Neuwirth
(familiar as Lillith from ``Cheers'' and ``Frazier'') and Chita
Rivera dance and sing a ``Chicago'' medley and Joel Gray and Liza
Minelli reprise their ``Cabaret'' roles for a nostalgic number.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sinbad's hilarious rag on Cosby. On an evening of effusive
praise, Sinbad's outrageous tales of sharing a foxhole in Vietnam
with Cosby, saving his life and then being treated abominably by
the beloved comedian had Cosby pretending to climb out of his box
seat and later waving a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   _ A heartfelt tribute to Previn by Mia Farrow, his ex-wife.
``Thanks for the music, Toots, and for the memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cronkite recalled Shirley Temple Black from the era of the
Great Depression as ``a little child who lit up the screen, lifted
up the nation and will always be America's princess.'' Later, Jack
Lemmon added his deadpan salute: ``The first drink I ever had was a
Shirley Temple.'' And Henry Kissinger remembered being secretary of
state while the former child star served as U.S. ambassador to
Ghana. Growing up, he had her movies dubbed in German, Kissinger
said, ``so I was surprised when she spoke English _ and without an
accent.''
</P>
<P>
   The show concludes with a bemused Cronkite sharing a stage with
scores of tap-dancing kids as the U.S. Air Force Band plays ``On
the Good Ship Lollipop'' and hundreds of red, white and blue
balloons fall from the ceiling.

   SICKLE _ Twelve-year-old Keone Penn is in a fight for his life,
against an almost unbeatable opponent, sickle cell. The relentless
disease has pushed him into an experimental procedure that may save
his life, and kill the disease _ or kill him. Today, the suburban
Atlanta youth undergoes a cord blood transplant, the first in the
world, at Emory Hospital. If it succeeds, healthy blood cells will
replace his sickle-shaped ones, and he'll live a normal, pain-free
life. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS and

   WOMEN _ On Christmas Eve morning nearly 125 years ago, 70 scared
but very determined women in this charming, quiet town set among
the rolling hills of the Ohio Valley decided to put an end to the
drunken brawls and shattered homes of its community, and set off on
a peaceful march to shut off the flow of liquor from its many
saloons, drugstores and hotels. Historians say that first march,
which soon spurred women to action across America, marks not only
the birth of the temperance movement but of the women's rights
movement in general. Today, some 30 members of the Women's
Christian Temperance Movement will re-enact the march through
downtown and visit the homestead and gravesite of ``Mother
Thompson,'' the Hillsboro matron who started it all. The Temperance
Union says it's still very much alive and needed today, but the
Hillsboro Mayor says development pains and traffic congestion, not
saloons, are the town's chief problem now. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily
News). 35-40. WITH PHOTOS. MOVED

   REVIEW-SIMPLE _ Review of ``A Simple Plan,'' a comedy/crime
thriller about two brothers (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) who
find a bag of money. Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but
simple. It's a character-driven black comedy with some powerful
moral-qualm undercurrents. Expertly played by the ensemble cast.''

   SIMPLE _ Review of ``A Simple Plan.'' A snarl of greed and
paranoia entangles friends and family when three snaggly-toothed
hayseeds find $4 million inside a downed plane. The title, you see,

which Michael Keaton gets a second chance at being a really cool
dad. Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. I'm not making this up.
The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of those

 Christopher Reardon writes frequently about dance for The Village
Voice.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Losing a child is a fate so wrenching that the mere thought of
it can tie a parent's stomach in knots. It can leave one
tongue-tied too, given that there's no better word for it than the
lawyerly predeceased.
</P>
<P>
   A spouse can be widowed, a child orphaned, but how can one
convey the singular grief of the mother and father who must bury
their young?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Susan Marshall, you summon your dancers and create a
work like ``The Most Dangerous Room in the House,'' which opens on
Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater. This
vertiginous 78-minute production, her fifth for the academy's Next
Wave Festival in a decade, revolves around a woman tormented by
visions of a child's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall began working on the piece while expecting her
first child, Nicholas, now 19 months old. ``I wanted to play with
the idea of chaos,'' she said in an interview. ``How do you protect
someone in a world that is essentially chaotic, where you have no
control?''
</P>
<P>
   Forever leaping from the personal to the universal _ and seldom
skittish about tempting fate _ Ms. Marshall turned her worries into
an allegory about fear and its ability to dominate people's lives.
It's this sort of brooding humanism that distinguishes Ms. Marshall
from her leading contemporaries like Stephen Petronio and Mark
Morris, who favor abstraction and musical interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dances are about people,'' she has often said. ``They're
not about dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   That maxim also helps explain her devotion to pedestrian
movement and emotional complexity, traits already evident in the
tentative embraces of ``Arms,'' her signature duet from 1984. They
reappeared in the cruel slaps and repentant caresses of ``Les
Enfants Terribles,'' a 1996 collaboration with the composer Philip
Glass.
</P>
<P>
   Both works won her Bessies, formally known as New York Dance and
Performance Awards, for outstanding choreographic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall, who turned 40 this fall, got her start in Hershey,
Pa., where her parents, a behavioral scientist and a co-founder of
the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Organization for Women,
encouraged her training in gymnastics and ballet. After two years
of modern dance at the Juilliard School, she set out on her own,
forming Susan Marshall and Company a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee last month near her Upper West Side apartment, Ms.
Marshall described ``The Most Dangerous Room in the House'' as a
psychodrama whose fractured story line and frantic atmosphere allow
many interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The title came from a study of bathroom hazards, she said, and
is meant to suggest ``domestic everyday fears'' like drowning,
choking and falling. ``It also hints at the unsettling notion that
the home, the place we're supposed to feel most secure, might not
be such a safe haven after all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When her troupe performed the piece last summer at the Jacob's
Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., audiences saw a central
figure, portrayed by the actress Norma Fire, slam into a wall,
crawl under a chair and brace herself against a whirlwind of seven
airborne aggressors. Shards of spoken text gave glimpses into her
subconscious, as she identified perils looming before a child: an
open window, a brimming bathtub, a sharpened knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as though she's unearthing things _ movements, images,
fragments of her life _ and we're left with the question of how to
interpret them,'' Ms. Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The identity of the child (sometimes called Jean, a play on
gene) remains a mystery to the end. Similarly, whether the dance
represents the loss of a child itself, the remembrance of loss or
the fear of loss is never revealed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dangerous,'' wailing guitar licks and plaintive piano
melodies give shape to some of these uncertainties. David Lang, who
wrote the score, said Ms. Marshall had given him fresh insights
into his own work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan took music I thought I knew inside and out, and she gave
it new emotional life,'' said Lang, a co-founder of the Bang on a
Can All Stars, an experimental music collaborative that will
provide live accompaniment when the troupe performs this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lang singled out a passage he had conceived as ``bittersweet,
beautiful in a naive way.'' In Ms. Marshall's hands, he said, ``It
took on a dark, romantic feel that I never expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's reluctant to accept full credit. The program for
``Dangerous'' attributes the choreography to ``Susan Marshall in
collaboration with the company.'' Few dance makers work in
isolation, but Ms. Marshall is known for drawing her performers
deep into her creative process, which entails long hours of
improvising and talking about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of jumping-off points; a lot of what-if's that
don't go anywhere,'' said Mark DeChiazza, who joined the troupe in
1993. ``But Sue can surprise you the way she takes something from
the day before and adds on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall tried to resist editing with a heavy hand, at least
early on, because she wanted the form to reflect the content. ``I
wanted this piece to be more chaotic,'' she said. ``I wanted to
exert less control and see where that would take the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, she got more disorder than she bargained for.
Susan Blankensop, who had been cast as the central figure, decided
to leave the troupe last year to pursue another career. Changing
tack, Ms. Marshall looked outside the dance world and found Ms.
Fire, 60, an actress who often plays a judge on television's ``Law
and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   The dance was transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that I wouldn't try to look like a dancer, which I
can do,'' Ms. Fire said. ``Instead, let me be a person running
around and never will my toe be pointed.''
</P>
<P>
   With a seasoned actor on hand, Ms. Marshall saw a chance to make
more of the text being written by her husband, Christopher Renino,
a novelist and school teacher. Instead of clarifying the narrative,
his prose adds a new wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   One passage begins, ``The knife split the melon and the halves
rocked back and forth, sugaring the air.'' Ms. Fire delivers the
line several times, substituting and reordering a few words each
time. Changing by degrees, it becomes, ``My husband cut the melon,
rocking me back and forth, sweetening the air with his seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a word game, it's a window on Ms. Marshall's
choreography. Like Renino, she generates lean, evocative images and
strings them together in different combinations to yield subtle
shades of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marshall sees ``The Most Dangerous Room in the House'' as a
metaphor for finding a coherent story of who we are. ``Our inner
lives are a big mush,'' she said. ``It's up to us to figure out
what to make of all these residual experiences, thoughts, and
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her dark palette, Ms. Marshall maintained that she is
neither a worrywart nor a pessimist. ``The flip side to all these
fears is that there are completely fulfilling moments in our lives
that are just as random,'' she said before heading home to Nicholas
and his father. ``They can happen to you at any moment.''

IN AN ERA OF HUMANOID ART, A FORERUNNER FINDS A PLACE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Elizabeth Hayt is an art historian and critic.  
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing to his death in 1996,
Duane Hanson sought to create in fiberglass and resin a catalogue
of American social types _ the tourist, the waitress, the cowboy.
Shamelessly realistic and reeking of pathos, Hanson's life-size
figures, their verisimilitude enhanced by props suggesting a
narrative, were widely popular. But they never received critical
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   To some, his sculptures seemed gimmicky, even hokey. Like a blip
in the history of modern art, Hanson's renditions of weary, forlorn
middle Americans might easily have been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Hanson's figures no longer seem anachronistic or
insignificant. In view of the current rage for hyper-realistic
figuration among 90s artists, particularly the widespread use of
mannequins, Hanson's men, women and children _ so lifelike they
have actually been mistaken for real people _ seem right up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a retrospecitive of his work, ``Duane Hanson: A Survey
of His Work From the 1930s to the 90s,'' opens on Thursday at the
Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always felt Duane Hanson is a love that dare not speak
its name,'' said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New
York University who included the artist in his list of ``the best
of 1997'' for Artforum. ``He's been rediscovered by serious people.
He's the father of virtual reality, humanoids, or substitute
humans. Without him, everyone from Robert Gober, Charlie Ray and
Vanessa Beecroft would be unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum said that Hanson's figures also touched on the issues
of cloning and what it meant to be human today. ``Reality is just a
facsimile now,'' he said. ``When it gets down to human beings, it's
creepy and topical. Duane Hanson is in tune with much of the art of
the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a movement _ first identified as mannequin art by the
artist Mike Kelley in ``The Uncanny,'' a 1993 show he organized _
has been gaining momentum in the 90s. Mannequins made their debut
in Eugene Atget's pre-World War I photographs of store windows,
reappearing in later Surrealist work like Hans Bellmer's dolls.
</P>
<P>
   A resurgence of mannequins, as well as figures cast from life,
occurred in the 60s in the sculptural tableaux of George Segal,
Edward Kienholz, John de Andrea, Yayoi Kusama and, of course,
Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   In the 70s, Dennis Oppenheim continued the tradition, and in the
late 80s, Laurie Simmons's photographs of female mannequin legs
perched atop objects like a house, a camera or an hourglass
provided feminist commentary on the objectification and
domestication of women. At the same time, Cindy Sherman's use of
medical prosthetics in her photographs took the theme to a
grotesque extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But today, more artists than ever are relying on artificial
human surrogates, whether actual mannequins or trompe l'oeil
figural sculptures, to question what is ultimately real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fake body is a permanent body at a time when real
bodies seem enormously fragile,'' said Robert Storr, a curator in
the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern
Art, explaining why mannequins and similarly life-like
representations are proliferating. ``With the AIDS crisis, along
with a culture that is so focused on youth, prosperity and infinite
horizons, the reminder that people age and die is a cold shower. A
lot of work about the body has to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   British artists seem particularly drawn to mannequin-style
figures as a way to memorialize human beings. In ``Sensation,'' a
show at the Royal Academy of Arts in London last year, Ron Mueck,
40, created a stir with ``Dead Dad,'' (1996), a three-foot
reproduction of his father's naked corpse presented on a low
plinth.
</P>
<P>
   Made from a clay model cast in silicone, the extraordinarily
detailed figure, complete with individual strands of synthetic
hair, was meant to commemorate the passing of Mueck's father, who
died of cancer that year. But with its elegiac tone and diminutive
scale, the work also suggests the physical vulnerability and loss
of dignity that accompany the body's passage from life to death.
</P>
<P>
   On a more mischevious note, two British artists, Dinos Chapman,
32, and his brother, Jake, 36, delight in rendering a freaky
alternative to mortality. In their 1997 installation, ``Six Feet
Under,'' at the Gagosian Gallery in SoHo, they transformed the
space into a massive grave, creating an underworld filled with
``zygotic'' figures, as the artists call their fiberglass and resin
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Looking as if they have been struck with a particularly virulent
strain of erotomania, these androgynous, child-size mutants,
wearing only sneakers and wigs, sprout extra limbs and heads, as
well as genitals in unlikely places _ phalluses project from
orifices, navels and noses.
</P>
<P>
   A vision of sex and science gone awry, the work is a spoof of a
future of bio-engineered bodies that can be replicated but that
cannot reproduce. ``Our work is cyber-erotica,'' said Jake Chapman.
``The human body is obsolete. We take pleasure in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr finds many connotations in such mannequin art. ``The
mannequin is under the complete control of the person looking at
it, but it can never offer a response,'' he said. ``It cannot
interact. It's morbid eroticism or sci-fi eroticism, a kind of J.G.
Ballard eroticism.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This sort of virtual eroticism surrounds Charles Ray's mannequin
sculptures. A retrospective of his work is on view at the Los
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art through March 14. In 1990, Ray,
now 45, created ``Male Mannequin,'' one of his first works to
incorporate a standard department store dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the figure's Ken-doll-like features, it is startling.
The mannequin's perfected physique is thrown off kilter by its
all-too-real looking genitals _ cast from Ray's body _ that the
artist has added.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McCarthy, 53, conjures a different kind of virtual reality
with his mechanized mannequin installations that he first began in
the mid-80s. His fabricated realities have all the imaginative fun
of a Disney theme park but none of its innocence. In ``Yaa-Hoo
Town,'' his 1996 installation at Luhring Augustine Gallery, he
created an X-rated version of the Wild West with robotic cowboys
and bar maids, some with oversize human heads, others with animal
faces, all are made of fiberglass and resin.
</P>
<P>
   They booze it up, masturbate and sodomize one another in a
makeshift saloon and bunk house, accompanied by the sounds of
ragtime music, distant gunshots and a train whistle. By
constructing his installation with deliberate shoddiness, allowing
the mechanics and motors of the moving figures to remain visible
and painting the forms bright, cartoon colors, McCarthy slyly mocks
the seamlessness of places like Disneyland and Hollywood that are
his inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, with Mickey Mouse in mind, Maurizio Cattelan, 38, an
Italian artist who lives in New York, staged a performance at the
Museum of Modern Art featuring a living mannequin dressed as
Picasso. An actor wearing a giant, comic book-style head of the
artist greeted visitors entering the museum. Recasting Picasso as a
Magic Kingdom idol, Cattelan's performance toyed with the exchange
between fine art and popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not poking fun at Picasso,'' said Laura Hoptman,
assistant curator at the Modern, who organized the performance.
``It's poking at the face in the Microsoft ads.'' Whereas Cattelan
creates a hybrid of man and mannequin, Vanessa Beecroft, 29,
another Italian-born artist who lives in New York, inverts the
relationship altogether, taking mannequin art one step further.
</P>
<P>
   If store dummies function as substitutes for humans, Ms.
Beecroft challenges humans to act like mannequins in her
performance art.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, she staged ``Show'' at the Guggenheim Museum,
presenting 20 statuesque female models, five of whom were nude save
for ruby red rhinestone stilettos. The rest, similarly shod, wore
crimson string bikinis. The models also wore body make-up, which
gave their skin an artificial, idealized appearance. The women,
arranged in a loose grid formation in the rotunda of the museum,
stood in place for three hours, occasionally stretching, shifting
legs or sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does a double take entering one of Vanessa's
performances,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, her dealer. ``It's unclear
whether you're looking at artificial mannequins or real people.
It's a strong, unique vision about identity in the contemporary
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusing the classical ideal of beauty with the glamour and
spectacle of a fashion show, Ms. Beecroft uses
models-cum-mannequins as a girl-power attempt to reclaim and
perhaps glorify the mindless superficiality associated with
representations of femininity today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many contemporary artists using mannequins and similarly
lifelike figures to question the distinction between artifice and
reality, Hanson's sculptures presage much recent art. Not that
Hanson saw himself as a forerunner of art to come. And today's
artists are certainly not quick to point to him as a source. But by
recognizing aspects of his work that have hitherto gone unnoticed,
contemporary artists inadvertently establish a lineage to him. In
addition, they also identify a pre-occupation of late-20th-century
art: virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanson carries the spectacle of reality further than
mannequins,'' said McCarthy, the artist. ``I'm kind of fooled by
his things. You walk up to them in a room slowly. You almost
believe their realism. It has to do with the inability to
distinguish between reality and a reflection of reality. They're
hyper-real. That's what makes them interesting today.''

LESSONS IN PEACE FROM THE HORRORS OF BAROQUE BATTLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, DEC. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Theodore K. Rabb is a professor of history at Princeton
University.  
 By THEODORE K. RABB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 250 years, until the carnage of our own century,
the Thirty Years War of 1618-1648 set the standard in Europe for
bloodshed, fanaticism and brutality. Confusing in its chronology
and appalling in its deliberate assaults on civilian life, the war
fully deserved its reputation as one of the darkest episodes in
Western history.
</P>
<P>
   Starting primarily as a bitter religious struggle, it gradually
became a naked clash for power among increasingly aggressive states
of Europe and ravaged much of modern-day Germany. For one
distinguished historian, Veronica Wedgwood, writing in the
appeasement-stricken England of the 1930s, this ``futile'' struggle
was ``the outstanding example in European history of meaningless
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   If that bleak conclusion no longer holds, it is because we have
come to recognize in recent years that the reaction by
contemporaries to the horrors of the war changed assumptions and
attitudes beyond recall, and that this reorientation was to propel
Europe toward the modern age. Even if we view the year merely as a
marker of political change, 1648 belongs in the same league as
other milestone dates, like 1066 and 1789, because the peace
treaties hammered out that year not only proved to be entirely new
kinds of diplomatic agreements but also created a system of
international relations that survived until World War II.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate these treaties on their 350th anniversary, a vast
exhibition has been mounted in three sites in Munster and
Osnabruck, the Westphalian cities where the negotiators spent much
of the 1640s and where they finally signed their accords.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, sponsored by the Council of Europe and made up
of some 1,500 items, opened on Oct. 24 with ceremonies that
featured the combatants' descendants in the persons of 10 kings and
queens and 11 other heads of state, including Vaclav Havel as well
as a prince and a grand duke.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than a recollection of the events of 1648, it reaches
back into the 16th-century origins of the fighting; it concludes
with a chilling display of Nazi interpretations of the peace; and
in between it suggests how Europe's political, military and
artistic cultures were transformed by the ravages of a seemingly
endless war.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful Dominican church in Osnabruck, now converted into
an art museum, establishes the historical background with a display
of paintings, printed broadsides and sculpture that evoke the
bitter confessional conflict among Roman Catholics, Lutherans and
Calvinists. Virulent propaganda rarely inspires great art, and this
was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic ``Ship of the Church,'' attributed to Jacob Loef,
carries revered biblical figures, including Jesus crucified on a
mast, and is followed by a dozen or so little men identified as
Luther, Hus and other heretics. Fully clothed, waist deep in the
water and vainly brandishing weapons, they seem more absurd than
serious in their threat to the Church.
</P>
<P>
   On the Protestant side is a crude anonymous painting of a monk
making love to a nun, their union blessed with tiny monster progeny
and various symbols of lust, all presided over by a benign,
red-nosed pope.
</P>
<P>
   Liturgical artifacts and church scenes expand on the differences
among the faiths, but one is caught short by the sudden sight of an
authentic masterpiece, Bernini's bust of Pope Urban VIII from the
Louvre. Deep in contemplation, the shrewd and cultured pontiff,
dressed in an exquisitely detailed cape and hat, seems almost out
of place surrounded by the products of fierce confessional strife,
especially as he became an advocate of peace and compromise in the
1630s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is salutary to be reminded of the dignity of the faiths _
here and in the depictions of church buildings _ amid the hatreds
that their bitter rivalries aroused.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, Osnabruck's main museum houses a
record of the chief personalities and events of the war. The most
dazzling portrait (even in the company of Velazquez and Rubens) is
a gleaming Van Dyck of the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola, whose
intelligence shines through an awkward pose in full armor and ruff.
</P>
<P>
   But the most vivid personality is the Swedish King, Gustavus
Adolphus, the Lion of the North, who saved the Protestant cause as
he swept through Germany until felled in battle. Gustavus never did
well in his painted portraits, but there is a monumental bronze
bust by Hans von der Putt that suggests his charismatic power; a
vicious sword that one suspects he wielded with murderous accuracy,
and a battle plan he drew that reflects his mastery of the art of
war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the overall effect of the scenes of fighting and the
townscapes, the portraits and the broadsides is to demonstrate the
steady decline of the religious passions that had prompted the war.
Here was one of the major shifts of the age, as politics and
territorial ambition (not to mention loot) became driving forces
for the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez's ``Surrender of Breda,'' perhaps the greatest work
the conflict inspired, could not be lent by the Prado, but it
adorns the catalog, and its portrayal of the Catholic Spinola
gently comforting the Calvinist Dutch commander emphasizes the
dwindling pleasure of victory, even over religious antagonists. And
the Dutch response after they recaptured Breda, Hendrick de Meyer's
``Withdrawal of the Spanish Garrison,'' is a calm country scene,
surveyed by a peasant and his dog, with covered wagons quietly
passing by on a fine autumn day.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the peace conference had to be split between
Protestant Osnabruck and Catholic Munster, and that Pope Innocent X
(also present in a Bernini bust) was to denounce the treaties as
``invalid, iniquitous, damnable, inane'' for their concessions to
the Protestants; but it is more significant that the pope's
fulminations were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The last room in Osnabruck, in the harsh new wing of the museum
normally devoted to the art of the Holocaust victim Friedrich
Nussbaum, surveys later reactions to the war and draws particular
attention to the Nazi response. In the 1930s and early 40s,
Westphalia was compared to Versailles _ the treaties by which
France had crushed German hopes, but which now were to be
overturned. The xenophobia and arrogance remind one of the new
fanaticisms and hatreds that replaced religious passions in
national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour train ride to the south (messages took a day to
cover the same distance in the 1640s), in Munster's Landesmuseum,
the larger implications of the conflict occupy 35 rooms, each
devoted to a different theme.
</P>
<P>
   In one breathtaking display of Baroque exuberance, all the major
protagonists are assembled: two popes in busts by Bernini, the
leaders of Spain in austere full-length portraits by Velazquez, the
Dutch leader in a robust Van Dyck, a charming Christina of Sweden
by Bourdon, a corpulent and disheveled Christian of Denmark by
Karel van Mander and half a dozen stiff princely figures.
</P>
<P>
   The one blaze of color in this self-consciously stoic gathering
is Cardinal Richelieu, resplendent in his robes in a full-length
painting by Philippe de Champagne from the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   This was the public face of the war. More revealing of its
reality are the rooms devoted to its social consequences. A
harrowing display of the omnipresence of atrocity, plague and
hunger includes a cart and coffin for a plague victim that has
survived from the 1620s.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome images include a finely polished ivory by Leonard
Kern of a man eating a human leg and vicious scenes of civilians
tortured by soldiers. It is here that one sees the roots of those
other fundamental changes brought about by the war. For it was the
revulsion at the bloodshed and depravity that prompted the
determination, finally, to establish tighter military discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to stricter organization, more formal training and the
isolation of troops into barracks, all of which accelerated after
the war, civilian and battle casualties fell dramatically during
the century that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a more comprehensive, formal international
system was also a means of restraining the horrors. The
aristocratic faces of the dozens of peace negotiators are on view,
as are the elegantly sealed documents they signed.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at them, one realizes that only their persistence _
remaining in this corner of Europe for seven years to resolve all
the issues _ enabled the peace congresses to put back in the bottle
the genie of unrestrained aggression that had been spawned by the
new capabilities of gunpowder warfare and the new ambitions of the
territorial state.
</P>
<P>
   These statesmen redrew the map of Europe, and in the process
they revolutionized diplomacy. Gerard ter Borch's famous painting
of the decisive moment, the signing ceremony in Munster, comes to
life when one crosses the Cathedral square to the city hall where
it took place, in a room that still looks as it did in 1648. It is
a numinous reminder of the transformation of politics and warfare.
</P>
<P>
   No less compelling is the evidence of the war's impact on the
artistic sensibilities of the age. This was one of the great
periods of European art, and its most sensitive practitioners
recoiled from the slaughter and desolation they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Callot's grim series on the ``Miseries of War'' sets the
tone; less obviously, Mathieu Le Nain's haunting version of a genre
scene, ``Argument Over a Card Game,'' takes on layers of meaning as
we notice the competing symbols of military and civilian life, the
readiness to spill blood and the somber, exhausted faces of the
soldiers. Even more resonant are a pair of desolate paintings by
George de La Tour: ``John the Baptist in the Desert'' and ``Job and
His Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven from his native Lorraine by the conflict, La Tour shows
John in depressed solitude, and his gaunt figure of Job stares
blankly as his wife tells him, ``Curse God and die.'' We see these
paintings differently in the context of an agonizing, consuming
war.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the artists also embodied their generation's most
urgent pleas for peace. Velazquez's ``Breda'' had an antiwar
message; so did Rubens's design for the entry of the
Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, the new ruler of the southern
Netherlands, into Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   And the final room in Munster, centered on Rubens's lush ``Peace
and War,'' makes the case unmistakably. The sunny, fruitful world
of Peace dominates the painting, while in the background Minerva
pushes Mars away into the dark world of furies and war. Mars looks
over his shoulder in amazement at the pleasures of Peace, which
seem to be organized for the benefit of two young girls (as it
happens, portraits of the children of one of Rubens's friends, a
personal touch that indicates the strength of the artist's
feelings).
</P>
<P>
   But it was not enough merely to hope for the future. The very
agenda of art, which hitherto had so often celebrated the glory of
war and its heroes, subtly changed as well. A quiet landscape by
Claude Lorrain that hangs amid cavalry engagements and sorties
gives one a foretaste of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion and drama of the Baroque were about to give way to
the more formal and restrained esthetic of Classicism and Rococo,
and it may not be too much to suggest that the experience of 30
years of brutality helped encourage that shift in sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog for this rich and multifaceted exhibition is a huge
and handsome hardback, modestly priced, beautifully illustrated and
flawed only in its skimpy index. For those who cannot get to
Westphalia by Jan. 17, it offers a glimpse of what is on offer: a
stirring encounter with one of the most creative as well as violent
ages in European history, illuminated by art both great and
ordinary, and by a swirl of people and events that echo long after
they are seen no more.

 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Westheimer was having a ``teachable moment'' _ her
third in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Her size 4 patent-leather pumps were planted in the everyday
green carpet of an out-of-the-way storeroom at Christie's, the New
York auction house usually thought of as prim, proper, perhaps even
prudish _ anything but an 88,000-square-foot erogenous zone.
</P>
<P>
   What had the relentlessly chirpy sex therapist sounding giddy
was a palm-size piece of reddish terra cotta, an 1,800-year-old oil
lamp. It was probably nothing special when it was made: the
first-century equivalent of a mass-produced table lamp with a
three-way bulb. More Macy's than Louis Comfort Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's might think twice about selling this Roman lamp, though.
It shows people having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's _ which has sold everything from Napoleon's hair to
Madonna's bustier to General George Custer's railroad pass, not to
mention countless Monets, Matisses and Picassos _ has no such
qualms.
</P>
<P>
   The trove of ancient erotic art it plans to sell on Thursday
includes dozens of objects made between 500 B.C. and 400 A.D. that
cannot be described in detail in a family newspaper. There are
couples coupling and single guys who would be the envy of
modern-day single guys _ and who could have been bigger
scene-stealers than the one in last season's sculpture-class
episode of ``Ally McBeal.'' If only they had lived another 2,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the terms Christie's uses to describe these items in its
80-page catalogue do not appear in most dictionaries. Quick: What
is a symplegma?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting departure from our usual sales,'' G. Max
Bernheimer, the head of Christie's antiquities department, declared
with martini-dry understatement. (By the way, he learned the word
symplegma from a Brooklyn Museum catalogue entry describing a group
of intertwined figures.)
</P>
<P>
   Cataloguing erotica has spared him those awkward
you-do-(italics)what(end italics)-at-work conversations at dinner
parties. ``My wife would say, `Tell them about the collection,' ''
he said, ``and I'd be talking about sex and positions with people
I'd never met.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was pretty much what he did with Dr. Westheimer, the
Sorbonne-trained psychologist who became a kind of cultural icon in
the 1980s. The Sister Wendy of sexuality, she ushered in the new
age of freer, franker talk about sex on radio and television _ and
was endlessly parodied for her limitless enthusiasm and for having
an accent only a psychologist could have.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard about the sale, she volunteered _ begged would
not be too strong a word _ for a show-and-tell session with
Bernheimer.
</P>
<P>
   As so often seems to happen with Dr. Westheimer, it began with
her doing the showing and telling. Minutes after she sailed into
Christie's, she handed Bernheimer a copy of a coffee-table book
called ``The Art of Arousal'' (Artabras, 1993). She said she had
written it with an art historian from a major museum _ ``a real
scholar.'' But the art historian's name is nowhere on the title
page. The museum did not want him associated with anything so racy,
she said. Besides, she knows the material herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruth Westheimer did her homework,'' she declared. ``I was
ahead of Christie's.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Christie's has Dr. Westheimer punctuating every sentence
with the word fabulous, which she pronounces the way she did on the
radio: ``FAH-buh-luss.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are no microphones or on-the-air signs in
Bernheimer's storeroom, only floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with
Greek and Roman statues. Near the door is a 17-inch-long bronze
lion's head. Nothing prurient there; Christie's says it is worth at
least $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   On a table in the center of the room were the items that had Dr.
Westheimer talking about ``teachable moments.'' She was so
intrigued when Bernheimer handed her Lot No. 103, a Roman terra
cotta figure of a woman (nude, except for a garland in her hair and
her large round earrings), that she dropped No. 152, a Babylonian
plaque with a lovemaking scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that she's not a la Hollywood,'' Dr. Westheimer said of
the woman in No. 103. ``She's a little plump. She's not
embarrassed. She's posing for the sculptor not as a come-on, but
for herself. Not for the benefit of a man. The perfect role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the table were several phalluses. ernheimer expects a
fourth-century one made of limestone to go for $1,000 to $1,500.
Before he could say anything about a somewhat older glass beaker in
the shape of a phallus or a gnomelike Egyptian figurine from the
fourth century B.C., Dr. Westheimer delivered her by-now familiar
size-does-not-matter lecture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The term that seems to be favored is macrophallic,''
Bernheimer said when she finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Means big?'' Dr. Westheimer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bernheimer blushed.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bernheimer's preview had a serious side: he
wowed Dr. Westheimer with scholarly erudition. Before Hugh Hefner,
Calvin Klein ads for leave-nothing-to-the-imagination jeans and
Howard Stern, the Egyptians, Romans and Greeks thought nothing of
showing elements of eroticism, from flirtation and seduction
through consummation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 20th-century curators are descendants not only of the
Romans and Greeks but of prudish Victorians, who relegated ancient
erotica to unseen back rooms in the Naples Museum, the Museum
Secretum within the British Museum and the Museum of Fine Art in
Boston (a turn-of-the-century Boston benefactor enjoyed shocking
the bluebloods, Bernheimer said).
</P>
<P>
   ``In this context it is not surprising that Egyptian erotica
were for the most part passed over in silence,'' Bernheimer writes
in the sale catalogue, ``and as a result, there is little in the
literature on this subject.'' Roman literature, Bernheimer noted,
told more. Ovid reported in the poem ``Tristia'' that wealthy
Romans' houses were decorated with erotic images.
</P>
<P>
   Those images are surprisingly valuable today: Various bronze and
terra cotta depictions of Roman fertility gods have estimated
values of $3,000 to $7,000. Lot No. 88, a gold-and-onyx cameo
earring ($4,000 to $6,000) showed a scene that fascinated later
masters like Leonardo da Vinci: Leda and the swan.
</P>
<P>
   Given the unusual nature of the material, the estimates may be
more off than pre-sale values often are. ``It's supply and demand,
and we don't know what demand will be,'' Bernheimer said. A plain
Roman lamp would go for $200, he said, but he is betting that one
with an erotic image will command five to eight times that.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Westheimer said that the image on one such lamp might have
provided inspiration for a husband whose wife might once have
looked like the figure on the lamp. ``Now she is fat after
children,'' she said. ``This shows him a Playboy model.''
</P>
<P>
   And a playmate of eternity at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case,'' Bernheimer said, ``the Playboy model is
Aphrodite, after her bath.'' Next Bernheimer brought out No. 38,
another Roman lamp with an estimated sale price of $2,500 to
$3,500. ``A foursome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Westheimer looked at it through a magnifying glass. ``All
right,'' she said. ``Three men for her. Not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernheimer cloaked his reply in history. ``There are depictions
of even more from the suburban baths at Pompeii,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Westheimer moved the magnifying glass closer. ``Amazing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernheimer said, ``In my field, scholarship tends to look at her
as a prostitute.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Westheimer nodded. ``Probably,'' she said. ``An adulteress
would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernheimer moved on to Lot No. 79, perhaps the most valuable in
the sale, a pair of bronze bedpost fittings. Bernheimer told Dr.
Westheimer that the woman has lost her head. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would present a problem for me,'' she declared. ``You
need the brain. The brain is the most important aphrodisiac.'' A
pause, then her refrain: ``I could use this for a teachable
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went for another hour or so. As she left Bernheimer's
storeroom, she said that looking at erotic art was not itself
erotic. Indeed, her only moment of unexpected passion (no, not
(italics)that(end italics) kind of unexpected passion) came in a
corridor when, after saying goodbye to Bernheimer, she passed a
burly-looking mover pushing a statue that looked like Rodin's ``The
Thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodin?'' she declared. ``Stop! I want to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mover stopped. She placed her hands on the top of the
statue. And then, satisfied, she left for lunch.

WASHINGTON BASKETBALL TEAM FAILING `BENDER TEST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Washington Huskies have lost three straight
basketball games, something that has not happened around here since
1994-95. They are 4-3. They are doomed to drop out of the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   From No. 14 to No. 16 to No. 22 to off the radar screen, the
Huskies' stature has slid faster than firefighters down a greased
pole.
</P>
<P>
   And the icing on the cake? Wednesday, the Dawgs came limping
back to Montlake from that little city by the river, Spokane, where
the mighty Gonzaga Bulldogs sank their canines deep into the necks
of the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Gonzaga is the ancestral home of John Stockton, which
gives it good hard-court karma. And the Bulldogs' coach, Dan
Monson, will one day get his shot at a Pac-10 job, so there is no
embarrassment in losing to a coach and program hellbent on putting
themselves squarely, rightfully, on the college-basketball map.
</P>
<P>
   Still, is that blood on the tracks of the so recently darling
Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   With college basketball enjoying an unprecedented run as top dog
in the NBA-less land of America, it makes the Huskies' drop off the
Billboard chart a much greater disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive Deon Luton was 1-for-9 against Gonzaga on the
heels of a serious Houdini act against UConn in the Great Eight
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Thalo Green has looked like a shadow of the stalwart forward who
helped drive the Huskies to their NCAA splendor last March.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dickau and Senque Carey are trying hard to be Top 25-caliber
point guards, but the Huskies are showing their youth in that
most-critical position. Without the defensively proficient Donald
Watts (ankle sprain) the Huskies lacked so much identity, Gonzaga
not only creamed the Dawgs but also stole their drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Todd MacCulloch's soft hands and 28 points could not cover the
multitude of other breakdowns that apparently prompted Husky coach
Bob Bender to vigorously exercise his vocal chords in the postgame
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   If not for one very specific, very good reason _ Bender _
college basketball enthusiasts around here would have no choice but
to figure the Huskies are hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Bender _ in whom we all trust _ who decreed that this
sort of trial by fire was the sort of test his team needed.
</P>
<P>
   From the Big Island Tournament victory in Hawaii to an
all-nighter flight to Chicago to gritty little pit stops in Boise
and Spokane, Bender has tried to test his team the way Patton once
tested his Army troops.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with that test is it might have provided the
very answer we all suspected about the Huskies: They truly are not
that resilient. They might have ridden a hot streak in last
spring's Sweet 16 that elevated expectations beyond the their level
of competitive will and, to some degree, talent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we want to hammer the poor fellas, who so recently
spoke of their Pac-10 championship aspirations. That's why they
have Bender.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic, demanding and dynamic coach was, we have to
guess, prepared to take whatever lumps came out of the six-game,
11-day ``Road Warrior'' experiment. If the Huskies are to have a
Top 25 reputation, it's better to get it parboiled early.
</P>
<P>
   That is the trend in college basketball these days. And this
season, there seems to have been an extra premium placed on
big-game preseason match-ups. We have been fed such a rich and
steady diet of great games this autumn, we are all destined to be
fattened like a Christmas goose before the conference schedules
even begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   Duke-Cincinnati. Stanford-Maryland. Carolina-Stanford.
UConn-Michigan State. UCLA-Oklahoma State. Kansas-Iowa.
Indiana-Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The list of great games reads like a who's who in college
basketball, thanks largely to the growing number of big-money TV
tournaments and the rabid desire by schools to solidify their
ever-important power rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pitfalls for teams taking on too much, too soon,
especially if its confidence emerges like something pushed through
a wood chipper.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us around here are still prepared to settle in for a
long, glorious winter of Washington games that really, really
matter. And at this point, the Huskies can take some solace in what
other Top 25 teams have done this November and December.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of the Top 25 teams have already lost this season. It
proves parity lives among the senior-depleted ranks of college
hoops. It shows that undefeated streaks produced last season by
Stanford and Utah were flukes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Duke has already lost to the Bearcats, while mighty
North Carolina got bounced by the College of Charleston, and while
Stanford is already 0-2 against the ACC, the Huskies' three-game
slide is different.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is still in a position where it must build upon its
success of last March. That is what a program on the upswing must
accomplish, yet so far, the preseason ``Bender Test'' has revealed
the Dawgs are not keeping up with the big dogs.

GALLOWAY TIRES OF LOST AND FOUND TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Joey Galloway is frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Catching two long touchdown passes in the first quarter of a
game and then having no receptions for the next three quarters will
do that. But Galloway's disenchantment goes beyond what happened in
Sunday's one-point loss to the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   That now-you-find-him, now-you-don't scenario was the latest
example of what has been a season-long problem for Galloway and the
Seahawks offense.
</P>
<P>
   When an opponent attempts to defend Galloway with one
cornerback, the Seahawks can't wait to get him the ball. But when
the same burned-and-learned opponent reverts to playing well off
Galloway and using a second player to help cover him, the Seahawks
can't find a way to get him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Sunday. That's what has been happening all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is driving me nuts, and it has been driving me nuts,''
Galloway said Wednesday. ``When I get single coverage, I beat my
man. When I get double coverage, we just tend to go other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's game against San Diego at the Kingdome _ the
14th game of the season _ the Seahawks continue to wring their
hands about finding ways to get the ball into Galloway's hands.
Just as they have been doing since making him the eighth pick
overall in the 1995 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a plan to get the ball to him, which we
always have a plan to get it to him. But you've got to get it to
him, too,'' coach Dennis Erickson said. ``Sometimes we have, and
sometimes we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Who's at fault here?
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna tried to shoulder all the blame Wednesday. But this
goes beyond a young quarterback still learning to give his best
receiver time to get open against double coverage. It involved the
play-calling, and Galloway also must accept some of the burden.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing his talents. Galloway has used his unique
combination of incredible speed, remarkable quickness and deceptive
strength to average 33.1 yards on his 34 career touchdown
receptions. Since the start of the '95 season, only Minnesota's
Cris Carter (49), Green Bay's Antonio Freeman (43) and Atlanta's
Tony Martin (36) have caught more touchdown passes than Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he is averaging 41.1 yards on eight touchdown
catches, including his 70- and 57-yard scoring plays against the
Jets. But Galloway has just 50 receptions, a pace that will produce
a 61-catch season _ the second-lowest of his career in a season
that started with talk of Galloway becoming a 100-catch receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting the big play, which is what it's all about as far
as that part is concerned,'' Erickson said. ``But we've also got to
get him the ball underneath where he can run with it a little bit,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, we work at it,'' offensive coordinator Bob
Bratkowski. ``I carry a list around every week in case (Galloway)
is not getting the ball through the normal process of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the list isn't long enough. At the top is the go route.
Few, if any, receivers in the league can put the go in a go-route
like Galloway. But when the go won't go because of double coverage,
the Seahawks have to use other routes, shorter routes, to get
Galloway open and involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey's certainly one of the guys you try to take away from
Seattle. But you can only do so much. Sooner or later, he gets
you,'' Chargers coach June Jones said Wednesday. ``You can't do it
the whole game. You've got to keep mixing it. ... But sooner or
later, they can formation you and put you in different things where
you can't get a double on him.''
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't it happen more often? That's what many, including
Galloway, are wondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to call plays that beat those double coverages,'' he
said. ``You've got to take what they give you. At times, when a
defense takes away some things from us, we tend to say, `OK, we'll
try other things.' Instead of saying, `We're going to do what we
do. You give us your best shot and we're still going to do what we
do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Five 10-yard outs or slants are just as effective as a 50-yard
pass. But if that's what the defense is going to give Galloway, the
Seahawks have to be able to take it.
</P>
<P>
   However, it takes more than speed to be effective running slants
across the middle or out patterns in the flat. At 5-foot-11 and 188
pounds, Galloway is not the biggest or most physical receiver
around. He isn't as adept at catching the ball while covered in the
middle of the field as he is at blowing past defenders while
running up the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway also isn't the most vocal player on the team. When
running back Ricky Watters feels he isn't getting the ball enough,
everyone in the stadium is aware of it. When Galloway feels
slighted, he is more likely to brood silently.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway did confront Erickson after last week's game, and Kitna
went to Galloway Wednesday and told him to be more forceful with
him as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Joey, `I'm just trying to start understanding how to
get you the ball,''' Kitna said. ``Heck, if he's in the third
quarter and he feels like he's not getting the ball, I'd love for
him to come and tell me that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kitna, he has been thrust into a difficult situation. If
he knows Galloway is occupying two defenders on one side of the
field, it means Mike Pritchard, James McKnight, tight end Christian
Fauria or Watters will be getting single coverage elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take full responsibility for it,'' said Kitna, who will make
his third start of the season this week. ``I just haven't gotten to
the point yet to understand that, yeah, the defense may be giving
me the hitch over here, but at the same time they could be giving
me a 12-yard curl with Joey. ... It isn't bad to go to the other
guys, but at the same time I have to get the ball to Joey. You get
the ball to No. 84 and he's going to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams are not going to stop using double coverage on Galloway.
As Erickson put it, ``The problem is, he's got a number on him.
They identify that number and they double him. They can double him
if he's in the stands if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Seahawks must make a commitment to getting
Galloway the ball even when he is being dogged by two defensive
backs. And they had better start this week against the Chargers'
No. 1-ranked defense that has not allowed a 100-yard rusher all
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely frustrating,'' Galloway said. ``Especially
because we're not winning. It's another year where it looks like
we'll be heading home for the holidays. With the talent we have
that shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, with the talent Galloway has he should never go three
quarters without catching a pass.

CHARLES DICKENS STILL DRAWS A CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday Dec. 17)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The celebration of Chistmas was on the decline in England at the
beginning of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The singing of carols had nearly disappeared, and because the
holiday traditions combined pagan and Germanic traditions, such as
yule logs and decorating trees, they were criticized by the
Puritans. Also, with the Industrial Revolution, adults and children
alike worked long hours in factories.
</P>
<P>
   It was a grim, gray period, with little time or money for
frivolity.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, however, like a thaw after a heavy frost, signs of
Christmas began to re-emerge. Christmas cards appeared in the
1840s.
</P>
<P>
   And, in December 1843, English author Charles Dickens, a young
man of 31, finished what he called a ``Ghostly little book,''
intended to ``raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my
readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the
season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly ...''
</P>
<P>
   The first printing of the book sold out, and 2,000 copies were
on reserve before the second printing.
</P>
<P>
   So it is, then, that in December 1998, my 7-year-old and I found
ourselves milling about outside the Alliance Theatre Company of
Atlanta, queuing up for their annual production of ``A Christmas
Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   This multicultural version of the play, which includes gospel
music and a Ghost of Christmas Present with knee-length dreadlocks,
has been a holiday tradition at the Alliance for nine years,
meaning that Dickens can still pack a theater house more than 100
years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   While the characters may reflect a broader community, the period
costumes and dialogue stay true to Dickens' version of the
moralistic tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This immortal story ... embraces the idea that you can get up
in the morning and start your life newly inspired,'' says Kenny
Leon, artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning is as clear, and as vital, today as it was in
turn-of-the-century England.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam and I settled into our seats, the lights dimmed to find
a beggar woman singing softly, an a cappella carol. Soon, Scrooge
appears, and his stingy ways become apparent as he limits his
good-hearted clerk Bob Cratchit to one small piece of coal and a
half-day off for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Adam enjoyed the arrival of the Spirits _ a bouncy, fun-filled
woman-child in a red dress to guide Scrooge through his past; a
bagpipe-toting Rastafarian Spirit of Christmas Present, spreading
good will; and a silent, towering Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.
(``Answer me one question,'' pleads Scrooge. ``Are these the
shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things
that May be, only?'')
</P>
<P>
   To my disappointment, a powerful section of the novel never
makes it into theatrical adaptations, probably because of the
practical hardships of showing hundreds of chained and shackled
phantoms floating outside Scrooge's window.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pivotal moment when Scrooge realizes that, ``The misery
with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for
good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite lines, whether in Dickens' prose or theatrical
dialogue, were in evidence that night as Jacob Marley, dead these
long seven years, tries to convince Scrooge to change his selfish
ways.
</P>
<P>
   These are the thoughts I will carry with me into the holiday
season, the words that echoed within my heart as I left the
theater, holding my son's hand and stepping into the windy Atlanta
night:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Marley moans, ``not to know that any man working kindly
in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life
too short for its vast means of usefulness. Not to know that no
space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunities,
misused.

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip President Clinton will make a historic
visit here Monday in hopes of witnessing the removal of a major
irritant in the quest for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He is coming to see that leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization reaffirm a letter that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat wrote to Clinton in January. The letter outlines which
portions of the Palestine National Charter, the 30-year-old mission
statement of the PLO, have been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   The charter debate is one of the most stubborn snags in the
troubled five-year-old Oslo peace process that officially began
with the September 1993 signing of accords by Arafat and then
Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin at the White House. The charter
controversy is one of the issues that has one-time allies of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now threatening to topple
his government.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo outlines a plan for Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, areas Israeli captured in the
Middle East War. In return, the PLO was supposed to end hostilities
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Steeped in the revolutionary language of the 1960s, the 6-page
charter calls repeatedly for war against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine,'' it
states, ``. . . the Arab Palestinian people, expressing themselves
by the armed Palestinian revolution, reject all solutions which are
substitutes for the total liberation of Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestine National Council met in April, 1996, to rescind
parts of the charter.
</P>
<P>
   American and Israeli officials applauded the move. But the
Palestinians never issued a new charter with the changes _ a move
American officials say is not required anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Israelis who support the peace process say progress
was made, but acknowledge that the revision was neither clear or
complete. The Israeli government changed in 1996 and the new
government headed by Netanyahu, and fueled by its right wing,
demanded clarification.
</P>
<P>
   They have asserted that Arafat's January letter to Clinton was
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   In talks Clinton mediated last October at the Wye River
Plantation in Maryland, an effort at restarting the stalled Oslo
process, the Israelis and Palestinians agreed to have Clinton come
to the Middle East to serve as a high-profile witness while the PLO
meets to ``reaffirm'' Arafat's letter. In going to Gaza Monday,
Clinton will become the first U.S. president to visit a
Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian political analyst Ghassan Khatib said the charter
has little influence over modern Palestinian thought. But, he said
Arafat has held back the revision because it was a bargaining chip.
</P>
<P>
   He may have cashed it in for the prestige of the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever will be done in Gaza could anger hard-liners on
both sides. Israelis are angry that Wye only requires a vague move
to ``reaffirm'' the letter, not a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are required to give these people land and authority and
everything similar to a state without them changing their goal of
destroying us? It looks crazy to me,'' said Michael Kleiner, a
member of the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton should stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many PLO members are outraged at having to repeat,
upon Israeli demands, a revision they say they have made.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Ajrami, a leader of the PLO faction known as the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is organizing a
boycott of the meeting. He believes that both Israel and the
Palestinians should exist as states, but does not want to change
the charter this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to lead to so many other concessions,'' he said.
Why, he asks, should he officially recognize the Israeli state
while Israelis oppose the formation of a Palestinian state.

   The Diaries of John Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   By John Rabe. Edited by Erwin Wickert.

 &UR; THE GOOD NAZI &QL; 
 &UR; By SHERYL WUDUNN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one years ago, Japanese soldiers captured the ancient
Chinese capital of Nan-king, torturing, raping and killing vast
numbers of people in one of the bloodiest massacres in modern
history. Yet there is a stunning difference of opinion on exactly
what took place. Some Japanese have tried to say -- perhaps
wishfully -- that the massacre never happened, while many Chinese
regard it as a symbol of Japanese brutality and one of the ugliest
landmarks of an ugly century.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there is a deep and divided body of literature on the Rape
of Nanking, as the incident has become known, but most of that
literature is, by necessity, dependent on secondary sources. That
is why ``The Good Man of Nanking'' soars above most of the rest.
Essentially the diaries of one man, John Rabe, a German businessman
for the Siemens China Company, the work is at once riveting,
inspiring, terrifying and tragically sad. It is also, in an odd
way, refreshing. For Rabe is modest, unpolemical. He is, by turns,
naive and cynical, generous and materialistic, outraged and calm.
His account is compassionate and, at times, humorous, with an
understated horror that seethes through the straightforward
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe not only witnessed the slaughter as the Japanese captured
Nanking (now known as Nanjing) in December 1937, he also saved the
lives of many people. By invoking the name of Hitler, he gained
tacit approval from the Japanese to set up a special safety zone
that ended up sheltering a couple of hundred thousand Chinese from
the rampaging Japanese soldiers. The zone lasted about four months.
</P>
<P>
   A Nazi who originally supported Hitler, Rabe chose not to flee
Nanjing with most of the other foreigners as the Japanese
approached. He remarked in his diary: ``I don't love being shelled
. . . but I simply cannot bring myself to save my skin just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So Rabe stayed behind in Nanjing to set up a small shelter,
which quickly expanded into a vast safety zone. He had his tussles
with the Chinese, particularly the Chinese troops, who kept
sneaking into his shelter, even digging trenches to secure safety
behind its walls. The Chinese military's presence, of course, made
the shelter a prime target for the Japanese, so Rabe wanted them
out.
</P>
<P>
   They did not leave, even as the Japanese began bombing their way
into the city. Mean-while, everyone else was pleading to be let
into the shelter. ``I can't listen to their wailing any longer, so
I open both gates and let everyone in who wants in,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the beginning of the chaos, though. Rabe's initial
hopes that the Japanese would capture the city peacefully -- their
planes dropped pamphlets saying that all civilians would be
``treated humanely in all respects'' -- soon gave way to
frustration, then horror and despair. ``We come across corpses
every 100 to 200 yards,'' he writes on Dec. 13, 1937, the day after
the Japanese took control. ``The bodies of civilians that I
examined had bullet holes in their backs. These people had
presumably been fleeing and were shot from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soldiers looted, smashed, burned people and buildings
-- whatever was in their way, whatever was their fancy, Rabe says.
They entered his safety zone to pillage, rape and murder. Just
behind Rabe's garden wall, a woman was raped and then wounded in
the neck with a bayonet. Nurses at the nearby hospital were also
violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been
raped, about 100 girls at Ginling Girls College alone,'' Rabe
reports on Dec. 17. ``You hear of nothing but rape. If husbands or
brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all
sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Japanese began burning down the city and the people in
it. When army officers demanded Chinese workers, a trusting Rabe
suggested where they could be found. Days later, he discovered that
43 of the 54 workers the Japanese had rounded up were led to the
riverbank and machine-gunned, ``ostensibly because they were the
employees of an enterprise managed by the Chinese Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe mentions one day when he was cleaning the safety zone: ``We
find many bodies in the ponds, civilians who have been shot (30 in
just one pond), most of them with their hands bound, some with
stones tied to their necks.'' At another time, he complains that 50
corpses lay unburied. At still another, he reports that a German
colleague saw 300 corpses in a dry ditch near one of the city
gates.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe records all sorts of atrocities: a woman is found dead with
a golf ball inside her vagina, another bayoneted there. ``You can't
breathe for sheer revulsion when you keep finding the bodies of
women with bamboo poles thrust up their vaginas,'' he writes.
``Even old women over 70 are constantly being raped.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rabe hears from a Japanese Foreign Ministry official
that Tokyo has asked for order to be restored. But he cannot get
approval even to bury the dead, and he points to ``the danger to
which we are all exposed as long as perhaps a thousand corpses are
lying about the city unburied.'' He continues: ``These corpses have
been partially eaten by dogs. At the same time, however, dog meat
is being sold by the Chinese in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nanjing starved, the crops outside the city walls lay rotting
because no one was allowed to go out to harvest them. Rabe surmises
that the Japanese wanted the Chinese to starve to death. He
compares the soldiers to the ``hordes of Genghis Khan'' and
laments: ``One might well believe the Japanese Army is made up of
ex-convicts. Normal people do not behave this way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing aspects of these diaries is that
while Rabe recounts tortures, rapes and mass murders by the
Japanese, he appears not to have seen many of the atrocities that
are commonly described by the Chinese themselves. There are no
accounts of live burials, mass disembowelments, deaths by freezing
or death by being eaten alive by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-NANKING-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: by dogs.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese soldiers would naturally have tried to avoid torturing
Chinese in front of foreign witnesses, but Rabe was also getting
reports of atrocities from his Chinese assistants. It is unlikely
that the book's editor, Erwin Wickert, who had known Rabe and
obtained the diaries from his granddaughter, would have left such
stories out. So it is probable that Rabe, who did not speak
Chinese, simply did not see these particular atrocities, or did not
dare to record them for some reason. It is also possible that these
crimes were committed in extreme secrecy. Or perhaps they did not
occur at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, an emotional debate rages over how many people
actually lost their lives at the hands of the Japanese. Some
Chinese estimates go as high as 200,000 to 300,000, a number that
was recently popularized by Iris Chang in her book, ``The Rape of
Nanking.'' In his diary, Rabe says that out of an initial
population of 1.2 million people, about 800,000 fled before Nanjing
was captured. He writes that about 250,000 ended up in his safety
zone, and though many were killed there, most survived. That would
leave about 150,000 people unaccounted for by Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Basing his numbers on reports from one of the humanitarian
groups involved in burying the dead, Rabe estimates that a total of
50,000 to 60,000 people were actually killed, and those are the
numbers that he used when he returned to Germany and lectured on
his experiences in China. (When he tried to send a report of the
atrocities to Hitler, he was arrested and interrogated by the
Gestapo; upon his release, he stopped speaking publicly about
Nanjing.)
</P>
<P>
   Rabe recorded the deaths he saw in his diaries, but he did not
keep a tally of the dead. That is unfortunate. However, he
certainly had enough on his hands.

   Tales From Hospice.
</P>
<P>
   By A. G. Mojtabai.
</P>
<P>
   190 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Zoland Books. $22.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; LIFE SUPPORT &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY HOFFMAN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Readers who turn glum at the prospect of a book entitled ``Soon:
Tales From Hospice'' should know that these stories aren't only
about dying; they're also about urgent living. In ``Last Things,''
a woman writes farewell letters filled with ``paper courage'' to
all of her friends; in ``Tour,'' a dying priest, drifting in a kind
of dream state, tries to make amends with the soul of a troubled
family member; in ``Greyhound,'' a man eaten up with cancer
remembers a bus trip when he fell in love with a girl, then let her
slip away. ``If he concentrates now,'' he tells himself, ``maybe he
can make things turn out different.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``hospice,'' A. G. Mojtabai explains in her preface,
``derived from the Latin hospitium, was traditionally used to refer
to a place of shelter, a place of rest, for pilgrims and travelers,
well or infirm.'' The hospice she writes about, in Amarillo, Tex.,
brings other Latin phrases to mind: tempus fugit; carpe diem.
</P>
<P>
   Mojtabai (the author of seven other books, including the novels
``Called Out'' and ``Ordinary Time'') has taken us behind
Amarillo's doorways before. In ``Blessed Assurance,'' published in
1986, she introduced readers to some of the workers at Pantex, the
final assembly plant for all United States nuclear weapons, where
they calmly awaited global annihilation, sustained by a strong
fundamentalist faith in their salvation after the coming
Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the patients in ``Soon,'' when faced with their own
personal annihilation, seem much less sanguine. Billy, the
tattooed, snakeskin-booted central character in ``Spring Me,'' is
``one of the meanest patients in the history of the unit.'' Acting
as if he's stepped out of a Larry L. King romp, Billy ``hollered
for booze, he hollered for the Playboy Channel.'' Chain-smoking in
the waiting room, he chooses filterless cigarettes since ``it
doesn't make a particle of difference by now.'' In his wheelchair,
waiting for a buddy to take him honky-tonking on Saturday night,
Billy yells to the nurses: ``Yessir . . . gonna hit the Crystal
Pistol tonight. Live it up tonight! Gonna have me a big time --
quality time!''
</P>
<P>
   In a story called ``Zone,'' the proudly agnostic Mr. Straughn
``wanted to record how it feels to die, what it meant to enter what
he called the end zone, so that his wife and daughter, and we --
all of us -- would be better prepared for it.'' The staff member
who narrates the story watches Mr. Straughn's final moments as his
breath stops and starts. ``Maybe,'' she says, ``he was summoning
himself back by main force to speak that final word. If so, he
needn't have bothered. The word was never heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon'' is at its most engaging when Mojtabai explores such
small, tumultuous dramas -- stories, even at life's edge, that
continue to unfold. There's a risk, though, in setting an entire
collection inside an institution that is meant to be serenely
confining; sometimes the stories feel confining too. Thus in ``At
the Door'' and ``Air,'' as grown children mentally loop back
through tangled relationships with dying parents, the stories
become one-sided conversations about the past, family dramas that
want to spill out beyond the hospice walls.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, Mojtabai has a knack for summoning up
telling details -- like the ``recommended'' hugs that staff members
are encouraged to give patients and their families: ``not too
tightly; never sexy.'' She is also good at using story titles
(``Sightings,'' say, or ``Long Distance'') as central images and
working them to a crescendo. The effect, ironically, sometimes
makes death seem a little too neat on the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolation,'' for example, is about a young AIDS patient named
Michael and a priest who exhorts him to pray. In reverie, Michael
returns to earlier times: ``He was so restless, he couldn't wait to
be gone from West Texas, he was ready to go. There were open fields
on either side, a telephone cable stitching the air high overhead.
The wire went on, humming with secrets it wasn't yet telling, bound
for elsewhere, where he, too, was going.'' Michael's story ends in
a lonesome but artful fashion: a nurse finds him clutching the
phone to his chest ``like a bouquet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Mojtabai is successful at involving us with
characters we meet only in the last chapters of their lives, people
whose fates have already been determined. We are drawn to their
stories as we might be to those of passengers on a sinking ship.
The most effective of these is ``The Juniper Tree,'' in which Cora,
a hospice volunteer who narrates several of the stories, sits with
Marian, ``the frailest of 8-year olds,'' who has ``been living on
crushed ice.'' Cora starts to read her a fairy tale, then hesitates
when she discovers it's about a boy who is chopped up and cooked in
a stew. Marian insists that she continue. At the fairy tale's end,
the boy is reborn in a juniper tree that is transformed into a
bird, then a child again. Later, Cora comes down the hallway and
finds Marian in crisis, ``surrounded by her parents and one of the
nurses.'' When Cora asks if she can fetch some more ice, Marian
lifts her hand and whispers, ``Hurry!''
</P>
<P>
   Hurry or not, it will make little difference. But Mojtabai has
us praying for a miraculous, fairy-tale ending.

THE SILENT DUCHESS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dacia Maraini. Translated by Dick Kitto and Elspeth
Spottiswood.
</P>
<P>
   261 pp. New York: The Feminist Press. $19.95. &QL; 
 &UR; -------- &QL; 
 &UR; THE SILENCE &QL; 
 &UR; BY KATHRYN HARRISON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A little girl, 7 years old, deaf and incapable of speech,
accompanies her father, a Sicilian duke, to witness the execution
of a young criminal, a boy of 13. Because of their social position,
these two aristocrats are permitted to eavesdrop on the child's
confession in his sordid underground prison, then given a ringside
seat at his hanging.
</P>
<P>
   The violence of this spectacle is such that Duke Signoretto
Ucria hopes it will both unstop his daughter's ears and ``unstick
her lips.'' But Marianna Ucria is possessed of an imperturbable
calm. ``For living visitors like Dante,'' she thinks as she watches
the prisoners, ``hell can even be beautiful to look at'' -- a
surpassingly literate and philosophical assessment from such a
young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Thus are we introduced to the early-18th-century heroine of
Dacia Maraini's novel, joining Marianna's father in ``knocking at
the door of her silence.''
</P>
<P>
   What lies behind that door, and who has pushed it shut? We can
ask these questions of stories other than the one Maraini tells in
``The Silent Duchess,'' for we are well acquainted with heroines --
and the occasional hero -- who cannot or will not speak. From the
Greek tale of Philomela to Hans Christian Andersen's Little Mermaid
to Maya Angelou in ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' from Ellen
James in John Irving's novel ``The World According to Garp'' to
Estha in ``The God of Small Things,'' by Arundhati Roy, the list
goes on. Can we guess what words, what accusations, their silence
holds? All too often, the clues point to sexual trauma -- in this
case, a childhood rape.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, Marianna Ucria is given in marriage, against her will, to
her mother's older brother (and her father's cousin), Duke Pietro
Ucria. The reason is a simple one, at least as her mother explains
it. ``Uncle Pietro will take you for nothing because he loves
you,'' thus sparing her parents a dowry they can't afford. This
conversation is carried out by means of pen and paper, as are all
of Marianna's communications. Soon she is married to ``that sad,
grumpy man, always dressed in red and known in the family as 'the
prawn.' '' Marianna refers to her cold and peculiar spouse as
``uncle husband.'' During the course of their 27-year marriage, she
bears him five children and presides over his large household. The
duchess herself is considered eccentric, but this has less to do
with her silence than with her devotion to reading.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Marianna is widowed. After the funeral, she accompanies
uncle husband's corpse to its interment in the catacombs; having
remained innocent of the pleasures of the bedroom, she scrutinizes
the ``fleeting curve'' of his lips, his ``jutting cheekbones,'' as
she tries one last time ``to fathom the secret of his body.'' Soon
thereafter, Marianna takes a young lover, but the discovery of
physical passion cannot tempt her from the life of the mind, from
her addiction to silent, sated hours in her library. As old age
approaches, she spurns the proposal of a kind admirer, a man who
values her intelligence. Escorted by her maid, Marianna sets out to
see what she can of the world. Without giving away the identity of
the man who raped her -- or its bearing on the duchess's betrothal
-- one can set out these summary events of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange how well she's worn,'' her profligate brother,
Abbot Carlo, notes: ``Slim as when she was 20, a fresh, clear
complexion. . . . This dumb sister still has the face of a young
girl. . . . What if it were her dumbness that has preserved her
from the ruins of growing old?'' Dumbness? ``Holiness'' might be a
more fitting word, suggesting the quality of being set apart.
Perhaps it is poetic justice that Carlo has been disfigured by
appetite, lust, cruelty. In contrast, Marianna bears no superficial
trace of sin or suffering. In her innocence, she looks like an
angel -- and in fact she functions as a particular kind of
celestial being, the recording angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Silent Duchess'' is a leisurely, discursive case history
of an early violation, a narrative that segues (painlessly, without
being polemical) into a treatise on the nature of the writer,
especially the female writer. Marianna's silence is both ``dense
and transparent.'' She sees it as ``both mother and sister'' and
prays to the ``Holy Mother of all silence.'' For Marianna, and by
extension all women, Maraini suggests that creativity implies a
certain defection, a refusal to participate in a forum dominated by
male voices -- voices that exploit, that discount the importance of
the domestic female world, that misrepresent what it is to be a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Silence does not diminish the duchess; rather, it dignifies her.
For Marianna, separation allows perspective; the abandonment (not
the impairment) of one faculty sharpens the others; deafness even
enhances her perceptions. Because she is spared the chaos and
distraction of noise, Marianna finds that she can read people's
thoughts. Her past violation guarantees her vigilance; she will
always be hyper-alert to her surroundings. Her sense of smell, for
example, is so keen that passages of ``The Silent Duchess'' will
remind readers of another novel set in the same pungent century,
Patrick Suskind's ``Perfume'':
</P>

   ``Now she has lowered her eyelids so as to rest her eyes for a
while, and her nostrils have begun to draw in the air, recognizing
the smells and meticulously noting them in her mind: the
overpowering scent of lettuce water that impregnates her father's
waistcoat, below that the scent of rice powder mingled with the
grease on the seats, the sourness of crushed lice, the smarting
from the dust on the road that blows through the joints of the
doors, as well as the faint aroma of mint that floats in from the
fields of the Villa Palagonia.''

<P>
   ``Recognizing'' and ``meticulously noting.'' This entire novel
could be described in such terms, filled as it is with observations
that are rich almost to the point of cloying. It's a trick for
historical fiction to avoid awkward pileups of costuming and props.
Maraini, a playwright and essayist who is one of Italy's most
prominent writers, is also a seasoned and elegant novelist. She's
not afraid of excess -- and why should she be? It's entirely under
her control. Her intelligent heroine, well read to the point of
heresy (she imports and eagerly consumes books by philosophers who
comment on the nature of reality, who challenge the vision of the
church and, by implication, the patriarchal rankings of society),
is an apparatus intricately calibrated for perception, for
understanding, for revealing.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the sort of world that the duchess describes on
the tablet hung around her neck, in the letters she sends to her
daughters, in the thoughts she shares with the reader? It's
splendid and squalid and violent, a place where women are at once
petted and despised -- a place that seems alive for the reader,
both then and now. But historical fiction is not, of course,
history. Despite its links to Maraini's own family's Sicilian
roots, ``The Silent Duchess'' isn't biography exhumed; instead, it
is fantasy projected onto the usable screen of the past.
</P>
<P>
   IN her afterword, the literary scholar Anna Camaiti Hostert
suggests that Maraini chose to set her story in 18th-century Sicily
because it was dominated by a peculiarly ``arrogant and
hypocritical aristocracy, remarkable . . . in the cruelty of its
oppression of both the poor and women.'' The afterword provides a
useful, if academic, context for the work of a writer who remains
largely unknown to Americans. In her more than 50 books, Maraini's
attention, Hostert tells us, ``has always been concentrated on
women's enforced silence in society as well as in literature, and
on the alternative ways in which a female voice can manifest
itself.'' If this sounds ponderous, the novel itself is anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   As translated by Dick Kitto and Elspeth Spottiswood, ``The
Silent Duchess'' is a story of grace and endurance, not mere
survival. What's more, it acquires a slyly suspenseful quality as
the somewhat pedestrian puzzle of the rapist's identity is
superseded by the more complex tension and mystery of Marianna's
silence itself. What will cure this case of ``hysterical'' -- in
other words, female -- deafness and muteness? There are passages
the reader dreads, afraid to be returned with the duchess to the
spoken word, to the implicit capitulation that would be signaled if
she deigned to talk. Might this happen at the death of uncle
husband? At Marianna's discovery of physical passion, when she
redeems what the rapist stole? When she at last learns (that is to
say, remembers and acknowledges) who raped her?
</P>
<P>
   Any of these would be the manipulations of a lesser writer. The
final and greatest satisfaction of Maraini's novel is that the
duchess remains triumphantly silent.

 &UR; EIGHT MILLION STORIES
</P>
<P>
   BY GARRISON KEILLOR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go in New York, you are walking through somebody's
literary turf. If I hike over to Central Park, I pass through Isaac
Bashevis Singer's neighborhood and the site of Poe's cottage and go
by the hotel where Holden Caulfield sat on the bed with the
prostitute and the building on 78th Street near Amsterdam Avenue
where Sister Carrie lived with Hurstwood, her paramour, before she
rose in society and he fell. In the park I breathe in a rich
fragrance richly described by John Cheever and look down the
horsepaths of ``The Age of Innocence'' toward the buildings of
Fitzgerald's 59th Street (``my lost city, wrapped cool in its
mystery and promise'') and think of E. B. White's saying, that New
York bestows ``the gift of privacy, the jewel of loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   So many great writers have lived here, their homes cannot be set
aside as museums: they are needed for housing. Everyone came
through town, even Thoreau, who spent a few months on Staten Island
in 1843. He rode the ferry to Manhattan, hoping to interest editors
in his work; he thought New York ``a thousand times meaner than I
could have imagined. It will be something to hate -- that's the
advantage it will be to me.'' He failed to interest anyone, he got
homesick and left town grumping about the crowds: ``It must have a
very bad influence on children to see so many human beings at once
-- mere herds of men.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phillip Lopate's excellent anthology, ``Writing New York,''
you get writers who love crowds and writers who hang out alone and
brood, the diaries of businessmen and homages to ``the sweet slums
of Bohemia and beatnikdom, where sunflowers and morning glories
would bloom on fire escapes in the summer and old ladies weighed
down by breasts leaned on goosedown pillows in windows,
self-appointed guardians of the street'' (from Joyce Johnson, who
``sat up till dawn in Rappaport's, where they gave you a whole
basket of rolls free, drinking coffee with a jazz trombonist from
St. Louis and a poet just arrived from Chicago''). And Elizabeth
Hardwick on Billie Holiday: ``The sheer enormity of her vices. The
outrageousness of them. . . . Her ruthless talent and the opulent
devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry James looks dimly at the ``vast bristling promontory'' of
Manhattan, where ``the shores are low and for the most part
depressingly furnished and prosaically peopled,'' and fusses about
the impermanence and commercialness of it all, and A. J. Liebling,
a sociable fellow from 93rd Street and Lexington, sees impermanence
as a civic virtue: ``It is one of the oldest places in the United
States, but doesn't live in retrospect like the professionally
picturesque provinces,'' he says. ``Any city may have one period of
magnificence, like Boston or New Orleans or San Francisco, but it
takes a real one to keep renewing itself until the past is
perennially forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The gassiest of the city's admirers may have been Lewis Mumford,
hiking across the Brooklyn Bridge, observing the skyscrapers
against the sky and the river below, the ferryboats, the tramp
steamers -- ``And there was I, breasting the March wind, drinking
in the city and the sky, both vast, yet both contained in me,
transmitting through me the great mysterious will that had made
them and the promise of the new day that was still to come.''
</P>
<P>
   O.K. Whatever you say, pal. Contain as much of the sky as you
like. What really shines in this anthology isn't the literary set
pieces but the journalism, from Poe's column about a 10-mile foot
race in front of 11,000 spectators in May 1844, won by a man named
Stannard in 1 hour 4 minutes 3 seconds for a $300 purse, to Alfred
Kazin's memoir of Brownsville and Joseph Mitchell rambling around
the Fulton Fish Market at 5:30 in the morning and Joan Didion on
her way home: ``I remember sitting in a lot of apartments with a
slight headache about 5 o'clock in the morning. I had a friend who
could not sleep, and he knew a few other people who had the same
trouble, and we would watch the sky lighten and have a last drink
with no ice and then go home in the early morning light, when the
streets were clean and wet (had it rained in the night? we never
knew) and the few cruising taxis had their headlights on and the
only color was the red and green of traffic signals.''
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising journals are those from a city long
disappeared, from when cows were pastured on Bowling Green and pigs
ran loose and Wall Street was a ``narrow thoroughfare, baking and
blistering in the sun'' and the English actress Fanny Kemble ruled
the stage and merchants and lawyers streamed into the eating houses
for lunch, where a barker stood in the doorway and chanted:
</P>
<P>
   ``Biledlamancapersors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosebeefrosegoorosemuttonantaters --
</P>
<P>
   ``Biledamancabbage, vegetables --
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkinsirtakaseatsir.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Grant Thorburn of 22 Nassau Street, a grocer who began
selling potted plants and found that they sold better if he painted
the pots green. Here is Miss Kemble, writing, ``The women here . .
. ripen very early and decay proportionally soon. They are,
generally speaking, pretty, with good complexions, and an air of
freshness, but this I am told is very evanescent.'' And here is the
Wall Street lawyer George Templeton Strong, writing in 1851: ``I'm
sadly vulgarized and degraded of late by the itching for money that
has come over me. Oh, for $100,000 -- well invested! A skillful
operation resulting in an enormous profit with no risk has all the
charm for me now of poetry or romance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-NEWYORK-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: romance.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The diaries of Strong and his contemporary Philip Hone provide
such clear accounts of early 19th-century New York as to make the
literary wits of their day unreadable by comparison. Try to read
the whinnying of the great Washington Irving and then check out
Hone's diary entry for Saturday, Dec. 8, 1838, when he and family
and guests are eating dinner and a week-old infant boy is left in a
basket on the doorstep, the name ``Alfred G. Douglas'' written on a
label pinned to his muslin frock. Hone reports on the autumn
foliage, a concert by Ole Bull, a charity ball, the Astor Place
riots, the rebuilding of Trinity Church, the death of his wife. He
observes John Jacob Astor, worth $15 million, sitting at dinner,
mumbling, drooling, fed by a servant -- ``a painful example of the
insufficiency of wealth to prolong the life of man.'' Hone is
chairman of the committee that plans the reception in 1842 to
welcome Mr. Charles Dickens (``a small, bright-eyed,
intelligent-looking young fellow, 30 years of age, somewhat of a
dandy in his dress'') and is pleased that all goes well, all except
the coat-check operation: Hone trudges home hatless and coatless on
a February night.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman gazed on it from the Brooklyn ferry, ``mast-hemm'd
Manhattan,'' and Poe rowed a skiff along Roosevelt Island to look
at the Manhattan shore, ``the magnificent cliffs, and stately
trees'' that he knew would be soon replaced by warehouses and
wharves. Maxim Gorky, looking across the harbor, saw a city
quivering like a mirage, ``a fantastic city all of fire. . . .
Thousands of ruddy sparks glimmer in the darkness.'' Helen Keller
took a boat around Manhattan and her companions spelled into her
hand the names of boats, Bella, Floradora, Rosalind, Pearl of the
Deep, Minnehaha, Sister Nell. Dawn Powell looked down from the
Empire State Building and saw ``a garden of golden lights winking
on and off, automobiles, trucks winding in and out, and not a
sound. All as silent as a dead city -- it looks adagio down
there.'' Fitzgerald saw it from a ship sailing up the Hudson at
early dusk, ``the white glacier of lower New York . . . a miracle
of foamy light suspended by the stars.'' And the Englishman Stephen
Graham saw it in 1927 as we all see it, on foot: ``It is 5 A.M.
Something of the burden of the city has been lifted. The air is
light. The heart seems freed. I feel happy to be walking. I love
the space and the quietness. I have got rid of the idea of going to
bed, got rid of the routine of daily life. New York and its
millions, its wealth, its mysteries, are mine. There is a sense of
conquest. The bustle has died down and I am still walking. The
majority of people are asleep -- but I am not the least sleepy. It
seems as if life has just begun.''

 A TRAITOR'S KISS

   The Life of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, 1751-1816.

 &UR; IN THE WINGS
</P>
<P>
   BY SARAH KERR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816) is one of those attractive
but vague figures, remembered for vastly different events that add
up to -- well, what they add up to is fascinating, but not at all
clear. Two centuries after Sheridan's heyday in London, his fame
rests mostly on the comedies he wrote as a young man. ``The School
for Scandal'' and ``The Rivals'' are hilarious, perfect little
exposes of base aristocrats, lying journalists and moralists
without moral cores. Yet by the author's own admission the plays
were a mere stepping stone, a bid for money and social cachet to
help him pursue his real passion. Sheridan was elected to
Parliament in 1780 and rose to the very top ranks as a reformer
within the Whig party. These were the fabled glory days of English
political rhetoric, and for a while Sheridan No. 2, the politician,
outshined his illustrious colleagues Charles James Fox and Edmund
Burke as the best orator in the land.
</P>
<P>
   The journey from facile golden boy to persuasive liberal
statesman is hard enough to trace. The real challenge for
Sheridan's biographer is to fit those first two acts with a very
different third. Later in life Sheridan became a laughingstock,
famous not for his way with words but for his notorious debts, his
desperate sucking up to patrons and, most embarrassing of all, his
bright red drinker's nose. This Sheridan lost most of his money and
all of his pride. When he died, London gossip pronounced that he'd
ended up a pauper, with hardly a chair left for furniture.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think some consolidation of the three Sheridans would be
in order, but in ``A Traitor's Kiss,'' Fintan O'Toole takes the
bold and, in the end, pretty convincing step of introducing a
long-ignored fourth Sheridan into the mix. No. 4 was born in
Dublin, and O'Toole believes that through all his later ups and
downs Sheridan remained, first and foremost, an Irishman. When he
wrote plays, Irishness was the outsider's point of view that
supplied the double-entendres. When he entered politics, Ireland's
plight fed his sympathy with oppressed pawns of colonialism and
with humble people everywhere who lived under laws that failed to
serve them. His torn allegiances, as a Protestant high up in the
British Government who thought the Irish had been given a raw deal,
drove him to seek a humane compromise. But this position was
lonely, irksome to enemies across the political spectrum and hard
on his nerves.
</P>
<P>
   We're speaking somewhat rhetorically here, of a sentimental
rather than a concrete patriotism, since Sheridan left Ireland for
English boarding school at 11, never to return. But O'Toole makes a
good case for the Irish question's powerful resonance within the
Sheridan clan; one 17th-century ancestor got swept up in a quixotic
effort to refashion Protestantism for the Irish language. And
Sheridan appears to have suffered one of those awful childhoods
that lead to nostalgia in the adult. As a boy he was sickly,
neglected by his family and teased by his peers for his father's
low profession as an actor and theater manager. (Theater then was a
guilty pleasure, enjoyed but frowned upon, rather like the
contemporary talk show.)
</P>
<P>
   At first Sheridan channeled his hunger for love, status and
vindication into romantic mischief, eloping with a well-known
singer, casting himself (falsely, O'Toole implies) as her protector
from an unwanted suitor and provoking two duels. Our instant
celebrities shop around for book contracts; Sheridan moved to cash
in on his 15 minutes by writing plays. O'Toole is a theater critic
for The Daily News in New York, and he's insightful about the
social atmosphere of the 18th-century stage: the rowdy informality
that sometimes climaxed in a riot, the barely camouflaged gossip,
the minor but suggestive fact that the lights didn't go down before
a show, which made the audience feel like full-fledged participants
in the entertainment. O'Toole has less to say about the plays
themselves, but it could be that Sheridan's plays, while close to
flawless, don't bear much talking about except to acknowledge that
their author was a comic wizard. I was constantly reminded, reading
this book, that the 1700's predate the 1800's. That is to say,
before the Romantics arrived, literature tended to be an arena of
wit, intrigue and idealized lovers -- of rhetoric more than
conflict or ambiguity. O'Toole dutifully looks for unplumbed depths
in some of Sheridan's strongest characters, like the vicious prude
Joseph Surface or the confused Mrs. Malaprop. Trotting out a little
rhetoric of his own of the jargony academic type, O'Toole argues
that Sheridan's constant awareness of the untrustworthiness of
language led inevitably to his lonely, radical choices in politics.
</P>
<P>
   But is the road from satire to politics really so straight? A
contemporary of Sheridan's named Jane Austen possessed as fine an
ear for linguistic untrustworthiness as has ever existed, but in
political terms she was a conventional Tory. Besides, while most
satirists are out to expose some ugly truth, Sheridan was the rare
humorist who dreamed of a kinder, gentler world. He could be as
sentimental, and as ruthlessly persuasive, as a Disney song. His
most celebrated speech, charging the Governor General of India with
corruption and brutality, was a classic of the 18th-century cult of
sensibility and by all accounts a show-biz masterpiece -- a
five-hour torrent of facts, unanswerable accusations and tugs at
the heartstrings that were achingly sincere, and utterly shameless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SHERIDAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: shameless.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the podium, his politicking was rougher around the
edges. A maverick within his own party, he fatally allied himself
with the fickle, selfish Prince Regent. His position grew even
trickier in the repressive 1790's, when his defense of the Irish,
and of basic civil liberties like habeas corpus, opened him to
charges of treachery. Was his thinking on Ireland a lost model for
an enlightened Third Way, a course of nonsectarian compromise, as
O'Toole -- again indulging in a little rhetoric -- seems to imply?
Absolutely, but then again, not quite. Sheridan's heart was in the
right place, but even at the height of his power his political
method was too compromised by social climbing and pipe-dream
idealism to apply usefully to today. After his first wife died, he
compromised himself even more. His drinking stood out in an era in
which it was hard to stand out for drinking. When an aristocratic
lady broke off an affair with him, a combination of depression and
class rage sent him off on a pathetic campaign of harassment that
today would put him on trial as a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying it: Sheridan had his weak spots. (Or, as
Byron once put it, after recalling all Sheridan's gifts, ``But
alas, poor human nature!'') Still, the decline was not wholly his
fault. O'Toole's very moving point is that as an Irishman, Sheridan
was doomed to remain on the fringes; as a self-made man he found no
home in the rigid upper reaches of English power. The irony is that
when Sheridan died, his Irishness was put away in the closet. His
plays were safely absorbed into a harmless pageant of English comic
literature. His irresponsibility was greatly exaggerated, and his
glittering wordplay and rakish reputation made him seem like the
prototype of the feckless English fop.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the lesson of Sheridan's life, it helps to look
not at his politics but back at his plays. Elites close ranks to
resist outsiders, they told us. People in power aid people in
power, and society runs on lies. In the plays, the message was
comic, with the happiest of endings. In life, it proved
depressingly real.

</P>
<P>
   Dixie Gibbs may be blond and pretty, she may have a smile for
everyone and give a successful after-game party, but as the wife of
the head coach of the Birmingham Black Bears, she is a flawed
individual. She doesn't care much for football. She doesn't even
know the rules. In Alabama that is plenty cause for suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of Dick Tomey, the head coach of the University of
Arizona Wildcats, Nanci Kincaid knows the rules, and for her
carefully constructed second novel she has recruited a shadow team
of wives, mothers, sisters and girlfriends to recount the lonely
and frustrating life on the sidelines. Kincaid also knows her
readers, which is why, despite its drolly macho title, ``Balls'' is
about women and marriage as much as it is an insider's view of a
college football recruiting scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie, the main character, grew up in ``HamU'' country, the
local handle for fictitious Birmingham University. In high school,
she vowed to marry a football player and picked the star
quarterback, Mac. Years later, she and their two children stand by
as he accepts the head coach's mantle from his mentor, Catfish
Bomar. It is the end of an era. The fans and money people all
expect Mac to carry on the winning tradition. By then, Dixie, still
a dispassionate spectator, has figured out the game: football comes
before marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie's first teacher is the big-hearted Leeta Sparks, who works
two jobs so her husband, Hemp, can pursue his first love, coaching
high school football. When the newlywed Dixie asks Leeta if she
still loves Hemp, she says, ``I love him the same way I love my
kids,'' because, Leeta thinks to herself, ``any other answer would
half kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a more seasoned Dixie who meets the ambitious Romalee May,
the defensive coordinator's wife at HamU. During games, Romalee, a
former Miss Georgia, talks strategy and player histories while
Dixie is content to scan the crowd. But as Dixie observes,
``Romalee's experiential expertise lasts only until the rum and
Coke she's sipping sets her free from it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a luncheon, Catfish Bomar's wife, Celeste, a ghoulish
augur, boozily declares about her husband: ``He's killing me. I am
one step closer to dead every . . . football season.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dixie, her marriage has evolved into a chilly union. Mac
canceled their first vacation to play golf. He missed his son's
first steps and first words. During the season, Mac is gone before
Dixie wakes and comes home after she is asleep. Off-season, he
travels on recruiting trips, and summer weekends he spends on the
links. When she asks him to attend a reading of a short story she's
written, he answers, ``I'll just wait until the movie comes out.''
Dixie's forbearance, however, is maddening. One minute she is
pricked with rage, the next she is in awe, comparing Mac to Jesus
``casting his net into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid cleverly mines the small moments to communicate Dixie's
deepening sadness. A car ride home becomes symbolic of the journey
of her marriage. The mood is celebratory: Mac has just been named
head coach. Dixie is exuberant because they have realized their
dreams. Then she sees it's a success she had no part in creating.
</P>
<P>
   It's an obvious conclusion that these women are mad -- and
cynical -- as hell. Ultimately they are outsiders. When the illegal
inducements Mac doled out to recruits are made public, Dixie learns
of his resignation in the newspaper. Though painstakingly
developed, the characters do not have enough to do except watch and
talk. Divided into short chapters, the book is narrated in the
first person from 18 different perspectives. Kincaid loses time by
reorienting the reader with each shift, which prevents her from
telling her story. And what of these rogue spouses? The husbands
are the supposed focus here, but they are relegated to the
background. Like the wives, readers are left sitting on the bench.

HAZEL BISHOP, 92, INNOVATOR WHO MADE LIPSTICK KISSPROOF 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MARY TANNEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hazel Bishop, who cooked up the first kissproof lipstick
(``stays on you ... not on him'') in a kitchen fitted out as a
laboratory, then lost the right to use the name she made famous,
died on Saturday at the Osborn Home in Rye, N.Y. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   She exploited the skills of a research chemist, a merchant and a
teacher to achieve eminence in three careers over the course of 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   It was soon after World War II that Miss Bishop, a trained
chemist who had worked in a dermatologist's laboratory, developed a
nondrying, nonirritating, long-wearing lipstick. (Long-lasting
types contain high amounts of colorants called bromo acids that
have staining qualities.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, she formed Hazel Bishop Inc. to manufacture and market
her discovery. ``Never again need you be embarrassed by smearing
friends, children, relatives, husband, sweetheart,'' the early
advertising said, pointing out that older formulations tended to
leave greasy marks on glasses, cigarettes and teeth. And the new
brand did not have to be applied several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   The brand found instant acceptance. When it was introduced that
summer at $1 a tube, Lord &AMP; Taylor sold out its stock on the first
day. The brand soon captured 25 percent of the fast-growing
lipstick market and locked horns with Charles Revson of Revlon in
``the lipstick war.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Bishop was engaged in a war of her own with her
majority stockholder over financial issues. In settling her
lawsuit, she left the company in 1954, when its sales exceeded $10
million a year. She set up Hazel Bishop Laboratories to develop
household and personal care products, but ran into legal problems
with her former partner, losing the right to sell products under
her own name or to use it in personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, she became a stockbroker for Bache &AMP; Co. and later a
financial analyst for Evans &AMP; Co. With the burgeoning of the
fragrance business in the 1960s and '70s, cosmetics companies
became hot stocks and her advice was ardently sought. She was
quoted in newspaper financial pages and lectured throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her third career was in fashion education. In 1978, she became
an adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in
Manhattan in a program preparing young people for careers in
cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, on the occasion of her appointment to the Revlon Chair
in Cosmetics Marketing at FIT, Michel Bergerac, chairman of Revlon,
said: ``It is really quite an achievement to carve one outstanding
career in a lifetime. To succeed in business, in finance, and in
academics in only part of a life is truly an amazing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Bishop was born in Hoboken, N.J.. on Aug. 17, 1906, one of
two children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father ran a dozen
successful enterprises, including numerous stores on Washington
Street, the main concourse of Hoboken. One Thanksgiving, he brought
Santa Claus to town on an elephant to advertise his candy emporium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family talk around the dinner table always concerned
business,'' Miss Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Bishop intended to
go to medical school, but the stock market crash forced her to take
a job as a chemist at Columbia University Medical Center, where she
worked for a leading dermatologist, investigating allergies and
cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, as senior organic chemist with what is now
Exxon, she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers
of aircraft engines. After the war, she moved on to what is now
Mobil, but in the meantime made her historic discovery.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a niece, Randa Bishop of Las Vegas, Nev., and
two nephews, Arthur Lipper of Delmar, Calif., and A. Michael Lipper
of Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Described over the years as demure and trim, with hazel eyes and
a weakness for hats, the woman who invented kissable lipstick never
married. She said she felt the obligation, in her courting years,
to keep her widowed mother company at home.
</P>
<P>
   After she left the business, she still mixed up lipstick for
herself, a red shade with a blue cast, and once offered the
following beauty advice: ``Women should use makeup to accentuate
their most attractive feature. After the age of 25 or thereabouts,
personality becomes an increasingly more attractive feature.''

 SURPASSING WONDER

   The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds.

 &UR; EDITING THE WORD OF GOD
</P>
<P>
   BY ANTHONY J. SALDARINI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Bible and Talmud ``inventions'' may sound like
fighting words to a religiously sensitive audience, but here the
word ``invention'' is a belief-neutral description of the processes
that created the Jewish and Christian foundational classics (the
Hebrew Bible, the Jewish literature of the Second Temple period,
the New Testament, the Mishna and the Talmuds). In ``Surpassing
Wonder,'' Donald Harman Akenson, a professor of Irish history,
adopts a Great Books approach to Jewish and Christian history,
viewing it not as ``a chronicle of events, but a chronicle of
successive texts, their constant invention and reinvention.'' With
an imaginative use of metaphors, analogies, persuasive rhetoric and
praise, he pleads with all to read these religious classics
seriously, whether they grant them spiritual authority or not,
because, precisely as splendid intellectual and spiritual
``inventions,'' they have fascinated readers for generations and
profoundly shaped Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   To read these complex collections as literary unities Akenson
must simplify. He stresses narrative because ``the most important
portions of the Scriptures are presented as historical documents,
and the most revealing portions of both Hebrew and Christian
Scriptures are found in tightly constructed primary historical
narratives.'' He artificially unites discrete narratives into one
by postulating (solely for the purpose of analysis) a single author
for the dominant narrative of the Hebrew Bible from Genesis to
Kings, as well as for the New Testament Gospels and letters as a
whole, the 60-plus legal tractates of the Mishna and the sprawling,
shifting conversations of the Babylonian Talmud, which include
technical discussions of law, charming folk tales, intriguing
interpretations of Scripture and lucid depictions of human virtue
and vice.
</P>
<P>
   Akenson subordinates the sharp and inconvenient particularities
and contradictions of the texts in order to accomplish the ultimate
goal of history and human thought, interpretation of the whole. A
moral end motivates this quest for understanding because ``the
acquisition of significant bodies of knowledge in adult life''
requires an act of volition and of ``ethical discipline'' that
demands the rigors of a pilgrimage. Thus the religious classics of
the West belong to an intertextual world in which they have been
received and transformed by later generations and stand ready to
work their magic again on us.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible has attracted dedicated readers in every generation,
and even in our television culture thousands of Jews have committed
themselves to a seven-year program of reading the whole Babylonian
Talmud. Akenson seeks to attract a larger audience by demonstrating
the intellectual and human worth of the biblical and Talmudic
tradition. However, he fails to provide a sustained and searching
critique of the limitations of these traditional texts and of their
misuse throughout history. He does capture much of the variety and
inner strength of the biblical tradition. The Hebrew Bible was
created from pre-existing traditional materials, which still
proclaim their individuality in language and thought. Subsequent
interpretations of it in the Second Temple period (500 B.C.-A.D.
70), the New Testament and the Rabbinic periods used the language,
symbols, thought patterns and literary forms from the tradition in
new configurations and new systems of thought while remaining
within the same grammar of biblical invention. Akenson stresses the
creative imagination of later authors, but not their implicit
dissatisfaction with the tradition, which begs to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   He does not ignore dissenting voices, for he shows again and
again how later generations radically rewrote Scripture and the
rabbinical tradition even as they claimed to change nothing. He
acknowledges the persistent, irresolvable historical uncertainties
that plague interpretation of these ancient texts, but pushes them
aside in favor of listening to the primary texts ``without engaging
any prior theological or ideological commitments.'' His style and
use of striking metaphors and analogies propel this rich literature
into the minds of his readers. But other voices in the text and in
the 20th century demand a more thorough hearing. The biblical books
modify, nuance and limit one another. Communities of believers who
have lived these texts also provide a gritty commentary that
qualifies the great themes of intellectual history.
</P>
<P>
   To the historian I am making a plea for more history in his
reading of the great books. Akenson has consulted major scholars in
each field and uses their work intelligently and shrewdly. He
ferrets out shoddy historical methods and special pleading among
biblical theologians and historians, especially in a delightful
65-page appendix on the historical Jesus. But through his own
hypotheses he binds together diverse materials at a heavy cost.
</P>
<P>
   The master narrative of the Hebrew Bible, from Genesis to Kings,
provides him with a Magna Carta or Constitution of the tradition.
But the ancient tradition privileged the Torah, or Pentateuch
(Genesis through Deuteronomy), as do Jews today, and modern
literary analysis convincingly demonstrates that Joshua through
Kings should be read as a deuteronomic history, governed by the
measure-for-measure theology of Deuteronomy. Akenson's fiction of a
genius who invented his master narrative during the sixth-century
B.C. exile in Babylon is just that.
</P>
<P>
   His narrative trope works even less well for the New Testament
and the Talmuds. Despite his attempts to make sense of the
canonical order of the New Testament books and of the reasons why
the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds comment on some Mishna
tractates but not others, no clear narrative structure emerges.
Admittedly, the Mishna's formulaic linguistic world -- with concise
laws, lists and crisp disputes over cases and contradictions --
produces an intellectual architecture independent of narrative. But
Akenson concedes that the unity of the Babylonian Talmud is a
matter of sensibility, not proof.
</P>
<P>
   Akenson's interpretation of these classics is a promising start
for anyone. He encourages serious, holistic reading by word and
example. Religious believers may be enriched by the exposition of
the ``surpassing wonder'' of these human inventions, even if
dissatisfied by the bracketing of some tenets of their respective
faiths. Cultural critics may find an entree into a more mature
conversation with some texts that live on in our culture. Most
important, this book will guide and stimulate ordinary readers to
read on.

 &UR; IRON DRIZZLE
</P>
<P>
   BY JAMES SAYNOR
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Americans often have an image of Eastern Europe that's not
necessarily appreciated by Eastern Europeans. From across the
Atlantic, the region is seen as unstable and locked in the past,
consumed by ancient fears, sutured together by superstition.
Repression and understatement are the order of the day. Then
there's the weather -- frequently chilly and gray, epitomized by
that most deadly of meteorological states, ``drizzle.''
</P>
<P>
   There's so much grayness, cold and drizzle in ``Country of
Memory,'' a novel set in Eastern Europe by the American writer K.
C. Frederick, that the merest ribbon of blue in the sky causes
people to shuffle together and gaze upward in wonder. Such moments
of community are rare in this story, which mainly focuses on dread,
dislocation and runny noses. It's almost a pastiche of the
20th-century Eastern European novel -- a digest of quiet
desperation, mining a vein of literary styles from Kafka to
Kundera.
</P>
<P>
   But Frederick seems aware that he's writing from without rather
than within and that his tale is something of a conceit, even a
backhanded homage to a cheerless tradition. He carries it off with
surprising esprit.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told mostly from the viewpoint of Petir, a needy
fellow trapped in a ``circle of solitariness,'' who works as a
petty bureaucrat in the vast Pyramid Combine, a state-led bank in
an unspecified fictional country. While the malign Government
grapples with ``unsettlement in the east'' and ``rebellion in the
southern provinces,'' Petir's office thwarts legitimate insurance
claims against the Combine -- like that of a man called Pund, who
lost a leg in a work accident. Pund is convinced that Petir is the
desk drone who deep-sixed his payout. Armed with a hammer, he is
intent on revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Petir must also cope with the oblique demands of two women. His
ex-wife, Marit, is a kleptomaniac librarian with a girlfriend
caught up in student protests. And Lera, his (eventual) lover, is
an enigmatic femme fatale who claims to be dodging both gangsters
and the secret police. She's full of windy remarks: ``All of us are
searching, and we're searching for different things''; ``We can't
be responsible for other people's illusions. . . . Only for our
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Marit and Lera prove unlikely but effective therapists for
Petir, helping to soothe his biggest hang-up -- his memory of the
deaths of his mother, father and grandmother in a huge inferno, set
by his mother, when he was a child. Now all he has to deal with is
Pund. When his wild-eyed nemesis finally catches up with Petir,
it's almost an epiphany: ``Never in his life had he felt so
transcendently content.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick is a fitful storyteller; the narrative pressure of his
novel comes and goes in spurts, like water in an Eastern European
plumbing system. Characters endlessly roam the streets, their minds
looping between horrid childhood memories of impaled goats and
thoughts of their own desolation. They're ``stultified by
self-observation,'' to borrow a phrase once used by the English
novelist Angus Wilson to describe some of his own characters. As a
result, the novel's angst can feel stapled on.
</P>
<P>
   But often there's more life in Frederick's writing than there is
in his characters -- when, for example, Petir's face is described
as ``a blackboard from which some terribly urgent message had been
erased'' or a truck whistles by on the highway like ``an unmoored
planet hurtling through space.'' And the narrative is seasoned with
witty mock-European folklore -- the saga of a disabled botanist
whose heart ends up in the pillar of a cathedral; the myth of ``the
tinker of Beldagg,'' a goblin who can snatch your soul if you utter
a particular word.
</P>
<P>
   For all that the novel is about a man tiptoeing around the edge
of a nervous breakdown, it is also about relishing this condition
in a giddy kind of way. ``Country of Memory'' has an odd,
depressive exuberance. It amounts to Old World gloom described with
irrepressible New World bounce.

 &UR; PIONEER OF THE NEW AGE
</P>
<P>
   BY LIESL SCHILLINGER
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Americans love a self-made man, but the British, as everyone who
reads Private Eye or Jane Austen knows, generally hate anyone who
succeeds and despise anyone who fails, which leaves very little
room for movement.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if biographers are to be kept in work, a few
self-esteeming, ambitious people need to step off the ordinary path
from time to time, if only so their adventures may be recorded as
cautionary tales. In ``Prophet: The Life and Times of Kahlil
Gibran,'' the classical translator and sometime anthologist Robin
Waterfield proves how vexing it must be for a British scholar to
possess a passion for Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Middle
Eastern-born poet and artist who moved to Boston from Bsherri,
Lebanon, when he was 12, held his first critically lauded art
exhibition at 21, had become a respected painter and writer in
Greenwich Village by 30 and at 40 acquired cult status as the
author of a mystical illustrated psalter called, immodestly, ``The
Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gibran's book has been ecstatically embraced by
scarf-swathed disciples of Isadora Duncan and Madame Blavatsky,
hash-brownie-munching beatniks, herbal tea-drinking New Agers and,
evidently, by quite a lot of ordinary people as well.
</P>
<P>
   The book has sold more than 9 million copies in America alone --
each one bearing Gibran's portrait of his prophet, Almustafa, who
resembles the artist and who stares hypnotically off the page like
a gravestone rubbing of the young Pancho Villa. Here is not only a
self-made man, here is something infinitely more embarrassing: the
self-made seer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Prophet,'' Waterfield struggles to present the life and
career without permitting his readers to think that he may himself
have fallen under the swami's spell. His admiration for the man may
be accepted; he has, after all, taken the trouble to edit a Gibran
anthology for Penguin, and this year, in addition to the biography,
he has also written benign introductions to Penguin Arkana's new
translations of Gibran's ``Spirit Brides'' and ``Broken Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   But the unforgiving portrait he paints here reveals a
narcissistic pretender who did not care about his family and who
may have cruelly manipulated his chief patroness, literary
collaborator and one-time fiancee, Mary Haskell Minis, for
financial ends. ``It is hard to avoid the conclusion that he knew
he was on to a good thing, and made sure that it remained in
place,'' Waterfield writes, reducing a complex 20-year relationship
to the exploitation of a lovesick human trust fund by a cad.
</P>
<P>
   He also speculates hand-rubbingly on Gibran's romantic
attachments, divining ``a sexual charge'' between the artist and
his model, Emilie (Micheline) Michel, and detecting a similar
``charge'' in the atmosphere during Gibran's conversations with
Haskell. While he accepts that Gibran never slept with Haskell, he
decides that Gibran and Micheline ``consummated their relationship
sexually,'' though he admits ``there are no extant letters or
anything to provide concrete evidence of this.'' His basis for
Ken-Starring the pair is that Gibran ``was certainly not a virgin''
when he met Micheline, and, more damning, that Baudelaire's
``Fleurs du Mal'' was in print, ``containing some of the most
highly charged erotic poems ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he sneers at Gibran for having been a ``tabula rasa''
when he met his first benefactor, the Boston photographer,
publisher and philanthropist Fred Holland Day, at 13. But one black
mark in Gibran's character overshadows the rest: ``the enormity of
his self-estimation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gibran's character flaws were more thoroughly
explored a quarter-century ago in ``Kahlil Gibran: His Life and
World,'' a lucid, comprehensive biography written by a cousin, also
named Kahlil Gibran, and his wife, Jean, who undertook the project
because they could find no objective study of their illustrious
relative. When they began their book, the chief accounts of
Gibran's life were ``This Man From Lebanon,'' an appreciation by an
acolyte who called herself Barbara Young, who described him as
``one of the rare gestures of the Mighty Unnameable Power,'' and a
sloppy memoir by his good friend Mikhail Naimy, written in Arabic,
that characterized him as a rake and a tippler.
</P>
<P>
   In this 75th anniversary year of the publication of ``The
Prophet,'' the 615 letters and 47 diaries the Gibrans unearthed in
the course of researching their book -- which was expanded and
reprinted in 1991 -- constitute the bulk of firsthand knowledge of
Gibran's American experience.
</P>
<P>
   If Waterfield's ``Prophet'' is pathography, ``Kahlil Gibran: Man
and Poet,'' by the Lebanese scholar Suheil Bushrui and his
colleague Joe Jenkins, both of the Kahlil Gibran Research and
Studies Project at the University of Maryland, breaks new ground,
falling into a category that lies somewhere in between hagiography
and history. Bushrui and Jenkins's adoration of their subject
emerges in their declarations that the poet could ``sing with the
eloquence of Isaiah and the sorrow of Jeremiah,'' that he ought to
be recognized as a national hero for the Arab world, much as
Cuchulain is for the Irish, and, more controversially, that,
although Gibran was a Maronite Christian, ``his writings through
the years reflect his desire to merge the Sufi Muslim tradition
with the Christian mystical heritage of his background.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GIBRAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: background.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet, through their consultation of Arabic and other sources,
the authors add substantial texture to previous descriptions of
Gibran's social and work habits in Beirut, Paris and New York,
paying particular attention to his friendships with men like Rodin,
Yeats and Carl Jung. ``Kahlil Gibran: Man and Poet'' also amplifies
Gibran's relationship with Mary Haskell, furnishing poignant detail
of her November-December marriage with the widower Jacob Florance
Minis, which she embarked upon in 1921 when she was 48, as she and
Gibran were completing their collaboration on ``The Prophet.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskell asked Gibran if she could truthfully tell her Minis that
she loved him ``better than anyone else in the world,'' as he so
often asked her. Gibran told her she could say yes, because ``every
love is the best in the world, and the dearest.'' Haskell married
Minis, but eight years later, while keeping house for Minis in
Savannah, Ga., she still edited Gibran's works in secret,
registering her thoughts about him in her diary in code.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jean and Kahlil Gibran before them, Bushrui and Jenkins are
not afraid to acknowledge the poet's foibles. They readily admit
that he mythologized himself, cultivated famous people and had
sexual relationships with women. They quote a dialogue between
Haskell and Gibran in full: Haskell asked if Gibran thought it was
all right for a man or woman to have as many as seven sexual
partners; he replied, ``If the seven were all willing, yes.'' No
nudges or winks required.
</P>
<P>
   Gibran's widely varying critical reception can be laid not to
any deficit of character or talent, they suggest, but to the
problem of categorization. His writing ``is neither pure literature
nor pure philosophy, and as an Arab work written in English it
belongs exclusively to no particular tradition.'' In other words 9
million people have bought the book and don't know where to shelve
it.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of book is ``The Prophet''? No one could call it
humble, no one could say it is not derivative. It is a slim volume
of fewer than 20,000 words, in which its hero, Almustafa (Gibran),
at the invitation of his muse, Almitra (Mary Haskell), tells the
people of Orphalese (New York) what he really thinks about
everything. Its poems are incantatory and willfully symbolic, and
they resonate of Blake, Yeats, the King James Bible, Laotzu and,
occasionally, the off-kilter whimsy of the Portuguese poet Fernando
Pessoa.
</P>
<P>
   Bushrui and Jenkins, wishing to claim Gibran for Islam, insist
that he also echoes Sufi precepts, and there is no reason to rule
that out, either. Gibran's drawings and watercolors, which are
often dismissed as overpretty, resonate of Rodin, Redon, Picasso's
``Romeo and Juliet'' and assorted Pre-Raphaelites.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the themes he chooses to discuss are in no way
original: Gibran wrote on love, family, beauty, pain and death. Of
married love, he wrote: ``Make not a bond of love: Let it rather be
a moving sea between the shores of your souls.'' Of children, he
wrote: ``Your children are not your children. They are the sons and
daughters of Life's longing for itself.'' Beauty, he apostrophized,
is ``eternity gazing at itself in a mirror. But you are eternity
and you are the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it gnomic nonsense, but ``thy nose is as the tower of
Lebanon'' sounds absurd if you don't know it's from the Song of
Solomon, and ``the cut worm forgives the plow'' is gibberish to
someone who does not admire Blake. Only somehow more people are
willing to confess admiration for Blake than for Gibran.
</P>
<P>
   On April 11, 1931, Kahlil Gibran died in his studio in New York.
The woman by his side was his secretary and later his biographer,
Barbara Young, who had begun working for him seven years earlier,
after Haskell married Minis. In his most significant addition to
Gibran lore, Waterfield furnishes the dramatic post-script. Because
both Haskell and Gibran had been exceedingly discreet, nobody, much
less Young, suspected the strength of their attachment, and when
Young discovered Haskell's letters in the studio, he recounts, she
was shocked. Gibran's will had left the management of his art
collection to Haskell, but Young soon began to appropriate not only
his artworks but his correspondence and other artifacts, claiming
that Gibran had meant her to have them.
</P>
<P>
   Gibran's will also incensed many of his Boston relatives,
because it bequeathed royalties from sales of ``The Prophet'' to
Bsherri, the tiny mountainside town he had left in 1895. Waterfield
suggests that the grandiose gesture was a bid to retroactively
create the myth Gibran had spread among his American friends --
that his family had been wealthy. If so, it was a scheme worthy of
a Gatsby. However, once hundreds of thousands of dollars began
flowing from the publisher into Bsherri, fierce squabbles divided
the villagers; the Lebanese government had to step in to restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The larger squabble over the worth of Gibran's literary legacy
may never be resolved. Bushrui and Jenkins glumly conclude that the
critical split that Jean and Kahil Gibran deplored decades ago
plagues Gibran scholars today: ``those who have deified him and
those who have dismissed him as a mere populist poet'' still refuse
to be reconciled. A solution to this troubled opposition may lurk
within the multipurpose wisdom of ``The Prophet.'' Just as Gibran
instructed married couples to imagine their love as an ocean that
unites as well as separates them, the quarreling camps might as
well acknowledge that their shared obsession joins them in a
partnership of opposed minds. Like it or not, Kahlil Gibran is
``the moving sea between the shores of their souls.''

 &UR; A VULGAR PUSHING WOMAN
</P>
<P>
   BY LINDA SIMON
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever'' is hardly sufficient to describe Fanny Trollope.
Essayist, novelist, travel writer and, not incidentally, mother of
Anthony, she was clever to be sure. But ``indomitable,''
``tireless'' and ``determined'' seem closer to the reality of her
breathtakingly energetic life.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning her writing career under duress at the age of 53, she
rose each day before dawn to produce, over the next two decades,
more than 40 books. If some critics thought her surname an apt
epithet for her stature as a writer, if Robert Browning warned his
wife against seeing ``that vulgar pushing woman who is not fit to
speak to you,'' still Fanny Trollope became, in her own time,
nothing less than a literary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   A contemporary of Jane Austen, Frances Milton grew up learning
the skills that should have enabled her to glide effortlessly into
a good marriage, but she managed to reach the age of 29 without an
offer. In ``Fanny Trollope: The Life and Adventures of a Clever
Woman,'' Pamela Neville-Sington, an American literary scholar who
now lives in London, suggests a few reasons: Growing up motherless,
Fanny never developed what one observer called ``taste and female
intelligence in regard to dress.'' A more significant drawback to
marriage was her lively mind, invigorated by her father's abundant
library. Women's ``terror of being called learned,'' she later
wrote, ``is in general more powerful than that of being classed as
ignorant.''
</P>
<P>
   She was a formidable match, but at last, early in 1808, she met
a man who was not daunted by her. He was Thomas Anthony Trollope, a
shy, serious barrister who had just moved into the Milton family's
London neighborhood. By summer, the two were exchanging books and
letters. In May 1809, they married. Immediately, the Trollopes
began a family; within nine years, they had six children. With
Fanny in charge of the nursery, Thomas assumed control of the
budget, for which he had little talent. As financial worries took
their toll, Thomas became increasingly morose and withdrawn. He was
no companion for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1820s, she found one: the Scottish social
reformer Frances Wright, recently returned from Tennessee, where
she had established Nashoba, a community dedicated to educating
freed slaves. Trollope was beguiled by her intrepid friend and
leapt at the chance to accompany Wright back to America. In early
November 1827, Trollope, with her 16-year-old son, Henry, her two
daughters and Auguste Hervieu, a struggling young artist who had
tutored her sons (and whose relationship with Trollope generated
considerable gossip), left England.
</P>
<P>
   After two months of arduous travel, they finally reached
Nashoba, outside Memphis. But one glimpse of its dismal, roofless
log cabins, Fanny said, ``sufficed to convince me that every idea I
had formed of the place was as far as possible from the truth.
Desolation was the only feeling -- the only word that presented
itself.'' There was no question of staying, and within two weeks
Trollope had devised a new plan. Her party would head up the Ohio
River to Cincinnati, reputedly the fastest-growing city in America.
</P>
<P>
   She brimmed with ideas for making money. First, she advertised
her son as a Latin tutor, but no students appeared. Undaunted, she
proposed to a local museum an entertainment she called ``The
Invisible Girl,'' in which Henry portrayed a mock Delphic oracle.
The public loved it, and Trollope was given another commission,
this time for a wax museum attraction called ``Infernal Regions,''
featuring terrifying scenes from Dante. These successes were not
enough to support the Trollope menage, however, and Fanny threw
herself into a grander scheme: the Bazaar, a combination mall,
theater, amusement park and museum. With the family's future riding
on this venture, Fanny spared no cost in making it spectacular. But
she had miscalculated. The Bazaar, the Americans decided, was too
decadent. They refused to come.
</P>
<P>
   Facing destitution, Trollope needed to act and act quickly. Her
next plan seemed just as risky: she would write a book based on her
American journey. A woman's view of the frontier, she believed,
just might find a receptive audience. Supported by Hervieu's
earnings as an artist, she stayed in America until she had gathered
enough material; back in England, she found a publisher willing to
take a chance on an unknown writer. In March 1832, nine days after
her 53d birthday, ``The Domestic Manners of the Americans''
appeared. ``I awoke one morning and found myself famous,'' she
wrote to her eldest son, echoing Lord Byron.
</P>
<P>
   The book sold through four editions in its first year. Her
candid, often acerbic critique of America fed British skepticism
about the supposed wonders of democracy, while at the same time
offering a vivid, lively commentary on social conditions in the
still-new world. American readers were less generous: Margaret
Fuller, for one, felt that Trollope had ``violated the virgin
beauty'' of her native land.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans were not Trollope's audience, and the enormous
popularity of her book in England inspired her travels to France,
Austria and Italy. Her success as a travel writer led her to
publish, to equal acclaim, 35 novels. Neville-Sington reads this
fiction as a reflection of Trollope's experiences, frequently
citing the novels to help us understand Trollope's responses and
relationships. Since Trollope, throughout her work, was above all a
social critic, this strategy seems appropriate and illuminating.
Although at some moments the biography takes on the pace and tone
of Trollope's own romances (abundant cheerfulness! many exclamation
points!), still Neville-Sington, attentive to historical context
and telling detail, has captured the spirit of the times -- and of
her subject.
</P>
<P>
   If Trollope merits a biography for her own accomplishments,
certainly some readers will come to this book for insights about
her famous son, whose literary reputation far exceeds hers. Feeling
abandoned when she left for America without him, Anthony never
established the rapport with her that his brothers had managed, and
his portrait of her in his memoirs often bristles with anger. Yet
Neville-Sington believes that Fanny inspired one of Anthony's
particularly fearless and charming fictional heroines, Glencora
Palliser. ``I do not know that she was at all points a lady,'' he
wrote, ``but had Fate so willed it she would have been a thorough
gentleman.''

 THE COWBOY AND THE DANDY

<P>
   Crossing Over From Romanticism to Rock and Roll.

   By Perry Meisel.

 &UR; PERCY B. GOODE
</P>
<P>
   BY TERRY TEACHOUT
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor of the melting pot is now desperately
unfashionable, but you cannot begin to tell the story of American
music without recourse to it. Virtually every musical idiom that
has left its mark on our culture -- jazz, musical comedy, country,
bluegrass, rock -- has been the product of ethnic hybridization.
Even the best American classical music bears its stamp: witness
Aaron Copland, whose ``American-sounding'' music was composed by a
Brooklyn-born Jew of Russian lineage who studied in France and
salted his scores with jazz-derived syncopations, Mexican folk
tunes and cowboy ballads.
</P>
<P>
   As Copland's example suggests, musical crossbreeding also
frequently involves a like encounter between vernacular and
cultivated traditions -- what Philip Rahv famously called ``redskin
and paleface.'' Though Perry Meisel makes no mention of Rahv's
dichotomy in ``The Cowboy and the Dandy,'' it is hard to overlook
its distant echoes in this intelligent but poorly focused
exploration of the wellsprings of postwar pop music.
</P>
<P>
   According to Meisel, a part-time rock critic and full-time
professor of English at New York University who has previously
written on Thomas Hardy, Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater, rock is
the product of a confluence of ``country and city'' -- 19th-century
English Romanticism and African-American blues tradition -- that is
prefigured in the process by which the small-group ``jump'' jazz of
urban jukebox idols of the 1940's like Louis Jordan evolved into
full-fledged rhythm and blues. ``Rock-and-roll,'' Meisel writes,
``is the crossing of cowboy and dandy. If you grew up on westerns
and Sherlock Holmes, your destiny was rock-and-roll. . . . Little
Richard, Jimi Hendrix, Prince -- all balance in a single style the
cowboy's strength, the dandy's charm; the cowboy's rage, the
dandy's melancholia.''
</P>
<P>
   Interwoven is a parallel discussion of the cowboy and the dandy
in English and American literature. ``Much as rhythm and blues is
the link between jazz and rock-and-roll,'' Meisel asserts,
``estheticism is the link between Romanticism and literary
modernism.'' But he is more interesting when talking about music,
though the ostentatious erudition of ``The Cowboy and the Dandy''
fails to conceal its author's sometimes shaky grasp of musical
fundamentals; he seems to think, for example, that Charlie Parker
and the beboppers were the first to introduce to jazz the
``Euro-harmonics'' that were in fact present from its earliest
days.
</P>
<P>
   The use of a loaded term like ``Euro-harmonics'' is a dead
give-away that Meisel is dealing from a politically stacked deck.
Not that there are all that many dead give-aways in this often
indigestible prose, which is full of clotted sentences that only a
post-modern literary scholar could love: ``Jazz's originary and
agonistic relation to European music proceeds, moreover, by means
of its use of fugitive African sources as the only defense at first
available with which to deflect the discourse of the oppressor.''
</P>
<P>
   Meisel's sludgy style will come as no surprise to those
masochists who keep up with high academic fashion. Small wonder
that the fruits of contemporary scholarship in the humanities are
so widely viewed with contemptuous incomprehension by nonscholarly
critics and the common reader, since the members of the
professoriate are so reluctant to translate their ideas into the
plain English of the public intellectual. In most cases, of course,
translation would be an exercise in futility -- jargon-jugglers are
rarely capable of disciplined thought -- but I suspect there is a
genuinely worthy book lurking somewhere in the midst of ``The
Cowboy and the Dandy,'' which contains unexpectedly shrewd comments
on such varied figures as Muddy Waters and Willa Cather. Alas,
Meisel has not taken the trouble to write it, and so it isn't
likely that very many people will take the trouble to read it.

   Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan Huntington

 &UR; TWO BELLES OF AMHERST
</P>
<P>
   BY RENEE TURSI
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the late 1870's Emily Dickinson wrote the
following lines to her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington Dickinson:
``Susan knows /
</P>
<P>
   she is a Siren -- /
</P>
<P>
   and that at a /
</P>
<P>
   word from her, /
</P>
<P>
   Emily would /
</P>
<P>
   forfeit Righteousness -- .''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's complex relationship with Susan, the wife of her
brother, Austin, remains a knotty one for biographers. Local lore
has handed down a tale of two young impassioned friends who, while
eventually living only ``a hedge away'' from each other on Main
Street in Amherst, Mass., went on to have a 15-year falling-out.
Rumors that Susan was a ruthless social snubber who had wronged
Emily may be problematic, given that their source is Mabel Loomis
Todd, with whom Austin carried on a highly public, lasting affair.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly no more credible is Martha Dickinson Bianchi, Susan and
Austin's daughter, who insisted that the affection between her
much-maligned mother and ``Aunt Emily'' never waned. After all, it
was Susan who prepared the poet's body for burial and wrote her
obituary. At the very least, most scholars agree that Susan was a
force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson's surviving letters to Susan, which began ardently a
few years before Susan's marriage and continued almost until the
poet's death in 1886, outnumber her letters to anyone else. After
an examination of these cryptic messages, Ellen Louise Hart and
Martha Nell Smith have emerged up in arms for Susan. In compiling
``Open Me Carefully'' (which includes more than 20 poems and one
letter not previously connected to Susan), they aim to show that
the women enjoyed a long, close relationship, one whose workaday
exchange of ``letter-poems'' (Susan's term) contributed to ``the
texture of their daily life.'' Even more urgent, however, is their
intent to champion Susan as Dickinson's ``primary reader'' -- the
person they believe exerted the most significant, sustaining
influence on Dickinson's poetic and erotic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   This claim is probably a stretch, considering Dickinson's rich
correspondence with intellectuals like Thomas Wentworth Higginson
and Samuel Bowles. Nonetheless, Susan not only seems to elicit some
of Dickinson's most exquisite phrasings but also a free and mature
expression of desire. Moreover, it was Susan who recognized that
Dickinson's early poems deserved to be published, unlike both
Higginson and Bowles.
</P>
<P>
   While few of Susan's replies exist, her response to a version of
Dickinson's poem ``Safe in Their Alabaster Chambers'' shows her to
be an astute reader. She observes that the second verse ``does not
go with the ghostly shimmer of the first verse'' -- a critique that
evoked not only a new stanza from Dickinson but also a letter-poem,
apparently in gratitude, that reads: ``Your praise is good -- /
</P>
<P>
   to me -- because I know /
</P>
<P>
   it knows -- and suppose -- /
</P>
<P>
   it means --.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dickinson's biographer Richard Sewall has commented, the
poet's publication history might have been vastly different if her
audience ``had all been Sues.'' Dickinson herself, near the end of
her life, wrote to Susan: ``With the Exception of Shakespeare, you
have told me of more knowledge than any one living -- To say that
sincerely is strange praise --.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, perhaps. At the age of 20, Dickinson longs to hold her
friend ``in my arms.'' A few years later Susan is told she can ``go
or stay'' because ``we differ often lately, and this must be the
last.'' And when both women had reached their 40s, Dickinson wrote:
``Sue -- to be /
</P>
<P>
   lovely as you /
</P>
<P>
   is a touching /
</P>
<P>
   Contest, though /
</P>
<P>
   like the Siege /
</P>
<P>
   of Eden, impracticable, /
</P>
<P>
   Eden never /capitulates --.''
</P>
<P>
   In her contemplation of Susan, Dickinson mused: ``What depths /
</P>
<P>
   of Domingo /
</P>
<P>
   in that torrid /
</P>
<P>
   Spirit!'' and, using phrases that may neatly compress the
enigmatic quality of their bond, writes: ``In a Life that /
</P>
<P>
   stopped guessing, /
</P>
<P>
   you and I should /
</P>
<P>
   not feel at home.''
</P>
<P>
   With spare commentary, Smith, who teaches English at the
University of Maryland, College Park, and Hart, who teaches writing
and literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wisely
let these letters speak for themselves. Most important, unlike
previous editors who altered line breaks to fit their sense of what
is poetry or prose, Hart and Smith offer faithful reproductions of
the letters' genre-defying form as the words unravel spectacularly
down the original page. All the better to appreciate, in a fresh
and overdue context, that poetic voice we have come to know --
iridescent, puzzling, explosive.

 &UR; ONE PICTURE WAS WORTH A MILLION BUCKS
</P>
<P>
   BY BERNARD WEINRAUB
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was two tough and strong-willed sons of an Italian immigrant
farmer from the Santa Clara Valley near San Jose, Calif., who
revolutionized the movie business. The time was 1906. The young
men, the bankers Amadeo Peter Giannini and his brother Attilio,
made a $100 loan to Sol Lesser, a 17-year-old nickelodeon owner who
needed the money to pay for the delivery of a film. (Lesser later
became one of the major exhibitors in California.) Over the next
few years, the Giannini brothers expanded their business with
several other movie companies and began to develop relationships
with some of the most powerful men in the fledgling industry. ``The
Gianninis were the first bankers to recognize the motion picture
business as a legitimate industry,'' David Puttnam writes in
``Movies and Money.'' He adds, ``The extent of the affinity between
the Gianninis and the pioneers of the movie colony was
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giannini brothers are two of the lesser-known, if colorful,
figures in a sober book about the movie business that struggles to
deal with several overlapping themes: the birth of the film
industry and the rivalries among the early innovators; the
inevitable and long-running collision between art and commerce;
Hollywood's hegemony over European films and the sometimes angry,
sometimes silly intellectual posturing in which European (mostly
French) filmmakers sputter about all those beastly American values
polluting Continental shores. (Jean-Luc Godard claimed that his
struggle against Hollywood's commercial imperialism was analogous
to the workers' struggle against capitalism. But as Puttnam points
out, Godard was forced to concede that ``workers don't come to see
my films.'')
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam is now Lord Puttnam, one of Tony Blair's life peers. He
is also an Oscar-winning producer, responsible for such impressive
films as ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``Midnight Express,'' ``Local
Hero,'' ``The Killing Fields'' and ``The Mission.'' But in
Hollywood Puttnam is best known for his tumultuous 15-month reign
in 1986-87 as chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia
Pictures, then owned by Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   No studio head had challenged so many top producers, agents and
movie stars in such a short period of time. Puttnam contended more
than a decade ago that the costs of filmmaking were out of control,
that movie stars were treated like spoiled children and that
studios had yielded too much power to agents and producers. He may
have had a tendency to pontificate and, surprisingly, never quite
understood Hollywood's rules of behavior, which fall somewhere
between ``The Godfather'' and a Kabuki drama. But he was right.
</P>
<P>
   If only Puttnam had used ``Movies and Money'' to explore those
turbulent months when he tangled with Ray Stark, Michael Ovitz,
Dustin Hoffman, Bill Murray and numerous others. What happened?
What did he learn? Instead, Puttnam vaguely addresses his Hollywood
tenure: ``Many factors contributed to my eventual departure,'' he
remarks. With the kind of stiff-upper-lip reticence that seems
entirely uncharacteristic of the author, he says that ``it became a
conflict between two differing ideas of cinema which, in some ways,
seemed to be at the heart of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this reticence is symptomatic of a sometimes
dramatic, sometimes thoughtful and often ambiguous book (written
with Neil Watson), one that is based on a series of lectures
Puttnam gave in Berlin in 1994 and at Oxford University one year
later. ``Movies and Money'' leaps only sporadically from its
academic roots, and rarely makes the movie business any more alive
-- or zany -- than the insurance business. In fact, it starts
pulsing only at midpoint, when Puttnam deals with the eccentric and
often brilliant moguls of the 1930's and 40's, like Irving
Thalberg, Louis B. Mayer, Darryl Zanuck and David O. Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the stories may be old, but they're priceless. Like Jack
Warner telling Albert Einstein, who was visiting the studio,
``Well, professor, I have a theory of relatives too -- don't hire
'em.'' Or Harry Cohn betting his brother Jack $50 that he couldn't
recite the Lord's Prayer. Jack started, ``Now I lay me down to
sleep. . . .'' Harry interrupted and gave him the money. ``That's
enough -- I really didn't realize you knew it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Puttnam observes shrewdly, ``if there was one thing
that bound the bosses together, moguls and production chiefs alike,
it was their passion for gambling. Cards, horses, roulette --
despite their cultural differences gambling became an all-embracing
passion.'' He goes on, ``It was hardly surprising that such men
should find their natural home in a high-risk business like the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam seems less interested in moguls, though, than in the
unresolvable debate over whether movies are an art or merely a
commodity like cars or jeans. His focal point is the contentious
1993 trade talks between the Clinton Administration and Hollywood
on one side and many European countries on the other. The Americans
wanted films to trade freely like any other manufactured goods. The
Europeans objected, believing that their own industries would
collapse under the weight of all those Sylvester Stallone and Bruce
Willis movies. The issue, which is, of course, about American
culture dominating Europe, was left stalemated.
</P>
<P>
   As Puttnam observes, the conflicting visions of filmmaking --
and filmmakers -- date back to the birth of the business. ``The
physical and intellectual remoteness of Los Angeles from the rest
of America, combined with the feelings of hope and optimism
engendered by the California sunshine, all played a part in shaping
the distinctive ethos of Hollywood cinema,'' he writes. ``The
situation was very different in Europe, where filmmaking was
overwhelmingly concentrated in Berlin, London, Paris and Rome --
cities that were also centers of traditional culture. Consequently,
in Europe there was far more interaction between the film community
and those involved with theater and literature.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MOVIES-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: literature.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, although European directors and producers have
naturally wanted to make money, their film tradition was often far
more intellectual, and suffused with a cultural lineage missing in
Hollywood. Unfortunately for them, Hollywood films, with their
fantasy and sheer entertainment value, have dwarfed European
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Puttnam sides with the Europeans, but only up to a point. ``It
is frankly dangerous to allow Hollywood's extraordinary dominance
in the field of filmed entertainment to go on intensifying,'' he
writes. Films and television, he says, shape attitudes, reinforce
or undermine values. Yet he also points out that film audiences
abroad have all but fled from locally made films; American movies
account for at least 80 percent of the box office across most of
the Continent. One of the reasons, he explains, is that ``European
filmmakers have on occasion, most notably in the late 1960's and
1970's, displayed varying degrees of irresponsibility toward their
financial backers, and something approaching contempt toward the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   PUTTNAM'S conclusions are blurry. He suggests that the Europeans
should probably forget about competing head on with Hollywood
because ``Americans understand, better than anyone else, how to
produce and market films, just as the Germans make cars, the French
make perfume and the Scots make whisky.'' He raises the idea that
Europeans should focus more on new technologies in information and
education.
</P>
<P>
   While he seems unmistakably ambivalent about the studio system,
Puttnam clearly admires the men who created it: ``Whatever else
happened to them, they were determined to have the priceless sense
of security that came from wealth and power. That was why, when it
came to fighting for overseas markets, they found it so easy to put
aside all the personal hatreds, their internecine rivalries and
their quarrels over talent. Cinema might aspire to become an art
form or be a wonderful vehicle for the dissemination of political
and ethical values, but finally it was a business like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   American movies were built on what Puttnam terms the twin
pillars of investment and profit. ``The Europeans,'' he declares,
``never really seemed prepared to address these obvious and simple
realities.''

 FINDING FRAN

   History and Memory in the Lives of Two Women.

 &UR; WORLDS APART
</P>
<P>
   BY GERALDINE BROOKS
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Girls' friendships haven't been well served by either literature
or popular culture. There's no Huck and Jim paradigm; with the
exception of ``Thelma and Louise,'' no notable buddy movies.
Instead, female friendships have mostly been portrayed as perilous
alliances, destined to be undone by sexual rivalry, cattiness,
witchcraft or PMS.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a relief to meet Lois and Fran, inseparable high school
friends in 1950's suburban Los Angeles. Smart, artistic and
athletic at a time when girls were supposed to be watchers, not
doers, they dreamed of adventuring together someday in New York.
Fran would paint, Lois would sing and any brilliant future might be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But then the two lost touch and years passed. Lois W. Banner
became a feminist historian and a professor at the University of
Southern California. Fran converted to Islam and became Noura,
living behind the veil in the closed Saudi Arabian city of Mecca
before settling with her family in Egypt. Banner, who has
specialized in retrieving women's forgotten histories, decided to
find her own lost friend and write the narrative of their lives,
together and apart.
</P>
<P>
   The result is part memoir, part social history and only partly
successful. I wish Banner had decided to write a story rather than
conduct a study. Instead, she tries to do both. When she allows
herself to be a storyteller, the prose unfolds with affecting
spontaneity. But then she seems suddenly to remember that she's a
professor and starts studding the text with analysis delivered in
language-withering academese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding Fran'' is at its best when Banner writes about her
not-always-happy childhood. Her extended family lived in one of the
grandest mansions in the suburb of Inglewood, not because they were
rich but because it was the only house big enough to hold them.
Into an imposing Gothic pile with an Italian marble fireplace and
velvet-embossed wallpaper moved Lois and her three siblings, her
parents, one set of grandparents, a great-grandmother, an uncle and
a threadbare collection of Salvation Army furnishings. Her
description of this setting and its characters is clear-eyed and
convincingly complex, as is her evocation of the depressingly low
expectations for the girls at her suburban high.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two life stories in this book, and while Banner's
is the better told, it isn't the better tale. It is her friend Fran
who has led the more unusual life: fleeing suburbia to join a
famous commune, Lama, on a mountain in New Mexico; then shaking the
place to its foundations by leaving her husband and running off
with one of the community's founders; finally, plunging into the
rigors of a Muslim life that included three years studying in Mecca
-- a city closed to nonbelievers in which few American women have
ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is rich material, but Banner approaches it too tentatively.
She fails to delve into Fran's acceptance of Saudi Arabia's
restrictions on women. She hints at the way these restrictions have
created a parallel, separatist female world, but offers
frustratingly few details of Fran's life within it. Likewise,
Fran's current life in Alexandria, Egypt, is barely sketched.
</P>
<P>
   For an academic, Banner is also oddly uncritical of sources like
Jehan Sadat's self-serving autobiography, and occasionally careless
with facts. For example, describing Fran's formative sojourn among
Palestinians in Jerusalem, she writes: ``In the mid-1970's, Muslims
still predominated in Jerusalem; Jews migrating there weren't yet
in the majority. It was still a city of domes and minarets.'' But
in Jerusalem's modern history Jews have been more than half the
population since 1860; by 1967 the city was 75 percent Jewish, and
a considerable portion of the remaining minority was Christian.
</P>
<P>
   What Banner achieves in this book is an insightful portrait of
her own family and her experiences in post-World War II America.
She has found herself. Fran, alas, remains elusive.

 IF A LION COULD TALK
<TEXT>
<P>
   Animal Intelligence and the Evolution of Consciousness.

 &UR; STUPID LION TRICKS
</P>
<P>
   BY JERRY A. COYNE
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A premier tourist attraction of Edinburgh is a statue of
Greyfriars Bobby, arguably the most famous dog in British history.
In 1856 John Gray, a Scottish constable, acquired this small Skye
terrier as a working pet. Two years later Gray died, and until his
own death 14 years after, Bobby kept a constant vigil at his
master's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Sentimental Victorians, touched by the dog's loyalty and hopeful
that they would be remembered, made him a national celebrity.
Bobby's tale has spawned several movies and dozens of books,
obviously plucking a deep emotional chord.
</P>
<P>
   Valuing animals in proportion to their apparent possession of
human emotions and mentality is the subject of ``If a Lion Could
Talk,'' an extended critique of anthropomorphism in animal behavior
research.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stephen Budiansky, a writer for The Atlantic
Monthly, professional biologists are almost as sentimental as the
admirers of Bobby, a trait that has produced dozens of flawed and
biased studies showing that animals, particularly primates, have
emotions, intellect and consciousness similar in kind if not in
degree to those of humans.
</P>
<P>
   He abhors such work because it yields false scientific
conclusions and buttresses the political agenda of ``animal-rights
advocates and New Age mystics,'' who base their ethics on the
similarity between humans and animals. He takes on many areas of
behavioral science infected by anthropomorphism, including
communication, navigation, intelligence and consciousness. Although
the descriptions and dissections of experiments are occasionally
confusing, they form a lively summary of the problems inherent in
this field (his analyses of animal ``counting'' and the use of sign
language by apes are particularly absorbing, while the discussion
of honeybee navigation is less successful).
</P>
<P>
   Budiansky sees three major problems with such research. First,
experimental designs are often flawed, as in the famous case of
Clever Hans, the counting horse whose ``mathematical abilities''
resulted from unconscious cues given by credulous onlookers.
Similar cues have cast doubt on studies of sign language in apes as
proof of their semantic abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some reports of animal emotion or intelligence could
merely be human misinterpretations of simple learning by
association. Casting a cold eye on Greyfriars Bobby, one might say
that he felt neither love nor bereavement, but, like a Skinnerian
pigeon pecking in vain for a tidbit, showed only a conditioned
response (association with his master) that gave rewards in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some supposed signs of animal consciousness may be only
evolved responses that do not involve subjective feelings. When I
poke an earthworm with a stick, does it recoil because it feels
pain, or merely because stimulating the proper nerves produces an
automatic (and adaptive) response?
</P>
<P>
   The main problems with Budiansky's own conclusions are clear to
those familiar with the scientific literature. The author makes
seemingly devastating and unrebutted attacks on experiments, but in
reality many of these studies seem quite credible. Budiansky, for
example, dismisses with withering scorn the use of mirrors by apes
as evidence for self-awareness, but many of his criticisms have
been answered already.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, his citation of ``the total failure of experiments to
support the idea that monkeys or apes are capable of imitation'' is
a gross distortion: recent work shows that apes may indeed perform
complex acts by imitating others. Conversely, the evolutionary
origins of some behaviors --such as ``alarm calls'' produced by
animals when they see a predator -- are still under debate, but
Budiansky writes as if the final answers are known. He does his
readers no favor by purveying such simplified and one-sided views.
</P>
<P>
   Budiansky concludes that work on animal intelligence is futile,
and that we should simply respect and treasure species as unique
products of natural selection. To a biologist this seems better
than valuing animals for their human qualities, although it does
not tell us whether it is acceptable to eat oysters but not veal.
</P>
<P>
   I am not convinced, however, that a few flawed studies negate
the whole venture of seeking the roots of human behavior by
studying our relatives. Comparative work on primates has given
valuable clues about the evolution of some human traits, and there
is no reason why well-designed work could not shed light on our
emotions and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   By far the book's biggest failing is the confusion and
contradiction imbuing the discussion of animal consciousness, which
occupies but one scant chapter. Budiansky simply finesses this
complex problem by defining consciousness in a way that limits it
to humans. Although virtually all philosophers of mind agree that
consciousness is the capacity to have subjective experience (e.g.,
to feel pain or pleasure), Budiansky's definition is ``the ability
to have thoughts about thoughts -- 'secondary representations' or
'meta-representations' '' -- in a word, to think about one's
motivations and to fathom the motivations and desires of others. He
admits that this requires the ability to think symbolically --
``language is so intimately tied to consciousness that the two seem
inseparable.'' Since only humans (but not infants!) have language,
only humans can be conscious. Moreover, he gives a controversial
scenario for the evolution of consciousness, suggesting that it
``may have been an adaptive strategy precisely because it provided
the material for speculating about the thoughts (and thus the
motives) of others.'' But such selection could operate on any
highly social animal, whether or not it has language. Budiansky
also ignores an important alternative theory: consciousness may not
have been a direct product of natural selection, but simply a
feature that arose in brains reaching a certain level of
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two pages, Budiansky considers the looser definition
of consciousness, concluding that no nonhuman species has
subjective experience, feels pain or is self-aware. In our state of
ignorance, this declaration is foolish. Whether members of other
species are conscious (and, if so, what aspects of the nervous
system produce this phenomenon) may never be known, for solutions
require either self-reporting animals or a very deep understanding
of the brain. Nevertheless, I find it quite plausible that my cat
feels pain when I inadvertently step on his tail. (Cats also
produce endorphins, molecules whose main function is to relieve
pain.) And who can be certain that Greyfriars Bobby did not miss
his master?

 &UR; ARTFUL DODGERS
</P>
<P>
   BY WILLIAM R. EVERDELL
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More like a catalogue than an encyclopedia, ``The Neighborhoods
of Brooklyn'' consists of short illustrated chapters on 47 big-city
neighborhoods, a baseball team and a bridge. The bridge is a
century old, the ball club is long gone, but the neighborhoods are
alive and kicking. Brooklyn is on a roll these days, ``an urban
delight,'' as this book says; and these neighborhoods, with their
fuzzy boundaries that so rarely show up on a map, are Brooklyn.
Each one has a real existence, streets full of people, a history
and a separate state of mind. And beyond the 47 that rate their own
chapters are the scores of smaller ones (like Homecrest, which
abuts Sheepshead Bay) that appear only in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Shaped since Brooklyn's birth in the 1630's by the different
ways residents have used to get in and get out of them (the ferry,
the horsecar, the trolley, the bicycle, the brisk walk, the subway
and even, southeast of Flatbush, the automobile), the ``hoods''
have had three centuries to evolve, and have come to expect a long
and vigorous future. Indeed, since something they call the
``renaissance'' began in the late 1960's, Brooklynites have become
tireless and almost tiresome in their boosterism. ``The
Neighborhoods of Brooklyn'' is hardly the first book in this vein.
Now, 40 years after the Dodgers' betrayal and The Brooklyn Eagle's
last issue and 100 years since the city's absorption by New York, a
revived Eagle is on the newsstands, and stacks of folio Brooklyn
books threaten to punch right through the old hardwood floors of
all those row houses.
</P>
<P>
   But this Brooklyn book comes not from a neighborhood association
or a real estate sales campaign but out of an ad hoc scholarly
program, a civic-minded effort to reintegrate the great American
cities into American culture. The task is surprisingly difficult.
We Americans have always tended to insist that ``nature'' civilizes
better than the cities that created civilization and still sustain
it, though this is a very strange idea in the ancestor culture of
Europe. When the Dodgers departed and The Eagle folded, American
history was at just the point where the population of cities, as
defined by the census, was exceeded by the population of noncities,
suburbs and the like. It was then that the political agenda of the
cities, the ``New Deal liberalism'' that had flourished between the
1920 and 1960 censuses, began to be replaced by the ``emerging
Republican majority.'' The tilt to the suburbs is a major event in
American history, though it is now overshadowed in the history
texts I teach from by the contemporaneous cold war. If the
textbooks ever demote the cold war for this more important event,
Brooklyn will be a major example of it, and the ``further reading''
will be books by Kenneth Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a scholar, and scholars cannot command much better
placement in national media than the rest of us. One form of
scholarly ambition is to be known beyond the boundaries of one's
own small subdivision of a discipline -- to be read, listened to
and made use of in the towns and counties of scholarship spread
over more than one of its states. By this measure Jackson, a
historian of the contemporary United States, is a major American
voice, with well over 300 citations in the past 10 years in
publications covering fields that neighbor history and employ it,
including archeology, antiques, geography, political science,
ecology, economics, urban studies and law. It has taken time. There
were far fewer Jackson citations in the previous decade, and most
were for a book called ``Crabgrass Frontier'' (1985), which was the
first comprehensive history of suburbanization in the United States
and stands, with John Stilgoe's ``Borderland,'' as the best. Other
living scholars are more widely cited -- more famous in this
measurable sense -- but Jackson is cited for things that are
notably unpalatable to the news media and others who control public
access to the national debate. His work makes cities look good,
cars look bad and privatization seem a decidedly mixed blessing for
democratic republicans -- or for a citizen majority. ``Crabgrass
Frontier,'' its fuse ticking away in the obscurity of scholarly
exchange, is a mine set under some of the more important
load-bearing pillars of the current social order.
</P>
<P>
   No mere theorist, but an established, unpolemical historian who
knows cities inside and out, Jackson is a New Yorker by choice, not
inheritance. Born in 1939 in Memphis and a graduate of Memphis
State University, Jackson in his first book, ``The Ku Klux Klan in
the City'' (1967), devastatingly anatomized how American fascism
was organized in cities like Memphis by people who hated city
values. After a stint in Chicago, Jackson came to teach at Columbia
University in 1968, the year of student upheaval; he is still
there. By now, his contributions to his adoptive city have made him
what was once called a ``leading citizen''; and the big folio
``Encyclopedia of New York City'' that he edited in 1995 has become
an instant classic, its authoritative details turning up in ever
larger numbers in the gamut of New York's journalism. In each book,
Jackson has conscientiously plumbed sources both vast and various,
from statistical abstracts to dusty local histories by provincial
patriots (Brooklyn has more than its share of those), and made them
part of a national -- even a global -- story about the rise, sprawl
and decline of big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn'' continues the project of a
pro-urban urban history, this time by detailing in charming and
highly accessible form the facts about a city that works. Once a
county of six farming villages, now more populous than Boston, San
Francisco, St. Louis and Atlanta combined, Brooklyn has been around
since the story started. It was, in fact, created by
suburbanization -- of the pre-automobile variety. (Contemporary
escapees from the suburbs to Brooklyn Heights should know that
Jackson's ``Crabgrass Frontier'' correctly identified this
neighborhood -- my own -- as the first true commuter suburb in the
world, dating from the opening of Fulton's ferry to New York in
1814.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BROOKLYN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: 1814.)) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet after King's County's 81 square miles were all built on,
low-rise Brooklyn found itself densely settled enough to be a city.
By comparison with later suburbs, its transportation links --
wharfs, streets and rails -- took up little of its space. Its
factories, though collectively strong enough to have made Brooklyn
one of the most productive cities in the world until the 1940's,
were individually not so big. The lots Brooklynites built on were
relatively small, and public land was sparse, even by comparison
with Manhattan. The tree that grew in Brooklyn grew on a street (in
the Williamsburg neighborhood), and even today the best way to
survey the public spaces of Brooklyn is from the seat of a bicycle.
Pictures of greensward in this book emphasize how precious parkland
still is, and make Bay Ridge, Cypress Hills, Brooklyn Heights,
Flatbush, Fort Greene, Park Slope, Prospect Heights,
Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Prospect Park South and Windsor Terrace
look embarrassingly rich. There are, of course, beaches, which is
why the former summer colonies of Bath Beach, Bergen Beach,
Brighton Beach, Coney Island, Gerritsen Beach, Manhattan Beach,
Mill Basin, Sea Gate and Sheepshead Bay lose playgrounds in the
winter. Perhaps the only true tycoons are Dyker Heights and Marine
Park, with beaches on one end and parks on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the principal public spaces in this city of former
suburbs are not parks but streets, and the streets show every kind
of variety. Their complicated history has given these neighborhoods
the kind of public civility and cooperation among strangers that
makes cities livable and discourages citizens from moving out.
Brooklyn is so determinedly provincial, so conspicuously lacking in
resident celebrities (even Richard Wright and Spike Lee eventually
left Fort Greene), and so peaceful in recent years, that outsiders
don't take much account of its astonishing mix of peoples; but that
mix is still world-class. With the exception of Sea Gate (one of
the nation's earliest gated communities), the Brooklyn
neighborhoods constitute the most wide-open multiethnic settlements
anywhere. Whatever it is that makes up the state of mind of a
Sunset Park or a Boerum Hill, it has repeatedly shown itself
capable of trumping other loyalties, including creed, color and
even class. Crown Heights was settled in the 1600's, like South
Africa, by Dutch farmers and their African slaves. It blossomed in
the 19th century with freedmen's villages, and a suburb that mixed
otherwise feuding European-Americans from England, Ireland,
Germany, Italy and Scandinavia. Now its majority is about evenly
divided between English-speaking, Spanish-speaking and
French-speaking Caribbean-Americans on the one hand and Lubavitcher
Hasidim on the other. The two subcultures are now slowly backing
off from a 1991 confrontation that made headlines, and cooperating
in a community-service group called Project CURE!, trying to turn
the recently hostile residents back into citizens.
</P>
<P>
   So it is only right that the neighborhood should be the
organizing principle for this book. The alphabet might serve for
Jackson's New York encyclopedia, but for Brooklyn only the
neighborhood idea can bring myriad details together.
</P>
<P>
   The details are mostly accurate, but one shouldn't demand the
same sort of precision as one might from the Encyclopedia
Britannica. Local history drips with little myths and although
Jackson, the consulting editor, John B. Manbeck, and other members
of the team are conscientious about dismissing them, a few creep
in. For example, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show played in Ambrose
Park (now Bush Terminal in Sunset Park) in June 1894, not 1892, and
St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights ceased being a church school
more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Thomas Wolfe, who never again lived in
Carolina, did indeed write ``You Can't Go Home Again'' in Brooklyn
Heights and ``Only the Dead Know Brooklyn'' in Cobble Hill. Now,
thanks to Kenneth Jackson, you can find out where those places are
even if you are still alive.

 &UR; GOATS' TOWN
</P>

</P>
<P>
   One of the first things you learn on picking up ``Gotham'' -- in
itself no easy task, this super-thick book being heavy enough to
cause back spasms -- is that Gotham is Anglo-Saxon for ``Goats'
Town.'' Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   There actually is an English village called Gotham, not far from
Sherwood Forest. Legend has it that old Gotham was filled with
blockheads, like the farmer who rode to market on horseback
carrying a bushel of wheat on his shoulders in order not to burden
the poor animal. Washington Irving slapped the nickname on
Manhattan in the early 19th century (and it may be the only
Anglo-Saxonism not routinely heard today on the sidewalks of New
York).
</P>
<P>
   Why would New Yorkers have ever agreed to a moniker of such
unfortunate origin? Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, history
professors at the City University of New York, suggest it may be
because legendary Gotham played the fool to mask real wisdom.
Doltishness was a subterfuge to throw enemy outsiders off balance.
In other words, if you accept this theory, Gothamites were con
artists at heart. What better role models for a city that has
rarely objected with vehemence to a little artful flimflam?
</P>
<P>
   Burrows and Wallace should be congratulated for, among other
things, exquisite timing. This year marks the 100th anniversary of
New York's consolidation into a megacity of five boroughs,
including formerly independent Brooklyn. There has been no shortage
of retrospectives on the way things were over the last century.
Here is a book to bring us up to speed on what took place in
Manhattan before 1898, as far back as the ice age, when ``packs of
glaciers crept down from Labrador.'' That tidbit falls under the
sly heading of ``immigrant ice.'' In New York, everyone and
everything come from somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotham'' often has fun like that. But no book this
encyclopedic can be expected to read like a romp. This is a serious
reference work. So many facts are crammed into every square inch
that trying to absorb them all will guarantee a headache bigger
than the one the city already has over Yankee Stadium's future.
Stray details are sure to stick, though, not necessarily in any
order of importance or chronology.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that New York's first hotel opened in 1794, called
simply the City Hotel, on Broadway just north of Trinity Church? Or
that the supposed $24 purchase of Manhattan by Dutch traders was
worth the equivalent of $669.42 (and even at that bargain price,
the Dutch may have been fleeced)? Or that the fabulously wealthy
John Jacob Astor made part of his fortune smuggling opium as
``America's first large-scale drug dealer''? Or that the brownstone
for the rows of houses that give New York streets their distinctive
look came from Paterson, N.J., and Portland, Conn.?
</P>
<P>
   Oddments like those add spice to a book focused more on the
powerful forces that shaped both city and country. After quickly
dispensing with the ice age and the rest of prehistory, it marches
relentlessly across the nearly three centuries from the Dutch
landing to the emergence of the unified boroughs. The countless
topics include, to list but a few, New York's wars with the Indians
and its pro-Crown leanings, its financial support for the slave
trade and its bloody draft riots during the Civil War, the
commercial imperatives and the waves of immigration that constantly
redefined it.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, the authors take a break from big-picture themes
to provide insights into day-to-day life. They glide easily around
town, peeking inside brothels for working men in Five Points, then
pressing noses to the gilt-edged windows of the uptown rich. Even a
self-impressed modern like Donald Trump might find it hard to top
this for extravagance: ``James Fenimore Cooper, writing to his wife
in the winter of 1850, described a party where one woman wore 'a
dress that cost, including jewels, $30,000' -- a fantastic sum at a
time when skilled mechanics and craftsmen took home between $1.25
and $2 a day in wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster revelations of the you-read-it-here-first variety do
not make themselves obvious in ``Gotham.'' But important themes
emerge, not the least of which is Manhattan's dominance as a
mercantile center from the moment the Dutch plopped themselves down
there in the early 1600's. Not much has changed on that score, or
others. In so many ways, New York's evolution proves the ultimate
wisdom of the great 20th-century philosopher Yogi Berra. Life in
the big city is often deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Think of some of today's major issues:
</P>
<P>
   Vast gaps between rich and poor? At the start of George
Washington's Presidency in 1789, the richest 20 percent of the
city's population owned 75 percent of the wealth. The poorest 20
percent held a scant 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crime? ``As early as 1749,'' the authors say, ``one local paper
reported that it had 'become dangerous for the good People of this
City to be out late at Nights, without being sufficiently strong or
well armed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tight housing? Around 1700, a harried colonial official
complained that ``houses are so scarce and dear, and lodgings worst
in this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost of living? By 1720, ``the diversity of imported goods in
New York was matched by their costliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipal egoism? An 1837 guidebook mocked New Yorkers' tendency
to see everything they did as the biggest and the best.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the rest of the country? '' 'New York is
notoriously the largest and least loved of any of our great
cities,' wrote Harper's Monthly in 1856.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the quality-of-life campaign championed by Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani echoes attempts by Peter Stuyvesant, New Amsterdam's
Governor in the mid-17th century, to browbeat the citizenry into
orderliness. Giuliani may wish to note what can happen to scolds if
they are not careful: ``The more Stuyvesant insisted on his
authority, the more he was resented -- above all among the colony's
burgeoning merchant elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are being ironic or sober, Burrows and Wallace
offer a large-canvas portrait of a city they clearly love. One
compelling reason seems to be New York's ability to recover from
adversity. Its determination was powerfully shown when lower
Manhattan was wiped out in December 1835 by a fire that raged for
two weeks in subzero temperatures. While only two people died, 674
buildings were destroyed in a ``13-acre ocean of burning
waves.''Yet within a year, 500 new buildings were constructed and
the area was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Then or now, you see, New York is the city that never weeps. It
simply does not give up.

</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The title of Annabel Thomas' first novel echoes the narrative's
tone and rhythm -- flat-footed, stark, terse -- and also serves as
a warning. Readers who balk at destruction, mutilation and death
should exercise caution before proceeding. By the time it ends,
``Blood Feud'' is littered with more corpses than ``Titus
Andronicus.''
</P>
<P>
   We hear this grim tale from a winsome, tough-and-tender
13-year-old girl. The scion of one of two feuding families in the
Yamoden Valley of southeastern Ohio, Winnie Clemmer wants to tell
not only the story of the feud -- its origins and culmination --
but the story of her love for Dave Kilkinney, a 15-year-old member
of the other family. ``Here we hang,'' she says, ``like bugs in
amber. Scarcely one among us has a notion how to look back nor an
idea how to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   As it unfolds, ``Blood Feud'' offers the expected ingredients of
a story set in Appalachia during the late 1930's: a coal miners'
strike, a tragic and fatal accident at the mine, incendiary family
rivalries. The challenge that Thomas (the author of two collections
of short stories) sets herself in this novel is to make the
expected surprising, to make the familiar -- or, at any rate, the
cliched -- seem unusual. Does she succeed? Only intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Blood Feud'' include the ``good'' patriarch,
John Kilkinney, a font of apparently endless wisdom; the ``evil''
patriarch, Cap Clemmer, father of Winnie; Licorice Mary, Dave's mad
mother, who roams the woods; Winnie's cigar-smoking Aunt Charlotte;
Fergus Kilkinney, the bad seed; and Joella Kilkinney, a whore with
a heart of, if not gold, at least stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and villains. It's clear from the outset which is which,
and no one changes his or her stripes as the novel progresses. What
saves these characters from continually falling into stereotype is
their voices. Despite a few too many ``jest's'' and ``yore's,'' the
regional dialect is handled adroitly, allowing its speakers to
reveal themselves as passionate and persuasive individuals. Winnie
herself employs a powerful version of mountain speech with many a
simile, some arresting (``mad as a meat ax,'' ``moody as a miser'')
and some less so (``wet as a muskrat,'' ``sour as persimmons'').
After the first dozen or so, such comparisons begin to wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   IF the characters in ``Blood Feud'' are a bit short on
contradiction and ambiguity, the narrative itself is short on the
texture of life -- the details that would let us feel these
people's experiences. It's as if Thomas were trying to keep her
terrifically strong material from running away with the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Characters who are rigidly defined and unchanging keep human
nature within bounds; a setting sparely described helps keep Nature
under control. Instead of letting both kinds of unruliness
intensify and deepen the novel, Thomas places the story firmly in
the fist of a narrator who points out the significance of every
scene, often before we've had a chance to witness it for ourselves.
Young Winnie is always on top of events, even though they are not
recollected in tranquillity but presented as if happening right as
she speaks. The result -- with the happy exception of first love, a
theme she treats beautifully -- is a loss of mystery, a feeling
that there is nothing here for us to discover.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because by the end of ``Blood Feud'' we've
come to like this intrepid, vulnerable, too-wise-for-her-years
narrator. Few could fail to be moved by the intensity of Winnie's
desire (some would say it's the deepest desire of the human heart)
to be listened to, to be heard and truly understood. If only her
creator had trusted our reciprocal desire to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   When they aren't constrained by an imposed interpretation or
moral, Thomas's eye and ear can yield graceful and rewarding prose:
``Outside was bright moonlight. The evening was so still we could
hear a cowbell down by the mine. The ground felt hard under our
feet and frost sparkled in the fields, but no snow had fallen. The
hills laid long moon shadows on us as we went up the road.''
</P>
<P>
   As intensely as the young lovers of ``Blood Feud'' long to be
with each other, so the reader will long to be left alone,
unsupervised, with passages like that -- a whole novelful of them.
Maybe next time?

 BARBARA JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Hero.

 &UR; THE HEART OF TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   BY PHIL GAILEY
</P>
<P>
   (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Jordan came into this world black -- too black, she
learned soon enough. ``Why is she so dark?'' Ben Jordan asked
immediately after his daughter was born on Feb. 21, 1936, in
Houston. Her blackness meant that Barbara Jordan had to overcome
two racial barriers in her life -- one erected by white racism, the
other by black culture. In her early years, she was more conscious
of the latter than the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black was not beautiful,'' Mary Beth Rogers writes in
``Barbara Jordan: American Hero.'' ``It was a burden. For a
girl-child, the degree of melanin pigmentation in her skin and the
turn of her features mattered. The shape of her nose or the texture
of her hair determined acceptance, opportunity and status. Ben
Jordan knew all of that, and he knew he would have to demand much
more of his new baby girl to compensate for her blackness. Mind,
will, discipline, work, achievement -- those attributes would be
the hope, and the challenge, for this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan met that challenge. She could not change her skin color,
but she was able to use her remarkable mind and her riveting voice
to overcome. And what a voice it was -- clear, resonant, musical,
soaring, inspirational. Its authority and eloquence could be both
uplifting and overpowering, as when she spoke during the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings against President
Richard M. Nixon. ``My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is
complete, it is total,'' she told her spellbound colleagues and a
national television audience. ``I am not going to sit here and be
an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the
destruction of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, on a hot July day in 1974, Jordan, a Democratic
Congresswoman from Texas, became an American hero and patriot.
Before that turning point, she was known as an ambitious politician
who often seemed more comfortable as a political insider than as an
activist for any cause. Idealism had its place, but Jordan was
interested in results. In the deal-making corridors of power in
Austin and Washington, Jordan's pragmatism and willingness to
compromise got results, though she was often criticized by white
liberals, black caucuses and feminists for settling for too little.
She made it clear to the white men who ruled the Texas Legislature
and the United States Congress that she would never betray ``her
people'' but that everything else was on the table. She played a
key role in the battle to extend the Voting Rights Act, but she
also was a reliable vote for her state's oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   If her personal struggle to rise above racism and her
legislative record were the sum of Jordan's life, her story would
be impressive but not extraordinary. She would be remembered
primarily for her ``firsts'' -- the first African-American to serve
in the Texas Senate since Reconstruction, the first black woman
ever elected to Congress from the South and the first black to be a
keynote speaker at a national political convention (the 1976
Democratic National Convention). But Jordan was much more than a
series of firsts. At a time when African-Americans had to look to
the entertainment world and the civil rights movement for heroes,
she became the first black elected official to attain that status.
She became a national hero who transcended race and touched a
nation's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Barbara Jordan it came together during the impeachment
proceedings,'' Rogers writes. ``As she talked about the
Constitution, she began her transformation from a politician to a
patriot, from an inside player who could get a law passed to an
inspirational leader. . . . Now she had a message that matched her
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who is the chief executive officer of public television
station KLRU in Austin, came to know Jordan when their paths
crossed in Texas politics and later at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, where both taught.
Despite her public life, Jordan was a stoic, intensely private
person. Even many of her close friends were not fully aware of her
20-year struggle against debilitating illnesses, including multiple
sclerosis and leukemia, which took her life at the age of 59 in
1996. In her autobiography, ``Self-Portrait,'' Jordan chose to
ignore or gloss over some of the facts. Fortunately, Rogers has
filled in many of the blanks, and between Jordan's autobiography
and this splendid biography, history has an ample and inspiring
account of Barbara Jordan's remarkable life.

 SINGING LESSONS

<P>
   A Memoir of Love, Loss,
</P>
<P>
   Hope, and Healing.
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 A.M. on April 19, 1978, Judy Collins writes, she had her
``last drink -- by the grace of God -- eight ounces of vodka out of
a jelly jar, in a stall in the ladies' room at the airport in
Reading, Pennsylvania.'' In ``Singing Lessons,'' Collins discusses
the personal turmoil that played counterpoint to the songs that
brought her fame. Provoked by her struggle to come to terms with
the suicide of her son, Clark, in 1992, this often moving but
unevenly written memoir is as contradictory as the life it
chronicles. Wonderfully lyrical language too often is juxtaposed
with cliches and psychobabble. Collins, now 57 years old, is at her
best describing growing up in a household in which ``glorious
music'' was underscored by darker themes. The eldest of five
children, she idolized her father, Charlie Collins, one of the
pioneers during the early years of radio. Blind since the age of 4,
he began every day by singing in the shower before inserting his
specially ordered blue glass eyes. Along with confidence, social
conscience and musical talent, Collins inherited from her father
the family ``failing.'' The man who ``celebrated each new day,
singing at the breakfast table'' could also be ``drunk, morose . .
. unpredictable . . . angry, terrifying.'' ``Music,'' she writes,
``gave me shelter from the pain of thinking'' that her father's
alcoholism ``was my fault.'' Almost seven years after her son's
death, Collins credits singing, a healthy life and an idyllic
second marriage with helping her battle grief and ``the black dog
of depression,'' a beast that has stalked her since childhood. ``I
see my son everywhere, in the glint of the diamonds on the snow,
the songs of birds,'' she writes. ``You are the music of the
spheres now,'' she writes to Clark, ``in your death, even more
vibrant.'' _ LESLIE CHESS FELLER

   &UR; HITLER AND GELI
</P>
<P>
   By Ronald Hayman.

<P>
   Bloomsbury/St. Martin's, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Geli Raubal was Hitler's niece, the daughter of his half sister,
Angela. For two years, beginning in November 1929, she and her
uncle lived together in Munich, and though the precise nature of
their relationship is unclear, Hitler declared repeatedly that she
was the only woman he ever loved. In September 1931 she was found
dead in their apartment. The police reported a suicide, but
questions have surrounded her life and death ever since. In
``Hitler and Geli,'' Ronald Hayman, the author of biographies of
Nietzsche, Kafka and the Marquis de Sade, has collected every bit
of information he can find about the couple. Some of it is
fascinating, some of it is merely prurient and some of it is
fascinatingly prurient (one chapter is entitled ``Things He Makes
Me Do''). Unfortunately, there is not very much of it, so Hayman is
forced to fill out his pages with a banal recitation of Hitler's
rise to power and wobbly speculations based on rumor and hearsay.
The book is crammed with probablys, seems-to-haves and
it-is-unlikelys. Hayman devotes four chapters to the circumstances
of Geli's death, examining everything from the angle of the bullet
wound to Hitler's whereabouts at the time. It is clear that he
would like to say that Hitler pulled the trigger, yet all of his
labors on this point are not only inconclusive but also
anticlimactic and redundant. For even if the evidence were more
substantial than it is, the worst that Hayman would be able to show
is that -- surprise! -- Hitler was a murderer. _ BARRY GEWEN

</P>
<P>
   In 1978, a year after winning the Nobel Prize, Rosalyn Sussman
Yalow was called ``a Madame Curie from the Bronx.'' Only the second
woman ever to win the prize for medicine, she identified closely
with Curie, the ideal scientist, wife and mother, three roles in
which she also sought to excel. In this biographical memoir, Eugene
Straus, a longtime friend and colleague, pays tribute to an
extraordinary woman. Yalow emerges from these pages as brilliant,
ambitious and driven in her professional life, rigid, humorless and
cold-blooded on a personal level. According to her biographer,
Yalow believes that women scientists should marry, rear children,
cook and clean in order to be fulfilled; while pursuing her career,
she had a son and daughter. Outside her family, though, Yalow could
appear unfeeling; when Solomon Berson, the dazzling colleague with
whom she shared dozens of important discoveries and prizes, died
suddenly in 1972, her public display of grief surprised several
onlookers. Five years later, she achieved the Nobel -- to universal
acclaim if not universal affection. _ LYNN KARPEN

   &UR; ONE RIVER MORE
</P>
<P>
   By W. D. Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   W. D. Wetherell wants us to think that he is writing about
fishing, but clearly that is just an excuse for this series of
thoughtful, evocative meditations on the environment, culture,
relationships and, incidentally, fly fishing. In ``One River
More,'' his third and, he says, last book on the subject, Wetherell
takes us through three seasons and 15 years of fishing in the upper
Connecticut River region and Montana. He writes entertainingly of
family trips and stratagems to slip in fishing while spending time
with his children. He muses on the benefits and drawbacks of clubs
(``private water'') and speaks lovingly of the Rangeley Lakes of
western Maine. He sometimes skirts perilously close to
curmudgeonhood as he decries changes in a sport ``that requires
thinking and creativity in a culture that often punishes both.''
But frequently he is right on the mark. ``American consumerism at
full throttle is not a pretty sight,'' he grumbles. And he is
exceedingly grumpy about the new breed of fisher-folk, ``their
competitive fires fully stoked,'' who bring their ``new
sullenness'' and cellular phones to a ``quiet and simple pursuit.''
The most important factor in fly fishing, he says, is ``not casting
ability . . . but coming to appreciate and understand something of
the landscape, terrain, history and culture of the region through
which your river flows.'' Respect for such ``interconnectedness''
is all-important because ``the brutal fact is that our future
depends on our culture's attitude toward the natural world.'' _

   &UR; TIBET: Through the Red Box
</P>
<P>
   By Peter Sis

   Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man returns to his childhood home in Prague after many years
and nervously climbs the stairs to his father's empty study. On the
desk he finds a mysterious red-lacquered box, which was off limits
to him as a child. He unlocks it with a rusted key, and finds
inside ``pages and pages of fragile paper covered with faded
handwriting and fine drawings and maps blending into the text, all
of it barely holding together, like brittle autumn leaves.'' It's a
diary kept by his father when he was lost in Tibet in the 1950's --
and ground zero for all the magical stories that later captivated
his son. That is the swift and surefooted set-up for the enchanting
TIBET: Through the Red Box (Frances Foster/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$25) by Peter Sis, best known as a writer and illustrator of
children's books. His father, a documentary filmmaker drafted by
the Czechoslovak Army and sent to China to teach and make movies,
was stranded in Tibet during the construction of a highway across
the Himalayas. His diary, embellished with factual notes in the
margins, is interwined with Sis' own recollections of his father's
encounters with nomads, yetis, lamas who fly like kites -- and with
a magical blue lake where the fish have human faces. His wanderings
culminate in a visit to the Forbidden City of Lhasa, where he tries
to warn the Dalai Lama of the threat posed by the coming highway:
``It might well bring hospitals, electricity and technology, but
little roads will then go to the lake, to the Valley of the Yetis,
to the caves and monasteries. What will it take away? It might take
more than it brings.'' All this is accompanied by exquisite
illustrations of his father's adventures, finely detailed mandalas
and dreamlike images that provide a rich counterpoint to the
simple, direct text. Younger readers will be transported by the
folk tales and the artwork, but this is more than a ripping yarn:
with its mystical underpinnings and the muted sadness that washes
over the whole enterprise, it is a personal account of a son still
struggling to understand the absence of his father, and poetic
testimony to the power of the imagination to transfigure reality. _

 THE DARK ROOM
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Julia Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The initial mystery of why an author of self-help guides for
perplexed writers would chose a detective story for her fictional
debut is solved about a hundred pages into ``The Dark Room,'' a
wildly incredible tale of cops and psycho killers. There Julia
Cameron has her protagonist, the aging but honorable Elliot Mayo,
interrupt his pursuit of a murderer to deliver a lecture about
encountering a Darth Vaderish archetype, devised by the Swiss
psychiatrist Carl Jung, that is supposed to stand for our darkest
desire. And suddenly what had been the increasingly preposterous
mean-streets narrative of a wisecracking, conveniently divorced
police detective being romanced by a kooky female surgeon is
revealed as just an artist-as-hero slog, certain to delight fans of
Jung's arcanely mystical notions but just as certain to leave
conventional whoduniteers stranded. So that quirky Jewish medical
examiner who warns Mayo to bathe in Epsom salts to keep the
Satanists away is not merely a delightful eccentric inhabiting a
dreary Chicago neighborhood -- he's a blazing beacon of Jungian
obscurantism who doesn't make the pages turn any faster. Too bad,
since Cameron's tough-guy prose often sparkles with wry turns and
snappy comebacks. Cameron's wit might have excused her symbolist
excesses if she had simply let her detective detect. Instead, Mayo
is pulled about by a plot that forces him to explore the
all-too-horrifying effects of a sex crime involving his son and
battle evil forces inhabiting a ``power ring.'' These gimmicks --
not to mention the overheated taunts of Mayo's love interest and a
twisted killer bent on doing good -- might make sense in terms of
Jungian symbolism but as plot devices they remain beyond Mayo's
belief, as well as our own. _ BILL KENT

</P>
<P>
   Red Greet is a strange and wonderful old man. When we meet him,
at the age of 87, he's behind bars and dancing with his jailer, the
son of an old friend. And he's talking. This unusual introduction
pulls up the curtain on an account of Greet's life and leads into a
stream of stories as he takes us on a tour of his memory's
touchstones. An inveterate but strangely honest thief, Greet has
what he himself describes as a ``soul of hard-packed dung'' -- not
exactly pure, but incredibly fertile in raw human emotion. As the
book proceeds, Greet tells of his lifelong love for Recita Holguin
-- a woman he finally marries when they are both in their 80s --
and of his first wife, Cecilia, who dies in middle age, partly
unloved because of Greet's inconstancy. He tells, too, of the
friendships he has made in the New Mexico village of Las Almas,
especially with his ``dearest friend,'' Francisco Velasco, who
becomes a priest when Greet wins over his true love -- Cecilia --
and who eventually rises to become the local bishop. Greet also
tells a fractured tale of religious turmoil, of the molding of
Roman Catholic ritual to everyday reality, symbolized by the
novel's title. (Hyssop is the soul-healing balm that comes of
confession and the sharing of secrets.) Greet is a jackdaw of
memory, collecting shiny, often unrelated bits of the past and
presenting them with effusive joy. _ ERIK BURNS

   &UR; EXCITABILITY
</P>
<P>
   Selected Stories, 1986-1996
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Dalkey Archive, paper, $13.50. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Diane Williams has gathered 107 stories and a 44-part novella in
her latest collection, which takes its title from a story about
romance and nostalgia that appeared in her 1996 volume, ``The
Stupefaction.'' Although the story itself hasn't been included
here, ``excitability'' is an apt precis of this new book's
lightning-quick, innovative style. Williams defies narrative
convention with her disembodied, unnamed characters, whose concerns
include sex, marriage and child rearing and whose predicaments have
no beginning, middle or end. Frequently told in the first person,
her work elicits a reader's voyeuristic complicity and wish to
understand -- if not identify with -- the speaker's state of mind.
At their best, Williams's stories achieve a high degree of lyric
intensity and suggestiveness. But while the brevity and esthetic
discernment of individual stories may be thought-provoking, a
succession of them can seem tiresome, even insubstantial. _ GARDNER

   &UR; THE CLEFT: And Other Odd Tales
</P>
<P>
   By Gahan Wilson
</P>
<P>
   Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gahan Wilson turns his pictures into thousands of words in this
collection of meticulously eccentric stories. But the illustrations
are definitely the icing on this devil's food cake of a book. The
best story is the tenderly heartbreaking ``Frog Prince,'' about a
poor little creature with a recurring dream about a kingly father
and a spell that until broken holds him fast in the loneliness of
his watery world: ``Frog watched from his lily pad, confident that
the magic would work on its own, that his salvation was
approaching.'' Salvation, alas, is not an option for most of
Wilson's characters. Spiders devour the curious, sea gulls wreak
vengeance on the guilty, cats claw their owners to death -- and
what people do to people is even worse. The title story, about
monks decorating the precipitous route to their mountainside
shrine, is a brisk lesson in human folly. In ``The Power of the
Mandarin,'' a fictional character undoes a real-life foe, thinking:
``The idiot had discovered Evan Trowbridge's strength, which was
implacable hatred, but he had shared, and therefore missed
altogether, his weakness, which was a lack of sufficient
imagination.'' Happily, this is a weakness that Wilson doesn't
share. _ ANDREA HIGBIE

   &UR; WIVES OF THE FISHERMEN
</P>
<P>
   By Angela Huth.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In her latest novel, Angela Huth (the author of ``Land Girls'')
tells of the lifelong, heartfelt friendship -- laced nonetheless
with rivalry, jealousy and disapproval -- between two women who
live in a tiny, secluded fishing village on the east coast of
Scotland. Myrtle Duns is the plain but intelligent friend of Annie
Mcleoud, a beautiful, frivolous, self-centered charmer. With these
characters, Huth drops curtsies to George Eliot and, in particular,
Jane Austen: Myrtle is deliciously slow to recognize that a man she
sees only as a friend is, in fact, her future husband. (We, of
course, have twigged to this long before she has.) But while Huth
enables readers to be perceptive when it comes to the undercurrents
of her story, she muddles us in other ways. Myrtle and Annie have
televisions and microwaves, yet often Huth's characters express
themselves with 19th-century circumspection. (A marriage proposal
is delivered with sober formality: ``You must know that I would be
far from averse . . . to changing the solitary nature of my
life.'') Luckily, this winds up being charming rather than
disturbing because it puts us into a timeless realm. And the novel
offers the additional pleasure of Huth's precise and piquant
descriptions: the ``velutinous black'' on the horizon where the sea
merges with the sky; the ``plushy warm air of a late summer
evening.'' ``I'm one of those who finds more than enough in a small
world,'' Myrtle concludes. Huth makes us share that sentiment. _

   &UR; LET NOTHING YOU DISMAY
</P>
<P>
   By Mark O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $22. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   'Twas the day before the night before the night before the night
before the night before Christmas -- or something like that. Fired
from his job, unsure about his sexuality, about to lose his sublet
apartment and suspecting that his doctoral dissertation will never
get written, Tad Leary is remarkably unprepared for revelry of any
kind. But since he's unprepared for anything else either, he
decides to take in a whole succession of holiday parties. In his
frothy second novel, Mark O'Donnell follows Tad through Manhattan
on an expedition to various circles of social hell. He begins with
a strained family gathering on the East Side. (Tad's father is
recovering from a heart attack and one of his brothers from a
bankruptcy-induced suicide attempt; his mother makes tactless
remarks designed to find out if Tad has AIDS.) From there, he flees
to an artistically unsatisfying session of performance art in the
East Village, repairs to the home of a Swedish friend where
everyone speaks in exclamatory sentences (``I see you're in your
trademark jeans and white shirt!'') and briefly crashes the holiday
party of the school that fired him before ending up at a
titanically superficial gala in a garish penthouse on Fifth Avenue.
What can Tad expect (besides a monumental hangover) from this
pilgrimage? Maybe just a bit of peace in the tiny corner of the
world he calls his own. _ JAMES POLK

CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  By Marilyn Stasio 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Adams is not a flashy writer; but in his quiet way, he
applies his spare, unruffled style to the creation of a modest
kingdom of the imagination where the landscape has a comforting
familiarity, where values seem certain and where characters come
and go with the confident step of people who know they belong here.
In NO BADGE, NO GUN (Walker, $22.95), as in earlier books in this
offbeat series, the stranger in this land is Carl Wilcox, an
itinerant sign painter and sometime sleuth who wanders across South
Dakota during the Great Depression, settling in a town just long
enough to get the lay of the land, spruce up the drugstore or dance
hall and maybe solve a murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like getting to know a place in a day or two,'' Carl says.
``Who runs it, why, all that. It's easy to get acquainted.'' Here,
Carl's traveling feet take him to Jonesville, where a stern pastor
hires him to solve the murder of his 15-year-old niece, who was
raped and strangled in the church basement. Carl pursues this one
to the bitter end; but being a keen student of human nature, he
also picks up on the local prejudices about sex and strangers,
adding to his already considerable store of knowledge about life in
rural America during a period when irresistible social changes were
beginning to sweep across the prairie.
</P>

   Edith Skom evokes ``the indefinable essence of dormitory'' to
transport us to a women's residence hall at the University of
Chicago in the late 1940's for her academic mystery THE CHARLES
DICKENS MURDERS (Delacorte, $21.95). Wafted on eau de tuna
casserole, Tabu and the hormonal heat of virginal intellectuals,
this smartly plotted whodunit progresses from incidents of petty
theft and boyfriend poaching to a murder that destroys the girlish
loyalties of a group of friends. ``The whole dorm looks at each
other now,'' one says, ``sort of suspicious, sort of scared.''
Years later, the survivors still wonder which one of them is a
murderer -- and if the killing is truly over.
</P>
<P>
   When Beth Austin, a professor of literature and the brainy star
of this series, learns of the unsolved crime from her mother, a
member of the dorm clique, she hunts down all the old girls and
puts them through some Dickensian analysis. This one reminds her of
Lady Dedlock; that one, of the cruel and conniving lawyer
Tulkinghorn; while the actual murder, ``like the case of Jarndyce
and Jarndyce'' in ``Bleak House,'' ``stretched back to the past and
blighted the present.'' Even when the Dickens connections become
forced or intrusive, Skom maintains the wit to deliver a lively and
affectionate picture of dorm life in an earlier but hardly innocent
generation.

   Lynda S. Robinson has an interesting theory about how Queen
Nefertiti died. (Hint: it was not of the plague that scourged Egypt
during the reign of her husband, the heretic King Ikhnaton.) Having
raised the tantalizing issue of regicide in ``Eater of Souls,''
Robinson now resolves it in DRINKER OF BLOOD (Mysterious Press/
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $22) through gorgeously textured vignettes that trace
the Queen's career from Pharaoh's 12-year-old child bride to ``the
focus of court intrigue'' as the true power behind the throne. Even
in fragments, the story has a dark, romantic power.
</P>
<P>
   But why the fragmentary treatment in the first place? Within the
broader scheme of this vividly dramatized series, Nefertiti's fate
is the obsessive concern of the fictional hero, Lord Meren, the
subtle spy master who serves as ``the Eyes and Ears of Pharaoh'' in
the court of Tutankhamen. Despite Meren's convincing argument that
the dead queen's enemies threaten his own monarch, the double
narrative is a double distraction. For all that, it's always a
pleasure to negotiate the treacherous corridors of power with Lord
Meren and his wily associates, eavesdropping on the priests in
Pharaoh's court, ducking the knife fights on the back streets of
Memphis -- and picking up beauty tips from Nefertiti.
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe that Russian spies, Mafia gangsters and rogue
C.I.A. agents are running amok in Vermont? I have trouble with that
one, too, and Archer Mayor is less than persuasive on the matter in
THE DISPOSABLE MAN (Mysterious Press/Warner, $22). Lieut. Joe
Gunther, the local lawman in this series, keeps his rock-jawed face
from cracking when a dead Russian mobster is found floating in a
soapstone quarry. ``I prided myself on keeping cool, keeping my
emotional cards out of sight, maintaining a professional stance,''
Gunther says. But after tearing around the state chasing renegade
spooks and landing himself in jail, the stoical hero finally blows
his composure. Despite a sensational mountaintop shootout that
clinches the action, this one is on hostile territory.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Patricia Carlon is back with another novel
of psychological suspense that confounds every neat notion about
what an intellectual thriller is supposed to be. CRIME OF SILENCE
(Soho, $21) opens as a conventional kidnapping case: Evan Kiley's
little boy has been snatched by the same villains who took George
Winton's little girl, but later returned her for a ransom and her
father's promise of silence. Appealing to Winton's guilty
conscience, Kiley enlists his aid in dealing with the kidnappers,
and on that level alone, the tension is terrific. But Carlon, an
Australian novelist whose work has just recently begun to surface
here, turns the formula inside out to raise the deeper issue of
what a man must do to pay off a moral debt. The game of nerves that
Kiley and Winton play is so manipulative that only one thing is
clear: this is a writer who is good enough to make up her own
rules.

   This collection by a versatile elegist and observer of nature

   Invited to India by her estranged hippie daughter, a demanding,
perfectionist mother embarks on a voyage of self-discovery that
takes her from New Delhi to the home of the exiled Dalai Lama, with
epiphanies and emotional awakenings along the way. ``Hadley is a
gifted travel writer with an artist's eye for the composition --
and the look, smell and history -- of every scene,'' Diane Johnson
wrote here last year. In India: From Midnight to the Millennium, by
Shashi Tharoor (Harper Perennial, $14), an expatriate takes a hard
look at his country's first 50 years of independence, and explains
why parliamentary democracy has done so little to relieve poverty,
illiteracy and disease. ``Few books in recent years, if any, offer
such a comprehensive overview of what ails India, its politicians
and its people,'' John F. Burns said here in 1997.

   The narrator of this tale of romance and fate is a Dubliner
whose search for one of his artist father's paintings leads him
into the arms of a young woman on the Irish coast. Last year our

</P>
<P>
   By Vivian Gornick.

   Beacon, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Examining the works of writers like Willa Cather and Grace
Paley, a critic argues that literature has lost its faith in the
transformative power of love. ``Gornick makes forceful and dramatic
judgments,'' Elizabeth Frank wrote here in 1997. ``Reading her
essays, one is reassured that the conversation between life and
literature is mutually sustaining as well as mutually corrective.''
The Merry Heart: Reflections on Reading, Writing, and the World of
Books, by Robertson Davies (Penguin, $14.95), is a posthumous
collection of lectures and essays by the Canadian novelist on the
literary life and matters of humane concern. Last year our
reviewer, Sven Birkerts, said that even though much of his public
prose is less successful on the written page, ``Davies was a
relaxed and winning raconteur, a beguiling autocrat of the
rostrum.''

   This novel, just restored to print, is about a black boy growing
up in Alabama in the 1920's and his idol, a blues guitarist named
Luzana Cholly. In 1974 in these pages, John Wideman admired the
``long passages of dialogue, monologue, the lyric descriptions of
countryside and fireside, which are nothing so much as the riffs
and choruses of a blues artist translated into speech and action.''

   A British historian tells how he found a blurred image of his
younger self in an old East German secret police file, and how he
tracked down the people who had informed on him. The result is ``a
political thriller, reminiscent of Graham Greene and John le Carre,
and a treatise on memory, forgetting and forgiving in the great
tradition of Proust,'' Tomas Venclova wrote here in 1997.

</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Duncker.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage International, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This intricate first novel focuses on a graduate student who
tracks down and falls in love with the subject of his dissertation,
a French novelist in an insane asylum. The result is ``a
fascinating drama of knowledge and power, reason and desire,''
Allen Lincoln said here last year.

   When a university dean is found dead in the Museum of Man, the
museum's courtly recording secretary turns sleuth. The result is a
``stylish, occasionally fiendish detective story . . . out to
skewer glitzy academic corruption,'' Nina Auerbach said here last
year.

</P>
<P>
   By George Plimpton.
</P>
<P>
   Anchor/Doubleday, $16.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This chronicle shows how the talented Capote turned fame into an
art form, and finally into a substitute for art itself. His lurid
story is told mostly through the firsthand accounts of fellow
celebrities. In 1997 our reviewer, Julia Reed, found the book to be
filled with old gossip, but said ``some of the best bits reveal
more about the speaker than about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PILGRIMS

<P>
   By Elizabeth Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Mifflin, $12. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pilgrims in this first short-story collection are
working-class folks searching for redemption but skeptical of
spiritual enlightenment. The author ``embraces the bizarre and
fabulous with similar enthusiasm,'' Liam Callanan wrote here in
1997. ``She moves stealthily, avoiding the temptation to
grandstand, moralize or, especially, patronize.''

AT LAST A NATIONAL SCOREBOARD OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CULLEN MURPHY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Secular soothsayers in recent years have deployed a variety of
well-known tools _ not just opinion polling but also various
economic auguries and social indicators _ to divine the public's
mood and perhaps even to illuminate what lies a few steps ahead.
Often, these tools are useful.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we could monitor, on a day-to-day basis, the
shifting prominence of specific words in the collective American
consciousness? Wouldn't such a Semantic Observation System (as we
might call it) yield important clues to the public mind?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that we have such clues at our fingertips, thanks
to the electronic version of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
Dictionary (www.m-w.com).
</P>
<P>
   The notion that words offer a key to social circumstances is a
hoary one. Scholars have spent a great deal of time trying to
infer, on the basis of vocabulary alone, the cultural and
environmental milieu of the first ``proto-Indo-European'' people _
that is, the people who spoke proto-Indo-European, the
reconstructed language that is presumed to be ancestral to most of
the languages spoken today in a vast swath from Europe to India.
</P>
<P>
   To give one example: The Indo-Europeans had no generalized word
for sea, prompting scholars to speculate that they were originally
a landlocked people.
</P>
<P>
   Linguistic work usually requires years of painstaking effort.
What the online Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary makes
possible is a form of instantaneous ``lexicographie verite.''
Individuals consult the online dictionary to look up more than 6
million words a month. (Merriam-Webster Online is probably the most
widely used English language online dictionary in the world, and
the service is available at no charge.) Merriam-Webster designed
the dictionary with a kind of see-through-mirror function:
Observers at the company can ``watch'' which words are being looked
up in real time; they do not, of course, know who is looking those
words up.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster also keeps cumulative track of the incoming
traffic, word by word, and company executives can review a Top 100
list at any moment. The number of daily hits required for a word to
reach the No. 1 spot varies according to day of week and time of
year; it has been known to exceed 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, words are flung onto that list by current events.
Paparazzi, princess, and cortege briefly surged as high as No. 17,
No. 36, and No. 60, respectively, in September 1997, in the
aftermath of the death of Princess Diana. Au pair reached No. 10
during the trial in the fall of 1997 of Louise Woodward, the young
British nanny who was accused of shaking to death a baby left in
her care. The recent 60 Minutes broadcast, which showed video
footage of Dr. Jack Kevorkian putting a patient to death, prompted
a short-lived upward blip of euthanasia to No. 102.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, during the first nine months of 1998, words
associated with President Bill Clinton's travails regularly made
their way onto the Top 100 list. Online-dictionary usage first
registered the Clinton scandals in mid-January, when people began
looking up the words suborn, perjury and proffer in unusually large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As winter gave way to spring, interest in these words was
replaced by interest in impeach, impeachment, and character. By
August, when Clinton submitted to a four-hour deposition with the
independent counsel and then made his semiconfessional speech to
the nation, the ascendant words included contrite, contrition and
mea culpa.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, on the weekend when Kenneth Starr made
public the full text of his report, the No. 1 word on the
Merriam-Webster list was salacious, with sordid at one point
cresting to the No. 34 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicographically, salacious represents the Clinton scandal's
point of furthest semantic advance. Impeachment attempted a
comeback, reaching its all-time high (No. 3) Oct. 8 but, for weeks
thereafter, no scandal-related terminology showed any sign of
significant strength or staying power on the Merriam-Webster site _
an obvious bellwether of the public's sudden loss of interest. (At
one point in November, integrity registered an anemic No. 98.)
</P>
<P>
   John M. Morse, president of Merriam-Webster and a professional
lexicographer who has studied the diurnal fluctuations closely,
observes, ``From approximately early October onward, Monica-related
words virtually ceased to appear on any day's Top 100 list. What
was evident from our site was that the public had tired of the
whole issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Words such as salacious and paparazzi, thrust briefly into
prominence, must be seen against a background of what constitutes
ordinary dictionary traffic, which for the most part is inertial
and humdrum _ the dictionary equivalent of junk DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving out sexually oriented and offensive words (which people
seem as prone to look up in online dictionaries as they do in print
ones; f**k is by far the most-looked-up word in the online
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary on any given day), what
follows is the cumulative Top 40 list for the first six months of
this year:
</P>
<P>
   1. paradigm; 2. love; 3. thesaurus; 4. ubiquitous; 5. HTML; 6.
effect; 7. gry; 8. affect; 9. home; 10. dog; 11. help; 12. time;
13. oxymoron; 14. Internet; 15. computer; 16. serendipity; 17. web;
18. etymology; 19. mail; 20. esoteric; 21. home page; 22.
genealogy; 23. pedantic; 24. ensure; 25. synergy; 26. hubris; 27.
hello; 28. marijuana; 29. metaphor; 30. resume; 31. dictionary; 32.
heuristic; 33. caveat; 34. eclectic; 35. information; 36. epiphany;
37. weight; 38. acquiesce; 39. pragmatic; 40. egregious.
</P>
<P>
   The Semantic Operating System remains in a relatively primitive
state of development, but clearly the future holds more, not less,
of this sort of thing. The statistical analysis of language was,
after all, a primal urge even before the days when electronic tools
made it easy, and some of the most compelling statistical data
emerged from the pre-microchip Age of the Linguist-Drudge.
(Examples would include the fact that 12 specific syllables account
for a quarter of all the English speech you hear, and the fact that
the 50 most frequently used words in English account for 45 percent
of the total volume of all words used.) So we can expect
refinements and advances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Merriam-Webster's tabulation of online consultations
will continue. Take note: In recent days, one word has been coming
on very strong _ censure, which, at this writing, holds the No. 5
position among the Merriam-Webster Top 100.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, the most revealing news offered by the
Merriam-Webster data has nothing to do with individual words or
current events. It is the fact that ordinary people are so eager to
take the trouble to look things up. America cherishes a myth of
itself as a land of practical folk who evince a zest for
self-improvement _ even as they pursue some sort of quest for
definition. Some 6 million times a month, the myth turns out to be
the truth.

RAGE OF THE ENTITLEMENT QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  By KATE AURTHUR 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was quoted in the Los Angeles Times
saying that she and her girlfriend, actress Anne Heche, had fired
their agents and publicists and were leaving Hollywood _ they were
sick of the homophobia they'd experienced since coming out as
lesbians last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that I ever feared happened to me,'' DeGeneres
said. ``I lost my show. I've been attacked like hell. I went from
making a lot of money on a sitcom to making no money.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the problem here?
</P>
<P>
   Heche got better reviews than the heterosexual Harrison Ford in
last spring's hapless comedy ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' and today
she reprises Janet Leigh's role in ``Psycho'' as the most notorious
murder victim in film history.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres has two movies coming out (one a Ron Howard comedy)
and is set to do a standup tour later this winter.
</P>
<P>
   I do feel sympathy for Ellen. To come out of the closet and
begin a new relationship under such intense public scrutiny is
unimaginable. I'm happy that my own period of playing the gay
megaphone, which took place on campus at age 19, wasn't staged for
Diane Sawyer, Oprah, and President Clinton. And you have to admit
that the professional pressure on DeGeneres was fierce, even if her
dilemma was notable mostly for its irony: Could an sitcom get
decent ratings if an out lesbian was played by out lesbian?
</P>
<P>
   But if DeGeneres feels that her subtleties as a performer are
being overshadowed by her status as a lesbian, she's the one who
set it up that way. She used her sexuality as a crutch throughout
the long feud with ABC that dominated the troubled last season of
her show. She should have copped to the fact that after a single
luminous, thought-provoking and joyful coming-out episode in the
spring of 1997, Ellen got lost in awkwardly orchestrated, unfunny
plot developments about parents and first girlfriends. Instead, she
called her network a bunch of homophobes.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think DeGeneres was funny, and I loved Anne Heche in
the little indie film ``Walking and Talking'' back when she was
just an alumna of the soap opera ``Another World.'' Now I think of
them as entitlement queens who whine while their careers steam
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them make out in front of President Clinton was hard to
take, but I'm sure he didn't mind. Watching Ellen screech,
``They're killing us!'' upon the death of gay student Matthew
Shepard turned my stomach. Faced with an actual tragedy, the least
she could have done is realize how fortunate she was.
</P>
<P>
   The day after DeGeneres made her announcement, Variety ran an
interview with the couple's publicist, who claimed that their
comments were taken out of context. (What context would that be?)
He added they should have been taken as ``wistful,'' rather than
literal.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the two actresses are really dropping out,
Variety writes, ``They don't have the agent, still have the
publicist and the house, and Heche was last seen driving through
Burbank.'' Whatever they wind up doing, I'm adopting a ``don't
ask/don't tell'' policy about it.

ARE TODAY'S KIDS HARDER TO HANDLE?
</HEADLINE>
  By KYLE D. PRUETT 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emily's long day was finally ending.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old had needed to stay late at school because her
father's train was delayed and he couldn't get to her preschool
until an hour and a half after the usual pickup time.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to wait for her father in the parking lot so she
could catch the first glimpse of his car rounding the corner. When
told that she would have to wait inside where it was safer, Emily
promptly sank her teeth into the teacher's forearm. Fortunately, no
permanent damage was done, but neither the child nor her teacher
could have been more surprised. Emily had always been a cooperative
and well-behaved kid from a ``nice home.''
</P>
<P>
   Such acts of aggression are occurring more frequently in
childcare settings. As a consultant to private and public daycare
and family-care providers for several decades, I have seen an
increase in this behavior in even the most advantaged and
competently run childcare facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lola Nash, lecturer in education at Yale University's Child
Study Center, who has established and directed early-childhood
programs in and around Yale for 30 years, observes: ``There's been
a dramatic increase in this kind of aggressive upset in childcare
over the past decade. All the programs I work with are struggling
to develop policies to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher in a private kindergarten in a Boston suburb says,
``Often, my classroom feels out of control. The speech is 'in your
face' and 'street talk,' even from kids who were raised in suburban
areas. Verbal aggression, teasing, and sarcasm are common, and most
of us can name children from good families who've decked or bitten
someone in the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing and mastering aggression is a normal and healthy part
of child development. Aggression is the drive to use our bodies, to
move about in space, to reach out and grab what we want. Aggression
gets us up on our feet and helps us learn to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Violence, on the other hand, is the intended use of physical
force to injure or abuse, and it is certainly not a normal, healthy
part of a child's development.
</P>
<P>
   We say no to babies, toddlers and preschoolers mostly to keep
them safe from the stairs, the street, the poisons under the
kitchen sink, the stranger and the unknown dog. But why should your
child listen to you? ``Because I'm the Dad (or Mom)'' carries
weight occasionally, but the real reason that no works is the child
believes this: Daddy and Mommy say no because they know what's best
for me; they love me and want to keep me safe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Too many caregivers? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Herein lies a dilemma for many young families who need to divide
the care of their children between people who love them deeply _
parents and other relatives _ and people who may like their
children well enough _ daycare staff and educators _ but are not
invested in them unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   The more caregivers a child has when he is learning how to
master his aggressive impulses and the greater the variability of
his experience with limit-setting adults, the harder he will find
it to develop the trust that prompts him to behave well for someone
whom he loves.
</P>
<P>
   Young children who are exposed to too much variety in caregiving
situations or to too many caregiver changes may begin to wonder,
``Why should I struggle to master my favorite aggressive impulses
for you? You may like me and know how to bathe and feed me, but you
don't really know me or love me, and I don't know or love you. So
is it really worth it for me to restrict my 'me first' impulses for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   From there, a preschooler can easily conclude: ``Well, then, I
guess it's every kid for himself around here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Media influence &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We know that young children are susceptible to visual images of
aggression, repeating and mirroring the violence they encounter in
movies, electronic games or cartoons for hours _ or days _
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As a clinician, I know there's a limit to the number of violent
images that children can absorb before feeling overwhelmed. Their
ability to neutralize the visual toxins emotionally is vastly more
limited than ours; can we be surprised when violence spills over in
their play for days afterward?
</P>
<P>
   Even more than movies, electronic and computer games excite our
young kids with irresistible graphics and attention-grabbing action
sequences. They keep attention levels so high that kids often have
difficulty returning to the more mundane pastels of life among
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The voice of authority &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A small crisis in parental self-esteem may also play a part in a
young child's ability to manage everyday aggression. Erin, the
young mother of a 4-year-old daughter, works 30 hours a week
outside the home. ``I do love my work,'' she says. ``But I so want
to be with my daughter that it's hard for me not to spend the first
hour when I get home making up to her for not being there during
the day. When she challenges my authority, all I want to do is make
nice because I've missed her so much! I'm not good at setting
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin's comments help explain why so many working parents place
their children in the driver's seat long before they can see over
the dashboard, then wonder why household routines last only a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This parental expectation that children be catered to also
influences their childcare and schooling. Karen, the suburban
Boston kindergarten teacher mentioned earlier, struggles with the
growing number of well-intentioned parents who urge teachers not to
quash their children's ``spirit.'' While a rigid classroom can
certainly stifle expressiveness, the educator's concern centers on
the difficulty some of these ``overappreciated'' children have in
sharing classroom supplies and equipment
</P>
<P>
   Are there any solutions? Yes. Here are several strategies to
consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit the number of caregivers your young child must deal
with. A few family members and a couple of daycare or school
professionals handling physical and emotional needs is about it for
kids under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay in close touch with your childcare providers about how
your child is doing, emotionally as well as physically. If you
don't get clear descriptions or stories that match your own
experience, the staff may be too busy with other kids. Ask the
director to keep an eye on things and to get back to you. When you
collaborate closely with the important people in your child's life,
both you and he are reassured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep tabs on what your child is watching and playing. Then
observe her moods. It will be clear to you if your child is
suffering from a toxic accumulation of internal aggression. Don't
worry about being the only parent on earth who won't allow his or
her child to watch the newest multimedia dismemberment spectacle.
Check out the thoughtful, age-appropriate movie and television
guides for kids available at local public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review the routines that your family follows. What you haven't
any? That might explain why you feel so exhausted. The chaos that
tends to take over when you don't have at least some routines in
place keeps the stimulation and tension levels in you and your kids
fairly high because you can never leave the negotiating table and
get on with life. Kids often embrace routines with enthusiasm; they
offer a sense of order and control, which raises children's
aggression threshold.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you say no to a child, let him know you understand how
much he wants what you've ruled out. Accepting the emotional part
of your child's aggressive drives (``I don't want to go to bed
yet!'') lets him know that he doesn't always have to act out
physically to get his point across. Furthermore, it sets up a way
for you and your child to commiserate about the daily
disappointments of life within the context of the loving
relationship between the two of you.
</P>
<P>
   Because understanding intervenes, your child feels comforted and
the pressure to be aggressive eases.

POETRY IN MOTION

  Includes color photo, available by e-mail, of Andrew Carroll
handing out free poetry books at the St. Louis Zoo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Shirley Armstrong is minding her own shopping business at a
Washington, D.C., supermarket when a friendly fellow walks up and
hands her a paperback booklet.
</P>
<P>
   She figures it for a high-class coupon promotion, her chance to
save big on solid white tuna or barbecue-flavored potato chips.
``The first thing I did (was ask), What kind of food items are on
sale in here?'' says Armstrong, thumbing the pages. ``Then I said,
My God, it's, poetry!''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't 20-percent-off-manufacturer's-suggested-retail-price
poetry, either. This is absolutely free poetry. And grade A
quality: tasty morsels of Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Langston
Hughes and other big name bards. ``Now I've got something to do
tonight,'' Armstrong chirps, ``and it' not Blockbuster Video.''
</P>
<P>
   That friendly fellow giving dozens of startled shoppers copies
of ``101 Great American Poems'' is Andy Carroll, the 29-year-old
unpaid executive director of the American Poetry and Literacy
Project, a shoestring nonprofit organization based in Washington,
D.C., with the lofty goal of (pardon the rhyme) awakening America's
poetic soul.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll _ a native Washingtonian who earns his living as a
freelance writer and editor _ encounters Shirley Armstrong on the
second day of a 6,529-mile, New York-to-San Francisco odyssey
dubbed The Great Appleseed Giveaway. The concept couldn't be
simpler: Andy Carroll hops into a rental truck loaded with 100,000
poetry books and heads west, showering literally free verse upon
whomever he meets.
</P>
<P>
   His target destinations aren't made-to-order venues such as
coffeehouses and high-school English classes. He plans to hit jury
rooms, turnpike rest areas, even Elvis Presley's Memphis mansion;
everywhere that everyday folks with time on their hands can be
found.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his supermarket stop, Carroll swings by the
Pentagon (where scores of rigid-posture passersby quickly gobble up
more than a thousand books) and the tourists' entrance to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry, it's the vegetable of the literary world,'' he
declares while driving across town on his poetry-promotion rounds.
More and more people have begun eating their literary
``vegetables.'' Sales of poetry books are up nationwide, as is the
number of public poetry readings.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop music has helped spawn a ``spoken word'' movement. ``It
really does feel like poetry's finest hour,'' says Toni Bevan,
director of marketing and promotion at The Academy of American
Poets. ``There are a lot of things contributing to that. You could
certainly say Andy is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't say that, though. He gives the lion's share of
the credit to the late Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize-winning
Russian-emigre poet. In 1991, in a speech that was printed later in
New Republic, Brodsky lamented the fact that print-based literacy
was gradually giving way to a dumbed-down, visually-oriented
``videocy.''
</P>
<P>
   As an antidote, he proposed making poetry ``as ubiquitous as the
nature that surrounds us ... as ubiquitous as gas stations, if not
as cars themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky's name didn't really ring a bell with Andy Carroll, who
had taken just one poetry course as a Columbia University
undergrad. Well, actually, it rang the wrong bell: Carroll thought
he was a retired Russian cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Brodsky's call to arms struck a responsive chord.
Carroll immediately wrote him a letter offering to help
saturation-bomb the United States with great poetry. Turns out it
was the only offer Brodsky received, and in 1993, Brodsky and
Carroll launched the American Poetry and Literacy Project.
</P>
<P>
   It has no employees. It sponsors no conferences, publishes no
newsletter. It just raises money from corporations, foundations and
private citizens, uses the cash to buy poetry books, and then gives
them all away in person or through the mail _ more than 200,000
books and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky died of a heart attack in 1996, and ex-poets laureate
Rita Dove and Robert Hass have since lent their names to the APLP
cause. However, as Carroll notes, ``Joseph was it. In some ways,
he's irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll personally takes care of business in the Washington
area, dropping off books at hospitals, nursing homes and other
sites. But he has also developed a nationwide network of poetry
compadres. Amtrak executives once stocked the cafe car on the
Washington-to-Boston run with 1,500 copies of ``100 Best Loved
Poems.'' One Halloween in Austin, Texas, the county tax assessor
and the local coroner held a ``Death and Taxes'' reading at a
library, dipping into spooky selections from Edgar Allan Poe's
``The Raven and Other Poems.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brodsky's death, Carroll was determined to take to the
road in his memory. In some respects, Carroll was the worst man for
the job. He flunked his driver's test three times before passing
and had never driven more than 400 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he possesses the requisite freewheeling spirit for such an
undertaking. He got Ryder to donate a truck. Doubletree hotels
provided rooms on the road. Washington State Apple Growers _
intrigued by the Johnny Appleseed-like notion of reaping and sowing
literacy through poetry plantings _ picked up the tab for the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are plans to compile a book of travel-related
poetry, perfect for slipping into seat pockets on trains and
planes. He's also looking for a corporate sponsor to underwrite the
cost of giving away 1 million books. Sound quixotic? Or crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, don't expect Andy Carroll to sit on the sidelines
watching the demise of Western civilization and the rise of Fox
Network. After all, this is a guy who walked into a swank Las Vegas
casino and was blown away by an innocuous sign in the gambling pit.
``It read: 'You must be present to win,''' says Carroll. ``That's
one of the most poetic things I've ever seen in my life.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Parents, will you buy your kids a Power Rangers video to teach
them how to karate chop? Or Ren and Stimpy, which instructs
children how to be more sarcastic? How about Rugrats, featuring
kids who upset their parents?
 &HT;    Nuts to that! Why buy something that makes your job harder?
 &HT;    Instead, why not buy a VeggieTale video that teaches the real
meaning of Christmas? A tomato named Bob and Larry the Cucumber
narrate ''The Toy that Saved Christmas.''
 &HT;    An evil toymaker named Mr. Nezzer has convinced all of
Dinkletown that ''Christmas is when you get stuff!'' With TV ads he
sells a toy named Buzz-Saw Louie. The town's kids, who are little
peas, start nagging their broccoli parents: ''I need more toys. I
want a Buzz-Saw Louie! Waa!''
 &HT;    It looks like this will be the worst Christmas ever, until one
brave little Buzz-Saw Louie rebels and decides Christmas is not
about children whining for more toys.
 &HT;    Buzz-Saw Louie, Bob and Larry ask a wise mailman what the real
meaning of Christmas is. He tells them about the first Christmas in
Bethlehem, with verses from Luke about an angel of the Lord
appearing to shepherds, saying ''Do not be afraid. I bring you good
news of great joy ... Today in the town of David, a Savior has been
born to you. He is Christ the Lord.'' Angels appear, singing
''Glory to God.''
 &HT;    ''That baby was Jesus,'' says the mailman. ''God loved people so
much that he gave his only son. Christmas is not about getting.
Christmas is about giving.''
 &HT;    The delightful trio decide they must tell all of Dinkletown the
real meaning of Christmas. But how, with only one day to go?
Buzz-Saw Louie remembers that Mr. Nezzer has a TV studio. Like
Hardy Boys, the group walks into the Toy Factory, finds the TV
studio and broadcast the news with a snappy song. That gladdens the
hearts of parents and children.
 &HT;    Mr. Nezzer catches them at the end of the broadcast, and is
furious. He sneers: ''Do you think anyone cares about this giving
and love stuff?'' He ties them up and is about to push their
toboggan over a cliff, when several families from Dinkletown show
up, saying, ''We're here to tell you that we care, and are here to
give you what you deserve.''
 &HT;    What does the old curmudgeon deserve? Why, a Christmas present
of course! That melts the old boy, who joins them in celebrating
Christmas.
 &HT;    You can preview this perfect Christmas video gift for free in a
network TV premier to be aired at 8 p.m., December 19, on PAX TV,
the newest TV network.
 &HT;    There are ten other VeggieTale videos such as ''Dave and the
Giant Pickle,'' which stars Junior Asparagus, whose foe is an
8-foot pickle. It is a retelling of David and Goliath, teaching
that with God's help, little guys can do big things, too.
 &HT;    VeggieTales was created by Phil Vischer, 32, a former bible
college student who was asked not to return because he and a pal,
Mike Nawrocki, flunked chapel. They met when they were auditioning
for a puppet team. In 1986 both worked for a video post-production
house on computer animation, which was being born as an art form.
 &HT;    They helped create commercials such as Pop Tarts jumping out of
a toaster. But Vischer longed to ''use story-telling and
film-making to point people to God, to reintroduce a higher
authority into media.''
 &HT;    He had to create characters that ''could not have arms, legs,
hair or clothes'' because they were too difficult to animate. He
thought of using candy bars, but thought parents might object, so
he chose to use vegetables that they'd like more: an armless,
legless cucumber that moved by hopping. In 1990-91, he created a
12-second scene to see if its personality came across.
 &HT;    The character was charming, but a year of knocking on doors of
potential funders was so fruitless he nearly gave up. Then a couple
at church said, ''We believe in what you are doing,'' and invested
money from a retirement fund; his parents took a second mortgage.
He bought a $75,000 computer and plunged into creating ''Where's
God When I'm S-Scared?''
 &HT;    With ads in Christian magazines promising delivery before
Christmas, Vischer barely made it, selling 500 copies in 1993. By
1996 his company, Big Idea Productions, had sold 700,000 copies.
That figure climbed to 1.8 million last year and has now reached an
astonishing 4.5 million.
 &HT;    Big Idea's vision: ''It is our goal to markedly enhance the
moral and spiritual fabric of our culture through creative media.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ It's been well more than a month since
Hurricane Mitch walloped Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the storm's wrath didn't end with the rains for the
shell-shocked people packed like animals inside an emergency
shelter at the Leovigildo Cardona Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   In one tiny classroom, a very pregnant Aida Celeste sleeps on a
piece of cardboard, without a pillow, on the cold, cement floor.
</P>
<P>
   She shares the damp space, which is marked off by desks, boxes
and stacks of old clothes, with at least a dozen strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to relief workers, she has all the tins of tuna fish and
cans of green beans she could possibly ever want.
</P>
<P>
   Now what she really needs is money to rebuild her makeshift
house, swallowed by a mudslide during the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take anything with me when my house fell down; I just
ran for my life,'' said Celeste, 23, a shy, soft-spoken woman with
a 2-year-old son. ``I sit here each day with my son, wondering if I
will ever have a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Her predicament is all too common.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch meandered over Honduras and neighboring
Nicaragua, for nearly six days in late October, destroying or
damaging tens of thousands of homes and leaving displaced nearly 2
million people, or 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Most are holed up in the unaffected houses of family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200,000 people have been herded into temporary
shelters, mostly in schools, but also in churches and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa alone, at least 20,000 people have been squeezed
into the close confines of 130 shelters, where they live in almost
unbearable conditions, with no privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In San Pedro Sula, the country's second-largest city, thousands
have been packed into the new soccer stadium, which has been turned
into a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped quarters force healthy people to live alongside sick
ones suffering from rashes, infections and conjunctivitis, and
women must sleep beside men they hardly know.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what will happen once many of these shelters are
closed in January to prepare for the beginning of school in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers worry that absolute poverty -- no home, no income
-- will give these people little choice but to live on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some shelters, men who don't belong there have come in and
tried to rape the girls,'' said Brenda Martinez, who works for
CARE, an Atlanta-based relief organization. ``I don't think anyone
has succeeded, but it is just not a good situation for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran government, with the help of foreign aid, plans
over the short-term to build at least 3,000 new homes in and around
Tegucigalpa, the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not nearly enough to accommodate the country's legion
of homeless, meaning it may take years before many lives return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   At the shelter at the Jorge Roberto Maradiaga Elementary School
here, Paula Valladares, 23, shares a cot and one blanket with her
three children, ages 5, 3 and 1, while her husband sleeps on the
floor beside them.
</P>
<P>
   They live with three other families in a dingy classroom that's
no bigger than a living room in a typical home in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They hang a torn bedspread from the ceiling when they want to
discreetly change clothes, and heat rice and beans over an open
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make tortillas and then sell them for money, but now
I don't have any materials to make tortillas,'' said Valladares,
who wears one of the few garments she owns, a flimsy, see-through
nightgown. ``My husband is trying to do some construction work, but
I don't know how we will find money to build a house.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they have no choice but to remain at the school, which
provides shelter to more than 120 other people.
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity or running water, the smell from six
overflowing toilets is almost suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, relief workers deliver several barrels of water to
the shelter weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Women wash their mostly tattered clothing by hand, hanging it on
ropes to dry in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtyard, dozens of children, many wearing only
flip-flops and oversized T-shirts, chase each other and toss a ball
back and forth, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Babies crawl at their feet, most with runny noses and no
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents, on the other hand, look dazed as they sit on the
ground swapping stories for the umpteenth time about the torrential
downpour that attacked like a biblical plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walls of my house started cracking, and it was nighttime,
so it was dark, but still I just knew that the house was going to
fall down,'' said Olga Vaquis, 22. ``I grabbed my two children out
of bed and just started running, and it was muddy and, we fell, but
we just kept going because we were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the families are from Colonia Soto, a working-class
neighborhood overlooking the Choluteca River that virtually buckled
under the weight of the rains.
</P>
<P>
   Before the storm, the community included 800 homes. Today, there
are fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Already the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,
after Haiti, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch, which
killed 10,000 people across Central America.
</P>
<P>
   At least 5,657 people are dead, 8,058 are missing, and 12,272
are injured in the Honduras alone.
</P>
<P>
   Total losses are estimated at $4 billion -- or roughly the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse.
</P>
<P>
   Food and supplies have poured in from around the world, so much
so that relief workers now warn that it could destroy the local
market.
</P>
<P>
   More goods have been flown in to Central America than during the
Berlin Airlift of 1948, when the United States was forced to drop
food from airplanes when the Soviets blocked the German city at the
beginning of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government, which has sent more than 3,600 troops to
Central America to help distribute supplies and rebuild
infrastructure, has handed out 2.3 million pounds of food and
863,000 pounds of medicine in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to the region now totals more than $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the best way to have an immediate impact now is to
give a cash contribution because it can be directed toward the most
urgent needs, such as providing permanent housing for all those
people who need it,'' said Mark Schneider, assistant administrator
for Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by actor-activist Edward James Olmos,
who spent five days touring the devastation in Honduras last month.
``I've helped after Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Andrew and other disasters, but this was the worst thing I've
ever seen,'' said Olmos, a spokesman for UNICEF. ``We have 20 to 30
years of work to do in Honduras to get that country back to where
it was just six weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tegucigalpa, a city of 1.3 million, appears
deceptively normal these days, at least on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Burger Kings are bustling with customers, and Nissan dealerships
are overflowing with crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Water service has been restored to many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the cliff-like hills that ring the city look like they've
been blasted by a bomb, with houses replaced by piles of mud,
stones and scattered tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a bowl-shaped valley, poor migrants for years have
built settlements on steep mountains when they couldn't afford
flatter, safer land.
</P>
<P>
   They've destroyed trees and vegetation to have building sites,
fuel to cook with and construction supplies.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit, the rains triggered landslides along the
deforested hills, gobbling up everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a recurrence of this tragedy, a new law has been
passed that prohibits the rebuilding of houses in dangerous zones.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how well this rule can be carried out
in a country where so many people are eager to build homes.
</P>
<P>
   One person who might have helped was Mayor Cesar Castellanos,
who worked for years to move people out of unstable areas but was
killed in a helicopter crash last month while surveying the
hurricane's damage.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses and nonprofit groups plan to help with
reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot, for example, has given CARE a credit
of $10,000 for building materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is going to be a hard, long-term effort because we
have to create whole new communities, since we can't put people
back where they were,'' said Marc de Lamotte, CARE's director in
Honduras. ``Meanwhile, I ask myself whether I would be able to live
with my family in a shelter under such poor conditions, and I
really don't think I could.''

   PUERTO RICO: THE FACTS AND FIGURES
</P>
<P>
   Population: 3.8 million; about another 2 million Puerto Ricans
live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Size: 100 miles by 35 miles; an area smaller than Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Both Spanish and English were made official languages
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment rate: 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Governor: Pedro Rossello; took office in January 1993 and was
re-elected last year; is pro-statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita personal income: about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Economy: Manufacturing-based; produces electronics, apparel, and
about half the prescription drugs in the United States; currency is
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Government: Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth. The
chief of state is the U.S. president. The head of government is an
elected governor. There are two legislative chambers: the House of
Representatives with 51 seats and the Senate with 27 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Politics: Local parties are neither Democrat or Republican, but
instead favor statehood, independence, or commonwealth. Puerto Rico
has one non-voting representative in Congress, who is currently
Carlos Romero Barcelo. Residents can't vote in U.S. federal
elections, nor do they pay federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Source: Puerto Rican government.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHOICES:
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's vote, Puerto Rico residents will be asked to pick
from the following options for the island's future:
</P>
<P>
   _ Commonwealth: Puerto Rico would continue as a U.S. territory
and maintain local self-government. Puerto Ricans still wouldn't be
allowed to vote in U.S. federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free association: Similar to the former U.S. territories of
Palau and the Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico would be considered
independent, but with some ties to the United States. For example,
Puerto Rico would use the U.S. monetary and postal systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Independence: Puerto Rico would become an independent nation.
Puerto Ricans would have their own citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Statehood: Equal standing as a U.S. state with guaranteed U.S.
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   _ None of the above.
</P>

OPTION
 &HT;    With PUERTORICO-BOX-$ADV12.

<P>
   MIAMI _ In Puerto Rico, a television advertisement shows a young
mother sitting in the sunny back yard of her Florida home,
expounding the virtues of U.S. schools and the U.S. job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With statehood, things will be just as good in Puerto Rico as
they are here in the United States,'' she says to the camera in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, paid for by a political action committee, is
just one tiny part of the battle being waged for votes in
Sunday's(Dec. 13) referendum on Puerto Rico's future.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the U.S. Army wrested the Caribbean island from
Spain, voters will go to the polls to decide whether they want the
U.S. territory to become the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to happen, Puerto Rico would be the only largely
Hispanic state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello called the vote
in July in a gamble designed to push the U.S. Congress to address
what he claims is an outmoded relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The vote doesn't bind the United States to do anything, although
President Clinton has said that Congress should honor the results
and take up the issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Congress will address this issue because it's the
right thing to do, and also, if it doesn't, it won't play well with
Hispanic voters across the United States,'' said pro-statehood
Puerto Rican Sen. Kenneth McClintock.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot is even formed as a petition that calls on Congress
to act.
</P>
<P>
   It offers four alternatives: statehood, independence, the
current ``commonwealth'' status, and free association. The last, on
a ballot for the first time, would allow Puerto Rico to be
independent while retaining some ties to the United States, making
it similar to the former U.S. territories of Palau and the Marshall
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth box allows voters to pick ``none of the above,'' a
choice the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party is pushing as
a way to protest the definition of commonwealth that appears on the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The party claims that the ballot is biased toward statehood by
implying that U.S. citizenship and other federal benefits will not
be safe under the current, commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Congress granted U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans in 1917, and
made the island a commonwealth in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   During the last non-binding referendum in Puerto Rico, held in
1993, nearly 49 percent of voters chose to retain commonwealth
status, while 46 percent opted for statehood. About 5 percent of
voters favored independence.
</P>
<P>
   Most Puerto Ricans believe the push for statehood has picked up
steam in recent years, an assertion confirmed by recent newspaper
polls that show statehood as the leading choice among voters.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of registered voters released this week by the San Juan
Star newspaper showed statehood edging out ``none of the above'' by
49 percent to 45 percent. Free association received 3 percent of
the vote, independence received 2.4 percent of the vote, and the
current, commonwealth status was favored by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill by
just one vote mandating the first-ever federally authorized
plebiscite allowing Puerto Ricans to vote on their future.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would have given Congress at least 10 years to
decide whether to grant statehood to Puerto Rico if a majority of
voters had opted for that choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal was stalled in the Senate, forcing Rossello to
call his own non-binding plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said that the movement for
statehood won't be over even if statehood fails to win a clear
majority Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted statehood would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would send a strong message to the Congress that
we need to move the process along,'' said Burton, who's in Puerto
Rico for the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does take up the issue next year, as is expected,
statehood will be fought hard by many passionate critics, including
Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First, a Springfield,
Va.-based organization that wants to make English the country's
official language.
</P>
<P>
   He said Puerto Rican statehood would saddle U.S. taxpayers with
an impoverished, crime-ridden island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option of statehood is like a fish left out in the sun,''
he said. ``The longer it is out there, the less appetizing it
becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Puerto Rico's per-capita income of $8,000 is
one-third the U.S. average and less than half that of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   But statehood advocates argue that the island deserves a new,
fairer status. They say Puerto Ricans have been drafted and have
died for the American flag even though they can't vote for
president and have only one non-voting member in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They also say statehood would provide an economic boon for
Puerto Rico the same way it did for Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic growth would double and investment would increase six
times over,'' said Alcides Ortiz, executive director of Puerto
Rico's Federal Affairs Administration, Rossello's office in
Washington, D.C. ``Plus, we'd have some say in Congress on
decisions that directly affect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Under statehood, Puerto Rico would gain two senators and six
representatives in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, commonwealth advocates worry that the
island's Hispanic heritage and culture would be discarded under
statehood, and that Congress would try to make English the dominant
language in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking territory where at least 75
percent of the population has a problem speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   The island is also a very conservative one, a place where
students in public schools are given five minutes to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth advocates also warn that Puerto Ricans would be
forced to pay a whole slew of new taxes, ranging from federal
income taxes to gasoline taxes, if statehood were granted.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans currently are exempt from federal taxes, although
they do receive federal assistance -- about $12 billion in the last
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under statehood, Puerto Ricans will die of hunger,'' said Luis
Munoz Marin, the first Puerto Rican governor and the father of the
commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, the issue of statehood has stirred heated debate
for decades among a population of 3.8 million people who enjoy
their own Olympic team and flag, but who also maintain strong
economic and personal ties to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about two million Puerto Ricans live on the U.S.
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, non-stop rallies, parades, and other
political events have built enthusiasm on all sides of the argument
over the island's future.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting statehood have grown increasingly confident
that they will have the votes this time to prove that an
overwhelming majority of Puerto Ricans are eager to end the status
quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under commonwealth, investors compare the opportunities of
Puerto Rico to the Dominican Republic and Chile,'' said a
pro-statehood brochure. ``Under statehood, Puerto Rico would be
compared to Connecticut, Montana, New Mexico . . . Which sounds
better?''

`STAR TREK' MOVIES SOAR LIGHT-YEARS BEYOND SERIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1979, television's ``Star Trek'' has boldly gone where it
had never gone before: into theaters.
</P>
<P>
   With the ninth ``Trek'' movie, ``Star Trek Insurrection,'' on
its way _ scheduled to open Friday nationwide _ what better time to
take another look at the movies that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   At a combined 17 hours, these films form a series of their own,
lasting as long as an entire season of ``Voyager'' or ``Deep Space
Nine,'' without the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do is prepare your VCR at warp speed and _
``Engage!''
</P>
<P>
   (Each film is from Paramount and closed-captioned. The first six
cost $11.95; the last two are $14.95.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek: The Motion Picture''
</P>
<P>
   Details: 1979, G, 143 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Director: Robert Wise (``West Side Story,'' ``The Sound of
Music'')
</P>
<P>
   Plot: The original Enterprise crew reunites to stop a massive
space ``thing'' from destroying Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Best line: Spock to McCoy, who has joked that the Vulcan is ``as
warm as ever'' and hasn't changed: ``Nor have you, doctor, as your
continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivia: The longest and only G-rated Trek film. On video it has
12 extra minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis: Sure, it's ponderous, the effects eclipse the
characters, and the uniforms are drab. But ``Trek's'' rebirth still
had a special sense of reaffirmation. It was grand seeing the crew
again, and the production values went light years beyond the
original show. Also, the cast was never younger in a movie; William
Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were 48 here. Jerry Goldsmith won a
deserved Oscar nomination for his rousing and romantic score, whose
main-title theme was lifted for ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission results: 6 phasers (out of 10)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan''
</P>
<P>
   Details: 1982, PG, 113 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Director: Nicholas Meyer (``Time After Time'')
</P>
<P>
   Plot: The arrogant superhuman Khan (Ricardo Montalban) of the
'60s show returns to take vengeance on the Enterprise crew that
marooned him. Spock must sacrifice himself to save the ship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best line:  &LR; A dying Spock to Kirk: ``I have been and always
shall be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trivia:  &LR; Kirstie Alley could have been a ``Trek'' icon.
Instead, she quit her role as Lt. Saavik to make some obscure TV
shows, such as ``Cheers'' and ``Veronica's Closet.'' (Robin Curtis
played Saavik in Trek's ``III'' and ``IV.'') Composer James Horner,
fresh from Roger Corman's film factory, went on to score ``Trek
III'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysis: This galvanizing space-opera is the most vibrant and
exciting Trek movie. Montalban is obsessive yet charismatic, and
the climax melds teeth-gnashing action with gut-wrenching tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mission result: 9 phasers
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek III: The Search for Spock''
</P>
<P>
   Details: 1984, PG, 105 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Director: Leonard Nimoy
</P>
<P>
   Plot: The crew steals a decommissioned Enterprise in hopes of
bringing Spock back to life, even if it means fighting Klingons
over the planet-shifting Genesis device. Spock returns, but the
Enterprise _ and Kirk's son _ are lost.
</P>
<P>
   Best line: From a rebellious Kirk: ``The word is no. I am
therefore going anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivia: Mark Lenard of the original series returns as Spock's
father. Miguel Ferrer (``Twin Peaks'') and John Larroquette
(``Night Court'') have bit parts. The USS Grissom clearly is named
after the late Mercury astronaut Gus Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis: Nimoy proves an able director in this dramatic tale
that brings his character back to life quite logically. An
emotional, strong film, even with Christopher Lloyd's miscasting as
a heinous Klingon.
</P>
<P>
   Mission result: 7 phasers
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home''
</P>
<P>
   Details: 1986, PG, 119 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Director: Leonard Nimoy
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Another space ``thing'' threatens Earth, but the
Enterprise intervenes by time-traveling to 1980s San Francisco and
rescuing two whales. Incredibly, it makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Best line: From Kirk, when leaving a spaceship in Golden Gate
Park: ``Everybody remember where we parked.''
</P>
<P>
   Trivia: Eddie Murphy almost was cast as a 20th-century con
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis: Comedy was hardly alien to Trek after such '60s
episodes as ``The Trouble With Tribbles,'' but for the movies this
was a turning point _ and it struck a chord. Earning $109 million
domestically, this became Trek's top-grossing film, even with
Leonard Rosenman's lousy score.
</P>
<P>
   Mission result: 8 phasers
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier''

ASTRONAUTS PUT SPACE STATION'S ANTENNAS INTO PLACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ U.S. astronauts Jerry Ross and Jim Newman floated
outside the fledgling international space station Wednesday to
equip it with two boxy communications antennas to link it to NASA's
Mission Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Their nearly 7-hour spacewalk began at 2:33 p.m. CST. The
excursion was the second of three from the shuttle Endeavour on the
first station assembly flight.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle astronauts are scheduled to complete the antenna
installation Thursday when they enter the recently linked U.S.
Unity and Russian Zarya modules, the first two components of the
station, for the first time. The modules were stacked together atop
the shuttle's combination docking mechanism and airlock Sunday,
creating an eight-story tower. The spacewalkers scale the modules
as they work.
</P>
<P>
   Once fully installed, the communications system, using a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite link, will
enable the staff of Mission Control in Houston to monitor the
flight computers aboard Unity and send commands to many other
systems in the two modules. Motion control for Zarya will still be
transmitted by U.S. and Russian staff at mission control in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we are doing is basic construction,'' said
Newman, who was moved around the outside of the station on the tip
of Endeavour's 50-foot long robot arm. ``I don't think the tasks
will ever be mundane. The environment we will be working in will
always be very, very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous view when you come out,'' said Ross, who
lashed himself to the outside of the modules during what was his
sixth career walk in space. ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the televised views transmitted to the ground, the backdrop
for Wednesday's spacewalk was the silver gleam of the new station
modules against the vast black of deep space and the rich blue hues
of cloud-filled skies over the Earth 245 miles below. At one point,
the astronauts paused from their work, distracted by a far-away
lightning storm.
</P>
<P>
   With Ross assisting, Newman strung a pair of long communications
cables from the Russian to the American module.
</P>
<P>
   One will furnish the signals from the U.S.-financed Russian
module to American controllers as well as a two-way video link that
can be used by the first occupants of the new station to
communicate with the ground. The second will allow communications
for station residents who don Russian suits and use the future U.S.
airlock for spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the two men wrestled a pair of 100 pound, suitcase-sized
antennas to installation points on the left and right sides of the
American module. Working separately, they plugged the bulky devices
into the hull of Unity and fastened them down in four places.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Wednesday's spacewalk was not as frantic as the
first one Monday when Ross and Newman made 40 electrical power and
computer data connections in the Russian hardware.
</P>
<P>
   In this spacewalk there was time for several unusual tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Using a 10-foot-long tool called a ``boat hook'', Newman tugged
free a guidance antenna on the Russian module. Two of the
4-foot-long devices failed to unfurl properly after the Zarya was
launched by the Russians on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   As it was during Monday's excursion, the two spacewalkers worked
in concert with astronaut Nancy Currie, the shuttle's robot-arm
operator, and pilot Rick Sturckow, who served as their timekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion's only low point was when Ross lost a large piece
of insulation the astronauts were applying to the outside of the
American module.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, one of the thermal covers got away from you,''
Endeavour Commander Bob Cabana radioed from the shuttle's cockpit,
surprising his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did it go?'' a frustrated Ross responded as the
blanketlike material drifted slowly away. ``It was all tethered, I
guarantee you. I don't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's spacewalk, Ross lost two aluminum tools, a
2{-pound socket and an 8{-pound wire carrier, equipment that was
supposed to be secured when not in use.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to recover the blanket was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got well out behind us and dropped down pretty fast,''
Cabana told Mission Control. ``We lost sight of it in the
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cabana was to lead his crew into the Unity and
Zarya modules for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking forward to on the ingress is the first
official act on the international space station and that is turning
on the lights,'' said Frank Culbertson, NASA's deputy director for
station operations.
</P>
<P>
   A final spacewalk is planned for Saturday night.

RESEARCHERS GIVE PILOTS ADVICE ON VOLCANO PLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You are the pilot of a Boeing 747 hauling 231
passengers over Alaska on a sunny morning when suddenly the sky
blackens. The passengers start complaining that they smell burning
sulfur.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an ancient ``Twilight Zone'' episode. It's an ash
plume from Hell's closest terrestrial equivalent: an erupting
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   And unless you stay cool and act fast, the thick, hot ash could
choke your jet engines. It might even shut them down, perhaps
dooming you and your passengers to icy graves in the Alaskan
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Such an incident, involving a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines jet,
happened near the Redoubt Volcano in Alaska on Dec. 15, 1989.
Fortunately, the pilot managed to revive the engines _ after 11
tries _ and she landed the jet safely. The damage: $80 million to
replace all four engines.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two decades, some 100 aerial close calls have
been caused by the unpredictable huffing and puffing of volcanoes,
Thomas J. Casadevall of the U.S. Geological Survey told the
American Geophysical Union conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the KLM flight, the cabin interior grew so dark that the
pilot tried to find her co-pilot ``by reaching out and finding his
shoulder,'' said Casadevall, who is the deputy director of the USGS
in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, no one has died in these bizarre confrontations
between airplane and geology _ not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air traffic is growing and volcanoes continue to be active,''
Casadevall said. ``To my knowledge, the major carriers are now
giving preflight briefings (to pilots) that include volcanic
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat is especially great during night flights, when pilots
can't see the volcanic plumes until they are barreling through
them.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent a volcano-triggered aviation disaster, volcanologists
hope to win NASA permission late next month to launch the world's
first dedicated volcano-monitoring satellite. The orbital probe
would give advance warning of eruptions that might threaten pilots,
Casadevall and colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   By using special instruments, the satellite would track volcanic
plumes as they migrate thousands of miles from their source. The
instruments would sense the chemical and mineral contents of the
plumes, such as silicate particles and a volcanic gas, sulfur
dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, the satellite should cost $50 million, a great
bargain considering the cost of the KLM incident, said a leader of
the project, volcanologist Bill Rose of Michigan State University.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the USGS continues to install ground-based sensors
around volcanoes across the globe. The sensors continually monitor
the shaking, temperature changes, gas emissions and other activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``These volcanic clouds can remain a problem for many days,''
Rose said. ``We have big holes in this kind of coverage now,''
meaning that a pilot can stumble upon an eruption unawares.
</P>
<P>
   Experts advise pilots against increasing engine power and trying
to escape a plume, but instead fly steadily while turning 180
degrees to escape the same way the pilot came in. By increasing
engine power in an effort to rise above the plume, the pilot risks
overheating, and perhaps burning out, the engines.

REPRESENTATIVES ELECTED TO SENATE FACE ETHICAL DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes impeachment definition sidebar.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One person cannot be both accuser and judge.
</P>
<P>
   So wrote President John Quincy Adams in his diary on Jan. 4,
1804. He later called upon US senators to disqualify members who
voted on impeachment in the House from voting on the same case in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Though in this case, involving a federal judge, several members
ended up voting in both the House and the Senate, the issue was
never really settled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three US representatives _ soon to be senators _ are facing
this dilemma as they contemplate the possibility of casting one
vote on whether to impeach President Clinton, then casting another
vote as senators next year on whether to convict and remove Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   The three are Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York; Mike Crapo,
Republican of Idaho; and Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky. They
deliberated, vacillated and finally decided that they are leaning
toward serving as both grand jurors in the House and jurors in the
Senate _ a decision that flies in the face of unofficial precedent
set over the years by members of Congress in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has no specific rule on the subject of voting twice,
according to the US Senate Historical Office. And although many
lawyers point to the 1804 trial as a precedent, in the past most
senators in this position have not voted in Senate trials.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, in 1989, four senators who voted as lame duck
House members to send articles of impeachment of federal Judge
Alcee Hastings refused to vote in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   All those refusing to vote were Republican, including Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Dan Coats of Indiana. A member
of Lott's staff said he did not think it ``appropriate'' to vote in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, one would be concerned about voting as a
prosecutor in the House and then serving as a juror in the
Senate,'' said the staffer.
</P>
<P>
   Senators must take an sworn oath _ under threat of perjury _
before agreeing to participate in Senate impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and
the law: so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a legal expert who asked for anonymity, Lott and
the three other Republicans did not vote as senators because they
did not believe they could be impartial.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning, who only a month ago was leaning toward skipping the
House vote in case he had to act as a juror in the Senate trial,
said he has had second thoughts about sitting on the sidelines in
such an historic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to wonder if it was the right decision, and I think
the 50 to 100 calls a day to my office by phone, e-mail and letter
have me convinced that I wasn't elected to pass on this vote,''
said Bunning, who was elected to the Senate in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' he added, ``my constituents have convinced me it is
my duty to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunning has not yet decided how he would vote on the floor next
week, if, as expected, the House Judiciary Committee approves
articles of impeachment. But he said calls from Kentuckians were
running 10 to 1 in favor of impeaching the president. Out-of-state
calls to his office ran 4 to 1 in favor.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a House Judiciary Committee member who opposes
impeachment, had declared this fall that he would vote in the House
but not the Senate. He was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning and Crapo believe that if they do not vote on all
impeachment issues, their states will not be properly represented
in what could be the most significant votes of their term.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is to vote in both places unless ethics
requirements of Congress prevent me from doing so,'' said Crapo.
``So far, no ethical objections have been raised. My intention is
to fully represent the people of Idaho in these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But eyebrows are being raised outside both the chambers. Bruce
Ackerman, who testified on behalf of the White House Tuesday,
argued that entire proceeding was unconstitutional because the
articles of impeachment were being voted on by a lame duck House.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ackerman, a Yale University law professor and
constitutional expert, voting twice ``to both charge and convict
someone does not comport with the ideals of American justice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMPEACHMENT STEPS
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The House:
</P>
<P>
   This week's House Judiciary Committee hearings on the possible
impeachment of President Clinton are only the first step in a
process that could lead to his ouster. The committee is expected to
vote this week on whether to recommend that the full House adopt
articles of impeachment against Clinton. If that happens, the full
House could vote next week on articles of impeachment. If one or
more article is approved, the case would be sent to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate:
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the Senate would hold a trial on whether
to convict _ and thus oust _ Clinton. The senators would sit as a
jury, with Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding
as the judge. Instead of having a ``prosecutor,'' the House
appoints a special impeachment counsel and members who are
``managers'' of the case. The senators could send questions to
Rehnquist, who would decide whether they could be asked. Witnesses
could be called to testify. In the end, the senators would vote on
whether the evidence shows that Clinton's action fits the
Constitution's vague definition of high crimes and misdemeanors.
Republicans control the Senate by a 55-45 margin. A two-thirds vote
_ meaning 67 senators if all are present _ are needed to convict
the president. Conviction on a single article of impeachment would
lead to Clinton's ouster.

TECHIE TREKKIES IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a bit of an urban-galactic mission just to wind your way to
the offices of The Screen House, an on-line design and development
firm located somewhere between a crater and a roadblock down on the
waterfront. Once there, you're greeted by a barefoot programmer
with a ponytail who pads across the blue Astroturf and invites you
to relax among the 10 arcade games in the lobby, enjoy a little
chat with the life-size cutout of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and,
heck, have a cup of java.
</P>
<P>
   This quirky little office, down by Big Dig Central, is the place
where a group of young entrepreneurs developed Star Trek:
Continuum, a rare Web site where the gee-whiz technology is
actually appropriate for the content. If you live in the flesh
world (as opposed to the Trek world), Star Trek: Continuum _ part
of Paramount's official Star Trek site _ might seem a little out
there, but to Screen House co-founder Drake Roberts, it's serious
business. His face takes on the look of a child just given the run
of the world's largest toy store when he leads a tour of the site,
which features more than 1,700 pages including an exhaustive
library and a special section called ``Klingon Compendium.''
</P>
<P>
   When he logs on, the site greets him personally, ``Welcome
Skyhopper!'' Roberts, needless to say, is a die-hard Trekkie.
Paramount noticed the start-up company after it produced some
on-line games for E! Online (most notably the fun little
time-waster that enabled users to sink the Titanic last year). ``It
didn't hurt that we were fanatic Trekkies,'' Roberts says,
launching the PADD (personal access display device) that enables
easy navigation of the mammoth site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you build a site for Star Trek, you can use all your
technical bells and whistles,'' Roberts explains, practically
whistling himself. He clicks into the Klingon Linguistic Studies
area, where newbies like you-know-who can learn the language and
hear the synthesized voice of Majel Roddenberry, widow of Trek
founder Gene Roddenberry; she pronounces and defines vocabulary in
Klingon. For instance, butlh, pronounced ``boock,'' means dirt
under the tips of humanoid fingers. Noted.
</P>
<P>
   The site, of course, includes a section on ``Star Trek:
Insurrection,'' the latest adventure film, which opens next Friday.
And, of course, the Star Trek store is now open on line, part of
the $2 billion entertainment phenomenon that started modestly with
the first television series in 1966 and spawned three additional TV
series, nine feature films, scores of books and action figures,
dozens of unofficial Web sites, as well as thousands and thousands
of fans. And, yes, Star Trek: Continuum, is found at
www.startrek.com.
</P>
<P>
   (at)j
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and his partner Adam Prince, who also produce
non-galactic sites for earthly entities like Fidelity Investments,
seem to have found their dream job with the Trek assignment. But
there's a guy out in Hollywood who has a job that would bring tears
to the eyes of all those Trekkies rushing to see ``Insurrection''
next weekend. His name is Guy Vardaman, and he maintains the
official Star Trek database, which contains more than 30 years of
trivia and lore. The very idea makes your nltlhpachs itch (that's
fingernails, humanoid!).
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman, 33, worked closely with the Screen House folks on the
site, and he's the guy at Paramount responsible for answering
e-mail from the discerning audience. ``I've got a backlog of about
10,000 here,'' he says. He proceeds to read one about a ``warp core
breach.'' ``As you can see, we get a whole bunch of real technical
questions,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman counts himself as a sort of soft-core Trekkie. ``I
watched the original series when I was a kid, but when I reached
adolescence, Captain Kirk came off the wall and Farah Fawcett went
up,'' he recalls. While he was a college student studying
electro-optical engineering, he landed a gig as an extra on one of
the Trek television series, and it turned into a full-time job. ``I
guess star dates and trivia pushed out my knowledge of the indices
of light refraction,'' he says, sighing. ``What can you do? I think
I know more about `Star Trek' than many things in my life I should
know more about.'' Like what? ``Like plumbing. If they could just
make the plumbing in my house look like the Enterprise floor plan,
I could figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vardaman is quick to point out that the only Trek uniform he's
ever worn came out of the costume department. Sure, he loves his
job, but would he ever consider doing anything else? ``Why do you
ask? Do you have an offer? I don't think there are a lot of places
where you can go with a real advanced knowledge of Star Trek and
use it to make a living,'' he says. Well, there's this place down
on the Boston waterfront. Take a left at the crater and a right at
the roadblock. Ask for Skyhopper.

   Search of the week. Trekkies, by their very nature, have been on
line since the very beginning, back in the day when some of us were
still trying to work our VCRs and other more enterprising types
were trying to figure out how to make money on this thing called
the Internet. The best way to solve the VCR problem is to marry an
engineer. As for the money solution, it's called e-commerce. And
that's the reason some Trekkies are at war in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   A quick search leads Trekkies to Star Trek: WWW (www.stwww.com)
one of the best unofficial sites in intergalactica. Billed as
``Mother of all Star Trek sites,'' it's run by an Italian Trekkie
named Luca Sambucci. Last year, he and other Trekkie Web masters
received letters from Paramount's parent company Viacom, which
charged that they were infringing on copyrights by using Star Trek
images on their sites. Sambucci launched the Online Freedom
Federation, which fired off a petition to Viacom striving to reach
a compromise that enabled the fans to have their fun and enabled
the corporate monolith to generate revenue from its property. By
the latest count, Sambucci has collected 23,881 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the affected sites have been shut down, and others
continue, with or without the unauthorized images. One of the
funniest of these sites (www.bradley.edu/campusorg/psiphi/mov/)
includes an annotated copy of the letter from Viacom, in which the
Trekkie renegade parses the legalese and corrects the punctuation.
Too bad it isn't written in Klingon. Do`Ha' _ in Klingon, ``That is
unfortunate.''

RAMPANT APATHY MAY HURT CLINTON

<P>
   MIAMI _ Apathy may be President Clinton's worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the rhetoric and rancor of this week's House
impeachment hearings and debate, Americans for the most part are
minding their pre-holiday business, weary of the hashed and
rehashed Washington story and unalarmed that a moment in history is
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Across this sunny, oceanside city with its zesty Latin flavor,
where the trunks of royal palms sparkle in wrappings of white
Christmas lights and convertibles cruise for parking spaces at
crowded malls, the news about Venezuela's president-elect draws
more passion than the issue of impeaching the US president.
</P>
<P>
   Many here admit they are battle fatigued, just too bored and fed
up with what looks like raw partisanship in Washington to care much
about Clinton's fate any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it ever should have gotten this far, but now
it's out of control,'' said Adi Ortigosa, a tourist on her way home
to Chicago. ``I went away for vacation and came back to find
impeachment in full swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House itself is playing an inside-the-Beltway game,
targeting a group of moderate House Republicans whose votes against
impeachment could save the president. For Clinton to appeal again
for forgiveness, or to warn that impeachment is a national
nightmare, might simply fall on America's deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound apathetic, but I think it's over and we
need to move on,'' said Mark Massimino, 31, a salesman from Miami
Beach. ``I'm tired of all the politics, and frankly, it doesn't
matter to me at this point whether Clinton stays or goes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Americans aren't paying attention. Most people say
they are following the White House story and congressional hearings
closely, and they prove it by citing both details of the sex
scandal and specific allegations made of the president's
wrongdoing, from perjury to abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Wheeler, a Miami homemaker who has watched large
chunks of the House Judiciary Committee proceedings on television,
including hearings this week featuring the president's defenders
and foes of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want something to happen,'' Wheeler said as she took a
break from holiday shopping with her 15-month-old son at the huge
Dadeland Mall here. ``I'm personally not scared of impeachment. I
don't think the president's departure would be too disruptive. He
doesn't have that much effect on the economy, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls show public opinion has not been influenced much,
if at all, this fall as the House Judiciary Committee set in motion
a high-profile inquiry that is likely to lead to it approving one
or more articles of impeachment later this week. Then, the full
House is expected to be called into session next week to decide for
only the second time in history if a sitting president should stand
trial in the Senate for committing high crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup survey released Monday showed 32 percent of Americans
are in favor of impeaching Clinton, while 66 percent are against
it. A Gallup poll published in early October showed nearly the same
thing: 34 percent for and 62 percent against impeachment. The
margin of error in each poll was three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypothetical questions are notoriously dangerous, and public
opinion might change when the voting actually starts,'' said Karlyn
Bowman, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in
Washington. ``But I'd be surprised. These opinions are incredibly
stable, rock hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Carrie Meek, a Democrat from the black-majority
district that includes Miami's Liberty City and creole-speaking
Little Haiti, said her constituents overwhelmingly like the
president and don't want him impeached. ``From the beginning, they
have begged Congress not to go against the will of the people,''
Meek said. ``They know the consequences would be dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Meek hosted Republican Representative Dan Miller at a
town hall meeting Wednesday at a busy Head Start center in her
district, neither she nor any of her constituents raised the issue
with Miller, who is from conservative Sarasota and said he still is
undecided about how he will vote if impeachment comes to the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents strongly think Clinton should be impeached,''
said Miller, noting that calls and mail in his district, across the
state and light years from the rich ethnic stew of Miami, run ``10
or 20 to 1'' against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was the first Democratic presidential nominee since
1976 to carry Dade County, which includes Miami and its
fast-growing surrounding suburbs. He wooed the elderly who live in
the handsome high-rises along Biscayne Boulevard, the young and
trendy patrons of the art deco clubs of South Beach, the
middle-class blacks and the struggling new immigrants from Central
America, and even the Cuban-Americans, who have been suspicious of
Democrats since President Kennedy's fiasco at the Bay of Pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Today opinions about the president are as deeply divided along
the Calle Ocho, the heart of Miami's Little Havana, as anywhere in
the country. At any one of the many open-air coffee bars, where
Spanish-speaking patrons sip the strong, sweet cafe Cubano from
tiny cups and sample from cases full of cigars, spirited
conversations turn from the upset victory Sunday of Hugo Chavez,
Venezuela's populist president-elect, to the plight of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is sexual misconduct the kind of high crime the Constitution
intended for impeaching a president?'' asked Dan Alvarez, a college
professor who said he has watched all the congressional hearings
and even read a book on impeachment. ``I think it is quite
appalling and embarrassing to trivialize the process and distort
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez voted for Clinton in 1996 and thinks he should remain in
office. Raul Tejero, retired from the US Army, also voted for
Clinton and thinks he is a perjurer who should be censured. Tony
Cordero, a real estate agent, didn't vote for Clinton and wishes he
would just resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole process is pretty digusting,'' said Cordero,
whose father, a former Cuban government official, fled in 1959,
after Castro seized power. ``My priorities are my family and my
business. I don't think it would matter at all to me if they threw
Clinton out.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ People have begun to ask whether Hillary Rodham Clinton
is likely to be elected president of the United States. At this
point, the answer is evidently no, but the question does reflect a
remarkable development in her role and the way she is perceived.
 &HT;    Throughout President Bill Clinton's ordeal by sex-lie scandal,
Mrs. Clinton has carried on as though she had no personal concerns.
Her stamina and her strength have made a huge difference in her
husband's ability to weather the attacks so far.
 &HT;    The troubles aren't quite over yet, but the issue now is more
how congressional Republicans are going to get rid of the
impeachment question than it is the fate of the president. Censure
strikes me as a rather pointless, artificial way of avoiding their
responsibility to conclude what has been started.
 &HT;    The argument that some formal punishment must be imposed to show
that Mr. Clinton earned the disapproval of the legislature and many
compatriots is fatuous. That criticism has already been very widely
recorded.
 &HT;    Some do seem to resent, however, that he has borne it all
without any signs of the emotional distress and self-abasement that
would seem inescapable for most people. He is probably sustained by
the same force of confidence that led him to feel he could ignore
the proprieties and get away with it. That trait got him into
trouble, and it is seeing him through, with Hillary's indispensable
help.
 &HT;    She has gone through several transformations in their years at
the peak of American politics. She wanted to share in the rewards
as well as the effort. There was a lively, joyful modern air of
equality and partnership in their early campaign theme of ``two for
the price of one,'' but it boomeranged. Feminism hasn't won that
much support from Americans.
 &HT;    So she shifted to less assertive, less political subjects,
gentled her style, and made more of the wife-and-mother role which
American political usage seems to demand. But that turned out to be
a lot tougher than the traditional routine, and she responded again
with intense, carefully programmed activity. Now she is on the
cover of Vogue, a first for a presidential wife, and will be Time's
Woman of the Year, and American-watchers around the world are
wondering about her future.
 &HT;    Mrs. Clinton is a fine public speaker, poised, generating
conviction, able to think quickly on her feet. In January this
year, not long after the Monica story broke, she appeared at the
World Economic Forum in Davos to talk about education and
development. She showed no diffidence or embarrassment, and the
several thousand business and political leaders present gave her a
standing ovation.
 &HT;    A question was passed up to her. ``Don't you think it's time for
the U.S. to choose an intelligent, capable woman president?''
Without stopping for breath, she laughed and found the perfect
diplomatic answer. ``Yes, and I look forward to voting for her.''
 &HT;    Clearly, the intention was to lure her into declaring a
candidacy for herself, but she is no political dummy. In current
circumstances, it is hard to imagine her name on a ballot. It would
be fun to see her as vice-presidential candidate on an Al Gore
ticket for 2000, but entertaining the voters isn't what campaign
consultants recommend.
 &HT;    Still, Mrs. Clinton has now established herself as an effective
public figure in her own right, both in the United States and in
the many foreign countries where she has made successful trips. She
is too young, too energetic, too full of ideas, too competent to
disappear politely when she is no longer first lady. There have
been rumors that the couple will split up after they leave the
White House, the aftermath of the scandal, but their pact has
proven extraordinarily solid so far.
 &HT;    The issues that were shoved aside and drowned out by Monicagate
are all still there, and she has developed considerable expertise
in addressing them. No doubt she will find a platform to enable her
to continue, whatever her husband chooses as his next career, for
he will have one.
 &HT;    The nearest thing to a precedent for Mrs. Clinton's
self-launched activism was Eleanor Roosevelt, also a stubborn,
persistent, innovative woman who had to put up with a lot. She was
demeaned, even detested, but she kept on with the humane causes she
thought important and now she is remembered with love and
gratitude.
 &HT;    Just where it will take her isn't clear, but certainly Mrs.
Clinton is not coming to the end of her road in 2000.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It is important for the international community to sort out the
developments in Russia, for our present financial crisis is the
best proof that the Russian economy is integrated into the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Our potential partners in the West cannot grasp the logic of
Russia's leaders' economic and political decision making. And yes,
the main problem that faces the West in trying to figure out
Russian events is not so much their complexity as the country's
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to explain to your politicians, CEOs and other
decision makers that it is probably premature to look for a logical
pattern now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains: our new Russian government under Prime
Minister Primakov still has not drawn up an economic policy. But
why? _ It has been too busy trying to ensure political stability.
And in fact it has managed to cope with this major task and keep
things from spiraling out of control. So we put up with a tradeoff:
uncertainty in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Russia may well take a step backward in terms
of market reforms. What is important is WHY it will make this step.
I hope the outcome will be to make two steps forward afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As to checks and balances, the degree to which our economic
program is realistic depends on whether it can get support from
international financial organizations such as the IMF and World
Bank _ and on whether it succeeds in restructuring our foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Three options are still possible to really overcome the Russian
crisis, but they are all related to the degree to which the budget
is balanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option One: To return to a rigid budget with revenues
exceeding expenditures. On this basis, an arrangement can be made
with international financial organizations on foreign-debt
restructuring. This would, however, require a total reform of our
tax system, reduction of ineffective expenditures and a way to
provide social protection to those who actually need it. In these
endeavors, the government might find itself taking steps at the
expense of its political prestige.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Two: To draw up a relatively balanced budget that
presupposes an emission, or printing, of 80 billion to 100 billion
new rubles before the end of 1998. This means that 35 to 40 billion
rubles would go to the budget, 40 to 50 billion would be toward
payment of the foreign debt and 10 to 15 billion rubles would go
into Russia's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Such a relatively balanced budget would result in a monthly
inflation rate of 5 percent to 8 percent through March. But it
would not lead to hyperinflation, and it would still enable us to
reach agreement on foreign-debt restructuring. In my view, this is
the most realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Three: To meet the opposition's populist demands, the
government could try to solve all its problems, including those
that cannot possibly be solved, such as paying off all its debts by
December. This would call for a printing of 150 billion rubles or
so. In this case, inflation would be no less than 10 percent a
month through March.
</P>
<P>
   I think this option would be unworkable. First, it would not
promote economic development; second, it would be fraught with
serious social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, importantly, I believe that Russia has no economic
problems that cannot be solved. Everything hinges on the political
problem _ the government's weakness in the absence of any accord in
our society over the goals, means and price of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that the democratic movement in Russia has suffered a
big defeat. There surely has been a political recoil. But even if
the idea of building a democracy is defeated, this does not mean
that a normal market economy cannot be built.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as spring, when I was prime minister, I thought the
main thing was to set ourselves an economic task that we could
tackle. I did not realize that in the final analysis, everything
would hinge on politics _ on the stability, wisdom and
trustworthiness of our politicians.
</P>
<P>
   We have made many mistakes, especially in grossly
underestimating the difficulty of remolding social consciousness.
One can speed up the implementation of an economic plan, but one
cannot speed up the remolding of social consciousness in the
various levels of society. All our economic theories, though
correct, tripped over this.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia has never seen a mere seven consecutive
years of economic reform. We simply mark time, taking two steps
backward for every forward step. What is important, however, is
that over this time of trial and error, everyone has realized that
no road exists other than the one leading to a free-market economy.
</P>

<P>
   It is important for the international community to sort out the
developments in Russia, for our present financial crisis is the
best proof that the Russian economy is integrated into the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Our potential partners in the West cannot grasp the logic of
Russia's leaders' economic and political decision making. And yes,
the main problem that faces the West in trying to figure out
Russian events is not so much their complexity as the country's
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried to explain to your politicians, CEOs and other
decision makers that it is probably premature to look for a logical
pattern now.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains: our new Russian government under Prime
Minister Primakov still has not drawn up an economic policy. But
why? _ It has been too busy trying to ensure political stability.
And in fact it has managed to cope with this major task and keep
things from spiraling out of control. So we put up with a tradeoff:
uncertainty in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Russia may well take a step backward in terms
of market reforms. What is important is WHY it will make this step.
I hope the outcome will be to make two steps forward afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As to checks and balances, the degree to which our economic
program is realistic depends on whether it can get support from
international financial organizations such as the IMF and World
Bank _ and on whether it succeeds in restructuring our foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Three options are still possible to really overcome the Russian
crisis, but they are all related to the degree to which the budget
is balanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option One: To return to a rigid budget with revenues
exceeding expenditures. On this basis, an arrangement can be made
with international financial organizations on foreign-debt
restructuring. This would, however, require a total reform of our
tax system, reduction of ineffective expenditures and a way to
provide social protection to those who actually need it. In these
endeavors, the government might find itself taking steps at the
expense of its political prestige.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Two: To draw up a relatively balanced budget that
presupposes an emission, or printing, of 80 billion to 100 billion
new rubles before the end of 1998. This means that 35 to 40 billion
rubles would go to the budget, 40 to 50 billion would be toward
payment of the foreign debt and 10 to 15 billion rubles would go
into Russia's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Such a relatively balanced budget would result in a monthly
inflation rate of 5 percent to 8 percent through March. But it
would not lead to hyperinflation, and it would still enable us to
reach agreement on foreign-debt restructuring. In my view, this is
the most realistic option.
</P>
<P>
   _ Option Three: To meet the opposition's populist demands, the
government could try to solve all its problems, including those
that cannot possibly be solved, such as paying off all its debts by
December. This would call for a printing of 150 billion rubles or
so. In this case, inflation would be no less than 10 percent a
month through March.
</P>
<P>
   I think this option would be unworkable. First, it would not
promote economic development; second, it would be fraught with
serious social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, importantly, I believe that Russia has no economic
problems that cannot be solved. Everything hinges on the political
problem _ the government's weakness in the absence of any accord in
our society over the goals, means and price of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that the democratic movement in Russia has suffered a
big defeat. There surely has been a political recoil. But even if
the idea of building a democracy is defeated, this does not mean
that a normal market economy cannot be built.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as spring, when I was prime minister, I thought the
main thing was to set ourselves an economic task that we could
tackle. I did not realize that in the final analysis, everything
would hinge on politics _ on the stability, wisdom and
trustworthiness of our politicians.
</P>
<P>
   We have made many mistakes, especially in grossly
underestimating the difficulty of remolding social consciousness.
One can speed up the implementation of an economic plan, but one
cannot speed up the remolding of social consciousness in the
various levels of society. All our economic theories, though
correct, tripped over this.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Russia has never seen a mere seven consecutive
years of economic reform. We simply mark time, taking two steps
backward for every forward step. What is important, however, is
that over this time of trial and error, everyone has realized that
no road exists other than the one leading to a free-market economy.

EXHIBIT OFFERS A REVEALING NEW LOOK AT DELACROIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ I'll bet I'm not the only art lover today whose
affection for the work of Eugene Delacroix (1798-1863) is tepid, if
not wholly lacking.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Delacroix: The Late Work,'' the exhibition organized to
commemorate the bicentennial of his birth by the Philadelphia
Museum of Art and the French National Museums, nearly made me love
his work in spite of myself.
</P>
<P>
   Forming with poet Victor Hugo and composer Hector Berlioz, a
triumvirate that defined French Romanticism, Delacroix tends to be
too emotionally extreme for modern tastes. His passion, his
outsized gestures, his theatricality, his love of strife and
violence turn us off as much as they turned on at least some of his
contemporaries. During his lifetime his work was received with
extremes of approval and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   The curators of the exhibition were smart to focus on
Delacroix's late works. With some 70 paintings and 40 works on
paper, the show is sizable but not overwhelming. The big pictures
of his youth _ ``The Death of Sardanapalus'' and ``Liberty Leading
the People'' _ gave Romanticism a set of indelible, iconic images
and gave Delacroix a reputation as a public artist of large
sympathies. Yet for all their self-importance, they prove obstacles
for us to get around today.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 15 years of his life, having retreated from
public battles to his country home, struggling almost continuously
with illness, Delacroix made paintings that are no less
representative. But they tend to be smaller, thus allowing us to
see their virtues through the still frequent bombast.
</P>
<P>
   Even Delacroix's contemporaneous detractors admitted that he was
a terrific painter with an unequaled sense of color, even though he
might have painted with a ``drunken broom.'' Those qualities shine
through still. Delacroix obviously loved his medium, and fans of
later painting from Manet to Van Gogh in which the physicality of
the pigment is not smoothed over will relish Delacroix's articulate
facture.
</P>
<P>
   Although our expectations of color largely derive from the
Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, Delacroix set the example
they sought to equal and outstrip. Intense reds, better to paint
blood, and deep blues dominate his palette, but if you look
closely, you can see how he orchestrated a full spectrum of color
across his canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Covering a concentrated period of 15 years, the exhibition is
organized by theme, and there are sections devoted to animals and
the hunt, Morocco, landscapes, still lifes, literary and
allegorical subjects and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Delacroix was a devoted observer of animals, spending hours
sketching lions, tigers and other exotic beasts at Paris' Jardin
des Plantes, and his obsession with the animal kingdom's ruling
species resulted in some of the best animal painting of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Delacroix's understanding of nature is complex and
unsentimental, and in his view, the animal world is marked by a
Darwinian battle for dominance. The titles tell the story: ``Tiger
Hunt,'' ``Arabs Stalking a Lion,'' ``Lion Stalking Its Prey,''
``Struggle Between a Lion and a Tiger,'' ``Lion Devouring a Rabbit,
``Young Woman Attacked by a Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Horses take part in this atavistic call of the wild. One of the
most dramatic paintings in the show is ``Horses Fighting in a
Stable'' (1860), in which a brown horse viciously attacks a white
one with gray markings. The horrific incident was observed by
Delacroix on his 1832 trip to Morocco, and it left a strong
impression that remained vivid nearly 30 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month trip to Morocco in 1832 was one of the deciding
events of Delacroix's life, and in his final years he came back to
impressions made then, often recorded in copious notebooks. The
Moroccan landscape with its walled cities provided him with
opportunities to paint some of his most engaging canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Delacroix painted pictures of what he saw as noble Arabs living
a life closer to that of the ancient Mediterranean world than that
by contemporary Europeans. Beneath azure skies on plains that
stretched between the glistening ocean and distant misty mountains,
they lived close to nature, their horses nearly family members.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as it might be to take his rhetoric seriously, Delacroix
painted this atmosphere convincingly. About ``Horses Coming Out of
the Sea,'' an image of a red-robed Arab leading two horses onto a
stony beach, an 1885 observer wrote, ``I do not believe that the
Impressionist school produced a more luminous morsel, one more
deeply infused with the freshness of morning, veiled in a more
transparent mist.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The least persuasive canvases here are those based on literary
themes. A great reader, Delacroix painted many pictures based on
scenes from Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Goethe, Dante and the Italian
poets Ariosto and Tasso. Today they look like curiously overwrought
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise of the exhibition might be the devotion
Delacroix, a professed agnostic, brought to religious subjects. A
number of crucifixions are included, and in this central sacrifice
of Christianity, Delacroix stripped away all superfluities. A
near-naked man, in his mind the savior of mankind, hangs on a cross
_ that is all. Profoundly moving.
</P>
<P>
   Delacroix might very well be the last artist to paint convincing
religious paintings. After him came Courbet, who sullenly said he'd
paint an angel when he saw one. But in several ways, Delacroix was
the last of one line _ and the first of the next. The exhibition
makes clear that he occupied a fulcrum position in Western art. He
inherited Rubens' and the Venetians' atmospheric color and roiling,
pulsing movement, and he passed on his love of the exotic and the
sensuous to Matisse.

TO REMOVE OLD TILE, INSERT CHISEL AND PRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am retiling around the tub and backsplash. I am wondering
how I can remove the old tiles? They are set on concrete board and
none is loose that I know of.
</P>
<P>
   GAIL RIEP, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. How easy or difficult the tiles will be to remove depends on
how they are set on the concrete board. If they are set with
adhesive, it should be easy. Insert a chisel at the edge of a tile,
tap with a hammer and it should pop off, or come off with a litle
more tapping. Now, you can scrape off any residual adhesive and put
up the new tiles with the same type of tile adhesive. If the tiles
are set with a thin-set mortar, it will be tougher. Tiles set with
thin-set on concrete board is akin to a mud job; very strong and
difficult to demolish. But you can still try the same technique as
with tiles installed with adhesive. Slip a chisel under an edge and
tap lightly. If the tile does not pop, you will have to keep
tapping and prying, which may break up the tile; then each piece
must be chiseled off. Once removed, scrape off as much of the
thin-set as possible, then install the new tiles with thin-set. You
have to scrape all the old thin-set from the concrete board so the
tiles will lie flat and even.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I inherited an antique bed, but it has no rails. Where can I
find rails?
</P>
<P>
   JOHANNA DONLON, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the Woodworkers Store; or call the catalog number,
800-279-4441.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A candle on a windowsill caused a small fire and dripped
sooty wax on a grasscloth wall, leaving a small streak of black wax
on it. How can I remove the black streak?
</P>
<P>
   CONNIE, from Milton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try scraping it with a credit card held at a slight angle.
Scrape gently to get as much off as possible. Then tape a piece of
brown paper (grocery bag) over the stain and place a warm-to-hot
iron over it; you will see the paper absorb the wax. Repeat as
necessary. Dissolve the rest of the wax, if any, with rubbing
alcohol, but test an obscure area of the grasscloth to make sure
the alcohol does not fade or bleach it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an 1/8-inch gap between my tongued-and-grooved
floorboards. I'd like to fill them, and a man suggested mixing glue
and sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   CONNIE MAGEE, Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The old-fashioned sawdust and glue just might work; the glue
may not get overly hard, and therefore might follow the natural
movement of the boards. I am skeptical, but if it's an
old-fashioned concoction it is likely to work. There is nothing
else you can put in those gaps because they are too shallow (only
1/4-inch deep) for any insertion.
</P>
<P>
   Filling them with a modern filler that hardens also won't work
because when that hard filler breaks up (and it will) it will look
a sight worse than what you have now.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have an arched wall in my shower stall and the shower head
keeps breaking up the plaster, due to thermal expansion and
contraction. I can't put a bell over it because of its arched
shape. What's a practical thing to do?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT PAYNE, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You might be able to chip out a bit of the plaster around the
shower-head pipe so that it is flat, and then the bell can fit
snugly around it. Or, chip out any broken-up plaster around the
shower-head pipe and install caulking, which will expand and
contract along with whatever else is expanding and contracting. I
have used PhenoSeal, an adhesive caulk, for many purposes and I
find it works wonderfully. It is paintable, if that is needed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We received a used refrigerator for our program, and as with
any refrigerator stored for awhile, it had an odor. How can I get
remove that odor?
</P>
<P>
   JANICE ABBATANGELO, Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Let me count the ways. There are so many of them, almost all
``home remedies,'' that is is hard to suggest just one:
</P>
<P>
   You could wash with a solution of 1 part bleach to 3 parts
water, let dry, then wash with a strong solution of baking soda and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Or, wash with white vinegar. A dish of vinegar or vanilla
extract set on the bottom will help.
</P>
<P>
   Or, put a small amount of sage in a dish and ignite it, then put
the residue in the refrigerator. After five days, wash with baking
soda and air-dry for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the odor is caused by the gaskets and door edges, so
be sure to treat those, too. Soak a ball of cotton with vanilla
extract and wipe all the gaskets and around all the doors.
</P>
<P>
   As you are doing all these things, keep the door open for good
air drying.
</P>
<P>

A GAMBLE FOR THE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Eric Brown, accused in a double murder, is set to play
a Jekyll-Hyde role in a real-life courtroom scene that could match
the high drama of the 19th century tale of good and evil trapped
within one soul.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring an insanity defense that could help his client avoid
life in prison, attorney Bernard Grossberg hopes to display
conflicting faces of the 30-year-old first-degree murder suspect,
who is charged with gunning down two gay men on a gaslit South End
street in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If Grossberg gets his way, a jury will get to see what he says
are the two sides of the Roxbury man. One is a jumpsuited suicidal
schizophrenic being held at Bridgewater State Hospital. The other
is a stable defendant in a jacket and tie, whose handshake is as
firm as his grasp of the legal hurdles he will face in court, now
that he's taking antipsychotic medicine twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that blends potential plot lines from TV's ``Law &AMP;
Order'' and ``ER,'' Grossberg last week asked a Suffolk Superior
Court judge to allow Brown to temporarily stop taking his
normalizing drug regimen so Grossberg and doctors can view _ and a
videographer can tape _ Brown in his full-blown psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using the doctors' assessments and video as evidence,
Grossberg could present an insanity defense that argues that
although a medicated Brown now is sane enough to stand trial, he
once may have been so tortured from hearing inner voices that he
couldn't keep himself from killing.
</P>
<P>
   Under Grossberg's proposal, by letting his mind be bent back to
the depths of paranoia, Brown could help set himself free from the
lifetime in prison a first-degree murder conviction would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make him mentally ill,'' Grossberg sighed at the
thought of having to manipulate his client's mind to balance the
scales of justice. ``But if he's found not guilty by reason of
insanity, he doesn't get punished _ he gets treated. Presumably he
could get better and be released. Right now, time is going by.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on Grossberg's unusual request is scheduled before
Judge Peter M. Lauriat on Dec. 10, the prelude to a full trial that
could start as early as spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth has not yet filed its response. David Meier,
chief of the Suffolk district attorney's homicide unit, this week
declined to talk specifically about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that when all the facts are presented at trial
that Mr. Brown will be held fully accountable for his conduct,''
Meier said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brown had displayed erratic behavior before he was
diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic following the slayings on
Appleton Street, according to his lawyer and family.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a lab technician at Massachusetts General Hospital
and liked to dance and play checkers after hours. But he also once
allegedly tried to run a woman over with her own car and displayed
a fascination with firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that on June 15, 1996, Brown fired a 20-gauge
shotgun into the air near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next day, prosecutors say, Brown headed for Appleton
Street, a late-night gay cruising area they say he had frequented.
</P>
<P>
   First, prosecutors say, Brown allegedly pumped two shots into
Athos Oliveira, 30, as the Somerville optometrist stood on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   As he fled, prosecutors say, Brown allegedly crossed paths with
Thomas Meyer, a 38-year-old marketing executive from San Francisco
who was in Boston for a friend's wedding. Police say Brown fired a
fatal shot into Meyer's face.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, police officers in Lincoln stopped Brown for
what they said was a routine motor vehicle violation. Inside the
van he was driving, they found a shotgun. Ballistics specialists
later matched the weapon to the shots fired.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was charged with both killings. In court papers,
prosecutors have not specified a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrest, Brown was deemed a danger to himself, and
was transferred from the Nashua Street Jail to Bridgewater State
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   There, he was prescribed an initial series of antipsychotic
drugs that didn't work, Grossberg said. Brown, he said, was distant
and spoke nonsense, unable to answer simple questions from his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a judge determined that Brown was not competent to
stand trial and ordered him back to Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, however, doctors gave Brown a new set of drugs.
Since then, Grossberg said, Brown's mind has come alive, and he has
been able to focus on his own legal matters _ including whether he
should stop taking his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a mental health supervisor at the hospital filed a
report recommending that Brown was competent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to test whether Brown was not criminally responsible
for his actions and thus a candidate for an insanity defense,
Grossberg wants to send him on a journey back through his own
psychoses, to perhaps be haunted once again by the voices only he
can hear.

THE SOUND AND FURY OF MISSISSIPPI BOOKSELLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ In the 1960s, when William Faulkner still walked
the land while Eudora Welty produced some of her finest work and
Willie Morris moved ``North Toward Home,'' their native state was
known as a place where more people wrote books than read them.
</P>
<P>
   Books in Mississippi were sold in pharmacies equipped with
rotating racks featuring Mickey Spillane thrillers, or sometimes in
department store nooks displaying Bibles and inspirational
``literature.'' But in recent years, a crop of small bookstores
catering to serious readers grew up in the state, and Mississippi's
independent booksellers now find themselves in the middle of an
escalating national feud with superstores such as Barnes &AMP; Noble,
Borders, and Books-A-Million.
</P>
<P>
   After nurturing their shops into a profitable existence, local
entrepreneurs in Mississippi and other points around the country
are struggling against chain stores offering cheaper prices. As
Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books in Oxford and president of
the American Booksellers Association says, ``In 1991, when Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Borders began to expand, there were 5,200 members of the
ABA. Today, there are 3,300.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaint is a variation of the Wal-Mart syndrome: cut-rate
behemoths drive mom-and-pop stores out of existence. But rather
than return to the days before bookstores flourished, the
independent booksellers are fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA, which represents private bookstore owners, filed an
antitrust suit against Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders last March,
charging the chains with undercutting the independent booksellers
through ``secret and illegal deals'' with publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   By obtaining ``disproportionate discounting and additional
credit'' unavailable to the independents, Howorth said, the chains
are able to offer more attractive prices. For example, Tom Wolfe's
new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' listed at $28.95, sells for only $20
at the superstores.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was exacerbated last month by revelations that
Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's biggest bookseller, planned to
purchase the country's leading wholesale distributor, Ingram Book
Group. (Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat sympathetic to the
independents, last week called for the Justice Department to
investigate the antitrust implications of the merger.)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his store overlooking the historic courthouse
square that Faulkner immortalized, Howorth said that if the Barnes
&AMP; Noble acquisition goes through, small booksellers who buy from
Ingram would be faced with ``the realistic threat of doing business
with a company showing a desire to put everyone else out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Square Books was established in 1979, the store has helped
transform downtown Oxford from a rural outpost into a cosmopolitan
center with a busy nightlife. The store is on the major league
circuit for authors promoting new books. While reluctant to divulge
his revenue, Howorth estimates that he sells an average of six
books per year for every man, woman, and child in the town of
12,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the University of Mississippi here awarded Barnes &AMP; Noble a
franchise for a campus bookstore a couple of years ago. ``I felt
betrayed by the university,'' Howorth said. As a result, he
withheld Square Book's support for an annual book conference that
draws many writers to Oxford each spring.
</P>
<P>
   After it became apparent that the campus store concentrated on
textbooks and had a minimal operation for ``trade books,'' a
designation for quality fiction and non-fiction, Howorth renewed
his support for the conference this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``after years of growth our sales have
been flat since Barnes &AMP; Noble has been here. It's hard to say
whether it's them or sales gravitating to Amazon.com,'' the
Internet outlet involved in its own advertising war with Barnes &AMP;
Noble's online ``bookstore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The independents may someday have the opportunity to develop
sales over the Internet, but not if we're obliterated from the
retail face of the earth,'' Howorth said. He added: ``All corporate
bookstores are, to one extent or another, predators.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemuria, a thriving independent book store in Jackson, Miss.,
has become a prime target for ``predatory activity,'' says its
proprietor, John Evans, who was frustrated by his inability to find
good books in his hometown and started the store more than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   After outgrowing its original site, Lemuria is now in a handsome
building just off an interstate highway. It is no coincidence,
Evans says, that Books-A-Million, a Southeastern chain selling at
cut-rate prices, set up a store across the interstate from Lemuria
a few years ago. Or that Barnes &AMP; Noble recently opened its own
store a couple of minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they try to do is to go and find a store to prey on,''
Evans said. ``There's no way I can sell books at 40 percent off.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemuria is one of 26 plaintiffs in the action against Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Borders. According to the independent booksellers'
lawsuit, ``the rapid growth of national chains, fueled by secret
and illegal deals, threatens the survival of independent bookstores
and the diversity of American bookselling.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-town enterprises such as Favorites Book Store, which
sponsors readings for children and book-signing garden parties that
have brought life to a neighborhood in Ocean Springs on the
Mississippi Gulf Coast, are in jeopardy. Marilyn Lunceford, the
store's owner, has told friends she fears her business will be
ruined by a Barnes &AMP; Noble store projected for a new mall in nearby
Gulfport.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ABA suit was filed in California, which has state
laws regarding unfair trade practices and serves as the home for
large number of independent booksellers, it has strong support from
members in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders formally responded to the suit in
July by steadfastly denying allegations of deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   The litigation is still in preliminary stages, but Howorth said
he was encouraged by a 1994 consent agreement involving the ABA,
Penguin Books, and other publishers. After the ABA complained about
unfair trade practices, the publishers agreed to pay the
booksellers $25 million.

PRINTERS MAKE THEIR MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As someone who has used laser printers for more than 15 years,
I've always looked at their less sophisticated cousins, ink jet
printers, with a good deal of suspicion and disdain. Year after
year, makers of inkjet printers have promised that their models
were just as good and just as fast as laser printers. But each time
I tried them out, I was disappointed _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Today's generation of ink jet printers is nearly as good and
nearly as fast as all but the most expensive laser printers. At the
same time, you can do much more with a typical inkjet. As a result,
I'm doing so many things with an inkjet printer that you just can't
do with a laser printer that I am hard-pressed to recommend a laser
to anyone except, perhaps, an author who needs to repeatedly print
out drafts of a 400-page manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month I've been experimenting with two
high-quality desktop printers: the Epson Stylus Color 640 and the
Lexmark 5770 Photo Jetprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Epson claims its printer has a resolution of 1440x720 dots per
inch, and prints five pages per minute. It comes with two
cartridges, one with black ink, the other with a mix of yellow,
cyan, and magenta inks, allowing you to print color photographs
with a four-color process. It is priced at $189.
</P>
<P>
   Lexmark, meanwhile, claims a resolution of 1200x1200 and eight
pages per minute print speed. It comes with a black cartridge and a
color cartridge. You can also buy a photo cartridge, which replaces
the black cartridge with black plus two colors, allowing you to
print color photographs with a six-color process. The Lexmark also
has slots on the side for flash cards for most digital cameras.
This lets you print a picture without first bringing the images
into your computer. This printer costs $315.
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, ink jet printers work by spraying a jet of
ink at the paper. The ink comes out of a nozzle that moves back and
forth across each line. Laser printers, on the other hand, are
based on xerography. A laser beam is used to control the placement
of an electric charge on a metallic drum inside the printer. The
charge then picks up tiny bits of toner, which are deposited onto
the paper and then melted into place by a high-temperature heating
element.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I've always been incredulous about inkjet printers is
that their specifications never match what I observe when I try
them out. Consider speed. Unlike a laser printer, which prints at a
fairly constant rate regardless of what is being printed, the
performance of inkjets slow down when the page is text heavy. I
tried printing out pages from a new book that I'm writing and found
that the Epson would only print two pages per minute, while the
Lexmark printed between three and four. Those speeds go down
considerably, of course, when you print a full-color page in
photographic quality: expect to spend three to six minutes per page
when you start stamping out copies of 8x10 photographs. And while
these printers may have truly phenomenal clarity, the resolution
quoted is the resolution for a single dot of color. In order to
create a full-color photograph you need to blend many dots together
to form each full-color pixel, making the perceived resolution
somewhat less than is promised.
</P>
<P>
   But when I set my moral outrage aside and look at the printouts
from these devices, I am stunned. Although there are occasional
horizontal streaks and smudges in the black-and-white text from
dirt and dust on the print head, especially when you are printing
on plain paper, it's pretty hard to distinguish the print of the
Lexmark from the print of my Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5P, which
costs $800.
</P>
<P>
   The Epson fares a little poorer in a side-by-side comparison
test, but it's still completely usable for both business and
personal correspondence. Put specially coated inkjet paper into
these printers and they can actually turn the tables on the laser
with print that is just as sharp, but with many tricks that a laser
printer simply can't play.
</P>
<P>
   Print a color photograph on glossy paper and you'll see an image
that is nothing short of spectacular. Indeed, the only problem with
printing photos with these printers is getting the digitized image
in the first place: anything that you download from the Web or snap
with a low-resolution digital camera will look like so many pixels
when you print it on 8x11 paper. If you are printing a JPEG file, a
common stardard for compressing images, be sure that you get one
that is at least 200 kilobytes in size or you won't be happy with
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've got these printers connected to my computers, I'm
discovering lots of other uses for printing with color. When I'm
traveling someplace new, I'll get a map from the Internet and print
it for myself in full-color. I've also started printing my
letterhead and envelopes with a color logo and return address. I've
even made a letter head file with a Microsoft Word template file,
so that I can print the letterhead along with my correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   For more ideas, just go to a large stationery supply store or a
computer store and you'll find an astonishingly wide variety of
inkjet-ready office supplies. You can get labels for envelopes,
floppy disks, CDROMs, and even Zip cartridges. There are overhead
transparencies. There are more than a dozen different grades of
photo-quality glossy paper, including thick stock that looks just
as good as the stuff that comes back from the photo lab. And there
are postcards and greeting cards that are inkjet-ready for your
personal message.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried paper from Epson, H-P, Lexmark, Avery, and others.
Overall, I haven't seen any problems in putting HP paper into the
Epson printer or Epson paper into the Lexmark. I've even tried
doing some two-sided printing for some brochures that I printed for
a friend's company. They came out pretty well with every paper I
tried except the Great White Recycled Content Paper that I picked
up at Staples. Great White worked great on the front page, but
printing on the back with my inkjet smeared.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing that I've learned on my printing
endeavors is that you won't get good results unless you set the
paper type before you go to print something. Setting the paper type
is quite easy: in Windows 95, just hit the roperties button before
you hit the OK button on the Print panel. On a Mac you can hit a
similar button that is labeled Options.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the paper type tells the printer how much ink to send
through the nozzles and gives it instructions for manipulating the
paper feed rollers. Set it wrong and you won't be happy with the
results.

HOLLYWOOD'S $17 MILLION WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Julia Roberts, Susan
Sarandon, Liam Aiken and Jena Malone in ``Stepmom.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``I don't want to be known as Hollywood's $17 million woman,''
says Julia Roberts, ``although I've been known as worse things.
 &HT;    ``I'd prefer to be known as the 'great friend woman,' 'the great
actress woman' _ or the 'nice legs woman.' Now that would be OK.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the 31-year-old Roberts is picking up that fat
paycheck for the film she's currently shooting _ reuniting with her
``Pretty Woman'' co-star Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall
in ``Runaway Bride.''
 &HT;    She's earning considerably less for playing the title role
opposite Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris in ``Stepmom'' (opening Dec.
25), although she and Sarandon could clean up nicely if the film
turns out to be a box office smash because they were producers on
the film.
 &HT;    In ``Stepmom,'' Sarandon plays Jackie, whose ex-husband (Harris)
has married Isabel, a vain, ambitious fashion photographer played
by Roberts. Not surprisingly neither Sarandon nor her two young
children are wild about their father's new spouse.
 &HT;    Things change, however, when Jackie learns she is dying. At
first Isabel is less than thrilled when she realizes she's
inheriting a family. She has to learn to change her priorities and
win the love and trust of the ailing Sarandon and her young
children if she is to grow into the stepmom role.
 &HT;    Roberts, looking relaxed with her hair down to her shoulders and
dressed in sweater and slacks, was in obvious good humor she showed
up at New York's Waldorf-Astoria to talk her role, which she calls
the most mature of her career.
 &HT;    Roberts, without children of her own, still found herself in
sympathy with Isabel since the character's life was much like that
of a career-driven actress.
 &HT;    ``Isabel says she never wanted to be a mom and yet finds herself
struggling to cope with being a surrogate parent--an unwanted
stepparent,'' says Roberts. ``Given her age she's more interested
in her career than stuck with a family. I can relate to that. And
it's a no-win situation because Jackie is the perfect mother and
Isabel can only come off a poor second when she tries to become a
parent.''
 &HT;    Should Roberts herself decide to become a parent, she says she
is certainly not about to become a stay-at-home.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand this one-versus-the-other business,
especially in this generation. Would any of us be here as capable
human beings if our parents didn't work? My mother always worked. I
know people talk as if this work I do would make it more difficult.
I have no children so maybe I'm talking out of the side of my head,
but it seems to me that you work for four months and then you don't
work for like nine months. That's a lot of kid time.''
 &HT;    And she's the first to admit that the kind of money her
star-wattage commands would pay for a lot of mother's helpers. Now
that she's become Hollywood's highest paid female star, however,
the actress insists getting paid big bucks is the last thing she
thinks about.
 &HT;    ``I love what I do and I'd do it for free,'' she says. ``I'm not
going to perform better if I get paid more or less. It's not pound
for pound--where you only pay for the legs or the smile or the big
hair. That's not how it works. When you're up at 4 a.m. and out in
a bikini and it's 30 degrees outside--it doesn't matter how much
they're paying you. At that moment you still think it's not
enough.''
 &HT;    Roberts says she's no longer the callow, vulnerable 20-something
star whose personal life has been chronicled to the point of
exhaustion since she first burst on the scene in ``Mystic Pizza''
(1988), ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989) and then as a star in ``Pretty
Woman'' (1990).
 &HT;    ```Stepmom' is first real-life grown-up part that deals with
real complex issues and problems I've ever done. It's about kids,
husband, job, not about makeup and wardrobe. I couldn't have done
it five years ago--it wouldn't have had the same value to me.''
 &HT;    Besides teaming up with Gere again she has just finished
``Notting Hill,'' shot in London, in which she gets to romance Hugh
Grant for writer Richard Curtis who wrote ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.''
 &HT;    And her career is riding high again after a series of flop
movies like Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996),
Robert Altman's ``Ready to Wear'' (1994), the horror film ``Mary
Reilly'' (1996) and ``The Conspiracy Theory'' (1997) opposite Mel
Gibson.
 &HT;    Her private life reads like a five-reeler: In l991 she broke off
her engagement with Kiefer Sutherland three days before the
wedding. In l993 she married singer Lyle Lovett but they divorced
21 months later. In between were relationships with Dylan McDermot,
Liam Neeson, Jason Patric and New York gym-owner Pat Manocchia.
 &HT;    She insists her relationship with TV actor Benjamin Bratt (``Law
and Order'') is still on despite published reports to the contrary.
But she says, ``I'm not getting married any time soon.''
 &HT;    Bratt has lasted more than a year on her arm but she still lives
alone in a New York apartment not far from her sister Lisa who is
two years older. (Roberts also has an older brother, actor Eric
Roberts.)
 &HT;    In the long-awaited reunion with Gere she plays a woman who goes
from man to man. Is the role based on her own penchant for skipping
from boyfriend to boyfriend?
 &HT;    She good naturedly handles the question: ``Of course not, '' she
says. ``The movie is fiction.''
 &HT;    But there's no doubt she's delighted to be back with her
``Pretty Woman'' star, and she adores the film's director,
Marshall.
 &HT;    ``The whole film has been a gas,'' she says. ``Garry is
fantastic and gets me to go out on a limb and do things I wouldn't
do for other directors. I know I can trust him. On `Pretty Woman'
he had me do something I was scared about. I thought I'd humiliate
myself forever but when I saw the scene in the finished movie with
an audience, people were peeing laughing.''
 &HT;    Since shooting ``Stepmom'' she has become bosom buddies with
co-star Sarandon, who has a family with actor-director Tim Robbins:
``Susan and Tim are my absolute idols,'' says Roberts. ``Some day I
would like to have the kind of career that Susan has and the kind
of relationship with a man that she has with Tim.''

FOR IBM, YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you pay $2,300 for a home computer, when you can easily
buy two for that price?
</P>
<P>
   The computer is made by IBM Corp, not some maker of cut-rate
clones. It's got an Intel microprocessor, a big hard drive and lots
of memory. And not only does the system include a color monitor,
IBM throws in a computer desk and chair, ergonomically designed for
comfort and easy operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a deal? Okay, but there is a catch. The IBM Young
Explorer computer isn't for Mom or Dad or even Big Sister. This
pricey new computer was designed in cooperation with Little Tykes
Co., the popular maker of toy furniture for toddlers, and is
intended for children aged 4 through 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer isn't a family computer _ it's a kid's
computer, with every feature tailored to a preschooler's idea of
comfort. IBM says it's the first machine of its kind, created for
use in day care centers. But when hundreds of parents began asking
where they could buy one to use at home, IBM executive Michele
Riggs decided it was time to take a gamble, and begin selling Young
Explorer at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs thinks Young Explorer is the product many American
children and their parents have been waiting for. ``We are
responsible for insuring that our kids have the right tools so they
can learn for the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs herself is a mother of two. Her official title _ ``market
segment manager for moms and dads with kids at home'' _ shows how
far IBM has moved from its blue-suited Fortune 500 past in an
effort to tap the massive consumer technology market.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer isn't your typical desktop computer. Indeed,
it's an entire desk. A 14-inch color monitor peeks out of a tough
plastic housing, and the keyboard is a part of the desk itself.
Unlike standard keyboards that can easily be ruined by spilled milk
and cookie crumbs, the Young Explorer uses a membrane-type keyboard
permanently sealed under thick plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The tough but friendly design was tailored to the needs of Young
Explorer's original target market _ schools and day care centers,
where the machines would regularly receive harsh treatment from
dozens of very low-tech children. Field testing even led IBM and
Little Tykes to modify the plastic seat, when they found that
toddlers view computing as a social activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it a bench so it can accomodate two kids,'' Riggs
said. And instead of a modem for dialing onto the Internet, each
unit comes with a built-in Ethernet adapter, for connection to a
school's internal computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Explorer has been available since April to schools and
day care centers, but IBM executives soon got word that teachers
and kids weren't the only ones who liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we rolled this product out, we were getting unbelievable
calls from parents saying, `We want this product. I'll write you a
check right now.' '' The same thing happened this fall, when a
Young Explorer unit was exhibited for two weeks at the Oklahoma
State Fair.
</P>
<P>
   IBM decided to begin selling the Young Explorer at retail this
week. ``We are responding to our customers,'' said Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far too early to know whether all the tirekickers will
really break out their checkbooks for computer, which is available
by mail order directly from IBM and from Little Tykes.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based children's software expert Cathy Miranker
thinks the Young Explorer is fine for schools and day care centers.
But she's skeptical about its value in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you happen to have septuplets or something, you probably
want some special computer equipment,'' said Miranker, author of
Great Software for Kids and Parents, part of the popular ``For
Dummies'' book series. ``But I don't see any pressing need for this
kind of equipment, other than its physical charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranker said that most households could make do with a cheaper
standard computer equipped with a special kiddie keyboard and
mouse. ``Kids are very adaptable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Miranker fears that parents who have just parted
with $2,300 may try to get their money's worth by encouraging small
children to spend too much time on the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to their parking their kids in front of the
computer the same way parents park their kids in front of the TV,''
Miranker said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Riggs said she doesn't want that to happen either.
``Nothing, absolutely nothing, should be used as a babysitting
tool,'' she warned. The Young Explorer isn't supposed to be a
substitute for ``Rugrats'' reruns, but a high-tech head start for
curious kids and ambitious parents.

YOUNG UNLIKELY CANDIDATES FOR REPETITIVE STRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children who play on new kiddie computers are unlikely to suffer
repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome because,
unlike adults, they don't usually sit still at a computer hour
after hour, day in and day out.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the prediction of Robert Follansbee, director of
the computer learning program in the communication enhancement
center at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence that kids using video games get some
RSI,'' he says, referring to repetitive strain injury, but ``that's
with a huge amount of use. It seems unlikely that most kids would
use a computer intensively enough to develop'' the problems that
adults or college students do. ``Many difficulties that adults get
come from massive amounts of touch typing day after day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't use the keyboard that way. They type slower
and not for long periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Children also tend not to stay seated in the same position for
hours on end the way adults do. Instead, they get up and down and
move around, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether small children would be better off doing something other
than using computers is another question, and one for which there
are no clear answers yet because computers designed for children
are so new.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has no guidelines for
computer use among small children. It does say, however, that ``the
amount of time that a child spends watching TV is a major concern.
If your child spends three to four hours a day watching TV, then
time for other activities is limited.'' The academy advises
limiting children's screen time _ including video games _ to less

THINK SMALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're working up a gearhead's gift list, think small. There
are a lot of cute little tech devices on the market in time for
Christmas. These lightweight gadgets will fit nicely in a stocking
or a shirt pocket, while being powerful enough to tempt many
business travelers to leave the laptop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Electronics has freshened up an old favorite, the Rex
shirt-pocket databank. I wrote about the original version about a
year ago, when it accompanied me to the Comdex computer show in Las
Vegas. With a Rex, I had all my phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
and appointments stored in a device about as thick as three credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex was touted as an alternative to the larger and more
expensive 3Com Palm Pilot. But the Palm Pilot lets you punch in new
information by touching the screen with a pen. To add new names or
memos to the Rex, you had to plug it into a full-fledged computer.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Rex Pro features a clever system for scheduling new
appointments or typing in contact data. You just use the six tiny
buttons along the right edge of the device.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the data input button on the Rex Pro opens a menu of
tasks. Say you want a reminder to call somebody. Click the ``To
Do'' command, which opens yet another menu. Click ``Call.'' Still
another menu appears, and so on. If the person you want to call is
already in the Rex address book, it takes just a few clicks to
create your appointment. The Rex even beeps to remind you.
</P>
<P>
   What if the name isn't in the address book? With the old Rex,
you'd be out of luck. But the new version can display a menu of
letters and numbers, and will let you type in new data.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex Pro lists for $239, but CompUSA sells it on the Net for
$199.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the Rex was a reliable gadget, but I had my doubts about
another trinket that recently slid over my transom. I think it was
the suction cup that worried me. It's tucked away on the underside
of the JVC HC-E100 Portable E-Mail Device, and it brought back
memories of computing in the Jurassic era.
</P>
<P>
   Before RJ-11 phone jacks became commonplace, people connected
computers to phone lines with acoustic couplers _ big rubber
suction cups that you wrapped around the mouthpiece and earpiece of
a standard telephone. The portable kind, long used by journalists,
were heavy, bulky, and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   So why is somebody making a device that uses an acoustic coupler
to check e-mail? Because it'll work with practically any phone on
earth. And because JVC uses one that's simple and lightweight. Just
dial an 800 number to reach the PocketMail e-mail service, then
press the JVC device against the phone receiver. Your e-mail is
quickly loaded into a box slightly larger than a Walkman. If you
can stand the cramped keyboard, you can pound out a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the JVC e-mail device against the phone is clumsy, but
unless you've got hundreds of messages, you'll be done in a couple
of minutes. For maximum speed, you can download only the title of
each message. Then you can look them over and dial up again to get
just the messages that matter. The devices even send faxes, for 25
cents per page inside the United States and $1 everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't try the JVC device with a cell phone. PocketScience
says it'll work with analog phones, but not the new digital ones,
including PCS phones. They're working on upgraded software to solve
that problem.
</P>
<P>
   PocketMail provides you with an e-mail account, but the service
can also check three outside mailboxes, including your company
e-mail box or even your America Online account. But for some odd
reason, PocketMail only checks these other mailboxes once an hour,
rather than doing it whenever the customer dials in. So if someone
sends you mail one minute after PocketMail's hourly update, you'll
wait 59 minutes to see it. Anybody willing to wait that long
doesn't need PocketMail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is an impressive gadget _ and cheap. At the
PocketMail site (http://www.pocketmail.com) you can order the JVC
e-mail device for $100. Then you pay $99.95 a year or $9.95 a month
for a PocketMail e-mail account. Then you can place it under the
Christmas tree and win the eternal gratitude of some poor
laptop-lugger who hasn't walked upright through an airport since
1989.

   &UR; Brain data echoes `first do no harm'
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A cerebral aneurysm, sometimes called a ``time bomb in the
brain,'' presents one of the most difficult medical questions:
whether to operate before it ruptures or to leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   When aneurysms, or the ballooning of weak spots in blood
vessels, rupture suddenly, they are often fatal or severely
damaging to the brain. But the risks of surgery are also
significant. A study suggests that many asymptomatic brain
aneurysms _ especially smaller ones _ have a low risk of rupture,
and doing nothing may be best.
</P>
<P>
   A report in The New England Journal of Medicine on a sample of
2,621 patients in the United States, Canada, and Europe concludes
that the risks of surgery outweigh the benefits in some people who
have brain aneurysms less than 10 millimeters (a bit less than half
an inch) in diameter. For those who have had previous bleeding in
the brain, the risk of another aneurysm bursting is higher and may
be a reason for preventive surgery, said the investigators, led by
Dr. David O. Wiebers at the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   More and more aneurysms are being found incidentally during
brain scans, and are posing dilemmas, said Dr. John Marler, a
neurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke, who supervised the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, he said in an interview, ``will come as a
tremendous relief to patients and physicians advising them''
because they provide more information on which to base a decision.

</P>
<P>
   Cognitive deficits caused by environmental lead in early
childhood are largely irreversible, with children failing to
improve very much even when the exposure to lead is reduced,
according to a study from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of a report in the Journal of the American Medical
Association said children in families living near a lead smelter in
Port Pirie, South Australia, have been tested for lead in their
blood and monitored for cognitive performance beginning in 1979. In
general, the lead levels in children's blood declined substantially
after age 2, though some children still had high levels at 11 to
13, said the researchers from the Queensland University of
Technology in Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   The cognitive scores of children who had the biggest drop in
lead exposure were only slightly better than those of children
whose blood lead concentration declined the least, said the
authors, suggesting the cognitive damage was largely irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, the authors wrote, make it ``increasingly
important'' to reduce exposure to lead from an early age.

   &UR; Tumor-starving drug to be tested

</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute has agreed to test a drug made
from shark cartilage that starves tumors of their blood supply, and
which is considered an alternative or complementary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known as AE-941/Neovastat, will be given in
combination with radiation and chemotherapy to more than 250
patients with inoperable lung cancer, said Dr. James Pluda, a
research official at the institute, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is made by Aeterna Laboratories Inc. of Sainte-Foy,
Quebec, and has previously been tested in animals and in patients
with cancer in advanced stages.
</P>
<P>
   Pluda said that part of the funding for the trial comes from the
National Institutes of Health's Center for Alternative Medicine.
The hope, he said, is that the drug _ one of a promising category
of agents called angiogenesis inhibitors because they block blood
vessel growth _ will work in combination with conventional
treatments to prolong patients' survival.

COMPUTING VISIONARY'S IDEA CHANGED THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an unimposing little handcarved wooden box on wheels,
looking more like a simple toy than like an epochal invention that
would change the world. But it was, and it did.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas Engelbart unveiled the first computer mouse to the
world at a computing conference 30 years ago this week, he thought
it would catch fire and change the face of computing in short
order. But to his surprise it took more than 16 years before a
commercial version reached the marketplace, with the introduction
of the Macintosh computer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's hard to find a computer that doesn't come with a
mouse, or one of its offspring (such as trackballs or touch pads),
as standard equipment. The transformation that was revealed that
day laid the groundwork for the whole computer revolution and made
possible an industry that today generates hundreds of billions of
dollars a year in revenues. For his trouble, Engelbart _ who holds
the patent for the mouse _ eventually was paid $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1968 demonstration of Engelbart's work completely blew
people away,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the
Future at Stanford University _ the campus where Engelbart made his
pioneering developments in the 1960s. ``It was like a UFO landing
on the White House lawn,'' Saffo said. ``Nothing has been the same
since in computing.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the mouse itself, of course. What Engelbart was
demonstrating at the Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco on
Dec. 9, 1968, was a whole new approach to what computers were and
how they could be used. On that December day, Engelbart unveiled a
vision that was the first public marriage of ``personal'' with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, computers were huge, expensive and impersonal
number-crunching machines. For the most part, they had no screens
or keyboards and were not too comfortable working with words, and
even less so with pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology was there, and Engelbart saw the potential.
As he described it in a recent interview, by then he had already
been working with computers for 17 years, and had figured out _ as
few others had _ that ``personally interacting with a computer is
going to be a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was prescient thinking in an era when computer pricetags
were in the millions, the hardware would fill large,
climate-controlled rooms, and even professional programmers mostly
interacted with a computer by handing a pile of punchcards to a
computer operator, who would feed the cards in, wait for the
computer to carry out its work, collect its output from a printer
and hand it back to the programmer hours, or even days, later. To
most people at that time, the notion of ``personally interacting''
with computers made as much sense as thinking that average people
could ``interact'' with a nuclear reactor or a battleship.
</P>
<P>
   First steps
</P>
<P>
   But Engelbart saw far beyond that, and set the stage for the
revolution to come. He saw that computers had the power to become
more than just the overgrown calculators they were at the time.
They could become, he realized, a way of expanding and enhancing
the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward that was to represent information in a
visual way, on a television screen. Words, pictures and commands
(menus) could all be displayed on the same screen, and could be
manipulated by controlling a moving pointer, or cursor, on that
screen. But then came the big question: How could you best control
the movements of that cursor?
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart and his Stanford Research Institute team tried a
variety of devices, but the breakthrough came when Engelbart was
``drawing doodles during a boring meeting. That ended up being the
principle for the first mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The system he developed also included the concept of the
hyperlink _ now widely familiar as the clickable links found on
Internet pages, which connect you to another page or another site
that contains additional information about the word or phrase that
was clicked on. And it included ``windows'' on the screen that
provided views of different kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Those concepts were further developed during the 1970s by
another group in the same town: the Palo Alto Research Center of
Xerox Corp., which developed the first truly ``personal'' computer
_ but never brought it to market. It was there that Steven Jobs saw
the system demonstrated, and incorporated the basic concepts into
the Apple Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate these ideas to a packed audience of 2,300 at the
1968 conference, Engelbart and his team had set up a large work
station at the auditorium, connected by special phone lines to a
computer at Stanford. ``It was a real gamble,'' Engelbart says.
``We had a lot of expensive hardware and software to work the
presentation. If at any time in that hour-and-a-half it had
crashed, we would have been left waving our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a further gamble, he said, because the people paying
for the work _ the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration _
didn't even know about the unauthorized demo. If it had crashed,
``people would have been upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of the future of computing was right there that day.
Engelbart himself _ a modest and unassuming man, now 73 _ admits
that ``the whole thing had lots of revolutionary aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Others put it more strongly. ``Engelbart's demonstration that
year was a watershed that fundamentally changed the course of the
computing revolution, contributing not only ideas, but also many of
the people who would later build the systems we use today,'' said
Stanford librarian Michael Keller.
</P>
<P>
   In honor of the thirtieth anniversary of that watershed event,
Stanford will hold a daylong symposium called ``Engelbart's
Unfinished Revolution'' this week, featuring many of the leaders of
today's computer industry. Some of the ideas demonstrated that day,
as the symposium's title implies, are still awaiting
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   A long way to go
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart sees the computer revolution as a towering mountain,
and he says we may be about 20 percent of the way up it so far. He
is concentrating on the way ahead, not what's happened so far. He
sees computers as a way for humans to gain ``collective IQ,
knowledge management. It portends a very significant potential for
society,'' where instead of just helping people do the things they
did already, computers will make it possible to do things that
could never even have been imagined before.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, he says, ``I think we can start collectively tackling
large issues in a way that we can't today. I'm still trying to get
people to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelbart himself never got rich from his vision, as so many
lesser innovators did. But he has found himself a comfortable home
for his own research. Back in the early 1980s, a company called
Logitech, which has since become the world's leading maker of mice
(they are about to ship their 200 millionth mouse) decided to
provide Engelbart with office space and resources to continue his
work. He has been working at Logitech's headquarters in Fremont,
Calif., ever since, though he is not on the company's payroll,
preferring the independence of his own nonprofit foundation, the
Bootstrap Alliance. He is deeply grateful for Logitech's help:
``It's been a huge thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1967, Englebart and the Stanford Research Institute were
granted a patent on the mouse _ but not on other elements of the
system, such as windows and hypertext. Those were software, and at
the time only hardware could be patented.
</P>
<P>
   But patents only last for 17 years _ exactly how long it took
for his device to become a commercial product. In any case,
Stanford owned the rights to the invention, under an arrangement
that was standard practice at the time. Engelbart was not legally
entitled to any royalties, even if there had been any.
</P>
<P>
   But he did get something for it. Several years ago, Stanford
``did give me a $10,000 check,'' Engelbart said _ and then, without
a trace of irony, he added, ``which was nice of them. They didn't
have to.''

LOOKING FOR LESSONS IN THE HUFFINGTONN PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere, there's a moral to this story.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, pundit Arianna Huffington wrote a column in which she
decried the media's interest in the life of the loins. Fuming that
ABC's Diane Sawyer had quizzed Kenneth Starr about his sex life on
``20/20,'' Huffington wrote, ``We are clearly not going to be able
to stop the media from asking inappropriate questions about the sex
lives of public figures. So it's up to the figures themselves to
stop answering them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three days later, The Washington Post broke the news that
Huffington's ex-husband Michael had answered one of those questions
in the January issue of Esquire. In an interview with David Brock _
a journalist who came out of the closet in a 1994 interview with
the Post _ Huffington, who as a conservative Republican lost a 1994
California Senate race, acknowledged his homosexuality after
decades of personal turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington ``wants you to know that all the other things you may
know him for _ getting a Harvard MBA . . . being a
multimillionaire, marrying Arianna Stassinopoulos, serving in
Congress, running for the Senate _ pale in comparison with the
thing he's doing right now,'' writes Brock. Brock knows about such
epiphanies. Not only did he publicly announce his homosexuality.
Earlier this year, the one-time Clinton-basher who first unearthed
Paula Jones in an American Spectator story, apologized for invading
the president's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only strange twist. In the January Esquire
story, Brock says a deeply unhappy Huffington actually wanted to
lose his 1994 Senate challenge to Democrat Dianne Fienstein _ a
strange race in which he spent nearly $30 million of his own money
and was widely dismissed as an enigmatic empty suit being
manipulated by Arianna, his Svengali wife. While Arianna eagerly
courted attention in the campaign, Michael ducked for cover _ and
paid the price. The American Journalism Review concluded that ``Not
Richard Nixon, not even Dan Quayle was pummeled by the press the
way Rep. Michael Huffington was.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, after word of Huffington's disclosures, the
San Jose Mercury News ran a story saying rumors of his sexuality
were well-known within journalistic and political circles back in
1994. Why didn't word seep out then? ``Lack of relevance,
professional restraint and in the end, stonewalling from the
candidate himself,'' said the Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   Arianna has a point in her Dec. 3 column. We have clumsily
trespassed on the boundary between public figures and private
lives. And the press's decision not to go with the 1994 Huffington
rumors seems a rare nod to their better angels.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of this week's events, perhaps Huffington would
have been better off confessing to Brock five years ago. It would
have saved him considerable personal anguish, $30 million, and the
nastiest press pounding in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who looked at me (strangely) when I
started this,'' says Tripp Jones. And with good reason. The
executive director of the nonpartisan think tank, MassInc. bucked a
tidal wave of conventional wisdom when he began publishing
CommonWealth magazine in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when public interest in government is noticeably
waning, CommonWealth bills itself as the magazine of ``politics,
ideas and civic life in Massachusetts.'' (In the recent past, two
other local political journals _ Otherwise and Beacon Hill _ have
gone belly up.) In this age of mega-media conglomerates, the
quarterly periodical has an annual budget of about $250,000. And
the magazine's motto as espoused by editor Dave Denison _ ``We will
print nothing stupid'' _ doesn't quite have that austere New York
Timesian ring.
</P>
<P>
   But with 10 issues under its belt, an impressive list of
sponsors from Bell Atlantic to the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, a
masthead that includes Nieman Foundation curator Bill Kovach and
former Globe editor Tom Winship as advisers, and a savvy
sensibility for mixing policy and personality (such disparate
luminaries as Mo Vaughn and Tommy Finneran have graced its cover),
CommonWealth is a legitmate good news story.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to Dennison, who is attempting a feat
that has eluded most of our political leaders _ convincing citizens
that ``there are real connections between what happens in the
public sphere and what happens in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The current issue reflects CommonWealth's quirky recipe for
readability. Throw in a helping of serious policy: a cover story on
how the ``new urbanism'' _ a concept for constructing communities
to physically enhance neighborhood empowerment and interaction _ is
being tried in places like Mashpee and Holyoke. Add a smidgeon of
spice: a provocative, if self-serving piece on the local media's
failings in covering state government. And bring out the dessert: a
engagingly voyeuristic feature matching local millionaires to their
mansions. (The winner is former Continental Cablevision CEO Amos
Hostetter Jr. who resides in a $1.87 million Louisburg Square
townhouse.)
</P>
<P>
   Right now, CommonWealth is more inside baseball than household
word, with nearly 90 percent of its 6,500 copies mailed to a target
audience of activists, pols, and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you run into people who haven't heard of
CommonWealth and that's frustrating,'' says associate editor Carol
Gerwin. It deserves better than to be a well-kept secret.

DIARY OF THE `SCHINDLER OF NANKING'

THE GOOD MAN OF NANKING 
The Diaries of John Rabe 
Edited by John Wickert; translated, from the German, by John E.
Woods 
Knopf, 294 pp., illustrated, $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As conquering Japanese troops swept down on the Chinese capital
city of Nanking in September 1937, every person who could do so
fled _ Chinese officials, professionals, businessmen, foreign
diplomats. Everyone, that is, except for the poor, and a handful of
Western businessmen and missionaries who remained behind to protect
and care for those who could not flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rich are fleeing, the poor must remain behind'' in grave
danger ``of being slaughtered in great numbers,'' wrote German
businessman John Rabe in his diary. ``Shouldn't one make an attempt
to help them? Save a few at least?'' Rabe did stay, and did save
many more than a few from the horrific event that is known as ``the
rape of Nanking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe's diaries, in which he recorded in vivid detail the horror
that took the lives of at least 260,000 people, were a major source
for Iris Chang's 1997 bestseller, ``The Rape of Nanking,'' in which
she calls Rabe ``the Oscar Schindler of Nanking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe was an ``old China hand'' in 1937, having ``gone out'' (as
they used to say) in 1909 as a representative of the German
manufacturing firm, Siemens. Like many expatriates of his day, Rabe
never learned Chinese but studied the culture and collected its
art. He was recalled to Germany in 1938 after the worst was over in
Nanking and died in 1950. The editor had met Rabe in Nanking in
1936 and was later Germany's ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries are of primary interest for their eyewitness account
of the Japanese terror. Rabe tells of driving through the streets
and seeing the decomposing bodies being ravaged by dogs. He tells
of looting by Japanese soldiers, often as their officers looked on.
And he records the literal ``rape of Nanking.'' ``You can't breathe
for sheer revulsion,'' he writes, ``when you keep finding the
bodies'' of women who had been raped, multilated, and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these events were also reported by the few foreign
journalists allowed to remain in Nanking, but Rabe is the principal
witness for the efforts that he organized to protect Chinese
civilians. The major effort being the establishment of a safety
zone in which at one time or another some 250,000 Chinese were
protected, fed, and housed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just received a Christmas present better than any I could
have wished for,'' he wrote on Dec. 26. ``I have been given 600
human lives'' _ men who were to have been shot as suspected
ex-Chinese soldiers but for whom Rabe was able to secure refugee
status.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly but movingly, the diaries are also revealing of the
thoughts of a rather ordinary man caught up in horrifying events.
``If I were to write that I was not afraid, I'd be lying.'' But
fear, he writes, ``is there to be conquered.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe also records events that will strike the reader as nothing
less than bizarre. Rabe had great hopes that Hitler would intervene
with the Japanese to stop the killing. But while those hopes were
unfounded, Rabe did flash his swastika armband at Japanese soldiers
when the occasion demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising were the relations with Japanese officials.
Just four days after Rabe records with revulsion that ``the body of
that Chinese soldier shot while tied to a bamboo sofa is still
lying out in the street,'' he reports attending a dinner at the
Japanese Embassy along with eight other members of the
international committee that operated the security zone. It ``went
off without incident,'' he reports.
</P>
<P>
   And amid the horror, he finds the macabre. The Japanese ``have
come up with the fabulous idea of erecting a military bordello,''
he writes with a note of sarcasm. ``With hands clenched in
horror,'' Minnie Vautrin, an American woman member of his
committee, ``is forced to watch'' as Japanese force their way into
the assembly hall of the Ginling Girls College (where just 10 days
before some 100 young women had been raped). But ``lo and
behold!,'' a number of young women step forward. ``Evidently former
prostitutes, who are not at all sad to find work in a new bordello.
Minnie is speechless!''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, John Rabe's diaries _ and the letters and reports that
he included in them _ are primary source materials for the history
of World War II. But they are equally important as a document of
the power of the human will.
</P>
<P>
   On a day after he had heard ``thunder of cannons, rifle and
machine-gun fire'' all night long, Rabe reports that an American
missionary was reluctant to open a Red Cross station without
approval from the Red Cross. ``What a shame!'' he writes. ``In his
shoes I wouldn't think twice. If you can do some good, why
hesitate?'' A quarter-million Chinese survived the horror of
Nanking because John Rabe didn't hesitate to act.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever wished you could hide inside a cubby at your
child's preschool and spy for a morning, just to make sure teachers
aren't casting spells on the kids? What else, after all, could
explain why teachers are able to bring children back into the fold
calmly and quietly, without loss of self-esteem or a power
struggle, while at home we back ourselves into corners, raise our
voices, and say things we regret?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, preschool teachers do work a kind of magic. First,
they create an environment that is totally child-centered:
Everything a 3- or 4-year-old can reach is not only safe for her to
use but intended to bring her enjoyment. Secondly, they focus
entirely on the children: With no dinner to cook or laundry to
fold, teachers have no distractions. Unfortunately, even if we
could create the same environment at home right down to the red rug
for circle time, even if we could free ourselves of other
responsibilities, it wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What teachers have that parents tend not to have is a
repertoire of strategies to head off power struggles,'' says early
childhood educator Ellen Galinsky. Power struggles are anathema to
preschool teachers and should be to us, too. ``As soon as you dig
your heels in about how something has to happen, you take away
what's most important to a preschool- &QC; 
age child: the ability to be autonomous, powerful, and strong, to
do things himself,'' says Galinsky. She is president of Families
and Work Institute in Manhattan and co-author of ``The Preschool
Years'' (Ballantine Books).
</P>
<P>
   It's not that parents don't have coping mechanisms; the problem
is we often inadvertently feed into a power struggle. To ensure
success, she says, strategies need to be developmentally
appropriate, tailored to the 3- and 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Pedrini, director of the Sunshine Nursery School in
Arlington, Mass., says, ``You'll never see a good preschool teacher
issuing loud commands or scolding, because that doesn't make a
child feel good, and feeling good is what leads to autonomy.''
You'll also rarely see a timeout chair in a quality preschool; in a
classroom setting, it's shaming.
</P>
<P>
   So what should we do?
</P>
<P>
   We asked directors of some of the area's leading preschools to
share their strategies:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Offer choices
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This sounds simple but it backfires for parents if we let it
drift into negotiation, says Pedrini. Negotiation gives a
preschooler too much room to move around in, too much power. ``It
creates anxiety,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Offer a preschooler no more than three options; anything more is
overwhelming. When choices are contained, a child accepts the
boundaries and makes a selection. If he begins to negotiate _ ``How
'bout the cookie before dinner?'' _ stay on track: ``That isn't one
of the choices.'' Calmly repeat what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Early childhood educator Janet Zeller, director of the Tufts
University Educational Day Care Center, says choices work well
because they empower a child and defuse the issue at the same time.
``When you tell him, `You can take the bath before we read a story
or after,' he's in control of something desirable, the story, but
not about what he doesn't want to do, which is the bath,'' she
says. ``It allows him to save face.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Say what you want, not what you don't want
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sentences that begin, ``If you don't,'' tend to get us in
trouble because what follows is typically a threat, says early
childhood educator Judith T. Wagner: `` `If you don't pick up your
toys, then you can't watch the video.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's as if a preschooler has a button set to automatically
respond negatively to that kind of language. ``Reacting against it
is one of the ways they separate,'' says Wagner, who is a professor
of education and child development at Whittier College in
California and director of Broadoaks Children's School there.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute ``when'' for ``if'' _ ``When you pick up your toys,
you can watch the video.'' That detoxifies your request by putting
power in her hands, making it more likely she'll comply.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Always tell why
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The typical preschooler responds to logic if it's genuine,
offered with respect and offered before he is out of control. Keep
your reasons simple, accurate, and age appropriate. ``Parents have
a tendency to go overboard with this,'' says Zeller. Here are
examples she says a preschooler can understand: ``You need to take
this medicine so you won't have a fever and feel sick.'' ``The
reason I'm asking you not to pick your nose is because it will make
it bleed.'' ``It's not OK to swear because grown-ups will tell kids
not to play with you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Offer praise
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you ask a 3-year-old to pick up the blocks and he puts only
two in the bin, a parent is likely to focus on what didn't happen
and react angrily: ``You didn't pick up the blocks!'' Before you
know it, you're into a power struggle. But something good did
happen: ``You put two blocks in the bin. Good job!'' By focusing on
that _ ``Let me help you finish cleaning up'' _ you head off a
battle and help define your expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for moments of goodness, even microscopic ones,'' says
Chris Giguere, director of Lexington Playcare Center, a preschool
in Lexington. Praise provides clarification for preschoolers, who
aren't always clear about what we expect of them or what makes them
good. Be as specific as possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Make eye contact
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for a child to disregard what we're saying when we
literally speak over her head. Position yourself at her level so
she can see your eyes, suggests Pedrini. ``When you look in her
eyes in a friendly way, as if to say, `Oh, there you are!' it's
much harder for her to ignore you,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Address the feeling you think she has
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three- and 4-year-olds have a hard time identifying and naming
their emotions. When they have a fear or worry, they act out.
What's tricky is that what they're acting out about often has
nothing to do with what they are upset about, says Mary Ucci,
director of the Child Studies Center at Wellesley College. A recent
incident with her 2 1/2-year-old grandson comes to mind.

   He was spitting, she asked him to stop. When he didn't, she
said, ``I wonder if you're upset about something. You don't usually
have spit coming out of your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry at Aunt Michelle,'' he said. Michelle had just
arrived, diverting Grandma's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had just gone after the spitting, I wouldn't have gotten
anywhere,'' says Ucci, ``but because I could address the source of
the problem, the spitting stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Giguere says validating feelings is one of the most magical
strategies she knows. ``A child can be puffed up with anger,
red-faced, ready to lash out, and you utter one sympathetic
sentence _ `It's hard to wait your turn for a shovel, isn't it?' _
and it's like you popped a balloon: `You understand me!' They're so
grateful. It's very powerful for them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Slow down
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pedrini thinks a big reason we end up in power struggles is
because we're always in a hurry. ``Preschoolers move at a slower
pace than grown-ups,'' she says. She tells parents to build in
extra time so children can function at a pace that meets their
needs. When you try to speed a transition, don't just issue a
warning _ ``We have to go in five minutes'' _ but provide a
definition: ``You have time to read one more book.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pick your battles
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the most frequently repeated strategy and one
most parents know about. Trouble is, says Zeller, we don't take it
literally enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every 10 things you think a child needs to do, only the
safety related ones matter,'' she says. ``Battles around food and
clothes are almost always unnecessary. Why does it matter if he
doesn't sit still at the dinner table?'' Zeller asks. ``Let him
stand. Even let him come and go. What's more important: That a
3-year-old acts like an adult or that he gets the nutrition he
needs? You're worried about manners? He's only 3! There's time for
that.'' To one mother who was in shouting matches every day with
her preschool daughter over clothes, Zeller asked, `` `What do you
care if she wears the same two outfits all year long?' It had never
occurred to her that it didn't matter,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Enlist her help in problem-solving
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This also empowers a preschooler, but it can easily backfire,
says Kathy Roberts, director of the Dandelion School in Cambridge,
Mass. Don't ask, ``How can we solve this problem,'' until you state
the problem clearly: ``Your brother wants to build towers and it
seems like you want to knock over towers.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is critical. ``Problem-solving doesn't work if the
situation is too far gone,'' says Roberts. If you catch it early _
you see a child about to knock over a block tower and you can
engage him in some other activity before he does _ then you can
say, ``Let me know when you aren't going to knock over Josh's
tower.'' That tells him what he was doing wasn't good without
shaming or humiliating him. It also puts control in his hands:
``When I'm ready, I can play there again. It's up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A less tricky way to problem-solve is after things have calmed
down: ``I wonder what we could do next time Josh wants to build and
you don't.'' This won't work if you're angry, cautions Roberts.
``Then it sounds like punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Use natural consequences
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another frequently-talked about strategy that typically doesn't
work with preschoolers unless the consequence is connected to the
behavior in an obvious and immediate way. Sending a 4-year-old to
her room or depriving her of TV later that day because she's
teasing her 2-year-old sister won't make sense to her, says
Roberts. But she will get the message if you tell her that you and
Molly are going to a different room so Molly can play without being
frustrated by her big sister. Then tell her, ``If you want to join
us, let us know when you're ready to play in a cooperative way.''
That tells her her behavior is a matter of choice and she has
control of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Distract him
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most parents know how to distract a child by engaging him in
some other activity but few of us think about using humor as a
distraction. When you see a power struggle looming because he won't
put on his snowsuit, try to put it on yourself.Your mock cries of,
``This doesn't fit me!'' will tickle his funny bone and likely
defuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Planning ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of ``an ounce of prevention . . .,'' Ucci tells
parents to anticipate a child's needs and reactions. If six cousins
are visiting on Christmas, how will your preschooler cope with
sharing? Talk about it _ ``I wonder how you'll feel if your cousins
want to play with your teddy bears? _ and problem-solve: ``You
don't have to share all your toys; we could put the bears in the
closet . . .''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adding these strategies to your repertoire will reduce power
struggles but may not eliminate them. When one erupts, Chris
Giguere's advice is to end it as fast as possible. ``It's your
choice to let it escalate or not. You're the adult,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite strategy for getting out of a power struggle in a
way that no one loses face is something she calls ``hand over
hand:'' ``We step behind a child, take his hand under ours and do
whatever needs to be done together, like pick up a book. `We need
to put the book away. Let's do it together.' Although a child may
be unhappy, even crying, hand over hand is fast. It puts the
incident behind you quickly,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's up to the adult to be able to move on.''

MAPPING OUT THE ROAD TO POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Mass. _ Broadway, the main drag in heavily Latino
South Lawrence, is home to dozens of restaurants and bodegas and,
revealingly, permanent offices of the Dominican Republic's two
major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   This hotbed of Dominican political activity, alas, produced few
voters in the recent city election, leaving Lawrence once again
with little in the way of Hispanic political leadership, even
though the city's population is an estimated two-thirds Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   That Lawrence has just two Latinos among nine City Council
members and seven School Committee members has prompted a federal
lawsuit, demanding that the city begin electing its School
Committee by districts, rather than city-wide, and redraw council
district lines to increase Latino access to political office.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Justice Department goal is more than worthy.
Lawrence is just one of many Massachusetts cities where
demographics are changing much more quickly than the complexion of
their officeholders, one reason the suit is being closely watched
elsewhere. But expanding representation will take more than a
federal court mandate. New arrivals also have to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of 71,000, up to two-thirds of the population _ and 80
percent of the school-age population _ are Hispanic. Yet because a
large number of Latinos are not US citizens, less than a third of
Lawrence's registered voters are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated activists, however, complain that the city has worked
hard over the years to keep voting down among Hispanics by failing
to: print election materials in Spanish, hire Hispanic poll
workers, or draw district lines that could lead to greater Latino
representation. After a nearly yearlong investigation, the federal
government has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawsuit rings false to Lawrence's mostly white elected
leadership, who say they are being scapegoated for the political
anemia of a community that does not turn out anything close to a
third of the vote on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Mayor Patricia Dowling, who took office in January,
argues that the city has also taken steps to address some of the
issues raised in the suit, including increasing diversity among
election officials.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the entrenched white political machine may have a
point _ there is nothing in the law requiring the School Committee
or City Council to reflect the city's racial diversity. In fact,
the US Supreme Court has ruled three times in the last few years
that it is unconstitutional to draw district lines in US House
districts as a means of electing minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the suit has legal merit, why just Lawrence? Lowell
and Springfield, both with large minority communities, continue to
elect city councils and school committees entirely at large. In
both, all the officeholders are white, thanks to a combination of
low minority turnout and bloc-voting among whites.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the issue of minority representation has never
subsided, despite the fact that the city elects nine of its 13 city
councilors by district. Just two of them are black, even as
Boston's minority population approaches 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, six city councilors are elected from districts (and
three at-large), though activists and US Attorney Donald K. Stern,
whose office filed the civil rights suit, say those district lines
were designed to dilute Latino voting power.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is some evidence that Hispanics are beginning to
flex political muscle here, even without federal help. Jose
Santiago, a city councilor, upset incumbent M. Paul Iannuccillo to
win a seat in the Massachusetts House in September, and Ralph
Carrera was reelected to the School Committee seat he has held
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more hopeful sign, Santiago says a key to his victory
was support from white voters, who traditionally have shunned
Latino candidates. He says he ignored advice that bloc-voting was a
longstanding Lawrence tradition that he would never be able to
overcome. ``I just ran a grass-roots campaign,'' he said. ``A major
part was that people wanted change.''
</P>
<P>
   Such hopeful signs, in the end, may be more of an opening to
political power than any court-mandated solution. Like earlier
waves of disenfranchised newcomers _ the Irish, the Italians, and
African-Americans _ Latinos will learn that they cannot win public
office unless they vote. No lawsuit can change that.
</P>
<P>
   A new Lawrence is being born, and somehow its politics have to
catch up. That can only happen when the main road through this city
connects its Latinos to City Hall and the State House, as well as
to Santo Domingo.

CARROLL WILL SEE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ On those days when he is cast into the
shadow of Bill Parcells and his shortcomings are endlessly
scrutinized, Pete Carroll probably wishes he had taken the St.
Louis Rams' coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   After going 10-6 and taking the Patriots to the second round of
the playoffs a year ago, and now overcoming a 5-5 start to win the
last three games, Carroll must realize he made the right choice two
years ago when the Rams were pursuing him along with New England.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll took a lot of heat during the courting process with Rams
president John Shaw when it was reported that he had made
exorbitant demands _ like Super Bowl tickets, luxury boxes, and
other perks _ in an effort to force St. Louis's hand, thus ensuring
him a great deal in the Midwest or leaving a clear field for the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can produce the proposal to show that what came out was
bull,'' said Carroll Wednesday. ``The guy (Shaw) said to me, `Would
you take the job if it was offered to you?' I said, `I can't take
it right now as presented. I need more information.' And there was
a lot of business that had to take place. I wasn't ready to take
it. Plus, John Shaw is a big-time business guy. He's very shrewd,
and I wasn't going to deal with him on any of the business issues
because he'd eat me up.''
</P>
<P>
   After what Carroll described as a ``great interview'' that left
him completely impressed with Shaw, owner Georgia Frontiere, and
the entire Rams organization, he had his agent, Gary Uberstine,
take over the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my guy to talk to him the next day,'' said Carroll, who
at the time was the 49ers' defensive coordinator. ``A couple of
days later, a release comes out about all of these demands. It came
out of nowhere about all these crazy things I'm asking for, and it
wasn't even close to being accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called John and I said, `What is this?' And he apologized
and said he didn't have anything to do with it and didn't know
where it came from and reinforced to me that it had nothing to do
with us. He said if anyone called about it, he would tell them
exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really angry about it. It wasn't true and it made me
look like a jerk. It came from somebody else who was trying to get
the job. Somebody who was representing somebody else put that out,
because Shaw swore he didn't say anything about it. It was once
again a big media thing that you can't do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get slammed and there's nothing you can do about it.
John's a heck of a guy and he didn't do it. Nobody ever called me
to ask me about it. It just hit the Philadelphia papers and
everyone ran with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots job hadn't become open, but all the signs pointed
to a nasty divorce between Parcells and New England owner Bob
Kraft. Carroll held out and declined the St. Louis job, which
ultimately went to Dick Vermeil, who went 6-10 last year and is
3-10 entering Sunday's matchup against . . . Carroll's Patriots,
who are in prime playoff contention again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the way it turned out,'' said Carroll. ``At the time,
I wasn't ready to do that (in St. Louis) and I was hoping something
else would happen that I would have the opportunity to go for. (The
Rams) wanted someone to take the job right away. Nobody took the
job right off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time since he made his choice, Carroll faces
the Rams and Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to guess how Carroll would have fared with
the Rams. Certainly, there wouldn't have been the media scrutiny he
faces in New England, where some look at his job status as game to
game, when in actuality, it has never been in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way he has led the Patriots back from near oblivion
has put him very much in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that after this year, I have three years left on
my contract, and I'm very happy about that,'' said Carroll. ``I
love this job and this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After keeping the Patriots up the last three weeks, he must
guard against a letdown against the Rams, who have beaten the Jets
and the Bills and lost to the Dolphins. He knows any era of good
feeling could go up in smoke if the Patriots lose Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done things against teams in our division that some of
us haven't been able to do,'' said Carroll. ``The first five or six
games, they played very well and then they had some people hurt and
it got away from them. But we have an opportunity to go in there
and play hard and come away with a road win. The entire NFL season
has proved to us that anyone can beat anybody else on any given
week. Our guys are well aware of that. We've talked about that all
week, and there'll be no letdowns on the part of our players.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll warned about the Rams' defense, calling it ``very
strong. They're No. 1 in the NFC against the pass. They have guys
like Todd Lyght and Ryan McNeil who are very good (defensive)
backs.''
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that quarterback Tony Banks ``is a very mobile
guy. He can make big plays.'' And he said that despite the absence
of Isaac Bruce, their best athlete on offense, he is worried about
Bruce's replacement, Eddie Kennison, who has caught only 15 passes
this year but in the past has been a big factor.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll plans to do some things in practice to help improve some
problem areas. For one, he expects to use a game clock because he
felt the team ``lost concentration of the game clock on some
delay-of-game penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell, who along with Carroll came
up with an effective plan to stop the Steelers last week, credits
Carroll for keeping the team in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't understand him,'' said Sidwell. ``He'll
probably never get his due until he wins a Super Bowl, but I've
been on a lot of teams and coached under a lot of different guys.
I've never seen a guy who practices harder and prepares better for
an opponent than Pete. He's won the respect of a lot of people
around here. Nobody wants to write that, but that's the truth.''

CELL-PHONE SET NEEDS TO GET THE MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mobile phones. You love them. Well, maybe you love them.
Possibly you hate them, at least when they're in the wrong hands,
and they so often seem to be in the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't people shut up? Would it kill them not to be in
constant telephone contact? Would their lives fall apart if they
weren't able to jabber on their phones in restaurants, theaters,
concert halls, trains, cars? Don't they know they're bothering
other people? Or don't they care?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to ``Wireless Etiquette: A Guide to the Changing
World of Instant Communication,'' a little book on a big subject,
by Peter Laufer. I reached the author on his mobile phone, on the
road, in Mill Valley, California. ``I'm on the highway,'' he said,
``Let me do what my book instructs and pull over so I won't kill
myself and others.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nice, I thought. A man who practices what he preaches. At
least when he gives interviews. Laufer said he's a self-appointed
expert on mobile phones, having used them for more than 20 years.
``Wireless Etiquette'' is published by Omnipoint, distributors of
digital wireless phone service. According to a press release, the
book is based on ``a simple notion _ that as our technology often
develops faster than our ability to cope with it, we need to agree
on some rules of common courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   We may need to agree, but can we?
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the book has been good, Laufer said. ``It's a
universal subject. Everybody has a cell phone story.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. I have several, most of which involve nearly getting
killed by somebody driving and talking on a phone at the same time.
In ``Wireless Etiquette'' Laufer lays down the basic rule for using
a car phone: Driving comes first, talking second.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difficult notion for some people to grasp. The
problem, he says, is that people become so involved in their phone
conversations that they tend to lose touch with what's going on
around them, whether it's a truck bearing down on them or a couple
trying to have a quiet conversation at the next table. ``Often they
don't realize they're being rude,'' Laufer said, ``they're doing it
mindlessly, because of the intensity of the relationship we have
with the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   So they don't mean to be rude, they just are rude. The basic
problem, as Laufer writes, is lack of common sense, often perceived
as lack of common courtesy, hence the need for ``Wireless
Etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Laufer lists places where mobile phones should never be used,
among them, lecture halls, churches, classrooms, concerts, live
performances, movies, crowded elevators. Restaurants are not on
Laufer's list of phone-free zones, even though he says that,
personally, he finds people who talk on cell phones in restaurants
``really offensive.'' If you must take calls in a restaurant, he
advises, answer the phone as you're excusing yourself from the
table, ask the caller to hold on for a few seconds until you find
an appropriate place to talk, an alcove, the street, a telephone
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, cell phone users are being asked politely, or
coerced, into switching off their instruments. As Laufer notes, all
over the world, more and more places are prohibiting the use of
mobile phones. In Milan, Italy, a sign at La Scala instructs
opera-goers to leave ``telefonini'' in the checkroom. At Carnegie
Hall, the program asks that cellular phones be turned off during
performances, or left at home. In the U.K., phone-proof railway
cars have been introduced for passengers who don't want to be
disturbed by mobile phone callers. In Japan, mobile phone jammers
are selling almost as briskly as mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, jammers are illegal in the U.S. Instead, we have
``Wireless Etiquette.'' Will anyone take heed? That remains to be
seen. Meanwhile, drive cautiously.

GIVE THE TOBACCO WINDFALL BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tobacco companies won't be paying the $206 billion agreed to in
the settlement with the states' attorneys general. Corporations
never pay taxes, they just collect them. The money is going to come
from smokers, which is another way of saying it is going to come
from the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokers have low incomes,'' writes Robert J. Samuelson,
Newsweek's stellar economics columnist. ``Only 20 percent of
cigarette taxes are paid by those with incomes over $50,000; 34
percent are paid by those with incomes under $20,000 and 19 percent
by those with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement, in Samuelson's apt phrase, is a
``reverse Robin Hood arrangement: It sanctifies soak-the-poor taxes
and robs the poor to pay the rich.'' Already cigarette makers have
announced a price hike of nearly 50 cents per pack; in some states,
it will be more. By early 1999, California smokers will be paying
an extra dollar for every pack of cigarettes. Antismoking
crusaders, who are often wealthy and politically well-connected,
typically demonize tobacco companies. But it isn't the tobacco
industry that will feel the lash of this settlement. It is ordinary
smokers, most of whom are working class stiffs with no connections
and not much money.
</P>
<P>
   The $206 billion is supposed to ``settle'' the states' claim for
reimbursement for providing medical care to smokers who get sick.
This was always a bogus claim, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, because most smokers have medical insurance, and thus do
not burden the public treasury at all.
</P>
<P>
   Second, because smokers already repay _ through heavy cigarette
taxes _ the costs they impose on society. Actually, ``repay'' is
the wrong word; smokers prepay for years before any tobacco-related
costs materialize. In 1998, federal and state tobacco taxes will
total $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Third, because smokers are less likely than other groups to draw
old-age benefits such as Medicare and Social Security. Studies have
repeatedly shown that the slightly shorter lifespan of smokers
results in a net savings to the public. In 1994, the National
Bureau of Economic Research estimated that savings at a minumum of
23 cents per pack.
</P>
<P>
   And fourth, because no rule of law supports the notion that if a
product harms a consumer, the manufacturer owes money to the state.
In creating Medicare and Medicaid, the government chose to
subsidize health care for eligible individuals regardless of how
their medical needs came about. The government could have refused
to pay for the care of smokers. But having chosen not to exclude
tobacco-related diseases, it has no right to then demand
compensation from tobacco companies. This settlement sets a
dangerous precedent. If cigarette makers are liable to the
government for smokers' illnesses, why shouldn't ski operators be
liable to the government for broken legs? Or distillers for
cirrhosis of the liver?
</P>
<P>
   By settling the lawsuits, the tobacco companies in essence
waived each of these points. In deciding how to spend the money
that will come pouring in, the states should do the same. That is,
they should take the arguments made by the antitobacco activists at
face value, and follow them to their logical conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Assume, therefore, that smoking does impose a net cost on the
public. Assume that the taxpayers have been underwriting that cost
all these years through Medicare and Medicaid. Assume that the
attorneys general were justified in suing the tobacco companies, on
the taxpayers' behalf, to recoup that cost.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have recovered $206 billion, restitution for all the
costs taxpayers were forced to bear. Who should get that money?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, US Senator-elect Charles Schumer proposes using
settlement proceeds to reduce property taxes statewide. In
Massachusetts, state Senator Robert Hedlund has introduced a bill
to rebate the money to the public by widening the personal
exemption on the income tax. Schumer is an ardent liberal; Hedlund
is a staunch conservative. Clearly, turning the tobacco windfall
back to the taxpayers is a matter not of ideology, but of honesty.
</P>
<P>
   But honesty has never been the strong suit of the antitobacco
zealots. Frequently they are hypocritical, driven by deeply selfish
motives: lucrative fees for the lawyers, popularity for the
politicians, and power for the public-health bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that the tobacco-haters have been quick to
squelch any talk of returning the tobacco money to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any doubts there would be a feeding frenzy,''
says the spokesman for the commonwealth's outgoing attorney
general, Scott Harshbarger. Greg Connolly, head of the state's
Tobacco Control Program, warns of legislators treating the windfall
as ``found money,'' predicting dismissively: ``Someone will be in
there saying, `Look, now you can cut the income tax down to 5
percent.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the equities here are clear. State programs to combat
smoking are awash with money, frequently from steep tobacco taxes.
Government budgets in general are embarrassingly flush. In
Massachusetts, spending races far ahead of inflation, yet so much
revenue is pouring in that the state has run back-to-back
billion-dollar surpluses. Meanwhile, the tax burden on average
citizens presses down more heavily than ever. If the tobacco money
belongs to anybody, it belongs to the taxpayers. Doubt the good
faith of politicians who claim otherwise.

AFTER A SLOW START, RESORTS HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question for a strange season: How long does it take a ski area
to recover from a heat wave of historic proportions and deliver
enough skiing to get through one of the major vacation periods?
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, if you weren't in a canoe in the north country
mountains, you might have been swimming for your life. Certainly
skis were useless.
</P>
<P>
   Following a season that started with a bang _ last year's
Thanksgiving dump throughout ski country, a modern record for so
much so early _ this year's late and long Indian summer could have
been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had gone on much longer,'' said Barbara Thomke of
Smugglers Notch Resort in Vermont, ``we'd have worried.''
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas about two weeks away, and some vacations
beginning sooner than that, it took a seasoned eye and long memory
to recognize that weather extremes rarely hold on very long, and
not get rattled about the warm spell. But at least one
climatologist, Cliff Harris from northern Vermont, sees a favorable
trend for snow lovers this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every extreme,'' said Harris, whose business, Harris &AMP;
Mann Climatology, is used by several ski areas and about 2,000
farmers in the Northeast, ``there is an opposite extreme. We're in
a La Nina period, and when that happens it reverses the El Nino
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: In the second half of the season _ January to April
_ we'll have well above average snow and cold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all ski areas really want at this point is a string
of nights in the 20s in order to keep the snow guns running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be all right,'' said Sugarloaf's Jim Costello, who
acknowledges that the 55-degree period was not a pleasant
experience at the sprawling destination resort in central Maine.
``At least,'' he said, ``we didn't get any rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugarloaf managed to keep 18 trails open through the tepid
spell, including a halfpipe for boarders _ a rare sight in such
warmth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into heavy snow production right now,'' said Costello.
``We've been able to make snow most nights (since), and by
Christmas time we'll have all terrain on all areas off the Summit
Chair and several off King Pine Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The warmth melted away so much hard-earned machine snow at some
areas that it actually closed a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to close _ suspend ski operations last Friday and
Saturday,'' said Thomke. ``On Monday, it was 69 degrees, and by
Tuesday it was 17 and snowing. Incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomke said Smugglers Notch subscribes to Harris &AMP; Mann and has
been reassured that the heavy dump is on its way before the end of
the year. But in case it's late, Smugglers, which is across a
mountain pass from Stowe (they connect at one point), is under way
rebuilding snow on all its terrain in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have plenty of snow,'' said Thomke, ``but it would be
nice to get a dump of natural. It just looks and feels so much
better around here with snow on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the unthinkable happened, as it has throughout ski
country on rare occasions, and a holiday meltdown should occur? At
Smugglers, whose Christmas bookings are strong this year, a whole
range of alternatives is brought into play _ from volleyball to
miniature golf _ from the resort's off-season activity menu.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is thinking in that direction yet, least of all
Harris. ``The warmest weather is over with,'' he said. ``Cold waves
peak with the full moon cycle, and that means it will be 10 below
zero early in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris claims that in 85 percent of the years that have started
with a warm spell such as the one New England experienced last
week, the second half of the season is colder and snowier that
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Nino reverses everything,'' he said. ``Last year (an El
Nino season), we started with a big snowstorm at Thanksgiving, but
it got warm and there was a snow drought later.
</P>
<P>
   ``With La Nina, it takes the normal pattern to extremes. In
'93-94 and in '95-96, from January to April, it broke records. And
the same with '82-83: We got blizzard after blizzard. That's what
kind of winter we're into this year.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is encouraging news to Rene Reimer and her
boyfriend, Scott Barry, who managed to snowboard at Waterville
Valley the weekend after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked terrible,'' said Reimer. ``You didn't see any snow
driving up, until you got there, got on the lift, and up some
elevation. Then it was amazing; the snow was pretty good. I mean,
for the first day, it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as much as real snow drought, ski area managers fear the
perception of snowlessness. At Okemo, where Pam Crukshank went from
hitting golf balls last weekend to scraping the thick snow off her
car on Tuesday, reservations for Christmas vacation are up 17
percent over last year's high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all spoiled by last season's big early storms,'' said
Crukshank, whose area gave out $20 coupons to skiers who bought
tickets during the meltdown last week. ``We want to get those
skiers back here. It would be nice to get some snow in people's
backyards.''

THE U GAME: A FITTING SHOWCASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ It has been a long time since New England has
had a signature college basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the rivalries, ranging from Boston College-Providence to
Providence-Connecticut and Northeastern-Boston University, have had
a sense of history about them.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of impact? Forgetaboutit. Nothing like Duke-North
Carolina or Kentucky-Indiana, or even a Big East staple like
Syracuse-St.John's.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Wednesday night's U Game. The University of
Massachusetts vs. the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it looked like a mismatch. No. 1 UConn against 1-3
UMass, coming off a 22-point loss to Marshall and struggling to
find its own identity as well as a win.
</P>
<P>
   The win for the Minutemen will have to wait a while. The
identity? That definitely came Wednesday night as they gave the
Huskies all they could handle before UConn hung on for a 59-54
victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was as much a war as it was a game. UConn earned every point.
UMass played the type of basketball that has made it a solid NCAA
tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   UMass hung tough, from center Lari Ketner, who brought the
Minutemen back from an 8-point halftime deficit, to Mike Babul, who
was in Richard Hamilton's face so closely and so doggedly that only
when the UConn star went to the foul line could he get more than a
foot away from the UMass forward.
</P>
<P>
   UConn was better, is better. But UMass conceded nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 9,493 was on its feet from the start, creating an
atmosphere that was every bit as hostile as North Carolina faces
when it comes to Durham or Duks encounters when it journeys to
Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rivalry. A big-time rivalry between two teams who will
get better as the season progresses.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question about UMass and its attitude as it
dropped three straight heading into the U Game.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   There were questions about Ketner, the 6-foot-10-inch senior who
has always had so much potential stitched into his uniform but
never seemed to show it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Ketner showed everyone what he can do,
pouring in 11 of his 15 points and turning the game the Minutemen's
way before he fouled out with 1:40 left.
</P>
<P>
   But UConn has not climbed to the top of the national polls
without being tough enough to handle challenges.
</P>
<P>
   What is different about this year's version is that the Huskies
can solve their own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Hamilton was held to a point in the first half
by Babul, yet the Huskies had an 8-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they merely switched to Plan B and Plan C. Albert
Mouring came off the bench and scored a team-high 13 points. ``He
showed up just in time,'' said UConn coach Jim Calhoun, who has
built a basketball empire in Storrs.
</P>
<P>
   That is the difference between this UConn team and previous
ones. The Huskies do not have to rely on the likes of Hamilton or
guard Khalid El-Amin to have super nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, we gutted it out,'' said Calhoun. ``We played poorly
offensively, but UMass had something to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it did. The Minutemen might be 1-4, but the grousing should
be at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can play like this, we'll see UConn in the NCAA
tournament,'' said guard Charlton Clarke, who spearheaded a
two-hour team meeting after Saturday night's drubbing at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will go their separate ways now. UConn will head to
Pittsburgh for its Big East opener. UMass will travel down the
Mass. Pike to Worcester to face BC.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies did nothing to prove they shouldn't be No. 1.
Wednesday night marked the third in a four-game stretch _
Washington, Michigan State, UMass, and Pittsburgh _ that Calhoun
said would give a better indication of how good the Huskies are.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to make any definitive judgments, only
Maryland and Duke appear to be in the Huskies' class at this stage
of the season. Barring something crazy, UConn's reign could be a
long one.
</P>
<P>
   When the Huskies were elevated to No. 1 last week, Calhoun
accepted the ranking without flinching _ another sign of the
confidence evident in Storrs these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be No. 1 late in March,'' said Calhoun. ``But we'll
take this.''
</P>
<P>
   For UMass, the great expectations of the preseason have given
way to the harsh reality of a four-game losing streak, which coach
Bruiser Flint hoped bottomed out with the loss at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   UMass is better than a 1-4 team, and Flint knows it. So does
UConn.
</P>
<P>
   UMass knows how to win. It has been to the Final Four, which
UConn has never done.

DIMAGGIO _ AN ATHLETE TURNED ICON

<P>
   He's fighting for his life in a Florida hospital. There are
daily updates on his condition, and fear exists that 84-year-old
Joe DiMaggio may not recover. Young people perhaps don't understand
why there is so much concern about an ex-ballplayer who last played
in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Joe DiMaggio matters . . .
</P>
<P>
   He's up there with Kennedy, Nixon, Sinatra, Elvis, and Brando
among the compelling American figures of the century. DiMaggio is
the rare US sports figure who seamlessly crosses into popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   People who know nothing about baseball know of the great
DiMaggio. Try this quiz on your non-sport-fan friends: Name four
things about Joe DiMaggio that have nothing to do with baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   1. He was married to Marilyn Monroe (men generally come up with
this answer first).
</P>
<P>
   2. He was ``Mr. Coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Paul Simon wrote, ``Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?'' in
``Mrs. Robinson,'' part of the soundtrack for ``The Graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Ernest Hemingway wrote about him in ``The Old Man and the
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   All the above suggest that in addition to winning three MVP
Awards and appearing in 10 World Series, Joe D contributed to an
Academy Award, a Grammy, and a Nobel Prize. His second wife was the
first Playboy centerfold, and he may be the only athlete who could
simultaneously grace the covers of Sports Illustrated, Life, Look,
People, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Ad Week, Premiere, and the New York
Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Santiago has to say about Joe in ``The Old Man and
the Sea'': ``The great DiMaggio is himself again . . . I would like
to take the great DiMaggio fishing . . . Do you believe the great
DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with this
one? . . . I think the great DiMaggio would be proud of me today .
. . San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great
DiMaggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan may be as big, but as
great as Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle were, they never touched so
many areas of American life. This is why DiMaggio is important.
Every time we lose a giant like Joe D, our country is another step
removed from a time when celebrities were famous for more than 15
minutes and people were accountable for their actions. There was a
grace and dignity about DiMaggio that's totally absent in today's
crotch-grabbing, end-zone-dancing sports culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ted was Joe D's contemporary rival. They fought for supremacy in
the American League (the Yankees almost always won), MVP crowns,
and the distinction as the best ballplayer. The two men could
hardly have been more different, and they carried their differences
into retirement. While Ted became more gregarious in his later
years, DiMaggio withdrew even further. When David Halberstam,
perhaps the finest historian of his generation, solicited
interviews with members of the 1949 Red Sox and Yankees, DiMaggio
was the only person on either team who resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's a great guy,'' Rex Barney, the late Brooklyn Dodgers
pitcher, used to say. ``He just hates to be bothered.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joe D got off some pretty good quotes in his day. When
Miss Marilyn came back from a tour of US Army bases in Korea, she
said, ``Joe, you never heard such cheering,'' and DiMaggio replied,
``Yes, I have.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked DiMaggio what kind of salary he would
command in the modern market under George Steinbrenner, DiMaggio
said, ``I would have sat down and said, `George, you and I are
about to become partners.' ''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio played with Lou Gehrig. That alone makes him important.
When Cal Ripken saved baseball in the post-strike summer of 1995,
DiMaggio was summoned for Ripken's historic consecutive game No.
2,131. As ever, he insisted on being introduced as ``the greatest
living ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio matters because he gave Italian Americans great
pride when he patrolled center field for the Yankees in the 1940s.
He matters because he hit in 56 consecutive games in 1941. He
matters because, with Williams, he is the link to the great
Yankee-Red Sox rivalries of the 1940s. He matters because he
attached his name to a Florida children's hospital where the motto
is, ``Whether rich or poor, no child is turned away.''
</P>
<P>
   The most private of men, despite his celebrity, he no doubt
would hate these daily disclosures of his medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe D matters. He is, after all, the great DiMaggio.

KRAFT ENCOUNTERS LITTLE RESISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn _ Bob Kraft should be on the phone. He should be
talking to Allied. Or Ryder. Or the family moving company down the
street. He can wait for the voters of Connecticut to speak
officially, if he wants. He'll be wasting his time. The Patriots
are definitely moving to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft came to a brick building at the corner of Capitol and
Broad Streets Wednesday. He and others were led to believe that
people would be throwing political bricks during a public hearing
at the state's legislative offices. Many would be unhappy and
angry. They would tell the Patriots owner that he can't come here,
relax in a posh $350 million stadium constructed with their money,
and contribute to their community by depositing his excess cash in
a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   So just before 4 p.m., Kraft sat at a table and faced his
legislative interrogators. It wasn't exactly Sharon Stone facing
the firing squad in ``Basic Instinct.'' That's not to say there
wasn't opposition. Representative Ernie Newton from Bridgeport
spent all day saying he had a problem with Kraft not spending his
own money to move his team to Connecticut. And Newton would
eventually say, ``He was willing to put up $200 million of his own
money in Boston. He ain't puttin' up jack here. This is a home run
for Kraft. If it wasn't, he'd be keeping his behind in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   These may be fierce words for the locals to hear. But Kraft and
his son Jonathan must have been like grade-schoolers trying to
contain their giggles as legislators asked their ``tough''
questions. This was it? This was the war? What a tame
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The Krafts remember their times in South Boston, times when they
found themselves in personal and political confrontations with an
entire community. Once, outside the South Boston Community Health
Center, an elderly man got in Jonathan Kraft's face and told him he
wasn't going to bring his team to Southie. The man pushed the
younger Kraft a few times, too. There were words exchanged with
City Council president Jim Kelly. And the famous disagreements with
House Speaker Tom Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing like that Wednesday. One group of protesters
handed out pieces of cheese, subtle reminders that people will
still be hungry when a new stadium is built. And at about 4:20,
with Kraft still answering legislators' questions, a disruption
could be heard outside. Those who took a peak saw about 50 men and
women in purple berets chanting, ``Union jobs!'' Many of them also
took up another credo: ``No union, no peace.'' They came up an
escalator, walked by Room 2C, and quickly went down an escalator
and out of the building. That was it. It did not remind anyone of
the Black Panthers wielding guns at the California Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Kraft seemed nervous when he spoke. Maybe he was
having flashbacks to his turbulent political days in Massachusetts.
But he had no reason for uneasiness here. Many of the legislators
and citizens who spoke focused on their own agendas rather than
picking apart the details of the memorandum of understanding Kraft
signed Nov. 19. One man wanted to know what the Patriots were going
to do for Hartford's crumbling schools. There was a janitor who
wanted to know about union jobs. Another man said he would blow up
the new stadium if it took money out of his pocket (he was quickly
reminded that he will be heading to jail if he decides to become an
Adriaen's Landing terrorist). There was a representative from the
National Organization for Women. There was another woman who wanted
to know about affirmative action and the prospects for women. One
man wanted to know why the state doesn't build a small minor league
baseball stadium rather than a 68,000-seat football stadium. A
legally blind woman wanted to know how the new construction would
benefit her.
</P>
<P>
   There were many excellent points made, but Connecticut proved
its pro sports naivete the entire day and evening. The hearing did
not expose a community willing to go to war with Kraft. Far from
it. The hearing exposed a desperate city. The hearing exposed a
needy city. Is it a city that wants pro football? Certainly. But it
also wants better schools, jobs, and government programs. Since so
much is lacking, many of the people came here expecting the
Patriots to be regional saviors rather than a region's football
team. There were no punches thrown here, just pleas.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, many people were not venting about a
generous stadium plan. They were talking about their personal
disappointments in life. They talked about how their neighborhoods
were razed in the name of good intentions. They talked and talked,
and after a while, you got the feeling that many people simply
wanted someone to listen.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Kraft should get ready for the move in 2001. He
knows how to listen now. He recognizes the faces of the politically
naive because he was one of them when he approached the people of
Southie. He knows better now. He knows the people who came here
Wednesday and pounded tables and raised their voices do not
represent the majority of voters. He also knows how to speak to the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The majority was at the Civic Center Mall Tuesday, participating
in a pep rally with Kraft, Bruce Armstrong, and Tebucky Jones. They
are the ones who want the glow of pro football shining on a
Hartford skyline that is dark on many nights. They believe the NFL
makes a town feel better, even if that town has schools on the
verge of losing accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues will be raised in the next few weeks. But they
won't stop this deal. The Patriots are coming to Hartford because
Hartford wants a lot of things. Football being one.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are people who go skiing (with emphasis on the verb) and
people who are already there. The twain do meet, and often.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who drive up to the mountains for ski weekends and
vacations often know only one phase of life there: the one that
they create. People who live in ski country understand that the
mountain _ that ammusement park full of manmade snow, halfpipes,
terrain parks, brew pubs, pizza bars, skating rinks, health clubs,
sleigh ides, snowmobile rides, cross-country trails, and whatever _
is just one part of the community.
</P>
<P>
   There are also the people who live there.
</P>
<P>
   I knew a fellow who ran a motel in Rangeley, Maine, many years
ago. Those were better days for Saddleback Mountain, and the town
filled every Friday with skiers from Farmington, Orono, Portland,
and even Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the week, my motelier friend said, the whole
town got into an excited buzz with the anticipation of the ski
crowd coming in, and Sunday night he described a ``kind of
depression'' as the town emptied out again.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the snowmobile crowd has transformed Rangeley into a
mecca of motorized sleds, Castrol smoke hanging in the air, a kind
of Harley crowd carousing through the nights in the little country
town in the middle of Maine's spectacular lakes region.
</P>
<P>
   But from Tijuana, Mexico, to Cuttyhunk, Mass., all tourist towns
are roughly alike. The periodic influx of tourism _ weekly or
seasonally _ transforms them. The very character and identity that
people seek when they visit such places is threatned by their sheer
numbers crashing in. For the locals, it's a love/hate sort of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cape Cod residents wave a giddy goodbye to the last of
the retreating summer folk as their tail lights disappear over the
Sagamore Bridge, so do the residents of winter-weary ski towns of
the north feel a thinly disguised sense of
good-riddance-to-all-that as the snow melts in April, wildflowers
bloom in the high country, and the ski/board crowd recedes to the
flatlands. Tide going out.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, the opposite effect is also seen as winter
vacationers return to a blustery cheer at the inns, hotels, and
restaurants of the northern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in New England has this two-culture effect been so clear
as in Vermont, a state so attractive to city folks that despite its
harsh northern winters, the state has become almost the symbol of
what retirement to God's country means. Vermont. Green mountains.
Black-and-white cows. Ice cream white mountains. How sweet!
</P>
<P>
   How many inn keepers have we met through the years who fall into
this description: Middle-aged couple decides to throw off all the
complications of the affluent, hectic life near New York (Boston,
Philly, etc.) and put the life savings into a Vermont business
hoping to live happily in the green hills ever after?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rueful joke is that towns like Woodstock and Stowe
are Vermont as created by the imagination of a Connecticutite.
</P>
<P>
   But the clash of cultures can be more serious than a Ralph
Lauren factory outlet. When organized no-growthers continued to
find ever new ways to hold up Sugarbush's plans for expansion of
its snowmaking water capacity, locals from the Mad River towns of
Warren and Waitsfield went to Montpelier to voice their support the
ski area.
</P>
<P>
   The locals knew in their boots that the no-growthers had no
evidence for their case against Sugarbush, and they were not about
to be pushed around by a bunch of outside egg heads and theorists.
Gov. Howard Dean, a native New Yorker himself, stood foursquare
behind Sugarbush, and so gave substance to his oft-lyricized
passion for skiing and boarding.
</P>
<P>
   But today the Green Mountain State faces a much more complicated
problem, created in part by the success of ski tourism in the
state. Or at least on the part of the state known as ``gold
towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the state supreme court ruled that Vermont must
equalize its school funding across the state, spreading the wealth
from the gold towns _ the Stowes and Killingtons _ to the poor
towns whose schools do not benefit from ski tourism, which is by
far the biggest dollar engine in any ski community.
</P>
<P>
   In this case Dean, a 49-year-old, Yale-educated MD, stood
squarely behind Act 60, the legislation aimed at equalizing the tax
burden of education by, essentially, taking from the rich and
giving to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialism!'' cried some opponents of the measure, which
created a 70 percent tax increase in Killington, a 50 percent boost
in Stowe. But Dean, who entered politics as a Jimmy Carter campaign
worker, once again stood for his principles, which in this case
were: ``Everyone starts with the same chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That Dean's election win last month was closer than expected _
at least by the early polls _ is proof to some in the ski industry
that while the electorate still admires its governor and feels he
has Vermont's interests at heart, it opposes Act 60.
</P>
<P>
   Gold towns may be gold to the huge ski conglomorates, say many
opponents, but there are many small and marginal business owners,
fixed-income residents, and just plain lower-income property owners
who can't afford such skyrocketing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there is no perfect solution, though Dean and the state
legislature are working on the many hardship cases created by Act
60. Still, the question is brutally difficult. No one can end up
really happy about the solution.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be worth remembering, as we are about to sweep
northward again up Interstates 91, 93, 89, and 95, that the places
we are bound for are more than theme parks for our pleasure and
relaxation. They are living, breathing communities of human beings
wrestling with the same problems of living we seek to escape for 48
hours or so when we go there.
</P>
<P>
   And often, we should also note, their problems are of our
making. To forget this _ and we often do _ is arrogance in the
extreme.

WHAT THE US MUST DO TO COMBAT BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of this century, mankind developed weaponry
capable of ending human life on the planet. At the end of this
century, mankind has created biological weaponry capable of doing
much the same thing, only more selectively and more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, biological weaponry does not require the
infrastructure and technical sophistication of a nation-state.
Outlaw states and terrorist organizations can concoct viruses,
poxes, and nerve gas agents with a few million dollars and a
handful of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   They are doing just that. Tuesday, William Broad and Judith
Miller of The New York Times reported that Iran has become the most
recent entry into this deadliest of games. Reporting from Moscow,
they filed what may be the most chilling account yet of the bidding
war that has broken out for graduates of the Soviet Biopreparat, or
germ warfare program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran is scouring the former Soviet Union,'' Miller and Broad
reported, ``to hire scientists who worked in laboratories tied to
Moscow's vast germ warfare program and has succeeded in recruiting
some of them to take jobs in Teheran, according to Russian
scientists and American officials. Iranian officials who report to
their leadership have approached dozens of scientists who once made
germ weapons, offering as much as $5,000 a month to people who make
far less than that a year in the increasingly chaotic Russian
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, it was believed that biological and chemical weapons
were too unstable for use in warfare. ``Most national
governments,'' says Juan Enriquez of the David Rockefeller Center
at Harvard, ``agreed to stop producing and have renounced the use
of chemical and biological weapons. They did so partly because
these weapons were considered militarily ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   For this and other reasons, the United States signed the
Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention in 1972, an agreement that
banned the ``development, use and stockpiling of biological
weapons.'' Some 140 nations have since signed the convention.
According to Richard Preston of The New Yorker, however, the Soviet
Union ``continued to believe that the United States had not ended
its bioweapons program but simply hidden it away, turning it into a
`black' weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, in 1973, the Soviet Union set up Biopreparat, or The
``System'' as it was called by those who worked there, and pressed
ahead with research and development of biological weaponry. At its
zenith, Biopreparat employed 32,000 people whose mission was to do
for the Soviet Union what the Manhattan Project (development of the
atomic bomb) had done for the United States. In 25 short years, the
success (if that's the right word) of the Biopreparat program has
altered the nature of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' says Enriquez, ``despite biowarfare conventions, gene
technology is creating nightmares for military officials throughout
the world. Analysts are revisiting the issue of chemical and
biological warheads as strategic weapons. As bioweapons become
stable, easy to disperse, and have specific and limited time
effects, some nations may be tempted to develop them as strategic
weapons. Technology is increasing their military value,
particularly since they can be dispersed quietly and are hard to
trace. If gene research can target medicines to particular
individuals, it can also target weapons. Conceivably, specific
ethnic groups could become targets.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is almost clueless when it comes to this new
genetic technology of warfare. As Preston reported, ``one of the
side effects of the closing of the American bioweapons program was
that the United States lost its technical understanding of
biological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States should take these steps:
</P>
<P>
   --Enter into the bidding war for graduates of Biopreparat. An
allocation of $1 billion from the federal budget surplus would more
than cover the cost and would alert the global scientific community
that the US was serious about stopping the spread of bioweapons.
</P>
<P>
   --Insist that Russia deliver a full report on what exactly
Biopreparat accomplished over two decades and where exactly the
scientists of Biopreparat now reside.
</P>
<P>
   --Greatly enhance our intelligence capabilities regarding
biowarfare. If the Central Intelligence Agency does nothing else
for the next 20 years, it would be time and money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   --Develop a plan for massive retaliation in the event of
biowarfare outbreak. That plan should be made public and broadcast
around the world. One way for biological agents to ``blow back'' on
those that launch them is nuclear retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Biological warfare and genetically engineered viruses represent
the most serious threat to US national security interests since the
Cold War. This time, though, the adversary could be Iraq or the
Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   What was once the stuff of science fiction and James Bond movies
is now reality. As things now stand, the US is virtually powerless
to combat these new weapons of war.

LEGENDARY MANAGER PEERS WARILY AT MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investment legend Peter Lynch may appear to be everywhere these
days, but you rarely hear from the second most-famous mutual fund
manager of the Lynch years.
</P>
<P>
   John Neff made his mark over 30 years working for Boston's
Wellington Management Co. as the manager of the Vanguard Windsor
Fund. He became famous by routinely doing what few mutual fund
managers achieve today, outperforming the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock index in 20 of the 29 full calendar years he ran Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Neff, who retired nearly three years ago, manages only his own
money and a small sum for alma mater Case Western University. But
he looks at today's stock market and knows what he thinks. It's not
an upbeat report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has kind of stabilized a bit, but the basic problem is
profits have quit growing,'' said Neff, who lives and has always
worked from offices in Pennsylvania. ``Here we are paying 25 or 26
times earnings at this point, which we've never paid before, for a
market in which earnings aren't growing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said weaker corporate earnings and individual investors who
cut back sharply on mutual fund purchases when the market slumped
in the summer are potential warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you've got a marketplace that's very very high
and there's not much excitement,'' Neff said. ``Over the next five
years or so, it's going to be a very moderate return.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff spends most of his time serving on a variety of profit and
non-profit boards, including that of Chrysler Corp. until its
merger with Daimler-Benz, and has taught at the Wharton School of
Business. He's also at work on a book on his investing style,
expected out in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Neff made his name as a contrarian investor, buying big stakes
in cheap and out-of-favor stocks he believed would come back. That
style worked most years and very well over the long run, but it did
not fit every market cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Neff's experience 25 years ago might be of interest to critics
of Charles Freeman, who took over management of the Windsor fund in
1996 and runs it in a similar value style.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's Windsor fund has struggled in a period that favors a
very small group of wildly popular stocks like Microsoft Corp.,
reminiscent of the early 1970s and its Nifty Fifty stocks. Windsor
has lost about 1 percent this year, while the S&AMP;P 500 advanced 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Neff actually managed Windsor, then a $500 million fund, during
the Nifty Fifty era, and it wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got killed for three years,'' he recalled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor earned only half the S&AMP;P 500 return in 1971 and 1972. It
got uglier the next year, in the early stages of the following bear
market: Windsor lost 25 percent while the market sunk by 14.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But then Neff's value-oriented portfolio began to turn around
and Windsor's very best years were near. The fund lost 16.8 percent
in 1974, less than the market's 26.3 percent decline. Then Windsor
soared by 54.5 percent in 1975 and another 46.4 percent the next
year, easily outdistancing the overall market each time. ``We did
twice as well because the marketplace simply went the other way,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neff avoids comment about the operation of his old fund and
professes no particular opinion about any other managers running
money. He will politely acknowledge problems fund managers face
today, the ones usually cited as reasons why so few can outperform
the market. Popular funds are much bigger and often more
constricted in the investments they may persue.
</P>
<P>
   But Neff also points out that his contrarian style, buying when
the market wants to sell and getting out when a stock has gotten
hot, should be managable for bigger funds because it takes
advantage of the market's trading tides. And, he said, stocks that
are overvalued or underpriced by the market are at least as easy to
find today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if anything, to a degree the market is less
efficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neff may be retired from professional investing, but he still
has some favorite stocks. He likes smaller home-building companies
like Beazer Homes USA Inc., M/I Shottenstein Homes Inc. and D.R.
Horton Inc. He finds airlines like UAL Corp. and Delta Air Lines
Inc. attractive. A few investment categories, like cyclical
commodity stocks and real estate investment trusts, are
sufficiently beaten down to attract Neff's attention.

   David Smith, a former State Street Global Advisors employee who
operates an Internet site devoted to criticizing the company, has
lost a key round in his case before the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination. The MCAD staff last week ruled that Smith
had failed to demonstrate that he was fired because he was gay or
in retailation for complaining about another employee's misconduct.
Smith had charged that SSGA, the big Boston money manager, had
fired him after the other employee had misused the office computer
system to reveal Smith was gay. SSGA denied it had discriminated
against Smith and said he was fired for refusing to cooperate with
an internal investigation; an MCAD compliance supervisor agreed. An
SSGA spokeswoman said the company has strictly defined policies to
fight discrimination and harassment. ``And the MCAD decision shows
those policies are working,'' she said. Smith says he plans to
appeal to the full commission.

HOW TO WRITE A GREAT HOLIDAY NEWSLETTER
</HEADLINE>
  By LEAH INGRAM 
 c.1998 Leah Ingram 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sending a holiday card and an annual letter is often our only
communication with certain family members and friends.
Unfortunately, most letters border on boring and banal and often
include inappropriate information, such as every health malady and
financial woe the family has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Each year Barb Freda of Louisville, Ky., gets a holiday letter
from one friend that includes ``stuff like losing a job or the
therapy she's been in,'' says Freda, who would prefer to have her
spirits lifted up -- not brought down -- by the holiday greetings
she receives.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to tuck a holiday letter in your Christmas,
Hanukkah or Kwanzaa cards this year, make sure you heed the
following advice. If you do, you'll create a letter that your
friends and family will want to read -- instead of toss in the
trash:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take time to plan. Deirdre and Jeff Robinson of Ellicott City,
Md., spend about 10 hours each year planning their annual letter, a
newsletter called the Robinson News Network's Bedtime News. ``We
sit down and brainstorm the things that have happened during the
year,'' explains Deirdre, ``and then we try to look for common
themes in order to break the list up into corresponding topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Florence Isaacs, author of ``Just a Note to Say'' (Clarkson
Potter, 1995, a book on how to improve personal correspondence,
``I'd keep a file all year long for your annual letter and keep
throwing in quotes and anecdotes you pick up from newspapers as
well as your own notes on memorable happenings at your house.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Include friends' milestones as well as your own. The Robinsons
devote an entire section of their newsletter to weddings and births
because ``people like to see their name in print, and it's a way
for me to get news out to those who don't necessarily stay in touch
with the same people we do,'' says Deirdre. (Last year's newsletter
mentioned three nuptials and nine births.) ``I'm at an age when
most of my contemporaries and I are starting to have kids,'' adds
Freda, who loves hearing about which children have come into the
world in the previous calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Incluse some laughs. When Tim Harper of Ridgewood, N.J.,
chronicled his wifes unsuccessful attempt to get more exercise in
the bygone year, he wrote in the Harper holiday letter: ``Nancy has
learned to avoid feeling guilty about ignoring the Nordic Track in
the basement by avoiding the basement.'' Tim also poked fun at
himself by recalling his kids' involvement in a Cub Scout derby and
school elections. ``We reckon they would have gotten first place
and president,'' he wrote, ``if their dad hadn't helped Jonathan
build his race car and helped Lizzie with her campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Get creative with your layout. One reason the Robinson's chose
a newsletter format was so they could create a handful of
mini-articles, which would allow ``people to read only the parts
that interest them,'' says Deirdre. When the Harper family returned
in 1993 after living in London for nine years, their annual letter
took the form of a list. The categories? Their top 10 surprises on
moving back to America. Their 1994 letter included headlines on all
the ways the family had become suburban stereotypes. One such
headline: ``We drove our Volvo wagon over the bikes in our
driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jazz it up with pictures. Letters don't have to be all words _
you can communicate your message through kid-created drawings or
photographs. ``A friend of mine crops a bunch of photos taken
during the year, adds handwritten captions, and color-copies it,''
adds Deirdre, who chose to create her own letter on the computer so
she could use clip art from software programs to liven up the
newsletter's look and give it a real Christmas feel. A past
newsletter featured a silhouetted picture of the manger scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trim that mailing list. ``I've received a Christmas letter
every year from someone I met once 25 years ago,'' says Isaacs.
``It's full of details about family members I don't know or have
never heard of. It's like getting a canned letter to constituents
from a politician running for office.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pen a personal note. ``The key to a good holiday letter is
personalizing it in some way with a handwritten note,'' says
Isaacs, whose book has a chapter devoted entirely to holiday
greetings. ``You can talk about what the holiday means to you and
what you wish for them, about prayers for peace, about their family
and the general joy of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel compelled to write a lengthy message. ``A line or two
will do it,'' Isaacs adds. ``The idea is to make the recipients
feel you are writing specifically to them.

   Unlike the Academy Awards or the Tonys or the Emmys, there's
never a shortage of deserving nominees when it comes time for the
annual GOOF (Greatly Overhyped and Overexposed Fool) Award.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner was Jerry Springer. The year before that, it
was Dennis Rodman. You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one aspires to the GOOF _ a gigantic trophy made
entirely of goat cheese carved into the image of the original
winners, Milli Vanilli _ but every year, dozens of worthy
contenders emerge, and 1998 was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the glittering nominees, though, only one gets to take
home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   Before we crown our winner, let's pay tribute to the 1998
nominees. Please hold your applause _ and your guffaws _ until all
the names have been read.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ OPRAH WINFREY. For singing her own theme song, for hammering
us over the head with her charitable greatness, for making the
nearly-unwatchable bomb ``Beloved,'' and for the New Age nuttiness
on her show that threatened to drive away a good portion of even
her most devoted fans. And what's with that disingenuous ``street''
voice she lapses into when she's dishing with someone like Whitney
Houston? What's that about?
</P>
<P>
   _ PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. Liar.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOEL SHERMAN. You've never heard of him, but he's the New York
Post sportswriter who honored Mark McGwire's 70-homer season by
placing McGwire seventh on his Most Valuable Player ballot.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll take Sherman out for some appetizers so we can
discuss this ridiculous decision. And then we can have an
appropriately New York Postian headline: ``Headless Writer in Tapas
Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY KAY LETOURNEAU. The Seattle schoolteacher and her
teen-age lover, who's now all of 15, brought another baby into this
world and penned a self-pitying book, ``Un Seul Crime, L'Amour''
(``Only One Crime, Love''), which for now is available only in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a busy gal! Just think of all she could accomplish if
she wasn't behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   _ LYING REPORTERS and THEIR ENABLING EDITORS. Twentysomething
wonder boy Stephen Glass concocted intricate, elaborate and wildly
implausible feature stories for The New Republic, Rolling Stone,
George and other national publications, while his editors ignored
protestations from subjects who quibbled with his pieces by saying
things like, ``Um, that never happened.'' Somehow Glass was able to
produce literally dozens of bogus pieces before the piles of lies
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston Globe stars Mike Barnicle and Pat Smith were
fired for writing fiction disguised as newspaper columns. (Barnicle
also was busted for publishing jokes by George Carlin as his own.)
While Barnicle wasn't particularly repentant, he at least spared us
the sanctimonious stance of Smith, whose final ``apology column''
was filled with self-pity and insulting excuses, and who has since
turned her dismissal into performance art poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of these people ever going to apologize to the
colleagues whose livelihoods and reputations they jeopardized with
their elaborate deceits?
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear a poem about that.
</P>
<P>
   _ RYAN LEAF. ``I'm a big, rich, goodlooking, talented
quarterback in the NFL! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER. The syndicated sensation _ who is
raking in tens of millions of dollars with her unique brand of
common-sense advice peppered with niceties like, ``Don't be a
loser!'' and ``No wonder you don't have any friends!'' _ was
humiliated twice this year, first when Vanity Fair published a
scathing profile, and then with the publication on the Internet of
nude photos from about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, the photos weren't all that humiliating. Dr.
Laura was smokin' back in the '70s!
</P>
<P>
   _ JACK KEVORKIAN. For co-starring in and producing the first
prime-time network-broadcast snuff film in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALAN DERSHOWITZ. One of the great legal minds of our time is
apparently addicted to cable TV appearances _ which only serve to
shine a spotlight on his horrifically brownish teeth. Cancel
Geraldo and get thee to a dentist, Dershowitz!
</P>
<P>
   _ KENNY ANDERSON. According to The New York Times, Anderson
budgeted $120,000 for ``hanging out money'' during the NBA lockout,
but he was considering a few cost-cutting moves like selling one of
his seven luxury cars (the Mercedes) and he was concerned about
being able to support the four children he has fathered with three
women.
</P>
<P>
   The piece unleashed a torrent of criticism, but Anderson said he
wasn't upset because ``some people don't even know of The New York
Times. They don't even read The New York Times. ... The corporate
world probably reads it. But a lot of my friends who I deal with,
they read the New York Post comics and look at the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY BONO. Mourned Sonny, ran for Sonny's congressional seat,
won Sonny's congressional seat, sheared and darkened her blond
hair, turned against her mentor Newt and called for his
resignation, dissed Sonny for drug use in TV Guide, took up with a
country singer stud and lobbed Kathie Lee-type questions at Kenneth
Starr, all within the span of a single year!
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only she'd marry U2's Bono, divorce him and marry NFL
quarterback Steve Bono, she'd be Mary Bono Bono Bono.
</P>
<P>
   _ HOWARD STERN. Still a comedic genius, but his weekly show on
CBS is behind ``Saturday Night Live'' in the ratings, and there
have been numerous cancellations from affiliates who are disgusted
with the freak-show theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem: It's one thing to hear Stern on the radio
as he pokes fun at the raggedy collection of losers who parade into
his studio _ but when you actually see some of these people reduced
to tears, it's just not that hilarious. There's too much of an
imbalance of power; when a famous millionaire star is shown mocking
the uneducated and the physically unfortunate, he comes across not
as a rebel but a bully.
</P>
<P>
   _ PAULA JONES. Was rendered nearly attractive by nose job and
total makeover, but she still grated with her ``Roseanne''
appearance by repeatedly opening her mouth, whether it was to crack
her chewing gum or assault our ears with her piercingly high voice
and her stupid opinions.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worthy honorees, one and all. Just being nominated is
accomplishment enough _ and in previous years, any of the above
might have taken home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, was particularly stupid. So without further
ado, the winner is ... wait a minute, we have a tie! The co-winners
of the 1998 GOOF are:
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP and MONICA LEWINSKY!
(Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap...)
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, gals. Your telephonic chatterboxing produced
tape after tape of scintillating conversations about the sad little
sexcapades of poor deluded Monica and our pathetically horny
president, aka ``Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Chowing on junk food, watching TV and clattering endlessly like
a couple of sophomores who can't stand those phonies from the
``in'' group, you two set back the women's movement 10 years and
helped fuel the most ridiculous and unnecessary political scandal
in modern history. At this time last year, only a few Washington
insiders knew your names, but now you're as famous as Lorena
Bobitt, Jessica Hahn, Donna Rice or Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Accept this GOOF in good health, and bicker among yourselves
about who gets to take it home.

<P>
   Unlike the Academy Awards or the Tonys or the Emmys, there's
never a shortage of deserving nominees when it comes time for the
annual GOOF (Greatly Overhyped and Overexposed Fool) Award.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner was Jerry Springer. The year before that, it
was Dennis Rodman. You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one aspires to the GOOF _ a gigantic trophy made
entirely of goat cheese carved into the image of the original
winners, Milli Vanilli _ but every year, dozens of worthy
contenders emerge, and 1998 was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the glittering nominees, though, only one gets to take
home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   Before we crown our winner, let's pay tribute to the 1998
nominees. Please hold your applause _ and your guffaws _ until all
the names have been read.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ OPRAH WINFREY. For singing her own theme song, for hammering
us over the head with her charitable greatness, for making the
nearly-unwatchable bomb ``Beloved,'' and for the New Age nuttiness
on her show that threatened to drive away a good portion of even
her most devoted fans. And what's with that disingenuous ``street''
voice she lapses into when she's dishing with someone like Whitney
Houston? What's that about?
</P>
<P>
   _ PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON. Liar.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOEL SHERMAN. You've never heard of him, but he's the New York
Post sportswriter who honored Mark McGwire's 70-homer season by
placing McGwire seventh on his Most Valuable Player ballot.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll take Sherman out for some appetizers so we can
discuss this ridiculous decision. And then we can have an
appropriately New York Postian headline: ``Headless Writer in Tapas
Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY KAY LETOURNEAU. The Seattle schoolteacher and her
teen-age lover, who's now all of 15, brought another baby into this
world and penned a self-pitying book, ``Un Seul Crime, L'Amour''
(``Only One Crime, Love''), which for now is available only in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a busy gal! Just think of all she could accomplish if
she wasn't behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   _ LYING REPORTERS and THEIR ENABLING EDITORS. Twentysomething
wonder boy Stephen Glass concocted intricate, elaborate and wildly
implausible feature stories for The New Republic, Rolling Stone,
George and other national publications, while his editors ignored
protestations from subjects who quibbled with his pieces by saying
things like, ``Um, that never happened.'' Somehow Glass was able to
produce literally dozens of bogus pieces before the piles of lies
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston Globe stars Mike Barnicle and Pat Smith were
fired for writing fiction disguised as newspaper columns. (Barnicle
also was busted for publishing jokes by George Carlin as his own.)
While Barnicle wasn't particularly repentant, he at least spared us
the sanctimonious stance of Smith, whose final ``apology column''
was filled with self-pity and insulting excuses, and who has since
turned her dismissal into performance art poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Are any of these people ever going to apologize to the
colleagues whose livelihoods and reputations they jeopardized with
their elaborate deceits?
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to hear a poem about that.
</P>
<P>
   _ RYAN LEAF. ``I'm a big, rich, goodlooking, talented
quarterback in the NFL! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER. The syndicated sensation _ who is
raking in tens of millions of dollars with her unique brand of
common-sense advice peppered with niceties like, ``Don't be a
loser!'' and ``No wonder you don't have any friends!'' _ was
humiliated twice this year, first when Vanity Fair published a
scathing profile, and then with the publication on the Internet of
nude photos from about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, though, the photos weren't all that humiliating. Dr.
Laura was smokin' back in the '70s!
</P>
<P>
   _ JACK KEVORKIAN. For co-starring in and producing the first
prime-time network-broadcast snuff film in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALAN DERSHOWITZ. One of the great legal minds of our time is
apparently addicted to cable TV appearances _ which only serve to
shine a spotlight on his horrifically brownish teeth. Cancel
Geraldo and get thee to a dentist, Dershowitz!
</P>
<P>
   _ KENNY ANDERSON. According to The New York Times, Anderson
budgeted $120,000 for ``hanging out money'' during the NBA lockout,
but he was considering a few cost-cutting moves like selling one of
his seven luxury cars (the Mercedes) and he was concerned about
being able to support the four children he has fathered with three
women.
</P>
<P>
   The piece unleashed a torrent of criticism, but Anderson said he
wasn't upset because ``some people don't even know of The New York
Times. They don't even read The New York Times. ... The corporate
world probably reads it. But a lot of my friends who I deal with,
they read the New York Post comics and look at the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   _ MARY BONO. Mourned Sonny, ran for Sonny's congressional seat,
won Sonny's congressional seat, sheared and darkened her blond
hair, turned against her mentor Newt and called for his
resignation, dissed Sonny for drug use in TV Guide, took up with a
country singer stud and lobbed Kathie Lee-type questions at Kenneth
Starr, all within the span of a single year!
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only she'd marry U2's Bono, divorce him and marry NFL
quarterback Steve Bono, she'd be Mary Bono Bono Bono.
</P>
<P>
   _ HOWARD STERN. Still a comedic genius, but his weekly show on
CBS is behind ``Saturday Night Live'' in the ratings, and there
have been numerous cancellations from affiliates who are disgusted
with the freak-show theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem: It's one thing to hear Stern on the radio
as he pokes fun at the raggedy collection of losers who parade into
his studio _ but when you actually see some of these people reduced
to tears, it's just not that hilarious. There's too much of an
imbalance of power; when a famous millionaire star is shown mocking
the uneducated and the physically unfortunate, he comes across not
as a rebel but a bully.
</P>
<P>
   _ PAULA JONES. Was rendered nearly attractive by nose job and
total makeover, but she still grated with her ``Roseanne''
appearance by repeatedly opening her mouth, whether it was to crack
her chewing gum or assault our ears with her piercingly high voice
and her stupid opinions.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worthy honorees, one and all. Just being nominated is
accomplishment enough _ and in previous years, any of the above
might have taken home the GOOF.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, was particularly stupid. So without further
ado, the winner is ... wait a minute, we have a tie! The co-winners
of the 1998 GOOF are:
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP and MONICA LEWINSKY!
(Clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap-clap...)
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, gals. Your telephonic chatterboxing produced
tape after tape of scintillating conversations about the sad little
sexcapades of poor deluded Monica and our pathetically horny
president, aka ``Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Chowing on junk food, watching TV and clattering endlessly like
a couple of sophomores who can't stand those phonies from the
``in'' group, you two set back the women's movement 10 years and
helped fuel the most ridiculous and unnecessary political scandal
in modern history. At this time last year, only a few Washington
insiders knew your names, but now you're as famous as Lorena
Bobitt, Jessica Hahn, Donna Rice or Tonya Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Accept this GOOF in good health, and bicker among yourselves
about who gets to take it home.
</P>
<P>

PG&AMP;E TURNS PAGE IN HANDLING CRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Pacific Gas and Electric Co. took a
decidedly different tack in how it handled the crippling power
outage that crippled the San Francisco area on Tuesday. Call it
corporate perestroika.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a subsidiary of the PG&AMP;E Corp., trotted out its
chief executive at two news conferences to explain what had
happened, accepted blame, and apologized for the inconvenience and
damage the blackout caused.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company's public relations staff gave radio and
television interviews throughout the day in order to update the
public about when power would be restored.
</P>
<P>
   A mistake made by a Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. work crew shut
down a power substation just after 8 a.m. Tuesday, triggering an
outage that left 1 million people without electricity for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Singer, president of Kamer-Singer &AMP; Associates Inc., a
public relations and crisis management firm, said PG&AMP;E's response
to the catastrophe was a sea change from the way the utility had
historically dealt with crises.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company took a pounding for not availing itself
more to the public during storm-related power failures in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned a lot from the storms in terms of communications
and the emphasis customers place on communications,'' PG&AMP;E
spokesman Cory Warren said. ``They said, `You don't have to turn on
my lights in an hour. Just tell me when you're going to turn them
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Singer also pointed to deregulation of California's $80 billion
electricity market as the other main reason PG&AMP;E had decided to
enhance its public relations efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open, competitive economy,'' Singer said. ``Now,
customers have a choice. PG&AMP;E recognized they can't be the monopoly
of old.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the San Francisco-based utility received mixed reviews
from crisis management specialists for the way it handled the
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Singer applauded PG&AMP;E for having the company's chief executive,
Gordon R. Smith, conduct the news conferences and accept
responsibility for the outage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a 10 on a scale of 10 in terms of dealing with the
public and the media,'' said Singer, whose clients have included
the Chevron Corp. and San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only hear from a utility once a month when you get a bill
and when something goes wrong, so you'd better do a good job of
delivering bad news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Singer also liked the fact that PG&AMP;E's public relations machine
had been on top of the situation, providing frequent updates about
the blackout to radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continued to communicate to the public throughout the
day,'' he said. ``That builds customer, consumer and public
confidence. It makes it appear they're trying to be a good
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Garrett, who specializes in crisis communications for the
San Francisco office of Alexander Ogilvy Public Relations, wasn't
as impressed. Garrett said he had heard conflicting information in
radio reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main problems was the difference of opinion from
(Mayor Willie Brown's) office and PG&AMP;E,'' he said. ``The mayor said
the power is going to be back on in 45 minutes. Then, someone from
PG&AMP;E said it's going to take longer. ... (And) at about 2 p.m.,
PG&AMP;E said all the lights are on, but people called into (radio
station) KCBS saying, `not for us.' ... If they're going to be
proactive, make sure it's right. That's what people are going to
remember you by.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the company had done the best it could under the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation was constantly in flux,'' he said. ``Information
that seemed good at the time was replaced later. That's how
emergencies operate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Garrett and Singer had numerous suggestions for how PG&AMP;E
should handle fallout from the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said PG&AMP;E should take out full-page newspaper ads
apologizing for the power failure and telling customers how it
planned to avert a recurrence. Singer said PG&AMP;E should consider
offering rebates to customers to stave off a flood of claims
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the company had already apologized and wouldn't know
its next steps until an investigation of the blackout was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But Singer expects PG&AMP;E to make more public announcements about
the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is toward honesty in corporations,'' he said. ``They
see if they get caught in a lie, it'll only come back and hurt
them. People who (aren't honest) can lose market share.''

STARTREK-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ In ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' the
ninth movie about a Starship Enterprise that goes to increasingly
familiar-looking places no one has gone before, things aren't going
well. The fabled Federation of Planets is in decline, facing
challenges from opportunistic alien forces on all sides, not unlike
the television series ``Deep Space Nine'' and ``Voyager,'' which
have steep competition in the ratings these days. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
RUSHMORE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Remember that smart but misguided,
attractively energetic but abnormally obsessive geek in school? You
can bet film critics do, and that's why you're going to have a hard
time finding negative reviews of ``Rushmore.'' Undeniably charming
and ultra-quirky in a generally pleasing way, this latest study of
oddballs-on-the-outs from director Wes Anderson was built to be
overpraised. 3 stars. By Bob Strauss.

SHAKESPEARE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Shakespeare in Love'' is a
smart, funny and sexy romp through Elizabethan times that will
satisfy both theatrical scholars and people who have never cracked
open the great Bard's work. 4 stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
SIMPLE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``A Simple Plan'' boasts great
performances, mesmerizing suspense sequences and a consistent
intelligence rarely found in thrillers today. It's just a shame
that it winds up being fundamentally simple. 3 stars. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
STILL-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ `While `Still Crazy'' bears a
resemblance to Rob Reiner's classic satire ``This Is Spinal Tap,''
it aims deeper to explore the harsh reality that follows people who
peaked too soon in life and now must cope with boring, routine,
everyday sameness. 3{ stars. By Glenn Whipp.

SINGER RIDES MTV WAVE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The winner of MTV's ``The Cut'' program will be
announced Saturday on the cable music network, and one of the
finalists is a Northridge-based alternative-pop singer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilson says the entire process was ``amazing _ just being
part of it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 22, relocated to Northridge from Brockport, N.Y., three
months ago to try to make it as a singer in the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a following back home, but I felt it was time to give it
a go,'' he said. ``On a whim, I mailed my demos to MTV, and they
got back to me almost instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable program, hosted by Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes of the
group TLC, provides an arena for undiscovered acts to present their
skills. More than 10,000 tapes were submitted to the production,
and more than 160 acts have been featured on the daily half-hour
program, according to executive producer Kathy Cotter,
</P>
<P>
   The finals of ``The Cut'' air at 12:30 p.m. Saturday when 10
finalists, including Wilson, compete against each other.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Cut' has been a great way for MTV to showcase the
talents of undiscovered performers,'' said Brian Graden, MTV's
executive vice president of programming. ``It's been a great way
for us to see the many talents of our audience in action each
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand prize winner will appear in an MTV-produced video,
which will go into rotation on the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already gotten quite a lot by being involved,'' Wilson
said. ``I've been contacted by several record labels and
promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says he enjoys living in the area because ``I'm
surrounded by people trying to do the same thing I'm going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   POORMAN WANTS YOU: Jim (Poorman) Trenton returns to the airwaves
with his ``Anti-Radio'' simulcast at 4 p.m. Monday on KYPA-AM
(1230) and KMNY-AM (1600). Trenton asks unsigned musicians to send

ON-SCREEN BUDDIES PACK A PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood loves the buddy system.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps putting pairs of guys together in action films hoping
to hit the jackpot. Last fall, Hollywood rang the bell with the
surprise hit ``Rush Hour,'' starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.
During the summer, it was ``Lethal Weapon IV,'' which will be out
on video Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Its being the most successful of any buddy-film series, you
wouldn't expect Warners to tamper with this lucrative franchise.
Instead, director Richard Donner adds a few spices to the meat and
potatoes of Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover). One
of the spices is in the form of Jet Li, a Hong Kong martial-arts
action star whose cold-blooded stares and lightning speed make him
a formidable screen presence even if he doesn't speak much English.
</P>
<P>
   There is a plot here, but it doesn't matter much. All you have
to know is there is ample bone-shattering violence and the stunts
are spectacular. The lighthearted way that death is dealt with may
offend some people (``Cool,'' responds Riggs when told that a
slaying victim had his eyes eaten by pigeons), but ``Lethal'' fans
know what they're getting into.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the dialogue is silly, especially as bodies
keep piling up. Comedian Chris Rock (another added spice) and Joe
Pesci take time out from the mayhem to do a comic riff on how cell
phone companies get you coming and going. Hardly relevant but part
of the juvenile appeal of the series, which has _ it is hoped _
reached its end. The edge from the first film is long gone. Still,
mindless as it all may be, Donner directs ``Lethal Weapon IV'' with
panache when it would have been easy to take the money and run.
Rather, what we got was pure Hollywood escapist entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy films didn't start with Gibson and Glover, of course, and
probably the most successful pairing took place nearly 30 years ago
when Paul Newman and Robert Redford teamed up in the western
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ultraviolence of ``Lethal,'' William Goldman's
screenplay focused on the good-natured relationship between Butch
(Newman) and Sundance (Redford). They are the perfect pair _ Butch
is the brains and quick-thinking visionary, and Sundance provides
the strong, fast-on-the-draw traditional Old West prototype.
</P>
<P>
   After Butch persuades him to go to Bolivia _ although he doesn't
know where it is _ Sundance tells him, ``You just keep thinkin',
Butch. That's what you're good at.'' ``Boy, I got vision, and the
rest of the world wears bifocals,'' Butch sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, director George Roy Hill uses slapstick and comedy to
poke fun at typical western film cliches. In a memorable scene
Butch appears outside the window of Sundance and his girlfriend,
Etta, one morning riding the bicycle of ``the future.'' It's
practically one of the first music videos as Butch tries out the
new invention with Etta on the handlebars, accompanied by Burt
Bacharach's Oscar-winning song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My
Head'' (sung by B.J. Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   When the pair face impossible odds in their final shootout,
rather than showing their bullet-ridden deaths (a la ``Bonnie and
Clyde''), the picture ends with the well-known freeze-frame of
their fateful charge. The image fades to a sepia, reminding us how
we have romanticized the past, especially the Old West. The result
is a charming film that, because of its wit, will never seem dated.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, Redford and Hill teamed up a few years later for another
buddy picture, ``The Sting,'' which won seven Oscars, including
Best Picture. The film about two Depression-era con men, which is
being released on a special 25th anniversary video, is a lavish
production, and Newman and Redford again show their on-screen
chemistry. Enhancing the mood is a soundtrack of Scott Joplin's
ragtime music.

`A SIMPLE PLAN' BASICALLY WORKS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``A Simple Plan'' does so much so well that it's a
shame it ends up so fundamentally, well, simple.
</P>
<P>
   A beautifully shot, wintry film noir that signals a profoundly
mature step in director Sam Raimi's development, the movie digs
deep into areas of behavior good people never want to know they
possess. ``Simple Plan'' also boasts impressive tonal consistency,
a good sense of paranoia, great performances, mesmerizing set
pieces and an intelligence rarely found in thrillers today.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that precious little in this movie comes as a
surprise. While lead actors Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and
Bridget Fonda play their small-town Minnesota characters with
depth, passion and something like the spontaneity of real people,
the outline of their moves is predetermined almost to the point of
ritualism. If you've ever seen a movie where a trove of unearned
money destroys everyone that touches it, then you know where this
unforgiving morality play is headed from the opening credits.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there, however, is all the fun. Based on Scott Smith's
novel (he also wrote the screenplay), the film spins a lesson of
biblical dimensions out of the classic concept that a little
knowledge is a dangerous thing.
</P>
<P>
   Our in-over-his-head smart guy is Paxton's Hank Mitchell, and
his grand tragedy lies in his painful discovery of how thorough a
jerk he can be. The only college graduate from a family of former
farmers, Hank initially sees nothing wrong with his humble
accounting job at the local feed store. It's enough to afford him a
nice, modest house, which his massively pregnant wife Sarah (Fonda)
seems content enough in.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to that of his dim-witted, unemployed older brother
Jacob (Thornton), Hank's life is indeed perfect. Every inch the
Midwestern geek with his long greasy hair, Coke-bottle glasses and
perpetually stubbled cheeks, Jacob has lived in a trashed-out
apartment with his mangy dog ever since the family farm got
foreclosed on.
</P>
<P>
   When Hank, Jacob and Jacob's only friend, a drunken lout named
Lou (Brent Briscoe), find some $4 million in a downed airplane,
it's educated, self-controlled Hank who decides to sit on the
obviously illicit money until spring, then dig in if nobody claims
it. It's the first of many bad decisions, many of which spring from
the greed-addled Sarah, who morphs convincingly from sweet
expectant mom into Lady Macbeth of the 10,000 Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The subtlest changes come across Hank, though. He's not wrong in
thinking he's the most decent, smartest conspirator involved in
this increasingly birdbrained and blood-spattered cover-up. But
it's amazing how his every strategy reveals an unexamined contempt
for everybody he thought he held dear.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully balancing Hank's descent into his own misanthropy,
Jacob's wounded human dignity blossoms under pressure (even as his
limited intellect cracks from the same force). This is Thornton's
finest idiot/saint yet, a man whose resentments are so poignantly
intertwined with his longing for love he will surely break the most
cynical viewer's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Raimi, a cracked near-genius who usually makes overcaffeinated
comic book movies like ``Darkman'' and ``The Evil Dead,'' reveals
these layers of humanity at a deliberate but perfectly timed pace.
He also knows exactly when to goose the proceedings along with
judiciously constructed shock bits; the scene in which Hank
insensitively forces Jacob to choose between his only friend and
his only brother may be the best stretch of film since Spielberg's
Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the mechanistic puritanism that drives ``A Simple
Plan'' is hard to take. After the recent ``Waking Ned Devine'' made
such worthy fun of knee-jerk moralism and ``Very Bad Things''
splattered the whole concept into a million preposterous pieces,
you just wish these fascinating individuals could live a nightmare
that was worthy of their complexity. &QL;

`STILL CRAZY' BEARS FINE FRUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With its story of an aging group of British rock
'n' rollers reuniting for a last stab at immortality, ``Still
Crazy'' bears more than a faint resemblance to everyone's favorite
``rockumentary,'' Rob Reiner's classic satire ``This Is Spinal
Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   But screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, the team that
gave us ``The Commitments'' as well as class British TV shows like
``Porridge'' and ``Auf Wiedersehen, Pet,'' are too smart to merely
imitate someone else's handiwork. Thus, while it's often quite
funny and appealingly whimsical, ``Still Crazy'' aims deeper to
explore the harsh reality that follows people who peaked too soon
in life and now must cope with boring, routine, everyday sameness.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect doesn't suit Tony (Stephen Rea) much. So when he's
asked to reunite his band, Strange Fruit, for the 20th anniversary
of a Woodstock-like concert, Tony is more than happy to track down
his old mates. There's Les (Jimmy Nail), the bass guitarist turned
ace roofer. Drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) lives in a trailer
near his mother's garden, while Ray (Bill Nighy), the egocentric
lead singer, lives well beyond his means with his
groupie-turned-wife (Helena Bergstrom) on a country estate.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, these guys could use the work. Problem is, they still
hate each other. Les openly despises the pretentious Ray and loves
to goad him about his diminished singing abilities. The Fruits
(yes, the film does get a lot of comic mileage out of the band's
name) are also haunted by the death of the original lead singer,
Keith, and the strange disappearance of his fragile guitarist
brother, Brian (Bruce Robinson).
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, the band is held together by their faithful Scottish
road manager Hughie (Billy Connolly), whose sharp one-liners help
defuse the simmering rivalries. (``I love the sound of vomit in the
morning!'') There's also the Fruits' original personal assistant,
Karen (Juliet Aubrey), a woman who rejoins the band out of a sense
of loyalty and quiet desperation.
</P>
<P>
   In less capable hands, every one of these people could have
easily become rock 'n' roll caricatures instead of fully and
lovingly realized human beings. Even (and especially) the
vainglorious Ray is portrayed as less a buffoon than an insecure
man terrified of making a fool of himself as he's nearing his 50th
birthday. Nighy's layered performance is one of the year's best. As
a bonus, he does all his own singing, too.
</P>
<P>
   The band's music, all original songs, is actually pretty good, a
credit to Chris Difford (best-known for his lyrics for Squeeze) and
music written by Mick Jones (Foreigner), Jeff Lynne, Russ Ballard
and Clive Langer. The bluesy, hard-rock songs come off as a cross
between Eric Burdon and the Animals and Cheap Trick, although not
nearly as horrible as that might sound in practice.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``Still Crazy,'' though, is its uncanny and
warmly sympathetic depiction of a group of middle-age men trying to
recapture something that they don't know how they created in the
first place. Back in the '70s, the band didn't even think about it
_ the music just came. Now, they're older and more mature, but more
vulnerable, too. Will the Fruits get a second chance or just bollix
things up, like they usually do?
</P>
<P>
   We won't spoil the fun. But we guarantee you'll be rooting for
the boys to make good.

QUIRKY `RUSHMORE' PEAKS VIA CHARACTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember that smart but misguided, attractively
energetic but abnormally obsessive geek in school?
</P>
<P>
   You can bet film critics do, and that's why you're going to have
a hard time finding negative reviews of ``Rushmore.'' Undeniably
charming and ultra-quirky in a generally pleasing way, this latest
study of oddballs-on-the-outs from director Wes Anderson (``Bottle
Rocket'') was built to be overpraised.
</P>
<P>
   But smart, distinctive character comedy being the rare thing
that it is these days, don't let the critical hype keep you away.
</P>
<P>
   Our wayward overachiever here is Max Fischer (newcomer Jason
Schwartzman), a 10th-grader at the prestigious Rushmore Academy who
is the master of all extracurricular activities _ Astronomy Club,
fencing team, the Max Fischer Players (for whom he writes gritty
social dramas) _ and flunking out of the curricular ones.
</P>
<P>
   While barreling along on an academic probation, Max makes two
key adult acquaintances: wealthy school benefactor Mr. Blume (Bill
Murray, dry and sweet like an impossibly conflicted wine) and
fetching British first-grade teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams).
Blume sees in the enterprising Max the kind of surrogate son he
wishes his own pampered jock boys could be. Max falls hard for the
widowed Cross and seeks Blume's aid in his hopeless quest to
romance the older woman.
</P>
<P>
   Can this course of action lead to anything but expulsion? Well,
yes, especially after Max arranges to have a state-of-the-art
aquarium built for the fish-loving Cross on the site of the campus
baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   But hard as being forced out of Rushmore is _ in a touching
expression of the film's subtle yet sharp class criticism, Max
doesn't want his classmates to know that he's the son of a barber _
it's nothing compared to the blow when Blume falls in love with
Miss Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Utterly unaware of how creepy he's acting, Max applies his
cross-wired ingenuity to both getting back into school and seeking
revenge on the betraying Blume. Meanwhile, harassed but nonetheless
influenced by Max's overheated point of view, Blume and Cross move
toward a kind of satisfaction they never thought life could offer.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman is a scream playing a guy you have to laugh at
because he's so self-serious it's impossible to laugh with him.
He's a brat and an integral accomplice to his own, immense
humiliation, and the film's suspense builds from our increasing,
tenuous hope that he'll actually get a clue about himself before
it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to see a lot of ``Murray does his best work in
years''-type quotes associated with this film, even though he was
actually funnier in last spring's less-reputable ``Wild Things.''
This is one of those amusingly tentative performances of his that
gives the impression something understated but remarkable is going
on. Really, though, he's just playing a rich guy who's lucky enough
to have a particularly enriching midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Which, if you think about it, is not something you see in movies
every day, but is very much in keeping with the cockeyed
individualism that is ``Rushmore's'' great, ingratiating strength.

`INSURRECTION' A BIT ON THE ODD SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is an odd one.
</P>
<P>
   Odd in that it's the ninth film in the venerable sci-fi series,
and it continues the dubious tradition of not being as good as any
of the even-numbered entries.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that other kind of odd as well. For reasons known only
to producer/co-writer Rick Berman and director Jonathan Frakes,
they've followed up the taut, gripping, visually splendiferous Borg
adventure ``First Contact'' with something more like one of those
throwaway warm-and-funny episodes from the '60s TV series. You know
the kind, where Capt. Kirk beamed down to some backward but
Eden-like planet, took up with a cute alien gal and tried to
prevent the place from being ruined by some off-world threat.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it's ``Next Generation'' leader Jean-Luc Picard
(Patrick Stewart) who falls in love on a place that's a virtual
Fountain of Youth. The 600 or so Ba'ku who live lives of perfect,
bucolic balance on their isolated little world are actually ancient
refugees from a highly technological society. But they settled on
this space rock because there is something in the planet's rings
that keeps them pretty and blond for, presumably, ever.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason Starship Enterprise is there, however, is
because the Federation has pacted up with an unappetizing space
race called the Son'a, a bunch of plastic-surgery casualties led by
the volatile Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham, having a ball behind
intricate, stretched-skin makeup). They're supposedly conducting a
joint observation mission, but what the Son'a really want is to
displace the Ba'ku and steal the planet's atmosphere for their own
immortality process.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here is whether Picard will rebel against
Federation policy to save his 300-year-old girlfriend Anij (Donna
Murphy) and her people, or follow orders that paradoxically
countermand the Prime Directive of noninterference with indigenous
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't sound bad, actually; it's got the bare bones of one of
those pseudo-philosophical political allegories ``Trek'' has always
done so entertainingly. But the movie blows it. Intriguing issues
are brought up once _ like why the declining Federation would ally
with the creepy Son'a, or whether the Prime Directive really
applies to the colonizing Ba'ku _ then not mentioned again.
</P>
<P>
   What we do get is a lot of questionable comedy relief. Riker
(Frakes) and Troi (Marina Sirtis) suddenly start acting like goofy
kids in love. Worf (Michael Dorn) gets a case of particularly
grotesque Klingon acne. Data (Brent Spiner), the fascinating
android who last time out was almost seduced by the icky/sexy Borg
Queen, gets to play in haystacks and otherwise act childish. It's
all pretty silly.
</P>
<P>
   On the presentational front, Frakes continues to prove he has a
true filmmaker's imagination. Though hardly the formal tour de
force ``First Contact'' was, ``Insurrection'' does boast some
striking outer-space footage (the starships are all computer
generated for the first time). And Frakes uses the tricky Holodeck
gimmick _ that's the primarily recreational, virtual environment
device _ very cleverly here.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that, there's a listless, shrugged-off quality to
the whole, um, enterprise. Never fear, though; they're bound to get
even with the next one. &QL;

WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Young Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has a
problem. He simply can't find the inspiration to write, even though
he has London's two leading playhouses eagerly clamoring for his
latest work. That play, tentatively titled ``Romeo and Ethel, the
Pirate's Daughter,'' hasn't even been committed to the page because
Shakespeare needs the passion of love to stoke his passion for
words. And right now, Will is spending his Saturday nights home
alone.
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a smart, funny
and sexy romp through Elizabethan times that will satisfy both
theatrical scholars and people who have never cracked open the
great Bard's work. The film's witty and rollicking screenplay
(written by Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard) succeeds in
taking Shakespeare out of the realm of myth and exploring just what
might have inspired him to create the desperate beauty found in
``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The stimulus for Will Shakespeare here comes in the appealing
form of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), an enchanting heiress who
catches the struggling playwright's eye one night during a royal
performance. Viola is mesmerized by Will's poetry and passion (not
to mention his soulful gaze) and decides to audition for ``Romeo
and Ethel,'' disguising herself as a young man named Thomas Kent.
(Women were forbidden from such ``depraved'' behavior as acting
back then.)
</P>
<P>
   Will pursues Viola at night while rehearsing Thomas during the
day. In a scene that memorably echoes ``Twelfth Night,'' Will
confesses his love for Viola to Thomas. Since this is Shakespeare
baring his soul, the disclosure is incredibly moving, leading to an
impassioned affair. Complications arise (hey, it's Shakespeare _
we've got to have complications) when Viola is betrothed to the
insufferable Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) by the command of Queen
Elizabeth (Judi Dench).
</P>
<P>
   There's also a litany of other problems _ creditors,
sword-wielding rivals and the potential resurgence of the bubonic
plague _ with which to contend, not to mention the fact that
``Romeo'' still needs a third act. Again, Will finds his
inspiration through Viola, although you know better than to expect
a simplistic ``happily ever after'' for these two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is an embarrassment of riches that works
so well on so many levels that one could easily see it again and
again and find new bits of clever dialogue, bawdy sight gags and
insider references to Shakespearean lore. The filmmakers have
marvelously captured the look of the disparate worlds of the
Elizabethan era through the costumes, set design and makeup.
(Dentists will have to avert their eyes when some of the characters
smile.)
</P>
<P>
   Director John Madden (``Mrs. Brown'') keeps things moving at
breakneck speed, spreading the spotlight generously among his
expert supporting cast. Standouts include Ben Affleck, displaying
superb comic chops as a bombastic actor who was kind of the Tom
Cruise of Elizabethan theater, and Geoffrey Rush, playing the
fumbling, bumbling theater owner Philip Henslowe (one of many
historical characters), who watches in confusion as Shakespeare
transforms ``Romeo'' from a comedy to a tragedy. (His request for
Will to include a dog in the play is one of the film's many great
running jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes (younger brother of Ralph) and Paltrow are magical as
the film's young lovers, both displaying a mastery of language and
strong sexual magnetism. And, impossible as it may seem, they're
all upstaged by Dench's imperious Elizabeth, who commands the
camera (as the queen would her subjects) and steals every scene
she's in.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, what's so wonderful about ``Shakespeare in Love'' is
the imagination and unbridled zest with which the filmmakers tell
their fabulous tale. The movie celebrates Shakespeare and the
theater and creativity and, most of all, life itself with such
contagious enthusiasm that it's impossible not to be swept along
with all the passion and fun. It's an enterprise that Shakespeare
himself would no doubt wholeheartedly endorse. (But don't let that
scare you away.)

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' the ninth movie
about a Starship Enterprise that goes to increasingly
familiar-looking places no one has gone before, things aren't going
well. The fabled Federation of Planets is in decline, facing
challenges from opportunistic alien forces on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Is this art following life, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made in the past year about steep ratings drops
for ``Deep Space Nine'' and ``Voyager,'' the two ``Trek''
television series still running new episodes. The 7-year-old
``DS9'' is in its final season, and Rick Berman _ who oversees all
aspects of the late Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi creation for
Paramount Pictures _ confirms that there are no plans for a new
spinoff series in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to concern that the ``Next Generation'' crew will
be able to match the success of their last film, the dark, intense,
critically acclaimed ``First Contact,'' with the lighter, funnier,
more romantic ``Insurrection.'' Adding fuel to the pessimism, the
new film even sounds like one of those embarrassing, hippie-dippy
episodes from the original '60s TV show. It's set on and around an
isolated planet where atmospheric forces have kept a small
population of peace-loving agrarians, the Ba'ku, youthful for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that could also be another artistic reflection of
life, or at least of Berman's hope to revitalize the 32-year-old
``Trek'' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been suggested that this is all a metaphor for the
franchise, that this was a subliminal element in our development of
the story,'' says Berman, a harried-looking man who produced
``Insurrection'' and co-wrote its story with Michael Piller. ``I
say, if it was subliminal, I wouldn't be aware of it!
</P>
<P>
   ``But the franchise is a very wide area,'' he notes.
``Certainly, the two television shows that are on the air now in
the United States, their ratings are not what they were five or 10
years ago. But remember, when `Next Generation' went on the air in
1987, it was the only science-fiction show on television. There are
dozens of them now. `Star Trek' is now in competition with all
those shows, and it's also in competition with other `Star Trek'
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the television dial is still loaded with reruns of the
original, William Shatner/Leonard Nimoy ``Star Treks,'' and with
``The Next Generation'' episodes, which feature the current movie
crew of Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar
Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden and Marina Sirtis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stewart, the English Shakespearean who plays ``Next
Generation's'' hard-nosed Capt. Jean-Luc Picard, the pervasive
familiarity of all things ``Trek'' made it imperative that
``Insurrection'' warp in a different creative direction from
``First Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've struggled to remain fresh through 178 episodes and, now,
three movies,'' Stewart, who is also an associate producer of
``Insurrection,'' says. `` `First Contact' was a film we were all,
I think justly, proud of, and we could have done another one like
that. But I think that would have been uninteresting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so we looked to create a different world, a different
atmosphere, a different mood, a different tone for this one. `First
Contact' was so intense, so unrelentingly dramatic from the get-go.
My spiel 18 months ago was this: `Relax.' I know what fun this cast
can be, so why not tell an exciting story, but try to do it with a
little more humor and a little more ease _ and with a romantic
tone.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in ``Insurrection,'' Picard falls in love with babelike
Ba'ku earth mother Anij (Tony Award winner Donna Murphy), even
though she's old enough to be his great-great-great-grandma.
Meanwhile, the planet's rejuvenating powers rekindle the
long-dormant attraction between Cmdr. Riker (Frakes, who also
directed the film) and Counselor Troi (Sirtis).
</P>
<P>
   On a more comic note, the Klingon Worf (Dorn) regresses to an
embarrassing pubescent stage and android Lt. Cmdr. Data (Spiner)
gets in touch with his inner Furby. And for a touching touch, blind
engineer Geordi (Burton) gains the gift of sight.
</P>
<P>
   All of this Fountain of Youth wonderment is about to be taken
away, however, by the Son'a, a technologically advanced race so
obsessed with the concept of eternal life that their skin is
splitting from too many face lifts. They're in cahoots with some
Starfleet officials _ remember, the Federation's hold is slipping _
and in order to save the Ba'ku, Picard and company turn against
their own superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject of this film is not eternal youth,'' Stewart
explains, ``but rather the question of finding a way to
emotionally, psychologically and spiritually slow down. That's one
of the things that Picard learns in this film and, in good old
`Star Trek' fashion, we're gently, quietly saying some things about
a present-day condition.''
</P>
<P>
   And saying them in a newfangled, high-tech way, as far as the
``Trek'' universe is concerned, anyway. For the first time, all the
spaceships you'll see on screen are computer-generated images; only
the Son'a's orbiting atmosphere-sucking device is a more
traditional, miniature model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that the ships looked great,'' says Frakes, who also
directed the more spectacle-oriented ``First Contact.'' ``Part of
it was that we were in this remote section of space that was so
dark, it allowed the ships to look cooler. I think it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   What Frakes enjoyed even more, though, was being able to shoot a
good half of ``Insurrection'' in some wide-open California locales:
Lake Sherwood near Thousand Oaks and the mountains around Lake
Sabrina in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed this more as a result,'' Frakes says of directing
his second feature. ``We were outside for weeks, and it was
glorious. The stuff at the top of the mountain was so beautiful to
work with. It was outside of Mammoth, accessible only by helicopter
and mule.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all paradises are, to some degree, illusory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved it when we went there,'' Frakes recalls. ``We should
have known, though. When we scouted the location, we got back into
the van and all of us passed out on the way to lunch, to a man. The
high altitude screwed everybody up; people needed oxygen all the
time. I think that was the most challenging thing about directing
this film.
</P>
<P>
   ``That and, of course, wrangling Patrick and Brent.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiner had to perform ``Insurrection's'' most chilling stunt,
literally, when android Data has to check out an anomaly at the
bottom of a pristine mountain lake.
</P>
<P>
   A lake that was fed by El Nino-driven snowmelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they had put a crawl on that piece of film that said
`This lake is 40 degrees,' which it was,'' Spiner recalls with a
shiver. ``It was freezing. If I hadn't had to think about being my
character, I probably would have panicked. Thankfully, it worked on
the first take, and I didn't need to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe it doesn't sound as exciting as interstellar armada
battles or saving whole solar systems. That acknowledged, the cast
of ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is confident that their movie proves
there's still resilience in Roddenberry's rosy vision of mankind's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that on television, in general, that everybody's
numbers have gone down,'' Frakes observes. `` `Friends' numbers
have gone down. So I don't think those reports of `Star Trek'
fading are very well-founded; it seemed to be a bandwagon that
Entertainment Weekly was on. In fact, I think `Deep Space' is
probably having their best season ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this movie, I get the feeling, is going to wipe a lot of
that negative feeling away,'' Frakes concludes with typically
Trekkie optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cautious, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we, meaning Paramount and myself to some degree, have
to be very vigilant and careful not to overexploit it, and I think
it can be overexploited,'' ``Trek'' supervisor Berman says. ``One
can take too many trips to the well, and I think it is important
not to force too many eggs out of the golden goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying wisdom worthy of a starship captain, Stewart suggests
steering a steady, middle course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the overall franchise is quite healthy,'' he says. ``I
see no reason why _ with the proper regeneration, with the
introduction of fresh vision and insight and energy _ it should not
have a long life, way beyond my involvement in it.''

DAUGHTER'S DIARY SENDS A SCARY MESSAGE 
 FOR USE FRI., DEC. 11, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I just read my 16-year-old daughter's diary and found
out she's having sex. Do I confront her and admit I'm a snoop or
take the easy way out and pretend I don't know?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: If you tell your daughter you've been reading her diary,
she will rightly say there's no reason for her to try to earn your
trust, since she can't trust you. You two have some important
business to transact that has nothing to do with snooping.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to admit that you've read her diary (she may have
fantasized or hoped you'd find it), but you do have to make sure
she knows the basics about sex. She needs to know how you get
pregnant and how you don't, how to protect herself from unwanted
venereal disease (which means using a condom and spermicide EVERY
time to protect against AIDS).
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, she needs to know that she can say yes, but
she can also say no.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a terrific time to share some personal experiences,
if you can remember them, and not preach or judge. It's OK to
confess some of your own misgivings and mistakes. It will make her
feel less alone.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's a good time to involve her father in talking about
sex. When only mothers talk to daughters and fathers to sons, it
perpetuates the notion that sex is a dirty little joke.
</P>
<P>
   An ostrich approach to her sexuality may be more comfortable for
you, but it's dangerous for her.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: We had a wonderful dinner together, talked the evening
away, went dancing and ended up at my front door where he kissed me
sweetly and murmured, ``I'll call you soon.'' I thought he might
even call me from his cell phone on the way home to tell me how
terrific I am.
</P>
<P>
   But the phone didn't ring then or at work the next day or for a
whole week. When he finally called, I told him to forget it. I
wasn't going out with him ever again. Now I'm having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Einstein said time is relative, and he didn't know the
half of it. It's not only relative, it's sexual. There's a vast
difference between girl time and boy time.
</P>
<P>
   When a guy says, ``Call you soon,'' he means when I get around
to it, if I remember, when I've straightened out my love life, when
I get my finances in order, once the basketball season is over, or
never.
</P>
<P>
   To a woman, ``soon'' means within the next 24 hours at most, but
preferably when he gets home since he's so smitten he can't sleep
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Guys, when you say you're going to call, never use the word
``soon'' and never say you're going to call unless you think there
is at least a 75 percent chance you might within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gals, if he says, ``I'll call you soon,'' you can say, ``I'm
going to be in and out for the next couple of days--why don't you
give me your number and I'll call you in the next week?''
</P>
<P>
   A final point: Guys, if you really do intend to call, you'd be
amazed at the benefits you'll reap from calling sooner rather than
later.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I had been living in a furnished sublet for three
months following my separation when I met a terrific woman at a
singles dance. After six weeks of seeing each other every night, we
decided it was perfectly logical for me to move into her place. So
I did. She had been divorced four years and was ecstatic that we
were together.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later I'm wondering if I haven't made a colossal
mistake. She didn't talk about commitment during our whirlwind
romance, but all of a sudden she has become as possessive as a
prison warden and as jealous as my wife.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Lots of warning signs here. She views living together
as marriage with training wheels; you view it as a welcome
alternative to a dreary bachelor pad.
</P>
<P>
   As for your relationship, you ought not to be dating at all.
Separated means still married and married people don't date. If you
were single and had been dating each other for six to nine months,
you might have been able to compromise on a couple of nights
together at her house, a couple at yours and a couple alone,
allowing the process of disovery to unfold a bit more slowly.
You're moving at the speed of light past things you ought not to be
moving past at all.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly relationships aren't always sensible, but dealing
with your underlying convictions now will at least give impetuosity
a firmer base. In this relationship, she must acknowledge that your
unwillingness to be alone isn't the same as being committed to her.
And you need to remember that living together is a larger
commitment to her than to you.
</P>
<P>
   Move out, get your head together, your divorce in place,
apologize to this woman and make your life work for you. If you're
lonely, find a same-sex roommate or a puppy--don't prey on someone
with a nice living room.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton leaves tomorrow
(Saturday) on a crucial mission to the Middle East with his
presidency, and peace in the region, hanging in the balance.
Clinton will face four days of difficult diplomacy in Israel and
Palestine-controlled territory. More than simply pressing the
parties to live up to the promises they made in Washington last
month, the president's real challenge is to try to move forward a
peace process burdened by continuing conflict and the spread of

   EXECUTE-FAULDER _ The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was
expected to rule Thursday on whether Texas' closed clemency system
violates condemned prisoners' rights. A ruling against the system
could shut down executions in the state, including that of Joseph
Stanley Faulder, a Canadian whose case has galvanized death penalty
opponents in Canada. A stay in Faulder's execution was issued on
Wednesday and the Texas attorney general's office on Thursday
appealed the stay. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).

Washington is scheduled to decide how much tobacco makers must pay
attorneys who sued them for Texas, Missisppi and Florida.

   MOTHS _ The gypsy moth, that bane of the Northeastern forests
for a century, is slowly munching itself southward and for the
third time this decade has infested an area of North Georgia's
mountains. Federal and state forestry officials plan the aerial
spraying of biological insecticides across some 30,000 acres of
rugged and picturesque mountains along the Georgia-North Carolina

 &HT;    The woman who wouldn't die
 &HT;    EDITORS: REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING. THIS STORY IS RUNNING IN TWO
PARTS. THIS IS PART ONE. NOTE ITALIC PARAGRAPHS.
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I keep all my little horrors in this suitcase,'' Sandra
Manning says in the dim light of her living room.
</P>
<P>
   The American Tourister _ bright red and solid _ keeps everything
locked up tight. She flips it open, reaches in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' she says, matter-of-factly, fingering a faded
Polaroid, ``is the monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a handsome man, with mahogany skin and a big white smile,
and at the moment Sandy snapped the photo, he was perched on the
edge of a park fountain, hugging his three small children. The very
image, Sandy says, of ``a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Except now, in the American Tourister, is another picture _ the
regular guy's booking mug. No big white smile, just two glassy eyes
confronting the police camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's more. Tucked beneath the mug shot are the police
reports, which detail exactly what he did to her, on the winter
afternoon she almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the police reports are the court papers, which assign
Sandy Manning's monster to a brief prison term _ over, it seemed to
her, before the ink dried on the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a picture of Sandy, in her hospital bed, oxygen
tubes curling up to her nose, a blue pillow resting lightly across
her chest, covering the bandages that bind the holes her husband
made when he stabbed her over and over in the marsh beyond the
railroad tracks way out on the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The stab wounds healed.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, my babies, they're everything to me. They have
been through so many traumas in their short lives. One day life was
one way, and then it was just total upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey, 9, the oldest, she saw the most violence, so she
carries the most pain. She still dreams her father's going to stab
me, shoot me. I was in the tub one night and she came in, sat down
on the toilet seat, said, `Mommy, what will we do if Daddy Mike
kills you?' And I told her, `Only thing we can do is pray, baby,'
so that's what we did, right there on the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikey's 7, looks just like his daddy. When he started
kindergarten, he was real moody. Lately, he's been worse. One night
we were lying on the couch and he kept holding his breath, putting
the covers over his head, saying he didn't want to live in this
world, that it was too painful. Mikey's counselor thinks the night
terrors are tied in with the fear he's going to grow up like his
father. Mikey has told him, why does he have to have the same name
as the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney's the youngest, 6. She's very withdrawn. Courtney
will not talk to you. I mean, she will not talk to you. She was not
even a year old when all this happened, but I feel like the
after-effects have gotten to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids, they're angry because they don't have normalcy like
other kids do, not by a long shot. And they worry just as much as I
do that he's going to come back. One time Lindsey thought she saw
him at the Texaco and she ran home screaming, `Mommy! Mommy! I
think I saw Daddy Mike!' She just freaked out. I know just how she
feels because sometimes I think I see him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple way to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the shorthand people use when they have talked
about something too many times, Sandy will say, in a single breath,
to dispense with it: ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story _ perhaps you opened the morning
paper six years ago and saw the headline, or watched the TV news
accounts _ you think surely she must be exaggerating. Because who
on Earth could survive all that?
</P>
<P>
   Other times, if she's in an upbeat mood and doesn't want to
bring herself down, Sandy will refer to ``The Incident,'' pause a
bit for emphasis, and let it go at that. Only the very curious will
inquire further.
</P>
<P>
   To really understand what happened to Sandy Manning you would
have to know 100 little things:
</P>
<P>
   That one morning after a weekend of domestic abuse, she finally
got up her nerve to flee _ straight down Interstate 95 in her pink
nightgown with nothing but her three groggy children and the
promise of shelter in a safe house.
</P>
<P>
   That a few weeks later, while living an underground life, she
went to court in the morning to renew a restraining order against
her husband, and that very afternoon he forced her into his car at
knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the restraining order was on the front seat of the old
green Chrysler when he held the butcher knife to her throat and
ordered her to drive, north and west through Palm Beach County,
toward nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That when they crossed the long, high bridge on the Beeline
where she could see the tree tops blowing in the wind like unruly
mops of hair, she thought about jumping out, but he said drive
faster, Bitch _ and she fought back tears as her chance disappeared
in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually he parked on a lonely stretch of road and
dragged her across the railroad tracks, and it was here that he
stabbed her and held her face down in the brackish water and she
said the Lord is my shepherd until her mind went numb.
</P>
<P>
   That after he stabbed her, she pulled the knife from the spot
near her heart and nearly sliced her fingers off, and still today
she can't use her right hand to pick up a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   That afterward he dragged her back to the car, where he drank
Pepsi, and smoked Marlboro reds.
</P>
<P>
   That he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That he beat her with a tire iron, picked her up and kissed her
on the forehead. ``I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That when the cops came, he blamed the crime on two masked men.
</P>
<P>
   That throughout all of this _ for 17 ungodly hours _ Sandy
Manning felt herself slipping away. But then her three children
would visit some small, still-alive place in the back of her mind,
and she would tell herself, again and again, taking up a mantra,
``Sandy, don't you dare die. Sandy don't you dare die.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you knew 100 little things, you still would not know
the whole story, or even the most important part. Because after The
Incident there was an investigation, and after the investigation
there was a plea bargain, and after the plea bargain there was a
brief prison sentence, and after the prison sentence Mike Jones
went free, but the woman who had been his wife did not.
</P>
<P>
   After The Incident, Sandy Manning wasn't Sandy Manning anymore,
she was somebody else. Somebody who heard the monster's voice in
her head. Somebody who hid in the bathtub every time a floorboard
creaked. Somebody who three years later still could not chop fresh
vegetables for her children's dinner, because chopping fresh
vegetables means picking up a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen Sandy Manning. She is the woman staring
blankly at the cereal boxes in the grocery store; the incapacitated
soul in the welfare office trying to string together enough
benefits to keep the lights on in her small, dim apartment; the
weekly regular at group therapy, looking for magic answers when of
course there are none.
</P>
<P>
   She is the woman who drops out of the work force so he can't
find her, then fights her way back. The woman who swallows too many
pills and has her stomach pumped, and who in despair practices
holding a revolver to her temple. The woman who wants to clear out
of town because she's terrified _ and who wants to stay put because
she has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking over my shoulder forever,'' Sandy Manning
says. ``Because that day he hurt me, he killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 10, 1992. Sandy stops at her mom's house to pick up some
clothes, and there he is. He's hiding it, but he's angry. Angry she
left him, angry she took the kids and went to the safe house. Red
hot angry. They talk for a moment, and then she gets into the car,
ready to go, and suddenly he is in the seat behind her, the knife a
cold, sharp warning against her throat. Drive, he says. Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hours pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's mom, Sharon, and sister Diane know something is wrong,
so they get in the car and go _ west past the farm fields, past
Mike's old haunts, back and forth on the roads he traveled most,
where he knew the street signs, because although Sandy had tried to
teach him, he still couldn't read too well. Maybe he's holding
Sandy captive till she says she'll come back, they think, maybe
they're just holing up to talk, maybe they're making up. Maybe,
maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and everybody knows what nobody's saying when
Sandy's mom turns on the news. On the screen, at St. Mary's, a
Trauma Hawk lands, depositing a stretcher, and on the stretcher is
a woman, and before Sandy's mom can process the image, the awful
truth of it, the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, We have your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She says she loves you, and please, please take
care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is 28, pretty, with the strong, broad features of her
Scandinavian ancestors, luminous green eyes and light brown hair
that picks up highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she colors it, and once you get to know her, you
realize the color says something about how she is feeling: Her hair
is a flat, dull brown when she has been depressed; it is a lighter,
brighter shade on the weeks she is successful in keeping
appointments with doctors and social workers; and on really fine
days, after the children bring home good report cards or counseling
has been particularly enlightening, it is a beautiful, soft shade
of strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has had so many setbacks in life, so many secrets, you
half expect her to pull the curtains and retreat, but withdrawal is
not in her nature. She is at heart an extrovert who relishes her
connections with the world; and despite all that has happened, or
perhaps because of it, she can be uncommonly empathetic and
generous, as if she would like to give to others all the security
and comfort she has been deprived. If, for example, while driving
to the store or the doctor's she happens to intersect with somebody
carrying a white bucket to collect change for a good cause,
especially one for children, she will give the solicitor not a few
quarters but a fistful of dollars _ then thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's dream, before Mike took it, was to win a music
scholarship to college. She still keeps a tattered Polaroid of
herself singing a Gloria Estefan hit at her high school talent
show. The auditorium was so dark that the picture is almost
entirely black, except for Sandy, the star soloist, up on stage,
arms spread wide, incandescent in a white dress in the last sweet
time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, if you walk past her apartment window, you might hear
her deep, gutsy voice doing justice to a gospel tune, or coaching
Lindsey through a Mariah Carey hit. Her oldest daughter doesn't
always reach the high notes, and sometimes she forgets the words,
but like Sandy, she has a voice full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time, baby,'' Sandy will say. ``Be patient and
you'll get it right one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's sister Betty loves to tell the story of how Sandy won a
big dance contest sponsored by Easter Seals when she was 7. When
Betty mentions this to a reporter, to make sure she understands her
sister had genuine talent _ that she could sing and dance _ Sandy
buries her face in her hands, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Mish,'' Betty says, calling her little sister by her
childhood nickname. ``You have to tell the good things about
yourself, too. You can't just tell the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the good things?'' Sandy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Betty. ``You are a good singer, and a good
person. And you are a very good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so much bad has happened to you, I think you forget to
take any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Olson was 15, a lovely high school sophomore who liked to
study, when she met a 19-year-old Job Corps trainee named Mike
Jones. It was Dec. 5, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a date, exactly. Sandy had a friend who was seeing
Mike's cousin, and one night they all went out. Sandy remembers two
things about this meeting. The first is that she was glad her mom
wasn't home, because Michael is black and her mother would never
approve of an interracial relationship. The second is how sorry she
felt for Mike once she got to know him, even just a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in the back seat and talked and talked. First it was
the easy stuff _ school, my hobbies, my favorite colors. But
Michael came from a family that had experienced extreme poverty and
violence. He told me in such detail about how his dad beat his mom
_ until she literally had to pile the kids on a bus and get out of
town _ that he just had me crying tears. I felt so sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would call me the next day, and that night I went
home and I was lying in bed
</P>
<P>
   thinking, `I don't want to date this guy.' He had so many
problems, I was praying he wouldn't like me. But the next day the
phone rang, and it was Michael, and I just had this overwhelming
feeling of _ I don't know _ pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing on Mike's part, but soon after, he and Sandy
were an item. Mike was so attentive. He brought her flowers, movie
tickets, a plastic red rose that lighted up _ even a lobster tail
from Red Lobster, where he had taken a job as a dish washer and
moved up to prep cook. They went to concerts, and, because they
loved coffee and conversation, to the doughnut shop down the street
for the $6.99 steak-and-egg special. The romance was short on
money, but Sandy thought it had a fairy tale quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest thing,'' she says. ``Back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she got pregnant and things unraveled. Michael and his
mother were thrilled at the news, Sandy recalls, and went out right
away to look for cribs; but her own mother and sister saw things
differently. Mike was too domineering, they said. Sandy, sweet 16,
was too young. So her sister drove her to a clinic, and, sobbing,
Sandy had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at her family's urging, she hopped a plane to her old
hometown in upstate New York, to stay with another sister.
Everybody she knew said better to end things now, make a clean
break, vanish until he forgets you, but Sandy had a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Once before she had tried to break up with Mike, to concentrate
on her schoolwork, and he had protested by dropping to his knees in
the middle of the street, vowing to kill himself. So what would he
do now that she had had an abortion and cleared out of town?
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, she had her answer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messed up all his intestines,'' Sandy says. ``And instantly
this became my fault, in Michael's mind, and in mine. I felt so
guilty I took an extreme measure _ I got back together with him,
and I threw away my birth control. I know how crazy this sounds
now, but back then, I didn't care what my family thought; to make
everything right, I was going to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's exactly what I did _ quit school, find a job, get
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he hit her? My God, Sandy says, you don't forget
something like that. You keep it on instant replay in your head.
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from the grocery and was running through
their Lake Park townhouse calling Mike's name, so he could help
unload bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him in the upstairs bathroom with a Cool Whip bowl
full of these little white things. He had a can and had scrunched
it down and made it into a pipe. Well, Mike used to smoke reefer,
but this stuff was new to me. So I said, `Is that drugs?' And he
said, `Crack.' He told me to go downstairs and start cooking.
Later, when he still didn't come out, I ran back upstairs and
opened the bathroom door, and I took the bowl and said, `I'm
throwing this in the toilet.' He got mad. Slapped me. Pushed me. I
rolled down the stairs, and then he went back and did his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always starts, with a first slap or punch, then
another, and another. And so it goes for Sandy, in her 18th year.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, to try to put him in a good mood, or at least a
better one, she tucks a napkin under his neck and serves up bacon,
eggs, grits, pancakes, biscuits, sausage _ then gets the juice
thrown in her face because it isn't chilled. Nights he smashes
dirty plates on the kitchen floor. There are many accusations _
where have you been? Are you cheating on me? No. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't matter. He's hitting her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first child, she runs. Her mom says, ``Baby,
come home,'' and she does. But the monster knows where she is all
the time. He follows her to the store, the bus stop, the doctor's
office. She's so scared she sleeps at the foot of her mother's bed,
with a machete. Her stepdad has an ax.
</P>
<P>
   She asks for help, and the police say get a restraining order,
so they can arrest him when he comes close _ but Mike's a magician,
good at disappearing. Sandy swears to the ominous, off-the-record
remarks of one officer, a woman: ``Honey, if he comes for you, the
only sure thing you can do is shoot him, then drag him in the house
and make it look like a break-in. Because this kind of man, he
doesn't give up until he gets what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he disappears for seven months, only to turn up at her
baby-sitting job. Come back to me, he says, or I'll kill your
family, one by one. Don't hide from me, he says, because I'll find
you. And she believes him, so, yes, she goes back. He lays off, for
a while. Then one day she makes the wrong kind of Kool Aid, and the
next thing she knows she's flying across the dining room with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on like this. Except when she's pregnant with her
younger children. He wants a boy and she's afraid of what he will
do if she says no, so they have Mikey. He forces her to have sex,
and her birth control fails, so they have Courtney. When she's
pregnant, he's Superdad _ and this is deceiving. For a while, she
has hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds God. They go to church. Four times a week they're
bowing their heads in the pew, and she's praying, Lord, please make
things different, but afterward, back home, he hits her. Once he
calls her a devil in front of the whole congregation, and she runs
out of church to weep on the front steps. A deacon counsels him,
but it doesn't sink in.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   He hurls a coffee table at her, and the glass shatters in
glittery pools around the children's feet. He speeds down Federal
Highway, calling her names, slams the brakes so hard Lindsey flies
from her safety seat into the dashboard. In the driveway one day,
when she is sick with a kidney infection and confined to a
wheelchair, he tries to run over her with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest baby is on her lap. She thinks, ``This is it.'' She
thinks, ``No more.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she drops him at his tree-trimming job and
kisses him on the cheek, so he won't suspect. And then she is
flying down I-95, her pink nightgown fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 11, 1992. Sandy is covered in blood and mud, and a tangle
of vines from the bog plugs the hole in her chest, and it is just
like this, a creature half alive, that she rises from the muck at
the Tri-Gas plant, on the Beeline Highway near Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so quiet, so damn deserted, a rescue seems
impossible _ but suddenly out of nowhere in the mist of the dawn,
two early shift workers appear at the gate. Mike says, ``Hey,
fellas, call a tow truck, I'm stuck in the mud.'' But they're not
stupid, so they call the sheriff, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy hangs on. Hangs on until the cops come, and the
ambulance, and the Trauma Hawk. Hangs on until the hospital, where
a detective leans low over her stretcher, and _ safe at last, if
you can call it that _ she says in a voice surprisingly strong:
Forget about two masked men. My husband did this. His name is
Michael Anthony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stab wounds in all, scattered like some sick
connect-the-dots game across her stomach, her chest, her upper
arms, her ears. Her hands are like mincemeat where she grabbed the
butcher knife, and the fingers on her right hand flop around like a
marionette's. The knife pierced her lung and her breath comes in
jagged little spurts.
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy asks the doctor if she will live, he looks a long
time at her, bandaged like a mummy and lost in a jungle of plastic
tubing, and very softly, he says, ``Honey, you should have been
dead 16 hours ago.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1993, in Courtroom 315 of the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, Mike Jones pleaded guilty to attempted first degree
murder and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the crime and then confessed to it made a
speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been searching myself, wondering why things happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a person of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got plenty of love in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He got eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sandy wondered aloud if that was how long she had to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``After The Incident, I held up real good. I was in this support
group for battered women, and I told them my whole story. People
thought, `Oh, this girl is wonderful!' I was like a role model for
people who were going to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, Michael plea bargained, and I just lost it. What
happened was, I met with the prosecutor and she handed me the
doctor's reports on Michael, which explained how upset he was about
the abortion and me leaving for the women's shelter and taking the
kids. The gist was that he was insane at the time he did this to
me. So the idea was, we go to trial, he might get off by reason of
insanity, and if we go for the plea, then at least we keep him in
the system for his prison term, and then 15 years' probation. So I
had 24 hours to decide, and I took the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after Mike went to prison, I just broke down. I
started hearing his voice in my head, and one day I flipped out on
Lindsey. She was yelling at me about something, and I got it in my
head she was her father. I put my hand over her mouth and nose and
I didn't let go. Her eyes started fluttering, and then I came to
and realized this was my daughter I was trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up at St. Mary's. Three weeks of intense therapy. One
hundred different medications. They couldn't tell me if I'd ever be
well, but I took the medicine and I saw a therapist, and I just
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day, at group, this old lady started talking
about how her husband had thrown her against the wall and something
in me just clicked. Because this woman reminded me of my
grandmother, and here somebody was beating the hell out of her, and
I just thought, `God, does it ever end?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, I left the meeting, screaming, and I went to the
water fountain. I had two bottles of pills with me, and I opened
them up and I took them all. I just wanted it to be over, all the
violence. I wanted out. Waking up in the hospital and realizing I
hadn't been successful _ that I hadn't killed myself _ that was
just the worst feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time, I'm doing the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because right around this time, the Nicole Simpson case broke,
and O.J. was the suspect, and suddenly domestic violence was this
really hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on Geraldo and Montel, and they said I had a real good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for Sandy's condition. Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. She was propped up in a psychiatric ward when she got the
diagnosis. Nightmares. Hallucinations. Anxiety attacks. Depression.
Flashbacks. Panic. Numbness. It all fit.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the post-trauma illness as a wartime
affliction, but it can be triggered by any traumatic event: rape,
torture, child abuse, a hurricane, a flood. Or, as too many women
can testify, near-death at the hands of the men they married.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sandy got the diagnosis, she thought the wartime
explanation might be the best, after all. Hadn't she just been
through a war? Wasn't the Beeline her battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Anderson, who has 20 years' experience as a case manager at
the 45th Street Mental Health Center in West Palm Beach, tried to
help Sandy put the fragments of her life together in 1994, when she
was living in a part of town where drug shootings are not just
something you read about. He remembers how smart she seemed _ and
how scared.
</P>
<P>
   Of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mike Jones had an eight-year sentence _ but that was just
on paper. In real life, he would be out before her youngest baby
finished kindergarten. Then what would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy was having visual terrors of being stabbed,'' Anderson
says. ``In layman's terms, she was having flashbacks. She was
absolutely terrified. When something like this happens, if you
don't get help, you wind up like the Vietnam vet who disappears
into the mountains and fights the war for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irreconcilable misery to be married to the man who
almost killed you, and so, while Mike Jones was in jail awaiting
trial, Sandy did the only logical thing. Divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she had found somebody else. You might even say
Mike Jones introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few months before The Incident, and Mike had just
dropped off Sandy at her job with an answering service in Riviera
Beach, where she worked triple shifts to pay their rent. In the
parking lot, they fought. She was still sniffling when she sat down
at her desk _ with a black eye _ and the first call came in.
Something about a leaky sink. Please beep Jerry Manning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry called back, Sandy tried to deliver the leaky-sink
message, but she was sobbing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry had a soft, deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   So she told him. The whole unbearable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, honey,'' he said, ``you sound like a real nice lady.
You got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   They met for the first time three months later, after the
</P>
<P>
   Trauma Hawk deposited Sandy's ravaged body at St. Mary's. When
she opened her eyes after surgery, she saw Jerry, standing over her
bed with a teddy bear, no longer just a soft-deep voice on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy thought getting married and buying a sweet little house
together and setting up shop as a blended family, his kids, hers,
might help her start over in life, but she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1996 when they said their vows _ and not too much later
when they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manning tried, but he stepped into a crowded marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry. Sandy. And her monster.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is high noon on a beautiful autumn day in 1997, and Sandy has
just washed her hair and put on a pretty gray shorts set for an
emergency meeting with the principal and teachers at her children's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency is, her ex-husband is about to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones' travels through the prison system were entirely
typical _ up to a point. He served 321 days in the county jail,
followed by three years in prison, and then, because Florida's
prisons were crowded and one way to empty them was to let inmates
out early, he was all set to walk out of his prison digs up near
the Georgia line _ a bus ticket south tucked in his pocket _ when
there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   He had no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   No job.
</P>
<P>
   No plan.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of monitoring his 15-year probationary term
didn't want him landing on Sandy's doorstep _ in a letter to a
judge, a Department of Corrections administrator noted that Sandy
was ``in extreme fear for her life and the safety of her children''
_ so they took the unusual step of having him assigned to a
Probation and Restitution Center in Central Florida for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy plops down in the principal's office. Fiddles with her
purse straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he tries to take the kids?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal raises her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he disguises himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal jots a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he has a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just her children's physical safety Sandy worries
about. Lately her kids have been doing well in school, but Sandy
remembers what happened this time last year, when Mike's prison
term expired, before the judge sent him to the probation center:
Mikey stopped focusing on his schoolwork and started obsessing
about the safety of his family. A worried old man at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my mom,'' he told his teacher then, and looking
into his small, round face, she knew right away his mom wasn't the
only one he was scared for.
</P>
<P>
   The principal pulls up her chair, touches Sandy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The school, she says, will do everything it can to make sure her
kids are safe. And she and the teachers will get them extra
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy smiles. But under the table, her knees are shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says it, but everybody's thinking it:
</P>
<P>
   What about Sandy? Who's helping Sandy?
</P>
<P>
   November 1997. What is fear, undiluted, uncontrollable fear?
</P>
<P>
   It is the phone ringing and a voice you can't place hissing,
``Gonna getcha, gonna getcha.'' It is a stranger outside your
house, inexplicably snapping a picture. It is your ex-husband's
relatives finding your apartment, dropping by for the first time in
years, saying, casually, ``Just want to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you're doing: A stranger cuts through your yard, you
hide in the tub. A palm frond tickles the window, you punch 911.
You pack your kids off to grandma's house, then shake like a leaf
alone in your bed. You come across his mug shot, and suddenly he's
in the room. You think you're safe working at a little
hole-in-the-wall restaurant _ who possibly could find you there? _
and then your boss gets a call from a stranger, asking too many
questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   You say his name, your scars itch.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the benefits office, the lady says, ``Why not file for
child support?'' You say no because you can just see his face the
day he opens his paycheck and it's short. You can hear him mutter,
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   You move again. Change your phone again. Call the county clerk's
office, ask to seal your address. Use an alias. Hand out his
picture. You check with the cops, the probation officer, the
courthouse. You know what everybody says? ``Get a restraining
order.'' This seems so preposterous you laugh. You tell your kids,
``Don't walk alone, not even down the block.'' Tell your mom, ``If
anything happens to me, I want you to sue the whole damn state.''
</P>
<P>
   And then.
</P>
<P>
   He gets out.
</P>
<P>
   And you draw the blinds and lock yourself in.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's worksheet:
</P>
<P>
   During a fight, what can you do to protect yourself?
</P>
<P>
   lockdoor hide
</P>
<P>
   Who can you call to help?
</P>
<P>
   cops
</P>
<P>
   Make a plan: When I see:
</P>
<P>
   Micke call 911
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it, Mom,'' the kids say. ``Read us the story. Read it so
we know what happened. What really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper clipping is titled ``The Woman Who Wouldn't Die,''
and Sandy keeps it pinned to the back of her bedroom door, so that,
in her lowest moments, when she undresses and sees her scars _
shining like fresh white wounds _ she can remind herself that she's
tough, that she survived. That headline is her Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Read it, Mom. They already know the rough outline, of course,
but an outline is a lusterless substitute for a story in its flesh,
and they know this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really hurt you? Why can't we be a family anymore? Her
babies are standing shoulder to shoulder like little soldiers by
the bedroom door, and they are so insistent, so certain, so
tormented, that she gives in. But she is a careful censor, careful
about what she leaves out, about how she delivers the truth of what
their daddy did.
</P>
<P>
   When she finishes, Courtney is crying, and the corners of
Mikey's mouth turn down, the way they do when a math problem is too
hard, or a vocabulary word stumps him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey, the oldest, stands perfectly still, then draws an
arm around her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is an accelerated reader.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been in mother's bedroom many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is sitting on her bed, wearing purple, because purple will
hide the blood.
</P>
<P>
   She has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She puts it to her temple, then under her chin, practicing
different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey needs help in math.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's so moody.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney climbs onto my lap when she's sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under her chin. To her temple.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps five minutes, but feels much longer than that,
when Sandy tiptoes across the hall in the middle of the night to
check on the children.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she pours a cup of coffee and three bowls of
Fruit Loops, and everybody comes running for breakfast, just like
always.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what about your night terrors, Little Man?'' the pretty
lady counselor says.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey looks at her with big wet eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty scary, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout we make a picture of them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to punch the balloon next time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   It feels good to punch a balloon when you're angry.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Saturday morning, and the pretty lady named Zoe is
trying to find the key to unlock Mikey. She and her partner, Matt,
are from the Children's Home Society, a new program called the
Child Witness to Violence Project, which helps youngsters who have
seen far too much of what they should not see at all.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Anderson and Zoe Costello first knocked on Sandy's door the
week Mike Jones went free, and they have been back many times since
to assist Sandy in practical ways _ doctors' appointments,
shopping, parenting techniques _ but mostly, they listen. To all
the stuff she and the kids don't usually talk about. ``All the dark
spots,'' Sandy says. Sandy's dark spots go back to childhood, when
she was raped by a relative. ``I learned early,'' she tells Matt,
``how to be a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking helps.
</P>
<P>
   Matt asks Sandy to sign a contract: If she is thinking about
hurting herself, she is supposed to call right away.
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a diary, and after a while she stops looking
over her shoulder to see if anybody is snooping when she writes, on
a bad day, ``God, if you can hear me, please help!''
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a daily agenda. Her whole day is mapped out,
from 6 a.m., when she gets up to make coffee, until 8:30 p.m., when
Lindsey goes to bed. In between, she reads the paper, exercises
(after The Incident, her weight ballooned), cleans the house, helps
with homework, cooks the dinner, bathes the kids, slides in a tape
and out-Mariahs Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Her last assignment, right before bed, is to look in the mirror
and repeat a sentence:
</P>
<P>
   ``I, Sandy Manning, am a good person, and I'm going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On good days, she almost believes it.
</P>
<P>
   It is afternoon, a clean, blue, spring day, and Sandy is
scrubbing kitchen counters with the window open, a breeze
fluttering in. She has freshly painted nails, a pretty blue dress
and beautiful strawberry blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Life is looking up. Just recently, she moved her family into a
cheerful new apartment, decorated it with throw rugs and family
photos and banners from her favorite team, the Cowboys (cowboys,
you know, are tough). And on the kitchen table there is a boom box,
which means that Sandy never does dishes without LeAnn Rimes
singing How Do I Live as back-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy likes to think of the apartment as the place she and the
kids will start fresh, put all the junk behind them and live _ dare
she say it? _ a more or less normal life. As if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, free now for nearly half a year, is living in
Lakeland, where, Sandy hears, he is working at a restaurant and
reporting regularly to his probation officer. When she feels
jittery, she pulls out the court papers and checks the terms of his
15-year probation, forbidding him from having contact with her or
her children.
</P>
<P>
   In the court file, she knows, there is also a note from Judge
Roger B. Colton of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit that states that
Mike ``should serve his probationary period outside of Palm Beach
County and/or in an area other than where the victim in this case
resides.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a comfort _ but not a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy looks out the window, ticks off recent developments:
Mikey's night terrors are worse. Lindsey still cries a lot. Sandy
still hides in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   But some good things have happened, too, and in Sandy's mind
these are worth remarking upon, because it has been a very long
time since she has been able to list so many.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy took all the kids to Kmart, and right there in the middle
of the aisle, Lindsey crossed her arms and said, ``We're not
leaving, Mom, until you buy yourself something nice,'' and that is
how Sandy got her new pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney got student of the month, and Sandy posted the
certificate on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Matt took Sandy to sit for a practice exam to earn her GED, and
she couldn't believe it but she did really well.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some news. Sandy heard it through the grapevine,
confirmed it with a probation officer. Mike Jones met somebody, got
serious fast _ and just got married.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Ham, 10th Circuit administrator for the Department of
Corrections, asks Mike if he will talk to a reporter for a story
about Sandy, he declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned that he doesn't want to cause any more pain and
confusion for his children,'' Ham says.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy pauses a long time when she hears this.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' she finally says. ``If it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday. Dead summer. She sees him.
</P>
<P>
   He is backing a white van into his cousin's driveway, a few
blocks from her apartment, and when she passes by on her way to a
manicure, God as her witness, he leans out and waves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike all right, she tells herself.
</P>
<P>
   She recognizes his smile.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   She's 100 percent certain.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Manning floors it, and after she adjusts the rearview
mirror, she takes a good long look back.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7, 1998. On the Saturday morning Sandy Manning left
Florida, she packed six worn suitcases and three pillows for the
kids, and she said her goodbyes on the phone and in her sister's
living room, and if she cried once she cried a dozen times. And
then she loaded everybody up in a little gray station wagon for the
ride to the Amtrak station, where in the few minutes she had while
waiting for the Silver Service she opened up the newspaper and
checked her horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Let go.''
</P>
<P>
   She had whispered about the plan for days, weeks, months. For a
long time, nobody thought she was serious; after all, she had left
town once before, a few years ago, only to come back a short time
later. So saying a thing and doing it are two different
enterprises, as Sandy Manning will tell you. But she will tell you,
too, that sometimes you have to do a thing, even if you're not
absolutely positive it is the right thing, because when you examine
your options you realize you have no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   So she had thought it all out. She had her priorities. And her
first priority was not to run into Mike Jones on her way to a nail
appointment. Or at the Texaco. Or anywhere else, for that matter.
Her first priority was not to run into him at all.
</P>
<P>
   And so on Halloween night, Sandy's family threw her a going-away
party at a karaoke joint, and since Sandy is a woman who
appreciates symbolism, she sang the old Gladys Knight hit about
leaving on a midnight train to Georgia. And right then, everyone
knew her departure was a sure thing, sure and true.
</P>
<P>
   Where she went, that's a secret. Just say it's a place far, far
away. A place where she has people who care about her and the
prospect of a good job. A place where she will live in a nice house
in a safe neighborhood, and the kids will have their own bedrooms,
freshly painted in their favorite colors, and out back there will
be a trampoline to jump on before they do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon Sandy left town _ one year and a day after Mike
Jones went free _ her train stopped in a Central Florida town where
the sun cut dappled patterns on the cobblestone as she and her
children walked toward Pizza Hut for one last celebration. If you
are going to do a thing, Sandy figured, it is best to do it right.
So she put a dollar in the jukebox, and Tracy Chapman belted out
Give me one reason to stay here. And everybody thought the pizza
tasted so, so good.
</P>
<P>
   After that they were on the train again. The kids pressed their
faces against the glass and smiled at the glittery night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way, babies,'' Sandy said.
</P>
<P>
   And when in the mist of the dawn the train whisked across the
state line, carrying them up and away, she sank to her knees on the
cold, rattling floor, unfolded a note she had written to God, and
prayed.

`JACK FROST' IS A SLUSHY MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theory is that if more than two writers are credited with a
screenplay, a sick film has needed doctoring. ``Jack Frost,'' which
had four writers toy with a borrowed plot, would seem to be proof.
</P>
<P>
   Jack (Michael Keaton) is a musician who's ``due for a break.''
His Jack Frost Band lives on the road, hoping for a miracle _ a
record deal. Back home in Medford, a tiny town with such sweet
values it might give Martha Stewart withdrawal symptoms, his wife
Gabby (Kelly Preston) and son, Charlie (Joseph Cross), miss him
terribly. But they're tired of his many broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   On a rare few days off, Jack and Charlie build a snowman and
Jack gives his son a harmonica he bought the night Charlie was
born. He tells him, ``No matter where I am if you play this, I'll
hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack's band gets a chance at his dream _ an audition with
the head of a record company. Predictably, he's forced to break his
word again. Charlie gets angry and gives him back his harmonica. En
route to his big gig, Jack has a twinge of guilt. He realizes how
much Gabby and Charlie mean to him and he botches the deal in order
to return home. The roads are icy and the snow is thick and Jack
crashes and dies.
</P>
<P>
   A year passes and Charlie, in his grief, is withdrawn and
sullen. He recalls how he and Jack built a snowman. Charlie builds
another and then finds the harmonica. He plays it and suddenly,
Jack Frost is nipping at his toes. Jack comes back in a snowman's
body and he's intent on being a true father and making up for all
his past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Jack Frost'' is a sloppily written rehash of
just about every other other film where a dad disappoints his son
due to a career. It tiredly yanks from ``E.T.'' with yet another
scene where a kid and an alien spy each other and scream. It also
attempts to mirror the innocence of classics such as ``It's A
Wonderful Life.'' Worse, the film copies already recycled films,
``City of Angels,'' ``Ghost'' and ``Michael,'' by striving to
demystify death and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Not a frame of the film rings true. There isn't one emotion,
thought or response that hasn't been lifted from some other source.
And Michael Keaton acts so irresponsibly smug and cool it's hard to
believe he'd ever have a catharsis, no matter how he comes back to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Jack Frost'' just plain looks and feels worn out and
cheesy. Even cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs' distinct visual talent
can't mask the bad special effects in the ridiculous snowboarding
segments.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Frost. Directed by Troy Miller. Written by Mark Steven
Johnson, Steve Bloom, Jonathan Roberts, Jeff Cesario. Cast: Michael
Keaton, Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross. Warner Bros. 96 minutes. Rated
PG for language.

</P>
<P>
   APPLES-WASHINGTON (Washington) _ Like Brasilia, Canberra and
other created capitals, cities custom-built as seats of government,
Washington has been bad-mouthed from the very beginning. Jefferson
called it ``that Indian swamp in the wilderness.'' John F. Kennedy
famously remarked that our fair capital was full of ``Northern
charm and Southern efficiency.'' But most visitors come not to
tut-tut at the hard streets where the city's poor live, not to
count the ways the government falls short of the Founding Fathers'
ideals, but to pay homage to the ideals themselves, to keep the
ideals alive and try to imbue the kids with them. That is why
Washington is thronged several times each year with family groups,
shod in their Reeboks, maps in hand, taking in the American dream.
By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY (New York) _ On the growing recognition that Off
Broadway and Off Off Broadway nonprofit theaters are receiving.
Typically these theaters have toiled in obscurity and struggled to
make ends meet. But the critical success of recent productions like
``Wit,'' ``This Is Our Youth'' and ``Killer Joe'' has lured more
conventional theatergoers below Times Square, boosting ticket
sales, building new audiences and attracting commercial Broadway
producers to sniff around for possible imports. By Robin Pogrebin.

   Although transportation has long held a top ranking in the list
of regional concerns, it soared to a new high in the annual poll,
with 40 percent of all those surveyed citing it as the most
important problem facing the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emphatic response,'' observed Sunne Wright McPeak,
president and chief executive of the Bay Area Council, a public
affairs organization sponsored by regional businesses. ``The fact
that this many Bay-area residents cite transportation as our top
problem, in response to an open-ended question nonetheless, should
send an unmistakable message to the region's policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Education, which in the last poll ranked as the seventh overall
concern, rose to a distant second, with 14 percent listing it as
their top worry. In the last poll, 6 percent listed education as
their top worry in the last poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which has been conducted by the Bay Area Council
annually _ with the exception of last year _ since 1980, is
sponsored by businesses to gauge opinion about quality of life and
business development.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Research Corporation interviewed 603 residents in the
nine Bay-area counties during October in compiling the survey. The
margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of those surveyed said the region's highway
system was worse than the previous year, while 48 percent said road
conditions had deteriorated and 36 percent said public
transportation was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are probably best explained by the ever-increasing
amount of time people are spending in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, motorists in the Bay area lost an average of 90,000
hours per day sitting in gridlock. That's an increase of 31 percent
over 1996 when the average stood at 68,000 hours per day, according
to Russell Hancock, vice president of the Bay Area Council.
</P>
<P>
   If all of the area's congested freeways were placed end to end,
the number of gridlocked roadways would measure 284 miles on any
given day, compared to 217 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As crime rates locally and nationally have continued to drop in
recent years, so has concern over personal safety. Listed as the
top concern four years ago, with 34 percent of all respondents
defining it as the Bay area's biggest problem in 1994, it fell to
24 percent in the last survey in 1996, and to 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All measures for serious crimes, murders, assaults and battery
have been dropping nationwide, so we can take heart in those
numbers and it's only fitting that people feel better about that
issue,'' said Alexander Winslow, director of communications for the
Bay Area Council.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the economy also dropped significantly as the
region, which five years ago wallowed in a recession, experienced
one of the nation's strongest economic booms. Only 6 percent cited
the economy as their biggest worry in 1998 compared with 10 percent
in 1996 and 32 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``These responses are a reflection of the good economic times
that the Bay area has enjoyed for some three or four years now,''
McPeak said. ``During this period, the Bay area has displayed one
of the nation's most robust regional economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the region's real estate market, with
skyrocketing prices, struck a nerve when respondents were asked
about their quality of life. Reacting to housing prices, which
soared to record levels for the year before cooling slightly in the
fall, four out of five surveyed said that the cost of houses had
gotten worse over the past year. When that same question was asked
in 1995, 30 percent of the respondents said housing costs were
worse than the previous year.

<P>
   One of space travel's most pressing but least known problems _
what to do with dirty underwear _ could soon be solved. Russian
scientists are designing a cocktail of bacteria to digest
astronauts' cotton and paper underpants. The resulting methane gas
could be used to power spacecraft, they claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a revolution in the science of biodegradation,''
says Vyacheslav Ilyin, project director and head of the microbial
ecology laboratory at the Russian State Research Centre's Institute
for Biological and Medical Problems in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The disposal unit will be able to process plastic, cellulose and
other organic waste aboard a spacecraft. ``Cosmonauts identify
waste as one of the most acute problems they encounter in space,''
Ilyin says. Each astronaut produces an average of 2.5 kilograms _
or up to 9 liters _ of uncompressed waste a day. To keep waste to a
minimum, they are forced to wear underwear for up to a week at a
time. Onboard laundry facilities are rare in space, although the
Russian space station Mir does contain a shower.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard Mir, waste is stored in sealed containers until a
Progress supply module arrives with fresh supplies. Waste is then
transferred to the module, which burns up and disintegrates as it
re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. But Progress modules only call
about twice a year. Meanwhile, stored waste builds up on the
station, taking up valuable space and posing a potential health
threat to crew.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the most suitable combination of microbes is
expected to take up to a decade. Many of the strains are stored in
national and international collections. The researchers aim to have
the complete microbial disposal unit ready by 2017, when Russia
hopes to launch its first crewed interplanetary mission, possibly
to Mars. &QL;

<P>
   A photographer has patented a device that motorists could use to
blind the roadside cameras that are designed to catch them breaking
the speed limit or jumping traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   Alwyn Morris, a photographer from Chesterfield in Derbyshire,
England, says that an electronically triggered flash gun mounted on
a moving car could dazzle any roadside law-enforcement camera. His
patent application (GB 2 324 858) threatens to pitch Britain's
Department of Trade, which runs the Patent Office, squarely against
the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and
the police.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the development, the police and the DETR admitted
that they do not know how to stop it from being used.
</P>
<P>
   In his work, Morris routinely uses ``slave'' flash guns, which
sense when a main flash gun fires and trigger themselves to provide
additional light. There is a small delay, but this doesn't matter
because the camera shutter stays open for much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the slave guns point away from the camera to
illuminate the subject being photographed. If a slave flash fires
back into the camera lens, it is so bright that it overloads the
film and spoils the picture. But Morris realized that this is
sometimes exactly what is needed _ and filed his patent application
on the benefits this can bring.
</P>
<P>
   For example, slave guns positioned next to pictures in an art
gallery will prevent visitors from taking their own photos instead
of paying for prints and postcards. Similarly, fashion and jewelry
designers could foil rivals who want to steal their ideas, by
making it impossible for them to take photos while items are on
show.
</P>
<P>
   But potentially the most popular application is in countering
the speed cameras that police in Britain, Europe, Australia, South
America, the United States and the Middle East have set up at
roadsides, and which are credited with cutting accidents in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Each camera has a radar speed detector, and points at a series
of white markings painted on the road. When it detects a vehicle
breaking the speed limit, it triggers two flashlit exposures
separated by a fixed time interval. As well as recording the
distance the vehicle has traveled in the time between the two
shots, and hence its speed, it shows the car's registration plate
so that the driver can be identified and fined.
</P>
<P>
   Morris wants to mount a slave flash next to the number plate, so
ensuring that it points into the lens of any speed-trap camera. His
idea is that this should fog the film of a photographic camera and
dazzle the sensors of a video camera, preventing them from
recording the car's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is aware that the authorities will not like the idea, but
says he wants ``to get the idea off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the DETR says it knows nothing of the new
invention, and referred inquiries to the police. A Metropolitan
Police spokeswoman condemns the idea but says that legality is a
matter for the Home Office. A spokesperson for the Home Office says
it knows nothing of the device or its legality, and was unable to
find anyone who did. &QL;

   APPLES-WASHINGTON (Washington) _ Like Brasilia, Canberra and
other created capitals, cities custom-built as seats of government,
Washington has been bad-mouthed from the very beginning. Jefferson
called it ``that Indian swamp in the wilderness.'' John F. Kennedy
famously remarked that our fair capital was full of ``Northern
charm and Southern efficiency.'' But most visitors come not to
tut-tut at the hard streets where the city's poor live, not to
count the ways the government falls short of the Founding Fathers'
ideals, but to pay homage to the ideals themselves, to keep the
ideals alive and try to imbue the kids with them. That is why
Washington is thronged several times each year with family groups,
shod in their Reeboks, maps in hand, taking in the American dream.

 &HT;    Danes' dark tale no piece of cake
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something rotten in the state of Denmark, particularly
at the country estate of Helge (Henning Moritzen), who is
celebrating his 60th birthday with a nightlong celebration of
drinks, dinner, dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and don't forget the toasts _ especially the one given by
his eldest son, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen). He's a pale, guarded
young man whose emotional distance may be a legacy of what he
reveals to the family members and friends gathered in the dining
room: that he and his twin sister, as children, were sexually
abused.
</P>
<P>
   That's the powder-keg plot of ``The Celebration,'' which fuses
documentary-style filmmaking with some of the melodramatic family
psychology of Ingmar Bergman and Eugene O'Neill. The Danish film,
winner of the special jury prize at this year's Cannes Film
Festival, manages to be both cutting edge and old hat.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the key players as they're arriving at the immense
family home. Christian, walking from the airport, gets a lift from
his hothead kid brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen). Michael is the
kind of guy who makes his wife and children walk a mile in order to
give Christian a ride. Then there's Helene (Paprika Steen), a
second sister, whose fondness for black men is only another of the
family bombshells.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is notable for more than their father's birthday. It's
the first time they've been together since the suicide of
Christian's twin, a loss that motivates the action and adds a
satisfying supernatural edge.
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie has the breezy rush of improvisation, the
script (by Mogens Rukov and director Thomas Vinterberg) is
thematically polished. When a couple of elderly dinner guests argue
over the consistency of the soup (salmon? lobster? tomato?), it
foreshadows the movie's strongest dramatic question: Is Christian's
accusation true? Or is he lying? Or does he somehow believe it's
true, although it never happened?
</P>
<P>
   The strongest section of ``The Celebration'' is the
excruciating, protracted reaction to Christian's toast. His mother,
Elsa (Birthe Neumann), smiles her social smile and insists that
Christian, ``a creative child,'' is playing a twisted prank. The
guests try to beat a polite retreat.
</P>
<P>
   They can't. The estate's chef, Kim (Bjarne Henriksen), a
childhood friend of Christian's, has ordered his cooks to steal all
the car keys from the guests, so that the family (nuclear and
extended) is forced to confront the truth. Whatever that happens to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Playing like a contemporary, domesticated version of ``Hamlet''
peppered with black humor, the movie also has the
upstairs-downstairs tensions and supernatural tone of ``The
Kingdom'' by Lars Von Trier. Not surprisingly, he's one of the four
Danish filmmakers, including Vinterberg, working under something
they call Dogme 95. Under this manifesto, the directors shoot on
location, using hand-held cameras and only natural lighting and
ambient sound.
</P>
<P>
   This ``dogma'' approach has its downside, including the motion
sickness you get from the shaky camerawork (like Von Trier's
``Breaking the Waves''). Some of the night scenes in
``Celebration'' are murky to the point of distraction. And the
video-to-35mm transfer can make things look cheap.
</P>
<P>
   You probably won't mind, thanks to the potboiler plot and strong
acting. Thomsen's enigmatic performance suggests what Hamlet might
be like in Copenhagen in the 1990s, while Moritzen's father is by
turns deeply sympathetic and frightening. In many ways, though, the
movie's biggest arc is acted by Larsen, who transforms Michael from
a drunken wreck into an unlikely hero.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Dogme 95 proves to be a strong basis for future films or
just a gimmick remains to be seen. But the approach, and the
material, work beautifully in ``The Celebration.'' It's not
terribly original, but it's terrifically compelling.

 &HT;    Luck of the Irish gets iffy in `Devine'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton may have been right after all. It does
take a village. At least it does in ``Waking Ned Devine,'' a broad,
twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in the tiny town of
TullyMore (population 52) when it's discovered that one of its
residents holds a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The first challenge is finding out who the lucky winner is, a
task that two lifelong buddies _ blustery, cunning Jackie (Ian
Bannen) and spindly, gullible Michael (David Kelly) _ undertake
with considerable gusto. After all, it doesn't hurt to be on the
good side of someone who's just come into a handsome amount of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a little too eager to please, a little too Lucky
Charms Irish. But Bannen and Kelly are professional charmers, and
there are dozens of winning little moments _ whether it's Kelly's
frazzled, full-monty motorcycle ride or a chicken dinner thrown by
Jackie and his wife (Fionnula Flanagan) to sniff out the ticket
holder.
</P>
<P>
   A few unexpected twists give the movie a last-minute lift,
making it relatively easy to overlook the earlier irksome aspects.
But if you're looking for something with edge or sophistication,
best look elsewhere.

 &HT;    `Jack Frost' bites the big Snowball and melts into slush

live-action version of ``Frosty the Snowman'' ends up being an
uninspired ``inspirational'' high-concept Hollywood mess.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton plays Jack Frost, lead singer in a mediocre rock band,
whose gigs keep him away from wife Gabby (Kelly Preston) and son
Charlie (Joseph Cross). In fact, it's when he's driving back from
an out-of-town show that he loses control of his car and bites the
big snowball.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, fatherless Charlie has grown withdrawn and
sullen. He's even quit the hockey team. But a dose of self-worth
comes via a peculiar kind of reincarnation: Dad reappears in the
front yard as a talking snowman.
</P>
<P>
   Checking out his new self, the frigid father wonders, ``Can the
universe really be that unoriginal?'' No, but four screenwriters
apparently can.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's big-stakes issue is to let Jack have a second chance
to be a good father and teach Charlie how to swat a hockey puck
really, really well. It's a celluloid mea culpa devised by West
Coast show-biz dads who feel guilty about not spending more time
with their kids. They should feel guilty _ not for neglecting their
families, but for inflicting junk like ``Jack Frost'' on ours.

 &HT;    `Simple Plan' weaves tangled web of greed
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Simply put, ``A Simple Plan'' is eerily similar to the season's
other Murphy's Law movie, ``Very Bad Things.'' In both, a bunch of
guys make a series of decisions that have increasingly disastrous
consequences. The major _ make that crucial _ difference is a
matter of tone. ``Very Bad Things'' is a purposely tasteless black
farce, while Sam Raimi's picture is a character-driven black comedy
with some sober, conscience-nudging undercurrents.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in the deep snow outside a small Minnesota town.
(Echoes of ``Fargo''? You betcha.) Three men stumble across a
wrecked small plane. Inside are the dead pilot _ and more than $4
million in crisp $100 bills. Sensible Hank (Bill Paxton), a regular
guy with a steady job and a pregnant wife (Bridget Fonda), suggests
that they call the local sheriff. He's overruled by his brother,
Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton), a deceptively complex simpleton, and
Jacob's best buddy, a greedy lunkhead named Lou (Brent Briscoe).
</P>
<P>
   So they devise a simple plan. But the best-laid plans of mice,
men and Minnesotans . . .
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the three men are up to their ears in blackmail,
murder and other troubling matters.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Scott Smith's best seller, ``A Simple Plan'' is an
unflattering yet undeniably funny study of the tangled webs we all
weave. Especially effective is the way each incident builds on the
last. Even the discovery of the downed plane is a kind of
``Mousetrap'' series of idiotic events that begin with a fox
crossing a road. It's enough to make you think that God must have
an awfully infantile sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Raimi's bent for malicious black comedy throws
the movie a bit off balance. There's some powerful stuff here about
corruption, brothers, family skeletons, the illusionary lure of the
One Big Chance. And some of that gets lost among the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the movie's focus is on Thornton, who's quite a
spectacle in his lank-haired fright wig and Alfred E. Neuman
dentures. But it's Paxton who holds the film together. He's the
quietly decent man quietly corrupted by so much money. As Fonda, a
Lady Macbeth in a bathrobe, says, her voice aching with love,
support and maybe a little greed: ``You gotta remember how people
see you. You're just a decent, normal guy. Nobody would believe
you're capable of what you've done.''

 &HT;    Lighthearted `Trek' sequel stages space vaudeville act
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The writers of ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' apparently based
their plot on Malibu cocktail chatter between aging movie
executives and their trophy wives. Namely, how far would you be
willing to go to preserve your youth and great skin, without the
inconvenience of elective surgery? Destroy a planet? No prob.
</P>
<P>
   In this largely lighthearted entry in the ``Next Generation''
big-screen series, the Enterprise crew has to defend an agrarian,
primarily blond and boring tribe, the Ba'ku.
</P>
<P>
   The Ba'kus' happy, ``Lost Horizon''-style planet turns out to be
a place of eternal youth. A leader of the mud-ugly Son'a tribe
named Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham under a bunch of facial gunk) plots
with a Star Fleet admiral (Anthony Zerbe) to evacuate the Ba'ku
residents, destroy their planet and bottle its rejuvenating
qualities for their own life-of-leisure purposes. It's up to
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), Commander Riker (director
Jonathan Frakes), android Data (Brent Spiner) and the rest to stand
up for the rights of the taut and tawny.
</P>
<P>
   Fine by me. But while they're at it, I wish the crew would also
save the galaxy from so many apostrophes.
</P>
<P>
   The plot basically exists as a framework to keep those
unfamiliar with ``Trek'' convinced that they're watching a
stand-alone movie. It's a spine supporting little bits of business
to excite the hard-core audience. Think of it as an intergalactic
vaudeville act: Here comes an outer-space dogfight for action
buffs, for the date-night crowd a flirtatious bathtub scene for
Riker and Lt. Commander Troi (Marina Sirtis) _ and look, there's an
adorable, computer-generated rodent to make kids say ``aaaah.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Stewart gets to wear tight shirts to show his
biceps. Frakes shaves off his beard but still looks like William
Shatner. Worf (Michael Dorn) gets tough. La Forge (LeVar Burton)
experiences changes in his vision.
</P>
<P>
   And Spiner's inevitable, groanable,
android-learns-the-joy-of-being-human shtick is learning to play
with a kid in a haystack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like watching a family photo album flicking by at
warp speed. Fans will be charmed. Others might find themselves
remembering the tedium of some family reunions. (Listening to the
persistent gadgetry-gabble in the script is like getting stuck in
an elevator with your cousin the Internet geek.)
</P>
<P>
   The new film doesn't have a villain approaching the
seductive-lethal Borg Queen (played by Alice Krige) in the superior
``First Contact.'' Nor does Picard's character (or Stewart's
considerable acting chops) get tested, except for his mild
infatuation with a throaty, 300-plus-year-old vixen named Anij
(Broadway Tony-winner Donna Murphy, who lends a classy air).
</P>
<P>
   For all its universal aspirations, the series still seems
profoundly Californian in its surface values. The good guys are the
handsome-pretty ones. The bad guys have the wet-paper-bag
prosthetics on their faces. And the female crew is woefully
undeveloped. The main difference between Gates McFadden (Dr.
Crusher) and Sirtis seems to be their hair color. Then again,
that's Hollywood.

THAT'S POWDERED SUGAR, NOT SNOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a movie's soundtrack includes songs by Hanson and Foghat,
you know it's got at least one eye on marketing demographics, and
``Jack Frost'' makes no bones about how it's putting itself out
there as something for late baby boomers and their kids. Cynics
will object to such manipulation, and to much more, but then ``Jack
Frost'' isn't a movie for cynics.
</P>
<P>
   It is instead a sweet, sentimental, formulaic movie about death,
second chances and closure. It goes on too long, and you know where
it's going every step of the way. But even though it has all the
depth of a greeting card, it succeeds by not being too crass or
self-serious and by building an easy chemistry among its lead cast.
</P>
<P>
   Its plot doesn't sound that great: Michael Keaton plays a blues
musician named Jack Frost who dies in a car accident, then comes
back a year later as an animated snowman to try to patch some
things up with his 12-year-old son, Charlie (Joseph Cross, who also
played Keaton's son in the much worse ``Desperate Measures'').
Keaton has a thing for masks _ see ``Beetlejuice'' and the first
two ``Batmans'' _ but it's while he is human here that he does some
of his freshest, most unforced work in years. Jack's open, witty
relationship with Charlie is almost more brotherly than paternal,
and their good times together early on make for some of the movie's
most charming moments.
</P>
<P>
   The movie can't resist playing on yuppie guilt, though, and Jack
_ on the edge of a big record deal _ can't always find time to
spend with his son. Although Jack's good-natured wife (''Holy
Man's'' Kelly Preston, playing sweet again) tries to understand,
Charlie feels put out, and just as Jack starts to come to his
senses, he has that wreck.
</P>
<P>
   When he comes back as the snowman, it takes some getting used
to. A few years ago, the special effects might have been
impressive, but in the wake of ``Antz, A Bug's Life'' and the
second ``Babe,'' this movie's walking, talking snowman looks like
nothing so much as Michael Keaton in a snowman suit. And Keaton
seems just as restrained; he gets a chance to do some rambling
shtick and to have some touching scenes with Cross, but because
there's only so much you can do with a snowman's face, Keaton's
voice-overs sound too low-key and obvious.
</P>
<P>
   You do have to wonder why Jack the snowman keeps his identity
secret from everybody but Charlie and Charlie's hockey coach (Henry
Rollins in an annoyingly bombastic performance); most guys would
head straight for Preston right away, but Jack doesn't want her to
see him like this. The movie also overstuffs itself with subplots
about bullies, Charlie's hockey team and bonding attempts between
Charlie and one of his dad's former band members (''The Full
Monty's'' Mark Addy).
</P>
<P>
   As afterlife movies go, however, it's not that bad; it doesn't
bog itself down with solemnity, like ``What Dreams May Come,'' or
pull a last-minute bit of intelligence-insulting, like ``City of
Angels.'' It strives to be nothing more or less than what it is, a
simple, touching family movie for the holiday season. If that makes
it a trifle instead of a classic, well, sometimes trifles make for
pleasing gifts.

LOTTERY CAPER IS A WINNING TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm too old for jail,'' chuckles Jackie (Ian Bannen) in
``Waking Ned Devine,'' and he's not just being glib, either. Jackie
and his boon pal Michael (David Kelly) are a couple of old duffers
who spend a good deal of their time trying to chase down the
lottery winner in their small town. It's Jackie who's doing most of
the pursuing. Michael just tilts that head at the end of his long,
birdlike neck and trails along after Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   This little village looks like one of those locales where
everyone gets a good night's sleep. Even the lottery-obsessed
Jackie, whose eyes sparkle as he gets closer to discovering the
identity of the big ticket-holder. It's not much of a search,
though _ there are only 52 people in town. That includes a pig
farmer determined to win the heart of the woman he loves, although
he's a ways from winning her nose _ you can smell him in the
distance. (Jackie does give the poor fellow ``fruity soaps'' to
wash the odor away. ``Try the raspberry,'' he advises.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie kicks into gear when Jackie tromps off in the rain to
find the person holding the winning ticket. He hatches a plan that
includes Michael, ``who's never lied a day in his life.'' The
scheme gets bigger and sillier as it rolls along. It's probably
appropriate for Fox Searchlight to release a movie about winning
the lottery since ``The Full Monty'' did essentially that last
year, catching everyone off guard and claiming a top box-office
pride. ``Devine'' takes its ``Full Monty'' lineage seriously,
offering a view of the tan-free posteriors of its two stars, and a
sequence in which a nude Kelly races through the countryside on a
motorcycle _ he's visible only from the chest up, but that's enough
to show that he is wearing a helmet at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Kirk Jones uses a sure, deft hand, even though
the movie is at best a slight delight. And the cast includes a
tight and polished group of professionals, with Bannen and Kelly
chief among them. This minor tease of a movie provides the moist,
clean air of a small seaside town not far from Dublin (the movie
was filmed on the Isle of Man.) Its likability comes from the
actors and the location. The picture itself lacks personality,
being a little indistinct but resolute in its need to charm. You
almost feel as if your pocket is being picked while it takes care
to brush off your lapels.

 &HT;    GA. TECH'S COLLIER TO PLAY FIRST GAME IN A YEAR SUNDAY
 &HT;    PHOTOS ARE AVAILABLE TO GO WITH THIS STORY
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Collier refuses to talk about the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the 450 or so days he spent in Bloomington, Ind.,
participating in war games under the iron hand of Bobby Knight,
``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 7-0, 250-pound product of Springfield, Ohio, was
one of the most highly recruited high school players. He eliminated
overtures from Duke, Notre Dame and North Carolina and narrowed his
choices to Georgia Tech and Indiana. Indiana won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just two hours and forty-five minutes away from home,''
he said. ``It was the closest big-time basketball program around.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Collier started 27 of 33 games at Indiana as a freshman and
eight of nine as a sophomore, averaging 10 points and six rebounds
a game. He walked away one Wednesday morning last December. The
night before, he had had 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists
in a win over South Alabama. The next morning, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The word out of Bloomington was that Collier felt he was more of
a perimeter player and wasn't allowed to play his game. Supposedly,
his parents were pressuring him to leave after they weren't allowed
free access to him on a trip to a tournament in Hawaii. One story
is that when his roomates, Luke Recker and Michael Lewis, threw him
a going-away dinner the night he left, some of the team members
didn't come, splitting the team. Some Hoosier players thought that
once he returned for his sophomore year he had made a commitment
and should see it through, not walk out during the season.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Collier had enrolled at Georgia Tech and when the
Yellow Jackets play Georgia on Sunday, the big man will be eligible
to play for the first time in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to dip into it,'' Collier said about his time at
Indiana. ``Every time I talk about it, it gets in the Bloomington
newspapers, and I get letters.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made his decision to attend Indiana, he said, it wasn't
what his mother or sister had expected. ``They both cried,'' he
said. ``They love Atlanta, and coach Cremins has been a friend of
the family for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out a year was excruciating for Collier, who had to sit
and watch when he knew he could be helping.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through it, Collier said he thinks the NCAA rules
governing transfers need to be changed. ``If you get married and it
doesn't work out, you can get divorced and re-marry the very next
day,'' he said. ``But if you're a 17- or 18-year-old kid and make a
mistake, you lose a year of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he must come out of the gate at full speed against Georgia,
with Kentucky and North Carolina following in the next two weeks.
``With Travis (Spivey) and Pablo (Machado) gone (as transfers) and
Dion (Glover) hurt, it's been a hard year,'' he said, ``but with
what I've been through over the past two years, that's not a
problem with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier will wear No. 52 Sunday afternoon, the same number worn
by his father, Jeff, when he played for Dwane Morrison at Tech,
1973-76.
</P>
<P>
   His presence will add immediate depth to a depleted Tech lineup
without Glover, who is out for the year, and Jon Babul, who hurt an
ankle. He will complement the inside game of Tech's 6-11 Alvin
Jones and give the Jackets a big body to take up some of the
rebounding slack in Babul's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Coller started his athletic career as a swimmer and won national
awards as an 11- and 12-year-old. But by the sixth grade, he was
six feet tall, and he gave up swimming in the seventh grade to
concentrate on basketball. When he entered Catholic Central High as
a freshman, he was 6-6 and weighed 156. ``I was a toothpick,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the toothpick grew, and so did his value. By Collier's
senior year, he was rated as the best big man in the country by
four different recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Collier won't talk about his off-court differences with
Knight, he said his on-court expectations at Georgia Tech are
different than what was expected of him by Knight. ``I was
inside-oriented all the time at Indiana,'' he said. ``I was told
not to shoot threes, not to do this, not to do that. There was a
lot more I wasn't allowed to do than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Collier's first day at practice at Tech, he says he knew
things were going to be different. ``Coach Cremins handed me the
ball out beyond the three-point line and told me to shoot it,'' he
said. ``I shot it and made it. He said, 'We're going to try to get
you back to where you were.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Collier will be listed as a power forward on the basketball
program, but his role will be more of a small forward, much like
Matt Harpring played last year. Cremins plans to exploit all of
Collier's talents, including his long-range abilities. ``The reason
people talk about my perimeter game,'' Collier said, ``is that not
many big guys can do it.''

`STAR TREK: INSURRECTION' _ BEAMING TO A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)

   Some good things really do last, if not forever, then for longer
than anyone might reasonably have expected. Take ``Star Trek.'' The
1960s science-fiction series has successfully survived a
generational turnover and made a relatively smooth transition from
video into films.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' the latest installment, is
little more than a glorified television episode, it still has all
the ingredients that have made it a perennial, with a few extras,
including improved special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Those staples include a starship captain who is a strong, wise,
imperturbably serene daddy figure, a soldier with a heart of gold,
piloting his harmonious multicultural extended family into the
great unknown. Strip away the gadgetry and elaborate technobabble,
and the problems that Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and
his loyal crew encounter out there on the intergalactic frontier
are precisely the same ones we struggle with here on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major villain in ``Star Trek'' is a variation on
the same vengeful, power-mad tyrant. Often, as in the case of
``Insurrection,'' that bad behavior can be traced to some
psychological wound. When the full story of the bad guys, a tribe
called the Son'a, is revealed in the latest episode, the trouble
can be traced to an ancient generational conflict. In the world of
``Star Trek,'' it seems, the late-'60s generation gap is still
grist for the narrative mill. And a little ``Father Knows
Best''-style psychological strategy, applied gently and at the
perfect moment, is all it takes to prevent catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this hokum work as entertainment is the series'
unquestioned belief in basic human benignity. It is a conviction
that can't be faked, and when expressed with a light touch, as it
is here, it can be seductively appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The new episode begins in the next best place to paradise, a
pristine planet that is the habitat of the Ba'ku, a tribe of only
600 who live an idyllic agrarian existence. The Ba'ku enjoy eternal
life and youth on their planet through an atmosphere whose chemical
components regenerate human cells once the people have reached
maturity. While exploring the planet, the crew of the Enterprise
senses itself becoming rejuvenated. Even the nearly bald captain
feels a tingling in his scalp.
</P>
<P>
   What might heaven in outer space look like? Why, of course, like
northern California. The Ba'ku suggest tranquilized residents of
such affluent Marin County towns as Mill Valley, dreamily
discharging their daily tasks in a world that has completely
forsworn modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Picard becomes deeply taken with Anij (Donna Murphy), a
309-year-old beauty who wears low-cut gowns and speaks in a voice
that throbs with the calm wisdom of centuries. Anij discourses
knowingly about the eternity of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But paradise is about to be despoiled. The Ba'ku's neighbors,
the evil Son'a, have made a secret deal with the Federation to
allow them to relocate the Ba'ku to another planet and harvest the
regenerative properties of their atmosphere for the universal good.
They plan to trick them into entering a spaceship that is a
holographic replica of their planet, then spirit them to a place
where they will age like ordinary mortals.
</P>
<P>
   Picard's discovery of the plot occasions the movie's most
impassioned speech, delivered to the starfleet admiral, Dougherty
(Anthony Zerbe), who is cooperating with the Son'a, about the ugly
history of forcible relocation. Picard, threatened with possible
court-martial for disobeying a superior, refuses to go along with
the plan and armed conflict erupts. The battle scenes in which
Picard and his crew fend off the swooping enemy aircraft armed with
transporters that kidnap the Ba'ku one by one, have snap.
</P>
<P>
   The Son'a are typical ``Star Trek'' villains. They're humans
with fright masks. When he's not plotting mayhem, the Son'a's evil
leader Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) has facials in which his
hideously crinkled gray skin is stretched and realigned over his
features.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jonathan Frakes, who appears only briefly as Riker,
the Enterprise's second in command, ``Insurrection'' is breezily
paced, and Michael Piller's screenplay has enough good-natured
humor to keep things from bogging down into sentimental pompous.
The lighter moments include some innocuously clever man-vs.-machine
banter between the Enterprise's resident android, Data (Brent
Spiner), and an angelic little Ba'ku boy, and a witty scene in
which Picard and Data sing a duet from Gilbert and Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   With its vision of a peaceable kingdom of eternal youth in an
agrarian arts-and-crafts paradise in a California environment,
``Insurrection'' is an appealing millennial throwback to the hippie
dream that is part and parcel of ``Star Trek's'' utopian ethos.
</P>

ANTIQUE TOYS THAT CAN TELL TRUE STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ F.A.O. Schwarz: Watch out. Attention: K-Mart
shoppers. A world-class collection of antique toys can be seen
Friday in New York and they are all for sale. But you'd better move
fast; Saturday is the day.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Sotheby's will auction 1,000 toys, dating from the
1870s to the 1950s, from the estate of Carol F. Andersen, the
Andersen Windows heiress who died in 1992. Ms. Andersen and her
husband, Bill Rubenstein, bought their toys from the 1960s to the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We collected toys that excited us visually and emotionally,''
Rubenstein said, adding, ``Most of them tell a story about
history.''
</P>
<P>
   John Darcy Noble, the former curator of the Museum of the City
of New- York, said: ``Toys are the most vivid, direct and truthful
representation of the morals and manners of the time. Toys weren't
bought by children. They were bought by parents who had social
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Andersen, for example, owned a set of figures based on Teddy
Roosevelt's safari to Africa in 1909-10; a clockwork toy depicting
Christopher Columbus, and a mechanical figure of Ulysses S. Grant.
The Roosevelt figures made up ``Teddy's Adventures in Africa,''
produced by Schoenhut Co. of Philadelphia, circa 1912.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelt menagerie includes a wooden-jointed TR in safari
suit and pith helmet; a photographer modeled on the Rough Rider's
son Kermit; an African tribesman; a lion, and a glass-eyed rhino.
The camp has its original box and comes with toy rifles, a folding
stool, a tent and supplies. A lithograph of a savannah with palm
trees and jungle grasses provides a scenic backdrop. Estimate:
$8,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus toy is a rare souvenir from the 1892-93 Columbian
World Exposition in Chicago. It consists of a tin egg, hand-painted
with red, white and blue stripes. When the large end is pressed
down, a model of the galleon ``Santa Maria'' pops out of the top,
with Columbus and crew waving on deck. The masts unfold and canvas
sails unfurl. The toy was made by Ives of Bridgeport, Conn., and
retains its original box. Estimate: $5,000 to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another Ives toy depicts General Grant in uniform. When a hidden
mechanism in the base is activated, the general raises a hand with
a cigar and exhales perfect smoke rings. Estimate: $10,000 to
$15,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Andersen's most compelling toys is a figure of a
black woman wearing a bonnet and apron, and standing behind a
podium. Her eyes are flashing. When wound, she turns her head from
side to side and bangs her hand on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The figure was produced in about 1880 by Automatic Toy Works of
New York City. Experts, including Eric Alberta, who specializes in
toys for Sotheby's, believe she is a model of Sojourner Truth, the
moniker of Isabella Baumtree, a slave born in 1797 who moved to New
York and helped other slaves escape. She also was an active
suffragist before her death in 1873. Estimate: $6,000 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Andersen and her husband, both Francophiles, lived in a
French-style house with French provincial antiques and owned French
toys. They particularly loved the wind-up tin toys made after 1878
by the Paris manufacturer Fernand Martin. ``The Martin toys struck
a chord,'' Rubenstein said. ``They are incredibly accurate at
portraying French life. They are crude in one way and sophisticated
in another.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at a new Sotheby's showroom, at 411 East
76th Street, where the toys are on display, Alberta said:
``Martin's genius was to observe everyday people and transform them
into toys.'' He added: ``Many times, toys are made for children but
with adults in mind. The subtleties would be lost on a child.`
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein and Ms. Andersen bought witty Martin figures of a
barrel roller, a street sweeper, a woodworker, a judge and a
waltzing couple. They also owned a figure of a dapper barber with a
huge mustache and mop of hair, who keeps rubbing hair tonic on his
client's bald pate.
</P>
<P>
   Another Martin figure, circa 1900, depicts a woman who mimics
the popular American dance of the day. Labeled ``Le Cake Walk,''
the figure is of a woman wearing a pink dress, who raises her arms
in the air, palms up. When wound, she steps forward, throwing out
one leg at a time.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is Martin's ``Plate Stacker'' toy, circa 1920. This
figure is of a young Breton girl in clogs who is balancing an
impossibly tall stack of dishes. When wound, she tilts from side to
side, then falls over backward, sending the plates flying. Madelon
was the subject of a popular World War I song about an
indefatigable girl who served soldiers in an army canteen, and the
toy may well be that Madelon. Estimate: $1,500 to $2,000. Ms.
Andersen also collected Lehmann tin toys from Germany. Ernst Paul
Lehmann established his firm in 1881 and marked his toys with the
letter ``e.'' Some Lehmann toys are politically incorrect yet
irresistible. ``The Masuyama Rickshaw,'' circa 1927, features an
Asian man in a chartreuse shirt (slyly printed with e's all over),
pink pants and slouch hat, dutifully pulling an elegant woman in a
kimono who is seated in a rickshaw. When wound up, the man lurches
forward and the woman waves a fan to cool herself. Estimate: $800
to $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Most Europeans hadn't seen a ``jinrikisha,'' or rickshaw, until
one was displayed at the Paris World's Fair of 1889, where it
caused a sensation, Alberta said. Lehmann named his toy after the
city of Masuyama, a gathering place for Japanese intellectuals in
the 1920's.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lehmann toy in the Andersen collection shows how fads
affect toys. ``Roller skating was a sensation in Germany in the
early 1900s,'' Alberta said. ``The boom was almost over when
Lehmann applied for the patent for his Primus figure.'' This toy
depicts a handsome male skater in a blue cap, jacket and shorts.
When wound, he spreads his legs apart, then pulls them together
again. As he moves forward, his arms go back and forth. He is very
rare and in good condition. Estimate: $6,000 to $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   An American item in the sale is known as a trade stimulator. A
glass box, circa 1910, has the legend ``Catch on to the `Anakim'
5-cent cigar and be happy'' on the top. Inside is a lithograph of a
dandy in a straw hat who has gone fishing. He sits by a stream, a
box of cigars and a flask. When wound, the man jerks his rod, only
to discover he's caught an old boot. Just then, a fish jumps out of
the water, and escapes to safety. Estimate: $1,500 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another American piece, from 1872, is an elaborate toy doll
patented by George W. Brown for the Stevens &AMP; Brown Company of
Cromwell, Conn. The doll, from the renowned Blair Whitton
collection, pushes two oversize hoops. As she moves, a bell rings
and a boy waves a flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``French and German toys may be amusing, but a George Brown is a
work of folk art,'' said Noble, the collector and expert. He is
also the guest curator of ``Dolls: Mirrors of Humanity,'' a popular
show that remains at the Mingei International Museum in San Diego
through Jan. 16.

ED HARRIS TO DIRECT AND STAR IN `POLLOCK' 
JOHN MADDEN AND `SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' 
`RUSHMORE': A GEEK'S STORY
</HEADLINE>

   `Pollock,' Priced At $6.5 Million
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Looking at the Jackson Pollock canvases at the
painter's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York has
a special resonance for actor Ed Harris. Harris, who has spent
hours at the show and who has read numerous books on Pollock's life
and career, has been consumed for years with the artist. Now, he is
going to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old actor is set to start making a film about
Pollock in March or April. Not only will Harris portray the
Abstract Expressionist, who died in a drunken-driving crash in 1956
at the age of 44, he is also going to direct the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dealing with this for years, probably five, six
years, maybe more,'' Harris said. ``I'm just very, very curious
about exploring this guy, about trying to understand him. He had a
difficult time being a human being. He put most of his feelings and
a sense of purity into his work. I'm curious about tracking that
down and seeing what happens to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a good week for Harris, a character actor for more
than a decade. Tuesday the National Board of Review, a film critics
group, announced that he had won an award for his supporting roles
in two films: Peter Weir's ``Truman Show,'' in which he played the
man who manipulates the Jim Carrey character, and Chris Columbus'
``Stepmom,'' opening Christmas Day, in which he plays a man who
leaves Susan Sarandon for Julia Roberts. The announcement was a
sign that Harris is a contender for an Academy Award nomination,
especially for ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that his compulsion to play Pollock was difficult to
explain, and that even he didn't understand it. ``It's an
instinctive desire I have,'' he said. ``I guess I feel there are
certain similarities between him and me, but he was more extreme
than I've ever been. He was, of course, an original. And he really
fought to get to a place where he was creating something that was
not derivative of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I do identify with him on some level. Here's a guy
who put a huge canvas on the ground, totally blank, and he's driven
to fill it up. I'm just very curious about the process of creation
through his eyes, his being. I'm really not sure where the film
will lead. It will have a life of its own, in some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has been attracted before to Pollock's tormented life
and career. Several years ago there was talk that Robert De Niro
and Barbra Streisand would play the artist and his wife, the
painter Lee Krasner. But nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has not yet cast an actress for the Krasner role in his
film, ``Pollock,'' which is based on the book about the artist by
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. Harris said that the
Pollock-Krasner estate was cooperating on the movie, but that he
was seeking permission from museums and private collectors to show
Pollock's art in the film. The film, independently made, is
budgeted for a relatively modest $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who is married to actress Amy Madigan, grew up in
Tenafly, N.J., attended Columbia University for two years and later
graduated from the California Institute of the Arts. He worked for
years in theater, mostly off- Broadway and in Los Angeles.
Currently, he's completing ``The Third Miracle,'' a drama directed
by Agnieszka Holland and co-starring Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he liked Pollock, Harris said, after a pause: ``It was
not easy for him to be in society. He struggled. I like him, I
guess, because he was full of contradictions _ he was a fighter, he
was scared, he was arrogant, he was humble, he was inarticulate yet
very bright. And he was searching for love. And he found it in his
work.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Stratfordians
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 18 months ago, John Madden, a British director whose last
film was the highly successful historical drama ``Mrs. Brown,''
received a telephone call from Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of
Miramax. Weinstein, whose company released ``Mrs. Brown,'' said he
was sending Madden a script called ``Shakespeare in Love,'' hoping
he would direct it.
</P>
<P>
   Madden said: ``I've never had such an instantaneous reaction. I
barely got past the first four pages. It was the first of many
times I threw the script in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   He accepted the job immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The film, an elegant comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph
Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush, opens Friday with strong advance
reviews. Written by Zack Norman and English playwright Tom
Stoppard, the film explores life in a theater troupe in
16th-century England and raises the question: what if Shakespeare
had writer's block while writing ``Romeo and Juliet''?
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts well-known figures like Queen Elizabeth I and
Christopher Marlowe, as well as Shakespeare, of course, in
fictional situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Shakespeare's life is: no one knows
anything,'' said Madden, a 49-year-old film and theatrical
director. ``And what's special about the movie's approach, I hope,
is the way it gets behind the iconic nature of the persona and
paraphernalia that is Shakespeare now and deals with him in a fresh
way, with a glorious mischievous attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, he said, should be treated almost as a pop writer
who wrote for mass audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a guy with a knack for writing on deadline,'' Madden
said. ``He was a superlative popular entertainer at one level, a
bloke good at writing words rather than just a genius composing
great literature in a solitary environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has a somewhat tortuous history. It was taken to
Universal Studios by the director Edward Zwick in 1996 and set to
star Julia Roberts and Daniel Day-Lewis. That deal fell apart, and
Zwick later brought the script to Weinstein of Miramax. The company
paid $4.5 million for the movie and picked up the preproduction
costs at Universal, the largest amount Miramax had ever paid, at
that time, for a project.
</P>
<P>
   Because Zwick had signed on to direct ``The Siege,'' the
director's job went to Madden, who taught in the late 1970s and
early '80s at the Yale School of Drama and who has staged plays at
the New York Public Theater and the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles. Eventually, Miramax and Universal shared the costs of the
$30 million to $35 million movie.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's personal life is largely a mystery. Indeed, the
time between 1585, when he was 21 and already married, and 1592 are
known as ``the lost years.'' In 1593, Shakespeare published some of
his most erotic sonnets, and one year later wrote ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' The film begins with ``the lost years'' and continues
through his work on ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it possible for a man to write this way about love and
sexuality and passion without having experienced something close to
it in his life?'' Madden asked. ``I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There's a stigma attached to Shakespeare by many
people now, a feeling that he's remote and inaccessible and
elitist. But none of those things are true.''
</P>
<P>
   A Geek's Story
</P>
<P>
   Max Fischer is the kind of 10th-grader at Rushmore Academy whose
first choices for college are Oxford and perhaps the Sorbonne.
Harvard is his safety school. Unfortunately, Max is also one of the
school's worst students, has been placed on probation and is deeply
and futilely in love with a British first-grade teacher and tries
to win her over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max invents his own reality, he sees himself as a young don at
Oxford, he says his father's a neurosurgeon when he's actually a
barber, he's totally oblivious to what other kids think,'' said Wes
Anderson, the 29-year-old director and co-author with his friend,
Owen Wilson, of ``Rushmore,'' a quirky and off-center movie that
has already earned positive reviews at film festivals. The comedy,
released by Disney, opens Friday for a week in New York and Los
Angeles so that the film can qualify for the Oscars (review on page
X). It opens nationwide Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   As they did on their first film together, ``Bottle Rocket,''
Anderson and Wilson have used their common experiences as
teen-agers growing up in Houston and Dallas, respectively, to make
``Rushmore.'' The film stars an unknown, Jason Schwartzman, a
recent high school graduate in Los Angeles, as the geeky Max.
Schwartzman was selected after a nine-month search. Also in the
cast is Bill Murray as an oddball businessman who befriends the
youth but also falls for the first-grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of this movie is sort of unreal, like a fable,''
Anderson said. ``You have a broadness and strangeness not based on
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, agreed to a $10
million budget for the film _ and then left the filmmakers alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent us to Texas, we made the film, edited it, showed it to
him and he said the movie was ready to be released,'' Anderson
said. ``They were not at all intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Anderson and Disney are a bit worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that it's an unusual movie, and I don't know of
any specific group that it's for,'' Anderson said. ``Do you think
people will show up for it? I hope so.''

``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'': SHAKESPEARE SAW A THERAPIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shakespeare meets Sherlock, and makes for pure enchantment in
the inspired conjecture behind ``Shakespeare in Love.'' This film's
exhilarating cleverness springs from its speculation about where
the playwright might have found the beginnings of ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' but it is not constrained by worries about literary or
historical accuracy. (So what if characters talk about Virginia
tobacco plantations before there was a Virginia?) Galvanized by the
near-total absence of biographical data, it soars freely into the
realm of invention, wittily weaving Shakespearean language and
emotion into an intoxicatingly glamorous romance. No less marvelous
are its imaginings of an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same
backbiting and conniving we enjoy today.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stoppard's mark on the jubilant screenplay, which originated
as the brainstorm of Marc Norman, harks back to the
behind-the-scenes delights of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead.'' This is a world in which a therapist times his patient
with an hourglass and a souvenir mug is inscribed ``A Present From
Stratford-Upon-Avon.'' Says the dashing young Shakespeare, played
tempestuously well by Joseph Fiennes, about the more successful
Christopher Marlowe (Rupert Everett): ``Lovely waistcoat. Shame
about the poetry.'' And there is the inevitable moment when someone
asks who Shakespeare is, only to be told by a comically obtuse
producer (Geoffrey Rush): ``Nobody _ that's the author.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingenious as the film's many inventions happen to be (from
boatmen who behave like cabbies to its equivalent of Shakespearean
outtakes _ ``One Gentleman of Verona'' in the writing process), it
could never have had so much energy without the right real-life
Juliet to dazzle Will. Gwyneth Paltrow, in her first great, fully
realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that
she seems utterly plausible as the playwright's guiding light. In a
film steamy enough to start a sonnet craze, her Viola de Lesseps
really does seem to warrant the most timeless love poems, and to
speak Shakespeare's own elegant language with astonishing ease.
``Shakespeare in Love'' itself seems as smitten with her as the
poet is, and as alight with the same love of language and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by John Madden in much more rollicking, passionate
style than his ``Mrs. Brown,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' imagines
Viola as the perfect muse: a literate, headstrong beauty who adores
the theater and can use words like ``anon'' as readily as
Shakespeare writes them. She comes into his life at a pivotal
moment in his career, about which the film speculates with literary
scholarship and Holmesian audacity. What if, before making the leap
from his early works to the profound emotions of ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' he had suffered both writer's block and a crisis in
sexual confidence? (``It's as if my quill has broken,'' he tells
his therapist.) What if such impotence could be cured only by a
madly romantic liaison with a Juliet prototype, an unattainable
woman with a habit of speaking from her balcony?
</P>
<P>
   Enter Viola, who is so eager to work in the theater that she
disguises herself as a boy, since women are forbidden to act. (Part
of the film's great fun is its way of working such Shakespearean
gambits into its own plot.) On her way to winning the role of
Romeo, Viola finds herself suddenly enmeshed with the handsome
playwright himself, and the film gives way to a heady brew of
literature and ardor. In one transporting montage, the lovers
embrace passionately while rehearsing dialogue that spills over
into stage scenes, and the bond between tempestuous love and
artistic creation is illustrated beautifully. The film is as bold
in its romantic interludes as it is in historical second-guessing,
leaving Ms. Paltrow and Fiennes enmeshed in frequent half-nude,
hotblooded clinches in her boudoir.
</P>
<P>
   Far richer and more deft than the other Elizabethan film in town
(``Elizabeth''), this boasts a splendid, hearty cast of supporting
players. (The actors in both films, like Fiennes, do notably better
work here.) Colin Firth plays Viola's fiance as a perfect Wrong.
Rush's opportunistic producer is very funny, as is Ben Affleck's
version of a big-egoed actor, Elizabethan style. (Cast as Mercutio,
he is also hoodwinked by Will into thinking that ``Mercutio'' is
the play's name.) Also most amusing is Tom Wilkinson as a financier
who grows stage-struck, Jim Carter as the actor who looks silliest
in a dress, Simon Callow as the Queen's censor and Imelda Staunton
as Viola's nurse. Judi Dench's shrewd, daunting Elizabeth is one of
the film's utmost treats.
</P>
<P>
   So are its costumes. The designer Sandy Powell has previous
credits including ``Orlando'' and ``The Wings of the Dove,'' and
she deserves to be remembered for her wonderfully inventive work
this year. She contributes extravagantly to this film's visual
allure and did the same for ``Velvet Goldmine.'' Gear-switching
that extreme is no mean feat.

SAN FRANCISCO TALLIES LOSSES FROM BLACKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER AND JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANACISCO _ Facing the likelihood of claims resulting from
a massive power outage this week, the Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
has mobilized a team of investigators to evaluate damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E has acknowledged the blackout resulted from human error,
and not an act of God, so we hope to address all these claims as
quickly as possible,'' PG&AMP;E spokesman Tony Ledwell said Wednesday,
a day after the outage that affected more than 1 million people.
``The blackout came right at the height of the shopping season, so
it makes sense lots of retailers would say they lost business.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people have requested claim forms from the power
company, a subsidiary of the PG&AMP;E Corp., while businesses and city
departments were tallying the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown and other city officials have said city
departments would add up losses and submit the claims to PG&AMP;E
within 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to have the city attorney handle all aspects of any
claims filed with the appropriate review,'' Brown said Wednesday.
``Each department will look at its daily spending to determine what
was lost and what was incurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer Susan Leal said the city lost interest on property tax
collections _ which typically amount to $30 million to $40 million
each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we lose the interest, but we were overdrawn,''
Leal said. ``We got a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other city losses incurred during the blackout included the
overtime incurred by the police, transit workers and other
employees.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E said mistakes made by workers at a power substation in San
Mateo triggered a shutdown of two San Francisco substations,
pulling the plug on most of the city and the northern half of San
Mateo County. Only one death was blamed on the outage, an elderly
woman who was struck and killed at an intersection where the
traffic signal was not working.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E spokesman Len Anderson said he expected many claims to be
from homeowners seeking compensation for lost perishables; computer
damage from surges; and business lost due to the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Tapan Munroe, who spent 17 years as PG&AMP;E's chief economist and
is now a community economic development consultant, said the San
Francisco-based utility appeared to be taking the problem seriously
by owning up to its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to give us a real wake-up call, and we should
mobilize to make sure we have the most reliable systems possible,''
he said, adding that companies should learn from those that had
back-up systems that minimized losses.
</P>
<P>
   A number of businesses were reluctant to say whether any claims
would be filed until the losses were calculated.
</P>
<P>
   The Starbucks Coffee Co. lost business at 36 coffeehouses in the
affected area, but a spokeswoman for the Seattle-based company
would not say whether a claim would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Stores spokeswoman Judie Decker said the grocery chain
hoped to have enough information by Friday to know whether to file
a claim.
</P>
<P>
   While Nordstrom was the only major retailer in downtown San
Francisco to remain open Tuesday because of its backup generator
system, representatives said the department store had incurred
significant losses but had not yet determined what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   At Neiman Marcus, which held its ``InCircle'' party Tuesday
night to honor customers who spend more than $3,000 a year at the
store, attendance was up 50 percent over last year. Ann Paolini,
general manager of the Neiman Marcus store at Union Square, said
the store had entertained 1,600 shoppers after opening at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge surprise to us. We couldn't have been happier,''
she said, adding that sales for the two-day event were up ``double
digits'' over last year. ``Certainly there's no lost revenues to
discuss, and there were no expense issues to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hauge, head of Cal Insurance Co., said that even though he
had losses of at least $5,000, he would not go after PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accident; those things happen,'' he said. ``I could
make a mistake in my business, too, and I would hope nobody would
sue me. It didn't destroy me.''

`A SIMPLE PLAN' FEATURES GREAT CAST, BUT WEAK SCREENPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sam Raimi wasn't the first choice to direct the film version of
Scott B. Smith's 1993 novel, ``A Simple Plan.'' He wasn't even the
second or third.
</P>
<P>
   Raimi is known more as a schlock-master (he's directed ``The
Evil Dead,'' ``Darkman,'' and ``The Quick and the Dead'' among
other cult favorites), than as a serious filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he got the job by default, it may have been a
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   He has cast the film sensibly, with earthier actors who fit the
``everyman'' theme of the story better than flashy leading men Brad
Pitt and Nicolas Cage, who were originally supposed to star under
Mike Nichols' direction.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda and Brent Briscoe
are the glue that hold this somber re-telling of Smith's moral
fable together. It's a simple story: Hank (Paxton), his older
brother Jacob (Thornton) and Jacob's friend Lou (Briscoe) stumble
upon a snow-covered single-engine plane crashed in the woods.
Inside are a decomposing pilot and a canvas bag holding $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For Lou and Jacob, who are suffering through unemployment and a
harsh Minnesota winter, the find equals heaven. For Hank, who works
in the feed mill and has a pregnant wife, Sarah (Fonda), earning a
little income at the library, it presents a different dilemma. The
trio agree to stash the money at Hank's, tell no one and, once the
heat dies down, take the loot and move on to better and bigger
lives.
</P>
<P>
   But, predictably, everything goes awry and before long the body
count builds. The perfectly thought-out scheme unravels, loyalties
fray and tensions build.
</P>
<P>
   Lou gets greedy. While greed has been a dramatic ploy since
human beings began to write, add the maxim, ``anything that can
happen, will,'' and the seed is sown for betrayal and marital
discord that is right in line with Shakespeare's ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the film's setup is paced well, something fails to click.
Smith's screenplay excises some of the book's violence but it also
extinguishes much of its soul. Its moral fiber feels muted and the
entire movie reeks of too much reverence toward the source
material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thornton and Briscoe are amazing as Jacob and Lou. The
pair are a studied contrast in ethical extremes, with Jacob acting
as the conscience and Lou as the hot-headed linchpin who pushes the
scheme toward disaster. Ultimately, it's up to Paxton to provide
the equilibrium, and he does it well.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its script problems, ``A Simple Plan'' has too much
lag time. Though the climactic moment where Jacob is forced to
choose between his brother and Lou crackles with sadness, dread and
impending violence, the rest of the film is humorless and dreary
and drifts endlessly without making much of a point or fully
finding its potential.
</P>
<P>
   A Simple Plan. Directed by Sam Raimi. Written by Scott B. Smith.
Cast: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda. Paramount
Pictures. 110 minutes. Rated R for violence, language.

NO BUTS ABOUT IT: RICK SCHRODER IS A SMASH ON `NYPD BLUE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This e-mail from a friend and colleague was one of the first to
greet me after nearly two weeks away from the beat: ``Rick Schroder
is terrific. His first two episodes were as smooth a transition as
I ever saw on episodic TV. I want to know all his secrets (and I
bet he has plenty), and if ABC is smart the secrets will be
revealed agonizingly slowly. This guy is just as appealing as Bobby
Simone, but in so many different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly what I would have said about Schroder's addition to
the ``NYPD Blue'' cast if my brain cells hadn't been stored in the
upright and locked position for so long. Without benefit of a
little post-vacation WD-40, the best I could come up with was:
``Schroder good, Bochco smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Any way you say it, the Schroder move is already looking boffo
for ``Blue'' and its estimable producer, Steven Bochco. Though I
liked Jimmy Smits a lot, Schroder's new character, Detective Danny
Sorenson, has me itching for next week's episode the way I did
during the first season, when David Caruso brought a tantalizing
mysteriousness to the character of Detective John Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is the newness, of course. Bochco is nothing if not
clever. His decision to cast a former child star in a gritty role
raised the curiosity quotient higher than Andy Sipowicz's blood
pressure. High fives to Bochco and co-executive producer David
Milch for not making Detective Danny a wide-eyed neophyte in need
of mentoring from Andy, the wise old cop (Dennis Franz). I like how
Danny's swagger has caught Andy a little off guard. I like even
better that Danny has some ``secrets,'' as my correspondent noted,
and that Schroder is being allowed to dribble them out slowly. Is
there a question about his sexuality? About violence in his past?
</P>
<P>
   Schroder is coyly keeping the answers under the shell of his
tough, street-smart character. But sure as Andy is likely to hurl
an insult his way, the answers are likely to emerge as Danny
Sorenson helps us to forget Bobby Simone.
</P>
<P>
   Also nice to see that Bochco and Milch haven't lost their senses
of humor. Only two episodes into Schroder's tenure and we've
already seen his ``bottom line'' performance _ the continuation of
a cheeky tradition that began with Caruso and has now included
Smits, Franz, Amy Brenneman, Kim Delaney, Sharon Lawrence and
Andrea Thompson in their ``Blue'' moon phases.

`WAKING NED DEVINE' IS A FINE, FEEL-GOOD COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' is sure to be classified as this year's
``The Full Monty'' with its feel-good tone and crowd-pleasing
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this comic fable is rather clunkily edited,
contains some gaping plot holes and is so wispy thin it could blow
away on a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, writer and director Kirk Jones has no lofty
pretensions about what his movie means: it's just plain
sweet-natured and gentle with a bit of a black comedic twist.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Irish village of Tully More. The population is
all of 52, but after the Saturday night lotto game, Ned Devine's
ticker gives out when he learns he's holding the winning ticket,
and the head count in the town shrinks by one. ``I always thought
the sea would take him, not a few lottery balls,'' says Jackie
O'Shea (Ian Bannen) to his lifelong friend, Michael O'Sullivan
(David Kelly).
</P>
<P>
   The ``boys'' are the town's mischievous old-timers; they're 60+
but have been getting into trouble since they were lads. This time,
even Jackie's gruffly loving wife, Annie (Fionnula Flanagan),
thinks they've gone too far: when the friends learn someone in the
village has the winning numbers worth more than 6 million pounds,
they hatch a plan to find out who has the prize in order to share
the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys discover Ned Devine dead in his cottage by the sea
with the lotto card in his hand, they devise a way to revive Ned,
get the money and split it among the economically depressed
township. Everyone can then be a winner they argue, but first the
boys have to learn a lesson about the real meaning of loyalty and
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Briskly paced without ever digging too deeply into any of the
characters' motivations, ``Waking Ned Devine'' owes a lot to its
fine cast. Veteran actors Ian Bannen and Fionnula Flanagan are
charming and vital as Jackie and Annie and Irish actor David Kelly
(``Fawlty Towers'') is a joy as the more sensible Michael. They're
such consummate pros that they give depth to the slender script and
the film the gusto and energy it sorely needs to spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot in a tiny, government-protected village called
Cregneash, located in the Irish Sea on the Isle of Man. The
brooding, isolated locale is a rugged contrast to the light story
and also contributes a needed layer to the simple work.
</P>
<P>
   Both these elements _ actors and setting _ combine to make what
Bannen calls ``simply a damn good comedy'' that's sure to whet
American moviegoing appetites for Anglo fare. This may just be the
next innocuous sleeper to overcome the limitations of the ``art
house'' label.
</P>
<P>
   Waking Ned Devine. Directed and written by Kirk Jones. Cast: Ian
Bannen, David Kelly, Fionnula Flanagan, Susan Lynch. Fox
Searchlight. 91 minutes. Rated PG for nudity.

   HOUSTON _ Are high-heeled shoes discriminatory footwear for
women? Many workplaces require women to wear shoes with heels, some
as high as three inches, but men can wear sensible wing tips.
</P>
<P>
   While the subject may sound odd, the mandatory wearing of
high-heeled shoes has become the focus of a lawsuit as well as
serious academic research.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Karla Qwist, a cocktail server at the Rio
Suite Hotel &AMP; Casino in Las Vegas, who told her boss she couldn't
wear the high stiletto heels that are part of her ``Girl from
Ipanema'' costume because she has foot problems.
</P>
<P>
   When the casino refused to accommodate her request to wear flat
shoes, Qwist sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Qwist
and other waitresses also sued the casino, alleging gender
discrimination and contending the 2- to 3-inch-high shoes caused
women physical deformity. Men are allowed to wear low-heeled shoes
as part of their costume.
</P>
<P>
   Qwist's initial lawsuit was rejected by a lower court judge who
contended that she wasn't sufficiently disabled to require her
employer to accommodate her, and that she didn't file the gender
discrimination claim within required time limits.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Ruckelshaus, Qwist's attorney and litigation director for
the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit advocacy group in
New York that represents low-wage workers, said she plans to argue
that Qwist's disability is indeed severe and that the
discrimination case was filed on time.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bogatz, vice president and general counsel of the Rio,
said he couldn't comment on pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FEET SMART IN STUPID SHOES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting case because many employers force women to
wear shoes that have a deleterious health effect, said Marc Linder,
professor of law at the University of Iowa and author of the
article, ``Smart Women, Stupid Shoes and Cynical Employers: The
Unlawfulness and Adverse Health Consequences of Sexually
Discriminatory Workplace Footwear Requirements for Female
Employees.''
</P>
<P>
   High heels are especially common in the airline industry as some
carriers require their flight attendants wear at least 1.5-inch
heels, he said. Instead of concentrating on passenger safety,
airlines want their flight attendants to look glamorous and leggy
as they serve beverages and pass out magazines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Dallas-based Southwest Airlines went to the U.S. Supreme
Court to keep its flight attendants in hot pants and go-go boots
(it lost), the carrier now encourages its attendants to wear
sneakers. They're more comfortable for people who are on their feet
all day long, said Melanie Jones, Southwest spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental Airlines lowered shoe heights in 1995
to reduce slips and falls, which was one of the biggest
occupational injuries plaguing the airline. The strategy worked _
women can wear heels as low as 1/4 inch _ and the number of falls
fell by 80 percent, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   High heels can cause severe foot problems, said Lynnelle
Gabriel, a podiatrist in Houston who sees many working women hobble
into her office on high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Hammertoes, caused by wearing pointy-toed shoes, are the most
common complaint, Gabriel said. Hammertoes form when two or more
toes get pushed together and curl up and then a corn appears that
grows into the foot.
</P>
<P>
   High heels cause toe, heel and lower back problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EXPECTATIONS AT WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel said she recommends to her clients that they wear heels
less than one inch high, but many tell her that they must wear
heels higher than that. It's largely social pressure, said Gabriel,
adding that many women just want to get their foot problems fixed
and go back to their same high heels. Men, on the other hand, heed
her advice to stop wearing pointy-toed casual shoes and their foot
problems typically disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Two women who work for a prominent Houston bank said they feel
pressure to wear heels at work. The two women, who were spotted
recently wearing sneakers during a lunchtime break, said nothing
has ever been said, but they just know that to look the part, high
heels _ in the 2-inch variety _ are part of the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Other women who were spotted on the street recently said they
don't wear high heels to work out of any job requirement but more
because heels ``finish'' their outfit, make them look taller or
make their big feet appear smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hell aren't they?'' said Irene Alexander, a legal
secretary in Houston spotted recently wearing black stiletto heels.
She works for a law firm and the shoes lend authority to her short
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman was surprised at all the fuss over high heels.
What about the discrimination of panty hose? she asked.

`A SIMPLE PLAN': A FROZEN SETTING FRAMES A CHILLING TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nobody'd ever believe that you'd be capable of doing what
you've done,'' the once-wholesome main character in ``A Simple
Plan'' is told by his wife, at a point when he can barely believe
it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Though he begins the story innocently enough, Hank Mitchell
(Bill Paxton) winds up digging himself ever deeper into a hole
that's impossible to escape.
</P>
<P>
   However straightforwardly these events are described, they
become ever more gripping and unsettling as the film proceeds. When
you get the shivers watching this wintry tale unfold, it won't be
from the cold.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how and why a chance event escalates to such intensity
is at the heart of this quietly devastating thriller directed by
Sam Raimi, the cult horror director (``The Evil Dead'') who makes a
flawless segue into mainstream storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   And in an acting collaboration that is as fine as their first,
and could share its title (``One False Move''), Paxton and Billy
Bob Thornton play out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error
in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a year in which films come in pairs (dueling World
War II epics, etc.), ``A Simple Plan'' is one of two bleak
snowbound dramas so well acted and sharply astute that they light
up the holiday season. (Paul Schrader's forthcoming ``Affliction,''
shown at the Sundance Film Festival, is the other.)
</P>
<P>
   Adapted by Scott B. Smith from his suspenseful and highly
cinematic best seller, it begins with the irresistible hook of a
windfall that drops out of the sky. Hank and two other men
accidentally happen onto a small airplane that has crashed while
carrying $4.4 million in cargo. What they do about this, and how
they do it, will shape their fates forever.
</P>
<P>
   The plan of the title: Hank decides he will take the money and
hide it for a while, waiting to see if anyone comes to claim it. He
assumes this responsibility because he is the only member of the
trio who has a job (at a feed store) and shows any sign of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The other two men are Hank's childlike brother Jacob, who is
played with both sweetness and an edge of danger by Thornton, and
Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), later described as ``a
40-year-old out-of-work high-school dropout who's proud when people
call him the town drunk.'' So Hank, who has a tidy little home, a
pretty wife and a baby on the way, is clearly the man in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Hank's wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), turns out to be an
unexpectedly powerful player in this drama. Right away, she
suggests that Hank return $500,000 to the plane, to ward off
suspicions of looting. This winds up having terrible consequences
when a nosy farmer gets in the way, and it's only the beginning of
the story's lethal complications. As they mount, the film becomes
ever more enveloping as a well-honed morality tale rising to a
near-biblical level of punishment for its characters'
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sarah gets to the maternity ward, nursing her
newborn baby as she thinks only of further scheming for Hank, the
story has taken on an air of eerily contemporary tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The film's simple visual scheme favors muted tones (with
effectively plain production design by Patrizia Von Brandenstein,
Alar Kivilo's stark, unfussy cinematography and Danny Elfman's
insinuating score) but its moral distinctions are alarmingly gray.
</P>
<P>
   It is by behaving expediently and self-protectively that Hank
begins his series of missteps (``I can't afford to go to prison,
Jacob!'') in a downfall captured in all its discreet horror.
</P>
<P>
   Paxton's fine, sturdy performance makes it all the more
troubling to discover what lurks behind the smooth facade of
hard-working Hank.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's screenplay refines his book to create some especially
strong, wrenching encounters between the two brothers, scenes that
pivot on Thornton's haunting mix of menace and fragility in the
film's showier role.
</P>
<P>
   Their last encounter here is searingly realized, powerfully
backed up by all the layers of complicity and betrayal that have
come before. By the time it occurs, the viewer has watched an
ostensibly small film turn into something that, despite its title,
isn't simple at all.

   PRIUS-AUTO-AZR (Phoenix) _ The little Toyota Prius hardly seemed
worth a second glance, parked at the curb with a dozen sleek and

appear, there's a critical difference between Prius and the other
electric vehicles being demonstrated Wednesday in downtown Phoenix.

   AUTO-COLUMN-AZR (Undated) _ Here's a small Oldsmobile that's
worth a second look. The all-new Alero has style, it has content,
it has value, and it's going after the big guns in the midsize
market _ notably Honda Accord. The only thing it doesn't have is a

`THE OGRE': AN ALLEGORY OF NAZIDOM CENTERED ON A CASTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its most unsettling scenes, set at a castle being used as a
military training school for Hitler youth, Volker Schlondorff's
film ``The Ogre'' suggests the stirring cinematic equivalent of a
Wagner opera.
</P>
<P>
   As you watch hundreds of adolescent boys being hyped with a
messianic blend of heroic German mythology and Nazi ideology and
participating in torch-lit rituals and athletic contests, you sense
of the thrill of being a boy swept up in the demented pageantry and
passion of the Nazi cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ogre'' _ made by the director of ``The Tin Drum,'' ``The
Handmaid's Tale'' and, most recently, the overripe American film
noir, ``Palmetto'' _ is just the sort of grand, tortured allegory
in which Central European filmmakers have long specialized. Adapted
from Michael Tournier's novel ``The Erl King,'' the film poses
knotty questions about good and evil and innocence and guilt,
focusing many of them on an ambiguous (and pathetic) symbolic
figure named Abel (John Malkovich) who narrates the movie.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Abel, he is a misfit and troublemaker at a
strict French boarding school. One day, while on his way to be
disciplined for disrupting a chapel service, he prays that the
school burns down. As if by magic, fire suddenly breaks out in the
chapel, distracting the headmaster and saving Abel from a severe
beating but killing his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this incident, Abel grows up with an inordinate
sense of personal power and the rightness of his own destiny, even
though he is consistently treated as an outcast.
</P>
<P>
   When a little girl he has befriended falsely claims he molested
her, Abel avoids prison by going to the front in 1939 as World War
II breaks out. Captured by the Germans, he becomes a lackey to a
group of high-ranking German officers. One of them is Hermann
Goering (Volker Spengler), whom the movie portrays as a grotesquely
charismatic supermacho caricature, a Prussian giant obsessed with
German mythology and with hunting wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   When it is discovered that Abel has a talent for making friends
with children, he is sent into the countryside to find young boys
and lure them to the castle as military conscripts. Abel's
escapades earn him the nickname ``the Ogre'' in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's climax, the last-ditch Nazi fantasy of a heroic
children's crusade against the invading Russian army collapses in a
fiery Gotterdammerung as the Russian tanks arrive at the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Schlondorff treats this fantastical story as an expressionistic
fable with some scenes shot in sepia, others in color and still
others in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   As Abel, Malkovich gives an understated performance that
captures the ambiguity of a character who does monstrous things yet
remains a tender-hearted innocent, a kind of idiot savant who
identifies with children and animals. Malkovich, who speaks in the
soft, halting voice of a man-child, moves through the film with a
blankly questioning, slightly cross-eyed stare. What's odd about
his performance, and about the movie in general, is that a film
this European, teeming with references to Goethe and German
mythology, should have been made in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ogre'' has strong supporting performances by Armin
Mueller-Stahl as a count involved in a plot against Hitler, and
Gottfried John, as Goering's fanatically loyal henchman and chief
forester.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its ambitions and moments of brilliance, ``The
Ogre'' doesn't feel unified or even complete. Episodic and vaguely
surreal, it is the antithesis of a Hollywood film that tells us
what to feel. Having unfolded an ever-widening series of moral
questions, it deliberately leaves them hanging.

OIL MERGER LIKELY TO DRAW CLOSE SCRUTINY OF EUROPEAN REGULATORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exxon Mobil may be an oil giant made in America.
But the merger partners can expect foreign antitrust regulators to
take a close look at their proposed deal because of the worldwide
impact it could have.
</P>
<P>
   Before Exxon and Mobil form the world's largest company, the
European Union and foreign antitrust regulators will examine the
likely effect on prices at the pump and dominance in refining.
</P>
<P>
   Although unlikely, a ``no'' vote by a foreign regulatory agency,
or a move to force the companies to divest a large number of core
assets, could slow the merger or stop it, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign antitrust authorities have become increasingly
active,'' said Mark Schechter, an antitrust expert in the
Washington law firm Howrey &AMP; Simon. ``If a transaction has a
substantial, direct and foreseeable impact on consumers, they would
assert that they have jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, through its antitrust regulator, the
European Commission, has become involved in some major American
mergers. The commission forced MCI Corp. of Washington to agree to
sell its Internet business before it merged in September with
WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss. European regulators estimated
that the combined company would have controlled about half the
world's Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the commission endorsed Boeing Co.'s $14 billion
purchase of rival McDonnell Douglas only after Boeing agreed not to
enforce 20-year exclusive contracts with Fort Worth-based American
Airlines and two other major U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the European Union's objections to a deal could result
in billion-dollar sanctions, and the EU could move to close
companies out of key markets by blocking shipments, rejecting
licenses or taking other measures.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boeing case, some commissioners said Boeing planes could
be seized if the deal went through and their problems were not
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If firms have assets and facilities in your country, you have
some control over those,'' said James Brock, a professor of
economics at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. ``In the extreme,
you can seize those and use them as leverage. They can get nasty
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong-arm tactics are not likely to result from the
Exxon-Mobil merger. Most observers expect the EU and other foreign
agencies to look primarily at the same issues important to U.S.
regulators: the number of gas stations in each market and the
company's ability to control prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts expect the deal to go through if Mobil and Exxon
agree to pare a portion of their 48,000 stations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be certain countries in Europe where they face
certain constraints, but there is also very broad competition
there,'' said Steve Smith, a Houston-based analyst with the
brokerage firm Dain Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that they will get more scrutiny here than
abroad,'' said Eugene ``Chip'' Hodge, an analyst with John Hancock,
an insurance and investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said foreign regulators are unlikely to attack Exxon and
Mobil if they did not balk at the other mergers the industry has
seen, such as British Petroleum's proposed purchase of Amoco this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of two of the world's biggest oil companies comes
amid a wave of mergers in the industry, which is trying to cope
with the lowest oil prices in 25 years and high costs for producing
and refining.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called Exxon Mobil Corp., would be the
world's largest company in terms of revenue, surpassing General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 billion merger is the biggest in U.S. corporate history,
topping the $72.6 billion paid this year by Travelers Group for
Citicorp. It brings together companies with combined 1997 net
income of $11.8 billion and revenue of $203 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have said the new corporate home will be at
Exxon's current headquarters in Irving. But both companies have
vast global operations.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon is the world's second-largest oil company, selling about
65 million gallons of fuel to more than 8 million motorists daily.
The company markets or produces products in more than 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon also produces petrochemicals, mines coal and other
minerals, and it owns about 60 percent of an electric
power-generating station in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil is similar to Exxon in many ways. The company is the
world's fourth-largest oil company, behind Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon
and British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has exploration and production activities in 25 countries
and has operations in about 115 others. The company produces
petrochemicals, wood and polymer building materials, plastics and
other products.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Exxon Mobil would control 4 percent of world oil
production and about 14 percent of U.S. gasoline sales.
</P>
<P>
   Schechter, the Washington antitrust lawyer, said that in most
cases such market-share figures would not raise regulator
objections. They will focus on market share in regions of each
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most interesting about the merger is that the shares
of the two companies are far from extraordinary,'' he said. ``If
this was a deal in any other industry, no one would be raising
eyebrows. It's fair to guess that in the end the deal will go
through.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this the greatest toy ever invented or what? It's like one of
my kids' Hot Wheels came to life, and I got to drive it around.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you want to know about the Plymouth Prowler can be
summed up in three letters: F-U-N. This wedgy eggplant doesn't have
a serious bone in its chassis. Nor should it.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a production hot rod built to resemble, if not perform
like, the roaring custom roadsters of Americana. In case you've
been hiding under a bridge, you must know that the resurgence of
classic hand-built, high-powered street rods has hit the big time,
especially in car-crazy places like Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Chrysler _ now DaimlerChrysler _ has the right
stuff at the right time. The Prowler may be high-priced and wildly
impractical, with a worthless trunk, cramped footwells and
squirrelly ride, but they can't build enough to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Even in its third year, the Prowler is still a massive
attention-grabber. The styling looks to the past and straight into
the future, while everyone you see on the street is looking back at
you. Especially teenage boys, who nearly go into fits at the sight
of a Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   A cruise out to the Pavilions mall in Scottsdale, Ariz., on a
Saturday night is just the ticket for a new Prowler. That's where
hundreds of street rods, custom cars, antiques and classics huddle
around the rock-and-roll McDonald's, accompanied by thousands of
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the competition, the Prowler caused a stir as we
cruised through to mostly positive remarks and admiring glances.
Sure, there were some sneers and disparaging comments about Prowler
not being the real thing, or that it's underpowered with a V-6
rather than a V-8. Well, that's just too bad.
</P>
<P>
   When we parked, we found ourselves in the company of two other
Prowlers. One was bright yellow, a new color for '99, with red and
black to come. The other was a '97 (there were no '98s, as a new
engine was being prepared) that was customized with a subtle flame
motif.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the flame-job had its enormous front bumpers
removed. This customizing act left the Prowler's sharp, jutting
profile unprotected, but otherwise made the styling look much
better defined.
</P>
<P>
   Really, those big, gray, ugly plastic bumpers really detract
from the style. I know, I know, federal mandates and all that. But
still, after designing such a hip-looking rod, you'd think they
could come up with a more graceful way to take a 5-mile-per-hour
bump.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the bumpers, the Prowler looks just great to my eye.
I love the way they fitted the fenders to the front suspension,
giving the appearance of an open-wheel car, even if it's not. And
the way the wide, wide rear aspect looks so aggressive, then slants
downward and inward until it reaches the point at the tip of its
chin.
</P>
<P>
   (An aside: The more I say the name Prowler, the less I think of
a cat and the more I think of some guy who sneaks around committing
burglaries.)
</P>
<P>
   The horsepower in the new, all-aluminum engine, also used in the
300M and LHS sedans, is up 39 horsepower from the former cast-iron
engine, giving the Prowler more spunk. The exhaust is throaty, but
nothing like the thunderous roar of a big ol' V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sneers from some of the hot-rod dudes, the new
all-aluminum engine, one of the most powerful V-6s out there, had
plenty of guts, pulling the lightweight car sharply. This mill
never will light up those huge rear tires, though, the way the real
rods do. The torque's just not there.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's hard to do hole shots without a clutch, and the
Prowler comes in automatic only. The automatic has the Autostick
feature, which allows the driver to shift manually. This is a poor
substitute for stick shift, but better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is surprisingly nimble. Surprising because most hot
rods struggle with turns, while the Prowler's refined suspension is
stiff but compliant, allowing sports-carlike cornering.
</P>
<P>
   Get into some rough surface, though, and the Prowler will dance
like John Travolta, but not quite as gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   The top is manual, but it flops down and up easily enough with
the use of one hand. It disappears into the rear-hinged trunk,
which is otherwise pretty useless because of its flat space,
basically contoured just a couple inches under the sloping deck
lid. That's why Plymouth sells a matching trailer for $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although $40,000 seems like a lot for a car, it's actually a
pretty fair price for a unique product like the Prowler.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler is one reason to admire the cool hands at Chrysler.
The V-10 Dodge Viper sports car is another one. Or the mighty Dodge
Ram truck. Or those new Jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the collection of fantasy concept cars that
Chrysler keeps popping out like Christmas cookies?
</P>
<P>
   Former Chrysler head Bob Lutz showed the world how a car guy
runs a car company, without looking over his shoulder and without
being afraid to take a chance, and bring out the kind of cars and
trucks that people can crow about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the merger, let's hope the serious crew over at
Daimler-Benz can unfurrow their brows long enough to dig what
Chrysler's all about. And learn from it. &QL;

BOOK BORK, MEET YOUR EVIL TWIN, BROWSER BORK 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The problem is Microsoft's tactics in maintaining their
(monopoly), which included an attempt to crush Netscape. You recall
in that meeting ... they were pretty rough and they threatened.
Marc Andreessen, the technical man from Netscape, said later that
it was like a visit from Don Corleone. He expected to find a bloody
computer screen in his bed in the morning.''--Robert Bork,
interviewed on CNN (1998)
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsophisticated theories of predation abound, leading to
drastic overestimations of its likelihood. The most common 'theory'
views firms in the market as if they were thugs in a dark alley;
evidently a large firm has more muscle and can beat smaller firms
to death. ... Such remarks, though they represent popular
'learning' on the subject, do not reflect theory but are only
foolishly inapposite metaphors that ignore the constraints the
market places upon firm behavior.''--Robert Bork, The Antitrust
Paradox (1978)
</P>
<P>
   My college freshman roommate thought he was trapped with a
madman when I asked, the first day, where you went to pick up the
free light bulbs. He had never heard of free light bulbs. Growing
up in Detroit, I had never heard of paying for them. Detroit Edison
gave away free light bulbs until 1978, when an antitrust lawsuit
forced them to stop.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Robert Bork published The Antitrust Paradox,
asking again and again questions such as why the law should stop a
company from doing consumers the favor of giving them something for
free. Conservative commentators--permanently embittered, like Bork
himself, by the 1987 battle that kept him off the Supreme
Court--often describe Bork as the towering constitutional
philosopher of our century. That is unlikely. Except for a
published lecture series, he has never written a scholarly book on
constitutional law. On antitrust law, though, he wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust statutes are very short--just a few vague and
badly worded sentences. But mountains of doctrine had been built on
them over the decades by judges, most of whom were innocent of
economics. Bork's book argued that much, if not most, antitrust law
was economic nonsense. The law protected competitors rather than
protecting competition. It punished behavior that was economically
efficient and good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   When I graduated from law school, also in 1978, every firm on my
job hunt had a big antitrust department. But thanks largely to
Bork's book--plus 12 years of Republican judicial appointments and
Justice Departments--antitrust law melted away. Huge companies
merged without a peep of complaint. Judges trained in economics (or
with clerks who were trained in economics) reversed, ridiculed, or
simply ignored long-established antitrust doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   With the return of a Democratic administration in 1992,
antitrust began to return as well. But one reason the Microsoft
case is so contentious and confusing is that the law remains
uncertain. The edifice was torn down and now it's being rebuilt,
and no one can say for sure what it's going to look like. But the
government is arguing that giving away an Internet browser, like
giving away light bulbs, is or ought to be illegal. And Bork is on
the government's side. He doesn't renounce his influential book. He
insists he is being perfectly consistent.
</P>
<P>
   It's not utterly impossible to reconcile Bork's current position
(call it Browser Bork) with what he wrote in 1978 (call it Book
Bork), but it's almost utterly impossible. What is utterly
impossible is to imagine that Bork himself would ever have threaded
through this maze of rationalization if he weren't being paid by
Netscape. Bork told the Washington Post, somewhat amazingly, that
when Netscape first approached him, he said, ``I'm not sure my
philosophy fits your case.'' Then, the Post reports, ``the company
pointed him to Pages 344 and 345 of his seminal book,'' which
discuss a case so important to his theory that he'd apparently
forgotten all about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Post also reports, ``Bork rejects the notion that Netscape
is trading on his reputation,'' which if correct will do nothing
good for that reputation. Obviously Netscape is trading on his
reputation, just as Microsoft apparently tried to. No one needed
his analytical expertise. By Bork's own account, after all,
Netscape's supplicants had to point out his key argument to him.
</P>
<P>
   The case on Pages 344 and 345 of ``The Antitrust Paradox'' is
indeed the only thing in Bork's 462-page book that even faintly
supports his current position. It is called Lorain Journal v. U.S.
and dates from 1951. The monopoly newspaper in a small town refused
to sell advertising to anyone who also advertised on a newly
arrived radio station. The court ruled that was predatory and
illegal. Bork argues that various Microsoft practices amount to the
same thing. These include things like requiring computer makers who
license Windows to make the Windows desktop the first thing users
see, or insisting that online services must make Internet Explorer
their ``default'' browser if they want to customize it for their
users. He also includes here the bundling of Internet Explorer with
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 1 for Browser Bork is that Book Bork is not all that
enthusiastic for the Lorain case. He says that it ``seem(s) clearly
correct, and yet it is rather difficult to articulate the
distinction'' between Lorain and another case he also endorses that
reaches the opposite conclusion. The distinction, he wanly
suggests, ``probably lies in the fact that the court was offered
what was essentially an efficiency defense'' in the other case. By
contrast, ``There was no apparent efficiency justification'' for
the newspaper's refusal to sell ads. The central theme of ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' is that economic efficiency is key.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-BORK-SLATE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: efficiency is key.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 2 for Browser Bork is that the Microsoft case
differs from Lorain in obvious ways. First, the Microsoft tactics
that leverage Windows into this or that advantage for Internet
Explorer fall short of a classic ``refusal to deal.'' The direct
analogy to Lorain would be if Microsoft refused to sell Windows to
any computer maker that installed Netscape--which it has never
done. (The computer I write this on, like most, came with
Netscape.) Second, I'll leave to Microsoft's lawyers the
challenging argument that Windows does not have a monopoly on
operating systems. But Internet Explorer certainly doesn't have a
monopoly on browsers--it isn't even No. 1--so the policies that
attempt to impose conditions on the use of Internet Explorer, as
opposed to Windows, do not qualify as monopolistic behavior at all.
</P>
<P>
   Problem No. 3 is efficiency. Microsoft certainly has ``offered''
an efficiency defense for making its browser part of the operating
system and for the other challenged practices. And several possible
defenses are ``apparent'' just from reading Bork's book on pages
other than 344 and 345. Book Bork touts the economies in the
marketing and distribution of one product rather than two. And he
explains the importance of ``technological interdependence.'' (``If
the essential component did not conform to exact specifications, it
might impair the operation or usefulness of the principal
product.'') He repeats and repeats his point that any even
plausible efficiency argument should trump overblown concerns about
the dangers of monopolization. ``The truth appears to be that there
has never been a case in which exclusive dealing or requirements
contracts were shown to injure competition,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   The most ``apparent'' efficiency of a monopoly in operating
systems or a would-be monopoly in browsers is the notorious
``network effect.'' The more people who use a complicated piece of
software, the more useful it is to each user. Browser Bork
strangely classifies the network effect as an artificial barrier to
competition imposed by Microsoft, rather than a genuine benefit to
consumers (for which Microsoft deserves neither credit nor blame).
</P>
<P>
   Book Bork is contemptuous of arguments against ``tying
arrangements'' (making the customer buy two products together) and
against ``predatory pricing'' (lowering your price in order to
drive rivals out of business). How would the Bork of ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' have solved the great metaphysical riddle of
our time: Is Windows with Internet Explorer one product or two?
``Every product or service could be broken down into smaller
components capable of being sold separately. ... There is no way to
state the 'inherent' scope of a product.''
</P>
<P>
   Browser Bork does have an explanation of why tying arrangements,
a practice he considered harmless if not metaphysically impossible
in 1978, became dangerous in 1998. He says his 1978 argument
concerned the extension of a monopoly from one product to
another--which classical economics considers to be
impossible--whereas Microsoft is using a tying arrangement to
preserve the monopoly it's already got. This is puzzling. It will
be news to Bork's Netscape clients that the case isn't about
Microsoft attempting to use its monopoly in operating systems to
achieve a monopoly in browsers. Or is Bork suggesting that they're
actually one undifferentiable product--which is Microsoft's
position? Or is it that Microsoft is somehow leveraging its
nonmonopoly on browsers backward into the monopoly it already has
on operating systems?
</P>
<P>
   Bork is so famous for believing that predatory pricing is almost
impossible that he doesn't explicitly say, in his ``white paper''
for Netscape, that selling an Internet browser for zero dollars is
predatory. He does say Microsoft's ``clear intent'' in giving away
Internet Explorer is ``to drive Netscape out of the market'' and
that the ``effect upon the much smaller Netscape was devastating.''
He also makes the truly bizarre argument that imposing conditions
on suppliers and customers ``is a form of predatory pricing''
because if the company didn't impose these conditions it presumably
could charge more. And he even repeats the single argument that he
is best known for demolishing: that a rich company can sustain
losses longer than a poor company, drive it under, and then raise
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Antitrust Paradox'' called predatory pricing ``a
phenomenon that probably does not exist.'' An aspiring predator,
Bork pointed out, would have to be willing to lose more money than
its victim for as long as the game went on. (Reason: It would be
selling more units, and losing money on each sale. And if it wasn't
losing money on each sale, the pricing would be efficient, not
predatory.) The predator could not count on the advantage of a
larger war chest, Bork argued, because if the victim were a going
concern apart from the predator's misbehavior, the capital markets
should be willing to bankroll its side of the battle. And predation
would only pay off if the survivor could and did raise prices
enough afterward to make up the enormous losses of the fight.
Between one thing and another, Bork concluded back then, alleged
victims of predatory pricing were almost surely financial
hypochondriacs.
</P>
<P>
   So how come ``a phenomenon that probably does not exist'' does
exist in this case? Browser Bork's explanation is that Book Bork
didn't know from software. The marginal cost of software (cost for
one additional unit) is just about zero, therefore you can start a
price war without much expense. That is an unfortunate argument for
Browser Bork, since Book Bork makes clear that pricing must be
``below marginal cost'' to be considered predatory at all. Browser
Bork also fails to note that the victim would enjoy the same low
marginal cost as the predator. So Book Bork's argument that
predatory pricing never works and therefore never happens is just
as true as ever--or possibly just as false as ever, but at any rate
its validity is unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The above discussion has very little to do with the Justice
Department's case against Microsoft. The DOJ never took the
position that tying arrangements, restrictive contracts, and
predatory pricing are harmless figments of the imagination, so it
is free to argue that they are dangerous monopolistic practices.
The DOJ never insisted that almost any plausible claim of economic
efficiency ought to outweigh concerns about the dangers of
monopoly, so the DOJ is free to say that in Microsoft's case they
do not.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bork is not free to say these things. Or he is not free
to say them and expect to keep his scholarly reputation. Did his
confirmation trauma turn a sprightly hard-truths ideologue into a
disingenuous cynic? If so, that's a shame. But it's no excuse.

MY CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a Microsoft employee, I have an obvious conflict of interest
in writing this article. Being an employee also makes me a
stockholder, which is another conflict, and a friend of many
Microsoft colleagues, which is a third. And Slate is owned by
Microsoft, making four.
</P>
<P>
   But I write it anyway, simply because the subjects of Robert
Bork and antitrust law have interested me since I reviewed ``The
Antitrust Paradox'' (favorably) for the New Republic 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I have waited for someone else to write this piece, and no
one has done so. Readers are free to discount or dismiss this
article because of its author. But the arguments here are all
heavily documented and can be evaluated, I think, independently of
authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Slate has established its willingness to publish articles highly
critical of Microsoft. This article, in any event, takes no
position on the merits of the Microsoft case. Bork's current
anti-Microsoft position may be correct. The challenge is to
reconcile it with anything he's said before he was hired by
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Like any hired expert in a legal case, Bork also has an obvious
conflict of interest. Indeed his is worse. My Microsoft paycheck
does not depend on agreeing with my paymasters. Bork's Netscape
paycheck does.

AGE OF THE MUTANT MORALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, the editor of this magazine, who was then the
editor of the New Republic, coined an aphorism for political
influence peddlers who defended their shady methods on the grounds
that they didn't violate the law. The scandal, he observed, isn't
what's illegal, but what's legal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, politics has stagnated, science has exploded, and
the art of moral rationalization has mutated to suit the new
environment. In this world, the game is redesigning human beings,
the stakes are ownership of the fountain of youth, and the scandal
is what passes as ``ethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, convened a hearing to examine the moral implications of two
recent experiments. Researchers funded by one company, Geron,
testified that they had taken ``stem cells'' from human embryos and
fetuses and had grown them into neurons, muscle cells, and other
tissues. Meanwhile, the CEO of another company, Advanced Cell
Technology, testified that by putting the nucleus of an adult human
cell into a cow's gutted egg cell, his researchers had converted it
into an embryonic human cell, which presumably could be manipulated
in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we learn to control the pathways that take stem cells down
the road to neurons, blood vessels, and heart cells,'' Geron's Vice
President Dr. Thomas Okarma testified, ``we can immortalize them by
telomerase gene transfer, so that sufficient quantities of these
cells can be grown for transplant applications.'' Old folks'
``degenerating organs'' would be repaired ``with young, healthy,
and fully functional cells.'' And one of the first organs to be
repaired in this way, the researchers promised, would be the brain.
</P>
<P>
   All this sounds wonderful. We can cure diseases, immortalize
cells, and theoretically live forever without the nasty old moral
problem of ``harvesting'' fetuses. But the prospect of a human
spare parts industry modeled on cooking, farming and car repair
raises a new moral problem. Human ingenuity--a grand synthesis of
agriculture, manufacturing, and information technology--is
dissolving human nature.
</P>
<P>
   The ethicists who advise politicians and biotech firms can't
comprehend the gravity of this step. Like lawyers, they dwell on
details instead of the big picture. While taking care never to
cross the line, they ignore anything short of crossing it, and they
don't notice that the line is gradually receding. They look for
moral problems in costs but never in benefits. And they quarrel
over yesterday's issues while being overrun by tomorrow's.
</P>
<P>
   For years, biotechnology ethics has been mired in the politics
of abortion. Since federal law restricts research on fetal tissue
and human embryos, the debate over stem cells has focused on
whether they are embryos and, if not, whether scientists are
killing embryos to get them. The token biotech critic at last
week's hearing, Richard Doerflinger of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, ignored the novel implications of the latest
experiments, complaining instead that the researchers had destroyed
embryos in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, pro-biotech witnesses argued that the stem cells in
the experiments were only ``pluripotent'' (capable of forming many
tissues), not ``totipotent'' (capable of forming an entire body),
and therefore weren't organisms or embryos. ``The issue that we're
dealing with,'' said Harold Varmus, the director of the National
Institutes of Health, ``is complying with the law, knowing the
legal definition of an organism.''
</P>
<P>
   But this lawyerly parsing misses the larger moral challenge: The
distinction between organisms and non-organisms is collapsing. In
embryonic development, totipotent cells (ostensibly organisms)
divide into pluripotent cells (ostensibly non-organisms), which in
turn divide into cells that are ``committed'' to become specific
tissues. The differences in time and in degree of versatility can
be subtle. Moreover, the cow-egg experiment, like the previous
cloning of a sheep, proved that the cycle is reversible:
``Committed'' adult cells can be restored to embryonic totipotency.
</P>
<P>
   The ethicists who testified at the hearing were obtuse to this
conundrum. The executive director of the National Bioethics
Advisory Committee confessed that in the course of discussing the
stem cell experiments, NBAC hadn't got around to the question of
defining an organism. Doerflinger, the Catholic spokesman, was so
intent on asserting the unique personhood of totipotent cells that
he dismissed pluripotent cells, by contrast, as non-organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than confront the new moral questions raised by stem cell
technologies, the witnesses praised them for abolishing the old
moral questions. Banks of stem cells, Varmus observed, would reduce
the need for ``fetal donors.''

   The panel's discussion of the cow-egg experiment was equally
shallow. Harkin quoted from a letter in which President Clinton had
said he was ``deeply troubled by this news of experiments involving
the mingling of human and nonhuman species.'' The senators joined
Michael West, the CEO who had supervised the experiment, in
debunking this ``misinformation'' (the cow's genomic DNA was never
mixed with the human DNA) and deriding the half-bovine, half-human
monsters drawn by editorial cartoonists as ``science fiction.''
West explained that he had used the cow egg only to ``reprogram''
the human cell, making it ``young again'' and restoring its ability
to ``become any cell type.'' The fake issue of mixing species thus
obscured the genuine issue of ``reprogramming.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MUTANT-SLATE-1000&AMP;ADD-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: of ``reprogramming.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other overhyped controversy that distracts ethicists from
the real action is cloning. The notion of replicating whole human
beings transfixes biotech alarmists. This concern, like species
mixing, is easily dispelled. ``We are not cloning human beings,''
West testified at the hearing. Indeed, why manufacture whole people
when there's more money in the parts business? The horror movie
scenario--cloning your whole body, freezing the clone, and
``harvesting'' its liver and kidneys when you need them--diverts
scrutiny from the real scenario: ``banking'' your stem cells and
growing them into new organs, including brain tissue, a la carte.
</P>
<P>
   This erosion of the distinction between whole humans and their
parts--technicians will be able to tweak your cells either
way--brings into question the moral privileges we attribute to
whole humans, such as personhood and bodily integrity. But no one
broached these questions at the hearing. Instead, as with abortion,
the panelists praised the new techniques for solving the old
questions. Doerflinger happily argued that by demonstrating other
ways of deriving stem cells, the new experiments had proved that
the cloning of whole embryos could be banned, as Catholic scholars
have proposed, without disrupting biotech research.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists also have trouble recognizing the new issues because
they're trained to look for moral problems in technology's costs,
not in its benefits. Dr. Arthur Caplan, the only ethicist at the
hearing who betrayed any awareness of the new issues, focused
instead on the morality of ``trade-offs.'' ``We should seek to
achieve the most good or benefit, with the least harm and
destruction of things that we value,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits of the new technologies--ultimately,
immortality and the rewriting of the recipe for human beings--are
precisely what philosophers ought to ponder. Where are we going?
What are we becoming?
</P>
<P>
   The immediate threat posed by the unraveling of the old physical
and moral distinctions--between human beings and human parts,
organisms and nonorganisms, subjects and objects--is that private
interests will come to own the stuff of which we're made.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing ended, Harkin expressed alarm that biotech
companies were claiming licenses and patents to human stem cells.
He said this concern had to do with the law, ``not with ethical and
moral implications.'' But if ethics is relegated to peripheral and
obsolete questions while industry deconstructs, redesigns and
manufactures human components just like any other commodity, laws
that exempt these components from patenting, licensing and other
property rights will lose their moral basis. And critics who object
that human life is sacred won't have a leg to stand on.

MONEYBOX: THE URGE TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the Exxon/Mobil merger, we've seen a small flurry
of articles arguing that acquisitions generally don't make sense,
except for the shareholders of the company that's being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of the New England Patriots' move to Hartford,
where Connecticut plans to build them a lovely $350-million
stadium, we've seen a wave of articles arguing that sports teams
are not sources of economic development and that deals of the sort
Connecticut has offered the Pats are corporate welfare of the worst
sort.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of stories are, of course, unquestionably accurate.
What's curious is that repeating these truths is still somehow
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to keep writing articles that say ``supply rises
to meet demand,'' after all. Yet when it comes to mergers and
acquisitions and to stadium-building, the economically rational
position has to be continually restated, because economic
rationality is persistently trumped by corporate ambition, simple
greed and political posturing. And what's especially appalling
about the whole state of affairs is that in both cases wealth keeps
getting redistributed upward for no apparent reason other than that
it can be.
</P>
<P>
   Some mergers, of course, do make sense. They remove excess
capacity, improve productivity, or allow companies to benefit from
economies of scale. But in evaluating any merger the basic
presumption has to be that it's a bad idea. This is not a subject
for argument any more. It's a fact. The empirical research is too
strong to be disputed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we don't need any more pieces about why mergers in
general don't work (and I've written more than a few of those
pieces). We need deal-specific analyses of what real business
purposes a given merger will accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what we'll find, more often than not, is that the
merger is the product of delusions of grandeur, imaginary
predictions of synergy, or, as Warren Buffett once put it, the
irresistible desire to buy a company because everyone else is doing
it. In the very worst cases, we'll find that managers are
orchestrating deals to line their own pockets, either in the form
of lucrative golden parachutes or the piles of stock options
they're sitting on.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of stadiums, we don't even need deal-specific
analyses, because no deal in which a state or city puts up hundreds
of millions of dollars to build a stadium from which a sports team
will derive all the profit is a good deal. When Pats owner Henry
Kraft announced he was moving the team to Hartford, he wept, in as
moving a display of crocodile tears as I've ever seen. The state of
Connecticut itself, in its own study, says that it'll take at least
14 years for the Patriots to generate enough revenue for the state
to cover the cost of building the stadium. And that's if everything
goes perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the best way for an already debt-ridden state to
spend public funds is to give the money to a multimillionaire would
be staggering if it weren't happening all across America. A sports
team isn't an auto factory, after all. Most of the revenue goes to
pay the salaries, not of 10,000 blue-collar workers, but of 50
millionaire athletes, who deserve everything they can get, but
don't deserve to have their workplace subsidized by taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   So why do these economically irrational things keep happening?
For the most obvious reason: because the people for whom the
decisions are economically irrational (shareholders in the case of
mergers and taxpayers in the case of stadiums) are not making those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, they could. And in theory, they should. But so much
smoke is blown in these cases that people still have a hard time
seeing through it. And the costs are removed enough--we'll have the
stadium a year from now, but we won't see the schools that haven't
been built as a result--that you need a longer-term perspective to
see them. Of course, that's no reason not to adopt that
perspective. The Connecticut legislature and Exxon shareholders
still have a chance to say no. Let's hope they do.

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; The Fast Way To See Films &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Films leave theaters and move on to home viewing. Where will you
find them first, in video stores or on pay-per-view? According to a
video industry survey, almost half the people who rent films on
videocassette are under the impression that they are available
either at the same time or sooner on pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the opposite is true. Somehow, almost 20 years into the
video age, many people are apparently unaware that movie studios
grant home video exclusive first use of movies for 30 to 60 days on
average before they are offered on pay-per-view and longer still
before they are shown on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the misperception, Blockbuster, the country's largest
video chain, is running a commercial in which a jellyfish gradually
evolves through the eons into a modern couch potato. That, the
message contends, is about how long it takes for a film to reach
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Cable people don't argue the point. ``If you want movies first,
the video store is the place to go,'' said Ted Hodgins,
pay-per-view manager of Media General in Fairfax County, Va. But he
added that the success of pay-per-view via satellite, if not cable,
has finally made home video pay attention to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `Antz' Goes Marching &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, video hurries along. Though ``Antz'' is expected to
play in theaters through December, Dreamworks Home Entertainment
has scheduled the video release for Feb. 9, only four months after
the film opened. Big movies typically take closer to six months to
reach stores.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Brown, head of Dreamworks' home entertainment operations,
said the idea was to join theater and video promotions. ``Keep the
ad campaigns right on top of each other,'' he said. Then focus on
the first week of release. ``That's when you get your shot,'' he
said, which is pretty much the way it works in movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jerusalem's Children &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there patrols around?'' asks Yacoub, a 9-year-old
Palestinian boy, speaking into his walkie-talkie as he scans the
streets from the rooftop. In ``Yacoub,'' one of seven half-hour
documentaries in Beverly Shaffer's series ``Children of Jerusalem''
from the National Film Board of Canada, he and his younger brother
pretend they are on the lookout for Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the film he engagingly describes his close
family life, his pride in his rigorous schooling, his job helping
out in his uncle's falafel shop and the devout religious regimen of
a Christian Arab boy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shaffer lets Yacoub and six other children, both Israeli and
Arab, talk about themselves as she films their families and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Asya, a 12-year-old Russian immigrant, revels in her new life as
an Israeli. Others in her household describe the frightening
tendency to blame Jews for worsening conditions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles are present or alluded to, but these are satisfying
little films, full of hope and gratitude, strong values, old
stones, sunny streets, well-kept flowers and delicious-looking
bread. The films are distributed by Ergo Media (information:
800-695-3746).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW RELEASES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Truce &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from his more frenetic roles, the gaunt-faced
John Turturro quietly portrays the Italian writer and Holocaust
survivor Primo Levi in the period immediately after his liberation
from Auschwitz by Russian soldiers. Based on ``The Reawakening,''
an autobiographical account by Levi, who committed suicide in 1987,
Francesco Rosi's film follows the writer as he makes a long journey
home through a series of displaced person camps. While there are
some flashy moments thrown in for effect, Stephen Holden wrote in
The New York Times, ``the anguished uncertainty clouding Turturro's
haunted face is all the drama this film really needs.'' _1996.
Miramax. $104.16. 128 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date:
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lethal Weapon 4 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With its familiar pieces in place, the old action series rattles
along on the same jokey, often wincingly banal camaraderie between
the detectives Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover). As
always, ridiculous situations _ in this case involving Chinese
gangsters who are smuggling illegal aliens _ serve as the
connective between fireballs. This time, Riggs' pregnant girlfriend
(Rene Russo) participates in the martial arts, but the attitudes
and banter, about homosexuality and other matters, are as benighted
as ever. That understood, ``the formula still has some zip'' (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   _1998. Warner. $107.37. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Madeline &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The 12 little girls from Ludwig Bemelmans' ``Madeline'' stories
are still in straight lines, but for the screen they've been taught
to lisp. A picture-book prettiness pervades this too terribly sweet
tale drawn from four Bemelmans books. Frances McDormand contributes
her usually adept performance as the mother hen, Miss Clavel, and a
production team not known for treacle has given the film a spare
visual sophistication. Otherwise it is ``best watched by viewers
who approach the material in a state of pre-adoration'' (Maslin).
_1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $23.95. 89 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.
Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Halloween: H20 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The H20 has nothing to do with water but refers to the fact that
the film commemorates the 20th anniversary of ``Halloween,'' John
Carpenter's very good original starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In this
film, directed by Steve Miner, Ms. Curtis is back (along with her
mother, Janet Leigh, a star of the original ``Psycho,'' whose minor
role here adds a nice touch). A campus, the locale of choice in
many recent horror films, is the setting for some grisly doings by
a vengeful slasher. But on this occasion, despite rustling
curtains, underlighted hallways and much suspenseful atmosphere,
``frankly, it's more marketing trick than moviegoer treat''
(Lawrence Van Gelder). _1998. Dimension. $107.37. 86 minutes.
Closed captioned. Release date: Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time or appeared on television. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KING LEAR. &LR;  Ian Holm stars in Richard Eyre's Royal National
Theater production, shown on Masterpiece Theater in October. A
minimalist ``Lear'' uses its spareness as part of the performance.
``This is Shakespeare filtered through Beckett and Brecht,'' Caryn
James wrote in The New York Times, ``but it's far from a slick
attempt to update the play. The result is a production of such
freshness that it seems we are seeing the old story anew.'' 1998.
Anchor Bay. $29.98. 150 minutes.

<P>
   &UR; MARIAN ANDERSON: THE STORY OF THE VOICE THAT BROKE BARRIERS. &LR; 
The contralto reminisces about a career that caught fire on the

   &UR; UMM THULUM: A VOICE LIKE EGYPT and NASSER 56. &LR;  Two videos share

DAD'S A SNOWMAN. (IS MOM SANTA?) 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning: Michael Keaton plays a struggling rock musician in
``Jack Frost'' and can be found stomping and singing the blues
(``Frosty the Snowman was as bad as he could be. ...'') even before
the credits are over.
</P>
<P>
   As the film's eponymous hero, he's one of those dedicated
rock-and-rollers who are also great husbands and devoted dads. But
the demands of his work sometimes keep him away from his son,
Charlie (Joseph Cross).
</P>
<P>
   The film is about what happens after Jack dies in a Christmas
Eve automobile accident and returns to his family as a large,
wisecracking marshmallow man parked on the front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   With emotions as sincere as the soap flake snow on its sets,
``Jack Frost'' goes on to show how much fun it is to have a snowman
as a loving (though dead) father. Thanks to the excellent efforts
of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, Snowman Jack can do anything from
snowboarding to coaching hockey (with pucks shooting right through
his middle). And when he gets damaged, he can just laugh it off and
repair himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I've had to put myself back together after some rough
nights, but this is ridiculous,'' he jokes after one such episode.
</P>
<P>
   As one more Hollywood effort to look on the sunny side of
fatality, ``Jack Frost'' is so sugarcoated that it makes other
recent efforts in this genre look blisteringly honest. On the other
hand, it's just cheerful and bogus enough to keep children
reasonably entertained.
</P>
<P>
   They may well want to believe in Keaton's affable Jack as the
coolest, most virtuous guy who ever picked up a harmonica, and in
Kelly Preston's Gabby as the kind of sweet, pretty mother who's
happy shoveling snow or fixing the drain beneath the kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   The film's Colorado townsfolk are also amusing, what with Henry
Rollins as Charlie's overheated hockey coach and Mark Addy (of
``The Full Monty'') as Jack's band mate and best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The long-in-the-tooth Jack Frost Band happens to be poised on
the verge of its first big break just as Jack realizes that Charlie
needs more of his time. In fact, the Frosts are all set to visit
their mountain cabin for a cozy family Christmas when Jack gets a
call summoning the band to Aspen immediately. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Jack goes for the brass ring, then suddenly realizes how much
more he cares about quality time with his loved ones. He heads for
the cabin but drives off the road, leaving the director, Troy
Miller, at a temporary loss. Without further ado, we get a ``One
Year Later'' title, a briefly sad Charlie and the return of Keaton
in the jokey voice-over portion of his role.
</P>
<P>
   A maudlin stretch becomes inevitable once the film has covered
two Christmases and run out of Snowman fun. So the screenplay,
which is credited to ``Mark Steven Johnson and Steve Bloom &AMP;
Jonathan Roberts and Jeff Cesario,'' and plays that way, brings out
the heavy emotional artillery.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: ``As long as you hold somebody in your heart, Charlie,
you can never lose them _ ever!'' And: ``I was so busy trying to
make my mark on the world. You ARE my mark on the world.'' And the
moral of the story: ``Everybody deserves a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Preston, Cross and especially Keaton do deserve credit for
playing their roles as credibly and breezily as possible under
these snowflaky circumstances. For extra insurance, ``Jack Frost''
is plastered with pop songs, with Stevies (Nicks and Ray Vaughan)
for baby-boom parents enjoying the prospect of immortality, and
Hanson for those who believe snowmen talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It
includes mild profanity, snowball fighting and parental death.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An honest mistake is what you could call ``Lettres
d'Amour,'' a new work for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
</P>
<P>
   A grim, amorphous piece about couples and outsiders seeking love
in a loveless climate, the work is stronger on atmosphere than
dance values.
</P>
<P>
   Its French-born choreographer, who uses one name, Redha, is not
a novice. He founded his company in France in 1983, has worked in
films and created a piece for the San Francisco Ballet a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Lettres d'Amour,'' which received its New York premiere on
Wednesday night as part of the Ailey troupe's season at City
Center, is dismally short on identifiable choreographic style.
There is something wrong when the most interesting movement on
stage shows a woman running up a kneeling man's chest.
</P>
<P>
   For all his ballet training (Rosella Hightower in France,
Stanley Holden in California), Redha strives for an eclectic
contemporary vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lettres,'' which was created for the Ailey company and first
performed in September during a South African tour, has some
theatrical impact, but its idiom is strangely inorganic, not
expressive or meaningful on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a dance work at the Ailey seemed so unsuited to its
members or its audience. Not every work has to be uplifting in this
company; this is not the only twist on the battle-of-the-sexes
theme. Donald Byrd and Ulysses Dove have not been slouches at
choreographing aggressive pieces in this vein for the company.
</P>
<P>
   But Redha does not give the dancers a focal point. They go from
gymnastic partnering to awkward floor work to exits and entrances
that are more disconnected than nonlinear. The oppressive
atmosphere is deliberate, but what should be a work about
unpleasantness becomes unpleasant itself.
</P>
<P>
   A science-fiction landscape is evoked in the initial
monochromatic ice-cold lighting design by Redha and Brenda Dolan.
Redha's costumes are black and gray. The men wear sleeveless
cassocks and strip to shorts and one kneepad. The women, in short
camisoles, don black velvet gowns. Presumably the people onstage
are hemmed in by ritualistic rules of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After a prologue in which two priestlike men strike fists to
their chests, the stage fills with six men and six women, assorted
couples or trios. The women are yanked and pulled. Some are
repeatedly held upside down in splits or they stand on men's
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The odd-man-out role goes to Richard Witter, given a solo in
which he repeatedly collapses and then rolls on his shoulder. At
the end, Renee Robinson looks in danger of being squeezed by light
projectors and electric fans that are moved toward her from four
corners. If all this were not enough (it isn't), the nine musical
recordings, ranging from Arvo Part to Gavin Bryars, threaten to
drown the action in an acoustical fog.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the revival of the 1970 ``Streams,'' one of Ailey's
less-than-successful plotless pieces, looked positively merry in
its clarity of form and structure. Martha Graham's pelvic
contractions, inserted into a balletic style, were superbly
executed. The droplet sound of Miloslav Kabelac's light percussion
score gave the piece its watery title, metaphorically rendered by
the flowing processions onstage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting the American civil rights movement as part
of a broader global struggle for human rights, President Clinton
honored Rep. John Lewis on Thursday for his lifetime fight against
racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, D-Ga., was one of four Americans to receive the inaugural
Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights. Clinton authorized the
awards to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, which the United Nations adopted in 1948, largely at
Mrs. Roosevelt's urging.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 58, was cited for ''uncompromising heroism in the face of
bigotry'' during an activist career that has spanned four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''From Freedom Rides to the House of Representatives, he has
educated and mobilized generations of Americans in the crusade
against injustice,'' read Lewis's award citation. ''He often did so
at great personal risk, yet he never deviated from his commitment
to peaceful change through nonviolent means.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis suffered repeated beatings that resulted in enduring
injuries and was arrested more than 40 times during the 1960s, the
height of a national confrontation between civil rights activists
and authorities enforcing segregationist policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was deeply touched and I was pleased to see the connection
between civil rights and human rights,'' Lewis said after receiving
his award. ''That's what our whole civil rights movement was all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Also receiving human rights awards from Clinton and First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Bernstein, regarded as the father of the New York-based
investigative and advocacy group Human Rights Watch, based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bette Bao Lord, a novelist and current chairman of Freedom
House, another New York-based human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy Thomas, also of Human Rights Watch, an advocate of
women's rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton cited the story behind the title to
Lewis's autobiography, ''Walking With the Wind,'' a tale of how
Lewis, as a small child, and several other youngsters held hands
and walked from one corner of a wooden frame home to the next
during a storm, using the weight of their bodies to keep the wind
from blowing over the fragile structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''That has become a metaphor for his life,'' said Clinton, who
went on to use the tale to symbolize the global quest to end
torture, murder and other forms of mistreatment, as embodied in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''By walking with the wind, hand in hand, they saved the house
and the family and the children,'' Clinton said. ''John says that
that walk is a struggle to find the beloved community. The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies to individuals, but
it can only be achieved by our common community.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, wearing a dark blue suit and seated on the dais near the
Clintons in a small auditorium in the Old Executive Office
Building, was far from the violence and the social turbulence of
the civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Images, however, swirled near his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just had a flashback to the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the
whole struggle,'' Lewis said after receiving the award. ''We still
have such a long distance to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Clinton, saying, ''I think the president has a deep
understanding of the significance of the struggle for people to
come together to create a beloved world where we can forget about
race and color and sex and nationality and just see people as human
beings.''
</P>
<P>
   One man inspired by Lewis was Wade Henderson, director of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a Washington coalition of
national groups concerned with civil rights and social welfare
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congressman Lewis is an icon for all Americans,'' said
Henderson, who came up to congratulate Lewis after he received his
award. ''He is a living symbol of the importance of perseverance
and commitment to purpose.''

MOBILE QUARTERBACKS ARE MORE IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sight has never been one to excite a
defender. For the most part, it's one of the worst situations to
face.
</P>
<P>
   A nimble quarterback drops back, finding his receivers covered
and his options limited. He steps up in the pocket, maybe shuffles
a bit to his right or left, then escapes with all hell breaking
loose in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   Massive linemen lumber after the guy. Linebackers question
whether to stay put or leave their pass defense zones in order to
smack a moving target. The defensive backs chase receivers, who can
break in any direction to find some open space. On the sidelines,
coaches utter profanities that would rival Richard Pryor on his
best days.
</P>
<P>
   No defender is happy, to say the least. At such a moment, one
certainly would opt for the time when most quarterbacks were
considered adequate if they were big, strong-armed and slow. But
the face of the pro quarterback is undergoing a subtle makeover,
with more scrambling models appearing in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the consummate drop-back passer is dead. He just
needs to be able to scoot every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The latest phenomenon is Buffalo's Doug Flutie. Before him there
were Kordell Stewart, Mark Brunell, Brett Favre, Steve Young,
Randall Cunningham and John Elway. After him, there will be Jake
Plummer, Charlie Batch and countless others. They come in all
shapes and sizes, with varied levels of success. But most
importantly, they come with wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anybody in an NFL player personnel position will tell you
how valued mobility and improvisational skills are in a pro
quarterback. They also will suggest this is nothing new. After all,
Roger Staubach and Fran Tarkenton made more than a few defenders
look silly in their day. What can't be denied, though, is how vital
elusiveness has become to a signal-caller's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what created my opportunity was Steve Young, Randall
Cunningham and Brett Favre having their success, making things
happen,'' Flutie said. ``It's starting to be looked at as an asset
when a guy can make plays on his own. That mode of thinking has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Flutie knows the old knock on athletic quarterbacks _
that some are too eager to bolt the pocket at the first hint of
danger. But the bottom line is whether a man is a playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, athleticism maximizes a quarterback's chances of
avoiding a long-term relationship with the medical staff. More than
half of this year's starting quarterbacks have missed a game due to
injury, primarily because defenses are filled with imposing
athletic specimens unleashed from such a multitude of angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes in defenses have made it harder to protect the
quarterback,'' said Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers. ``The
thing is, if you can't make the first guy miss when you drop back,
and I mean the first defender who comes free, you're going to have
a tough time in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The age of free agency has made the dearth of playmakers even
more glaring. Fewer offenses stay together today, making it more
difficult to maintain cohesiveness on that side of the ball. You
just can't have Montana-to-Rice going on for half a decade anymore.
Without that advantage, teams need someone who can produce when
disaster strikes, or at least sense when it's on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   This year's college stock, the deepest at quarterback since
1983, includes some players with the potential to do so. Excluding
Kentucky's Tim Couch and Washington's Brock Huard, that list of
mobile players includes Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper,
Syracuse's Donovan McNabb, Oregon's Akili Smith, Kansas State's
Michael Bishop and Cade McNown of the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some guys who can run and move around,'' said Ken
Herock, the Oakland Raiders' director of player personnel. ``But I
don't think anybody knows how good these guys are. There will
always be some failures in every crop. The tough thing is figuring
out who's not going to be a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   That has always been the catch, and given the record for NFL
teams of late, their gauge for determining success at quarterback
is somewhat flawed. There are enough bad quarterbacks. There are
enough aging ones. Now it's time to prepare for the future. Because
there are sure to be plenty more elusive ones.

RAIDERS' WILSON TO START AGAINST THE BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAMUEL CHI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Doug Flutie may be old, but he's not older
than Wade Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders will have the senior starting quarterback
when they play the Bills on Sunday in Buffalo. With their playoff
lives at stake, the Raiders have decided that Wilson, 39, will give
them their best chance.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hollas, who has been the Raiders' de facto starting
quarterback since Jeff George went down with a groin injury on Oct.
4 against Arizona, has a banged-up left wrist. That and his
ineffective performance against Miami Sunday were enough for
Raiders coach Jon Gruden to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade Wilson is a veteran quarterback,'' Gruden said. ``He's
healthy, he's experienced. He's a good athlete, with solid
mobility. He could make all the throws. And he's a system player
and he's a good leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's experience plays no small part in Gruden's decision.
Unlike Hollas, who's started only two games in his NFL career
before this season, Wilson is an 18-year veteran and a former Pro
Bowl selection. He took the Minnesota Vikings to three playoff
appearances and was with the Dallas Cowboys when they won the Super
Bowl in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fresh _ I haven't played that much since last year,''
Wilson said. ``I'm hoping (my experience) will help. It's a big
game. The crowd noise and the elements will make it difficult. I
hope to use the experience to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson took all of the snaps in practice Wednesday and is
expected to get most of them again Thursday. Hollas, who sat out of
practice Wednesday, will be Wilson's backup in Sunday's game if his
wrist recovers in time. If not, Pat Barnes might be named as the
No. 2 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donald is resilient enough to come back,'' Gruden said. ``He
will come back. He's not relinquishing his job. A lot of it has to
do with his injury and (lack of) preparation because of it. It's
the logical thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are probably more concerned about Hollas' state of
mind than the state of his wrist following his six-interception
performance Sunday. Hollas, though, said he had forgotten all about
the Miami game already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and got my calendar and cut out the date Dec. 6,''
Hollas said in jest. ``It never happened. So I don't even know what
you're talking about. It's like selective amnesia, you just put it
out of your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollas had an exam on Monday for his injured wrist and it
revealed no serious damage. While the injury won't hamper his
ability to throw, it poses a problem for him to take center snaps
and handoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt it on the play right before I got yanked,'' Hollas
said. ``I really didn't think of it at the time and after the game.
But I went home and by the next morning it was really swollen.
Nothing's broken, but unfortunately we didn't arrest (the swelling)
in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollas, with 10 touchdowns and 16 interceptions, saw his
quarterback rating plummet to 59.7, the worst of any quarterback
still starting in the NFL. Hollas is 4-2 as a starter this season
and 1-2 in relief of George.
</P>
<P>
   Hollas' injury prompted the Raiders to look at Wilson, who had
been the team's No. 3 quarterback since signing in the offseason.
He wasn't given the opportunity to compete for the backup
quarterback job in training camp and served mostly as insurance
policy. Wilson last started a game in 1996, when he was with the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has appeared in only two games this season, both in
relief of Hollas. In the Oct. 11 game against San Diego, he
replaced the ineffective Hollas late in the fourth quarter and
threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to James Jett with a minute
remaining to lift the Raiders to a 7-6 victory. Last week, he was
8-for-12 for 75 yards, with a 2-yard TD pass to Tim Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson knows Sunday's game is the most important of the Raiders'
season. A win will keep the Raiders in the playoff hunt. A loss
could mathematically eliminate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense of urgency,'' Wilson said. ``If we lose,
there's a possibility that we could be done. What I have to do is
be consistent, not to make big mistakes that hurt the team. We
can't lose the turnover battle.''

<P>
   The ruling is one of the few times that the high court, during
Chief Justice William Rehnquist's tenure, has defended a person's
right to be free of searches while in an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The police do not need a warrant to search an automobile, only
probable cause. Understandably, a car might be driven off and
evidence destroyed before a warrant could be obtained. The
exception to this rule is a car parked in the driveway of the
suspect's home.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Knowles was stopped in Newton, Iowa, for speeding. The
police officer, following Iowa law, had a choice of arresting
Knowles or issuing him a citation. The officer wrote a ticket and
then, as allowed by Iowa law, conducted a full search of the car
without Knowles' permission and without probable cause. The officer
found a bag of marijuana and a pot pipe. Knowles was then arrested
and charged with violating laws dealing with controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles moved to suppress the evidence as illegally obtained. He
lost in the Iowa courts and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the court.
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing that officer safety is a prime concern _ the
usual rationale for searching a person under arrest _ Rehnquist
noted that a traffic citation puts the police officer in much less
danger.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted with heavy irony: ``Once Knowles was stopped for
speeding and issued a citation, all the evidence necessary to
prosecute the offense had been obtained. No further evidence of
excessive speed was going to be found either on the person of the
offender or in the passenger compartment of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   We applaud the high court. This is a rare victory for privacy
rights. We'd like to see more respect for our privacy.

HISTORY IS THE FIRST COURSE AT THE WHITE HORSE TAVERN
</HEADLINE>

By CAROLYN BAUMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ For centuries, New England innkeepers have lured
tourists with the promise of rest in a bed where George Washington
once slept. The father of our country, it would seem, slept in lots
of places.
</P>
<P>
   But at Newport's White Horse Tavern, it's possible to gulp a
beer where Washington himself _ plus Paul Revere and Benedict
Arnold _ used to belly up to the bar for a tot of ale.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern acquired a liquor license in 1687 and hasn't stopped
serving since, making it one of the oldest food-and-beverage
establishments in the original 13 colonies _ plus 37. Although the
original, wide-beamed floorboards have long since been replaced,
careful stewardship has retained an authentic Colonial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the goal of the current owners, who have a strong
North Texas heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern ``goes back to the early days of colonial times,''
said O.L. Pitts, an 82-year-old Fort Worth resident who, with
several other friends, acquired the White Horse in 1981. ``There's
nothing like it. At night, having dinner by candlelight and a light
snow falling outside the window ...''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase was prompted by a 1980 conversation between Lee
Smith of Fort Worth and cable TV mogul and sailing enthusiast Ted
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted said the White Horse Tavern was taking Chapter 11, and we
couldn't let it go under,'' Smith said. ``He said, `You guys need
to buy it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Turner were in Newport for the America's Cup sailing
competition. It took 10 minutes to decide to make the purchase,
Pitts said, and a year to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Melissa J. Rogers, also of Fort Worth, has joined
the White Horse ownership. Working together, the North Texas troika
has kept the tavern's doors open _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day revelers enjoy White Horse hospitality just as much
as the Man on Mount Rushmore once did. Newport Life magazine named
the White Horse its area's ``most romantic restaurant''; it has
also been cited for excellence by the ``New England Travel Guide,''
The Wine Spectator, Yankee Magazine, and, most recently, by Rhode
Island Monthly, whose readers found the White Horse a premium site
for romantic dining.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder. Walking through the White Horse doors is like
stepping back in time, if food servers of old wore tuxedos.
</P>
<P>
   Fireplaces host welcoming blazes; rough wooden floors and other
rustic amenities are more 17th-century than 20th. Even the
plastered walls are textured with horsehair. The only telltale sign
of the Fort Worth owners is a Fort Worth Boat Club pennant hanging
in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   If the look of the White Horse is vintage, the libations and
food are modern. Although it calls itself a tavern, the White Horse
has evolved into an eating establishment offering reasonably priced
lunches and dinners. A New England lobster salad is $14; a ragout
of shrimp and scallops is $18.
</P>
<P>
   But the past is never forgotten. A ghost supposedly lurks in the
dark corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't change anything about it under the conditions we
bought. It has to stay as it is, as it was,'' Pitts said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The White Horse Tavern accepts reservations, but not men without
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   The tavern is at 26 Malborough St. in Newport, R.I.; call (401)
849-3600 for more information, or E-mail whitehorsetavern.com.

WHERE'S RICARDO MONTALBAN WHEN YOU REALLY NEED HIM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because one of the pleasures of ``Star Trek'' movies is the way
they reveal their mysteries layer by layer, it's best to take a
minimalist approach when writing about them. So here's a bare-bones
plot summary of ``Star Trek: Insurrection:''
</P>
<P>
   The Ba'ku, a peaceful tribe that shuns technology (sort of like
futuristic Amish), is living a quiet existence on an Eden-like
planet. The Son'a, an alien race that looks like
pantyhose-mask-wearing robbers crossed with shar peis, wants
something the Ba'ku have, and are willing to use force to get it.
The Enterprise intervenes. Action ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one surprise, though, and it's a little unpleasant to
report: After 1996's lively and entertaining ``First Contact,''
also directed by series star Jonathan Frakes, ``Insurrection''
comes off as flat and uninspired. It's not bad, really, but it
looks like an expanded episode of the ``Next Generation'' TV show,
where ``First Contact'' and 1994's ``Generations'' looked like
feature movies, even if ``Generations'' was a little leaden with
Capt. Kirk hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to put a finger on what's wrong; the writing is as
literate as ever _ despite a brief, misguided detour into hoary
cliche _ and although no one will ever confuse Frakes with Martin
Scorsese, he's a competent enough director. It may be that the
movie is just too democratic. The previous ``TNG'' movies focused
on one or two crew members, with everyone else relegated to the
background, but ``Insurrection'' gives everyone but poor Dr.
Crusher a mini-subplot. Even Marina Sirtis' Deanna Troi gets one,
after two movies of nothing but doe-eyed reactions to other crew
members' actions.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's an effort at reviving an ensemble feel, the upshot
of all this story-spreading is that it leaves everyone's little
plot underdeveloped and/or unresolved. The movie could have had a
lot more fun, for instance, with the story it gives the Klingon
Worf (Michael Dorn), but instead it lets it peter out, as if
screenwriter Michael Piller forgot it was there.
</P>
<P>
   Also curious is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the lead
Son'a. He's not over-the-top enough. It's as if wearing all those
pounds of makeup took something out of him; he's not so much
maniacal as he is cranky. This robs his inevitable showdown with
Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) of much of its payoff; where's some
good scenery-chewing when you need it?
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the movie does have some cool effects _
although it's a little too obviously filmed on the planet Sierra
Nevada _ and the script keeps a light touch, with some
laugh-out-loud lines when you least expect them. But the action
scenes are a bit anemic, and there's often too much talk between
them. It may be best to be minimal when describing the plot, but
that doesn't mean the movie should be minimal as it lets the story
unfold.

A TOO-SIMPLE PLAN FOR A MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's high-octane style _ twitchy, hyperkinetic
camera movement _ sounds like an exciting way to crank the rust out
of a film adaptation of ``A Simple Plan.'' Scott B. Smith wrote a
somber genre piece based on the Dostoevskian line that there is no
clean money. Three men find over $4 million in a small aircraft
that crashed in the snowbound woods near their hometown, and the
money divides them.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' with a wind chill
factor. I expected a surge of addled camera adrenaline, to loosen
the self-consciousness of the material, from Raimi, whose ``Evil
Dead'' trilogy brought parodistic glee to the horror genre.
Instead, Raimi has settled down into what could be called his first
adult movie. It's wintry and grown-up in a way that seems like an
apology for all the pleasure he has given.
</P>
<P>
   Hank (Bill Paxton), the closest thing to a moral center in
``Plan,'' wants to turn the money in, initially. ``Maybe there's a
reward,'' he says, mildly anxious, a line that's sure to get a
laugh. Lou (Brent Briscoe), who's been out of work for a while, is
already figuring out what he'll do with the dough. Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton), Hank's brother, is a wasted innocent who'll point in
whichever direction causes the least amount of friction. After they
convince themselves that the loot is drug money, they decide to
keep it, hiding it away ``until the spring,'' Hank says. Then,
they'll split it up and go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   As played, Paxton's Hank sets the tone. It's as if he's
suffering from lower-back discomfort _ he's miserable before the
picture gets started. His resolute glumness is reflected in the way
Raimi directs. There's not much here but the inevitable weight of
greed driving these men apart, and some vitality might have
distracted us from the eventuality. These guys seem to be friends
only because there aren't many people in the town, or the movie for
that matter. You just wait for Lou's wild hair to cause trouble;
he's the kind of lout who's almost as much trouble sober as he is
drunk, and he ain't sober too often. Thornton has shaped Jacob into
the most intriguing character in the movie, even though he's
inconsistently drawn. He's a dim martyr, the center of attention.
But Thornton's resigned and out-of-it, and his deliberate
showoffiness works. You do pay attention to him, and you long for
Jacob when he's not on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, snowy expanses offer some relief from the glumness.
And Bridget Fonda, as Hank's wife, has a sudden twist of conscience
that's funny. But all that's missing is one of the characters
getting a gleam in his eye and cackling about the cash. As ``A
Simple Plan'' grinds to its conclusion, several diverting moments
arise. But you may find yourself thinking it's a little too simple.
Raimi picked the wrong occasion to show that he doesn't have to
upstage his material.

SOME FEAR THAT MILLENNIUM BUG COULD PUT THE BITE ON FOOD SUPPLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WORTH WREN JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the millennium bug has you in a tizzy about your computers,
bank accounts and utilities, there's one more thing you might start
sweating: your food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear up front: Most experts say you have nothing to
fear.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped some folks from starting to stock up,
say those who sell survival supplies. Even traditional grocers and
grain executives have fielded calls from fretful consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the fear centers on the computer glitch predicted to
explode when 2000 hits. Older computers that designate years with
two digits won't know whether it's 2000 or 1900. Technological
doomsayers have suggested that the so-called Y2K bug could
interrupt the flow of foods and water, electricity, money and
information.
</P>
<P>
   Other people have less specific concerns tied to the turn of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, many businesses are starting to report
runs on items such as toilet paper, canned and dehydrated foods,
kerosene stoves and survival books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even ammo and gun sales are rising on those worries,'' said
Mark Abbott, a technical adviser at Cheaper Than Dirt!, a
sporting/survival goods supplier and gun dealer in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   While technology experts say the Y2K bug may affect some
dealings that depend on computers, most grocers say the food supply
will not be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's panic over nothing,'' said Larry Sadlowski, president of
the Winn-Dixie Texas division, which is based in Fort Worth. ``I
don't think we'll even notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other major grocery chains and suppliers, Sadlowski said,
Winn-Dixie Stores is upgrading its computer systems. Winn-Dixie's
systems will be 2000-compliant by early next year, and ``we're not
alone,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There probably will be some glitches in the food distribution
chain, Sadlowski said, but nothing on a scale to cause food
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what Sadlowski fears most are efforts by untrained
consumers to store large supplies of grains or uncanned food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already got rats pestering many of the neighborhoods,''
Sadlowski said. ``If you store wheat in the basement or the garage,
those rats or mice are going to think they've hit the food lotto.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Y2K has turned into a business opportunity
for some entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based Texas Grain &AMP; Feed Association reports it
is receiving two to four weekly telephone calls and e-mail queries
for sources of ``survival grains.'' That compares with a typical
one or two per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a market for people's fears,'' said Ben
Boerner, the association's president.
</P>
<P>
   At Cheaper Than Dirt!, orders for ready-to-eat meals _
comparable to military field rations that can be stored without
refrigeration _ are approaching 5,800 cases (at 12 meals per case)
per month, up from about 500 in November last year.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K demand also has spilled over into solar-powered lights,
military-surplus wool blankets and sleeping bags.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for survival items such as ready-to-eat meals generally
rises in the fall and winter as customers prepare for hunting trips
and weather emergencies in the northern United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Darrell Kidd, a buyer for Cheaper Than Dirt!, credits Y2K
concerns for most of the rising demand for the ready-to-eat meals.
</P>
<P>
   One customer, a Miami doctor, recently bought $10,000 in silver
coins and 48 cases of ready-to-eat meals. The same customer loaded
up on gun ammo to be used if law and order breaks down. The coins,
presumably, could substitute for cash if chaos occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Walton Feed, the 50-year-old dean among U.S. retailers of
dehydrated and other long-term storage foods and equipment, says
many shipments are five to 12 months behind schedule. Walton is
based in Montpelier, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephenville, Texas, career social worker Barbara Gaume has
formed Millennial Basics. Its offering, which it hopes to bring to
market by January: food-grade whole wheat in extra-tough plastic
bags.
</P>
<P>
   A case of six airtight, 6-pound bags will cost $25 plus
shipping, which could run almost as much as the case. Gaume figures
she will have no trouble selling all 22,000 pounds of bulk wheat
she bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a doom-and-gloom type of person,'' said Gaume, whose
full-time job is executive director of the Star Council on
Substance Abuse. But she advocates these precautions: ``Store what
you will use and use what you store.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison Milling in Denton, Texas, said it receives up to six or
seven phone calls a day from people, including homemakers and
corporate executives, who want to buy and store bulk wheat or corn
or purchase grinders for the grains, said Fred Bursey Jr., the
flour miller's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest, `Buy a big sack of flour or several small sacks and
put 'em in the freezer,''' Bursey said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dallas policeman Greg Bowen, who started Millennium
Resources of Texas about a year ago in the East Texas city of
Mineola, said his monthly sales rose about 30 percent in the past
three months on assorted nitrogen-packed whole grains, dried beans,
peas, dehydrated milk and soup mixes, grain grinders, water
purifiers and other emergency items.

   NEW YORK _ Not since Alfred Hitchcock put poor Tippi Hedren
through all that nasty pecking have so many unwelcome birds crowded
into a single landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In `` `Hope' Is the Thing With Feathers,'' the new drama by
Frank Pugliese and the latest offering from the Drama Dept., there
are avian visitors galore. True, they appear mostly as poetic
conceits rather than physical creatures, but they are dominating,
noisy things all the same, chattering up a symbolic storm.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, by way of example, the following occurrences found in
the last few minutes of the drama. A young woman holds up a cage
with a white dove inside while delivering homilies on life and
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, on the other side of the stage, a bird
(invisible) swoops into a New York apartment just as a group of
four is sitting down to a nourishing meal of _ what else? _ bird's
nest soup.
</P>
<P>
   It honestly doesn't spoil the evening's ending to report that
these events, which are set against the sight of a somewhat
birdlike boy falling through the sky, are meant to signify the
continuing renewal of hope in the human spirit. `` `Hope' Is the
Thing With Feathers'' may not be much of a play, but it does have
the courage of its literal-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   The title of Pugliese's work comes from the poem by Emily
Dickinson, and he does indeed seem to reach for a Dickinsonian
grasp of the eternal in the everyday. Interlinking stories of three
couples of different ages who have all lost faith in the future,
``Hope'' is replete with metaphoric considerations of objects like
seashells, trees, loaves of bread, cornflowers and newspapers in
which Italian sandwiches are wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pugliese, who is best known for his 1993 drama, ``Aven'U Boys,''
which brought to mind a frillier version of Hubert Selby Jr.'s
``Last Exit to Brooklyn,'' has always shown a lyrical bent. The
pleasure he takes in linguistic flourish and careful patterns of
imagery can be refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, the overall effect is of looking into the
literary journals of a precocious, sensitive plant of a high school
student, the sort of ruminations writers tend to burn in middle
age.
</P>
<P>
   The real surprise is that ``Hope'' comes from the Drama Dept.
Since making its debut with a witty and touching revival of
Tennessee Williams' ungainly ``Kingdom of Earth'' two years ago,
this troupe has seemed incapable of making a false move, scoring
with everything from a deconstruction of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin'' to
Douglas Carter Beane's frothy dissection of celebrity culture, ``As
Bees In Honey Drown.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Five out of six, by the standards of today's theater,
not only ain't bad, it's close to miraculous. And no one associated
with the staging of ``Hope'' is treating it as an ugly stepchild.
</P>
<P>
   Set against a tiered backdrop of Magritte-like blue skies, the
work of the terrific projection designer Wendall K. Harrington, the
show's look attractively matches the poetic ether of Pugliese's
text.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Randolph Curtis Rand (of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin''),
brings clarity and discipline to the proceedings. And the excellent
six-member cast tackles its Kahlil-Gibran-like dialogue with a
no-nonsense precision that keeps the evening less sticky than it
could be, though it's not easy wrestling with lines like ``We build
Great Walls of China in our tiny hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Nixon, as a spiky-haired, commitment-fearing journalist,
and Maria Tucci, as a temperamental doctor's wife, manage to hit
occasional moments of sharp emotional resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Nobbs and Robert Hogan, as a disillusioned teen-age
hoodlum and a disillusioned doctor, wear their respective burdens
of youth and age with restrained flair, and Avery Glymph is quietly
appealing as Ms. Nixon's lover.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Garces, a very pretty young actress who portrays the
play's most whimsical character (and that's saying a lot), isn't
always audible. Given that she is asked to say things like, ``Hope
is a tree,'' this may be for the best.

 &HT;    SHORT TAKES: A brief history of weatherphobia
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather turned a bit snappier and more appropriate
the other day. We had a few rain showers. People seemed happier.
They had mostly been griping about all the nice weather we were
having. There was a small thrill of fear in their griping. Then,
finally, nice, normal, gray, dark clouds. Aren't they great?
</P>
<P>
   We all probably have a gene somewhere that remembers the ice age
and the great glaciers. Weather, like its big sister Nature, makes
us feel smaller and less in control. There is considerable evidence
supporting that view.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a body of evidence _ enough to convince even a
House Republican _ that all this strange weather is our fault. As
they say in the old sci-fi films, ``Man was not meant to tamper
with the unknown.'' And we have done it. The quite resilient
natural air and water that sustains life may have suffered a
critical insult.
</P>
<P>
   So, suddenly, we have summer in the fall, and the trees and the
animals seem confused, put out buds, go to sleep at the wrong time.
We have started noticing. We look around and discover it's a nice
day, when the part of us that is still connected with Nature tells
us we should be covered with snow and have icicles on the tips of
our noses.
</P>
<P>
   Nice day, we say to our neighbors on those rare occasions we see
them. Isn't it awful?

A FASHION STATEMENT DRAPED IN CUBISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some exhibitions have hard acts to follow. ``Cubism
and Fashion,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume
Institute, is saddled with at least two. One is last year's big
winter show at the institute, an over-the-top survey of Gianni
Versace. This exercise in elegant kitsch was exhilarating fun, but
it had roughly the same relationship to serious design that the
motorcycles in the Guggenheim's dazzling summer show had to real
art.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Cubism and Fashion,'' Richard Martin, the curator of the
institute, has wisely taken a different tack, reinstating both
historical perspective and the wide-angle view. His new show traces
the influence of modern art's most earthshaking movement on the
work of several generations of 20th-century designers, rather than
on a single contemporary career. It's a real palate cleanser, so
pure and restrained as to seem almost penitential, as if to
compensate for last year's excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the second act. This exhibition may also feel
wan because it is based on an idea that is either not fully
developed or not inherently rich enough to begin with. The two
possibilities can nag at the viewer's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The recent standard for exhibitions linking fashion and
20th-century art is ``Fashion and Surrealism, '' which Martin
organized in 1987 at the Fashion Institute of Technology (where he
was worked as a curator from 1980 to 1993). Ambitious and
exhaustively detailed, this show represented a near-perfect fit
that Cubism, with its emphasis on abstract form and structure,
might never match, even under ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, there's little about Surrealism that
doesn't dovetail with fashion, from its focus on the female form
and physical beauty to its extensive uses of photography and
altered or displaced objects. And there are frequent crossovers _
Man Ray's photographs, Dali's fabric designs, Bellmer's dolls and
Duchamp's store window, for example, all of which Martin included
or referred to in his Surrealist show. (In the Cubism exhibition,
he includes reproductions of famous modern paintings _ Picasso's
``Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' Duchamp's ``Nude Descending a
Staircase'' _ color coordinated with the clothes.) In addition,
``Fashion and Surrealism'' unfolded over 8,000 square feet at the
FIT, nearly twice the amount of gallery space at the Costume
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests a third act, one that can't be followed because it
isn't over. It centers on the question: what does the Met want from
the Costume Institute? Its commitment doesn't seem to be as strong
as it used to be, and this can limit curatorial creativity. After
the reign of Diana Vreeland, whose sprawling exhibitions put the
institute on the map in the 1970s and '80s, the museum severely
reduced and relocated its galleries, shrinking space from 14,000
square feet to 5,000. In addition, its exhibitions are limited
almost exclusively to items in the Met's permanent collection.
(Everything in ``Cubism and Fashion'' is owned by the Met except
two 1998 dresses lent by Geoffrey Beene.) While Martin has done
some outstanding shows at the Met, few of them have matched the
breadth or depth of his FIT efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the nagging thoughts. It is hard to know exactly what is
being stretched to the limit: the idea or the Costume Institute's
collection. Or what makes the show feel meager: again, the idea or
the institute's galleries. But that shouldn't stop you from looking
and learning what you can.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's thesis is that Cubism's radical reorientation of
painting's pictorial conventions _ its flattening of space, its
emphasis on structure and its preference for indeterminate forms,
layered transparencies and multiple viewpoints _ played an
important role in the modernization of dress that began around the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   His approach is largely formal and highly focused. He
acknowledges other influences only occasionally: mentioned, for
example, are Japanese kimonos, whose simplified forms were
extremely influential in those years, as demonstrated by ``Japonism
in Fashion: Japan Dresses the West,'' a related exhibition at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art. And he doesn't touch on the increasing
liberation of women during the same period, which surely had
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the clothes speak for themselves, at least in the first
gallery. Here their dramatic changes in bulk and structure signal
the profound rise in the physical and mental freedom of women that
occurred between the late 1890s and the end of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Martin makes the point with three opulently upholstered ball
gowns from the turn of the century, elegant armor that camouflaged,
extended and encased the wearer's body. He then turns to the
designs of Callot Soeurs, who retained richly embroidered fabrics,
but reduced the volume of the dress to a simple cylinder that
mirrored the body far more accurately. Even more reduced is an
evening dress from around 1920 by Paul Poiret. It forsakes even the
cylinder for the flat plane of fabric, wrapping and draping the
figure in what are essentially large squares of red silk deeply
bordered in navy blue.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in two decades, the female silhouette comes into view. In
one of the show's best wall texts, Martin describes late
19th-century dresses as inherently sculptural, stand-alone garments
that looked very much the same on the body or hanging in the
closet. In contrast, modern clothes tended to be flat and limp,
their structural logic incomprehensible until someone put them on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of the exhibition, Martin follows the
different Cubist innovations he has defined from garment to
garment, through examples profound and superficial. Jacques Doucet
is represented by a day suit whose jacket is little more than an
asymmetrical plane folded around the body. A dress-and-coat
ensemble by the designer Nemser features a fairly silly dress
printed in a routine Cubist-Art Deco cityscape pattern (its skirt
has round-topped panels of pleats reminiscent of the Chrysler
Building). Non-Cubist signs of modernity enter the discussion: the
abstracted plant forms in white applique on a blue silk dress by
Mariska Karasz is seen as reflecting the influence of Matisse and
modern artists' attention to peasant designs.
</P>
<P>
   The show's heart is a cluster of nine dresses by Madeleine
Vionnet, who is similarly central to Brooklyn's ``Japonism'' show.
Undoubtedly the result of synthesized influences, Vionnet's
breathtaking economies of dress still look like modernism
incarnate. Transparent, planar, structurally declarative, they
reduced the garment to its scaffolding and reconstituted it so that
every seam and stitch figured in the whole, and the body's
scaffolding was revealed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fabric played a new role, as Vionnet was the first designer to
exploit the bias cut. It enabled her to reorient seams in sweeping
diagonal lines and fanning curves, and created an effortless flow
and body-skimming effect.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is added; it's all in the fabric. When Vionnet wanted to
complicate things, she might make a strap look like a bit of scarf
casually draped over a shoulder. Her specialties included groups of
tiny pin-tucks that measured a skirt or dress in fine parallel
lines. In a maroon silk chemise dress from 1926-27, ranks of
pin-tucks descend diagonally from each shoulder to a pin-tucked
skirt. Where they meet, at the garment's dropped waist, they create
a delicate gridded square that magnifies the fabric's weave, and
its bias tilt.
</P>
<P>
   After Vionnet, this exhibition comes to life only
intermittently, usually when her inventions are evoked, as in the
deconstructed garments of the Japanese designers Rei Kawakubo and
Issey Miyake. Its final third, devoted to postwar and recent
fashion, includes a startlingly plain white-and-navy evening gown
by Jo Copeland, and a dress and a suit by Christian Francis Roth,
whose bold geometric fabrics glibly quote earlier designers glibly
quoting Cubism.
</P>
<P>
   A glittery bodysuit ensemble by Versace, luxuriously beaded with
layered motifs, is suitably collagelike. And a suit by Charles
James, which was once owned by the painter Lee Krasner, reiterates
some of Vionnet's inventive use of seams, but in stiff, heavy
fabric that takes one back to the upholstered evening gowns at the
show's start.
</P>
<P>
   This section also includes ball gowns by Yves Saint Laurent, one
with a noticeable bustle, the other with the low, square neckline,
fitted bodice and full contrasting overskirt of an 18th-century
French gown. And the bright geometries of a Perry Ellis sweater,
said to be inspired by the work of Sonia Delaunay, only makes one
wonder why Delaunay's designs are not included. The answer, one
assumes, is that the Met doesn't own any. It would have been
interesting to see what this show would look like with more space
and greater freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubism and Fashion'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, through March 14. The exhibition
is made possible by Prada.

``HALLELUJAH! RON ATHEY: A STORY OF DELIVERANCE': BLOOD AND
RAPTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Body artist, extreme masochist, HIV-positive gay man, heavily
tattooed freak, former heroin addict, onetime grant recipient from
the National Endowment for the Arts and thorn in its side (after a
1994 performance at the Walker Center drew complaints), Ron Athey
has turned his life into the most radical kind of performance art.
</P>
<P>
   In his collaborations with a traveling troupe of self-described
outcasts, Athey swirls his experiences into mock-Christian rituals.
In one he is ecstatically tormented with a crown of thorns
consisting of hypodermic needles that spill blood across his face
as they are inserted into the skull. At the moment of insertion,
Athey, his eyes rolling heavenward, wears an expression of
rapturous calm.
</P>
<P>
   The crowning is only one of several blood-letting scenes in
Catherine Gund Saalfield's documentary portrait ``Hallelujah! Ron
Athey: A Story of Deliverance,'' which opens today at Cinema
Village. This is a movie that is definitely not for the squeamish
or the sexually prudish. In addition to the blood-smearing, the
film offers a methodical catalog of advanced sexual kinkiness, with
scenes of piercing, bondage, branding, flogging, enemas and dildos.
</P>
<P>
   As Athey tells it in a disarmingly boyish manner, he was born an
extremist, having been raised by a Pentecostal grandmother to be a
prophet. Anyone who is brought up in such an extremely devout
environment is probably bound to have a hyperdeveloped sense of
good and evil, of Jesus and the devil locked in perpetual combat.
When Athey flashes a sly grin and widens his blue eyes, you have
the sense of a performer taking pleasure in being the naughtiest
little boy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Athey's performance art is admittedly a desperate act. As an
HIV-positive man, he insists he wants to make the most creative use
of whatever time he has left. And his performances take body art
about as far you can go, short of suicide and actual dismemberment.
The most disturbing excerpt from his work shown in the film is a
section from ``Martyrs and Saints,'' in which impassive white-robed
``doctors and nurses'' brutally parody invasive medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Athey lacks the wit of the late Bob Flanagan, whose masochistic
demonstrations were the subject of last year's memorable
documentary film ``Sick,'' a much more intimate exploration of
similar material, minus the religious iconography.
</P>
<P>
   Are Athey's performances art or psychodrama? They're both, of
course. Sacred or profane? Again, both. With their emphasis on
visceral and spiritual extremes, they're also blatantly obvious
attempts to shock.
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing statement Athey makes is an offhanded
voice-over comment heard at the very end of the film. ``Which came
first, the evangelist tent or the circus tent?'' he muses.
``Sometimes there isn't any difference.''
</P>

   It's the perfect holiday gift for a movie lover: a
movie-and-video guide. Several are on the stands, and each has
something to recommend it. We've done a quick study in an attempt
to sort them out for you. Although their ratings systems differ,
our ratings are on a scale of one to five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Movies and Videos 1999, six
editors credited (Island Books, $7.99)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 23,000, including individual
reviews of TV episodes (you should see the ``Star Trek'' section).
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: One to five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``Spice World,'' released Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: Reviews that are less mainstream than you might
expect; neither ``The English Patient'' nor ``Titanic'' merits even
four stars. Reviews include genre categories that don't always jibe
with what you'll find on the video stores' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: Although some folks will be glad to see that the
guide doesn't list X or NC-17-rated movies, it seems to pick and
choose: the NC-17 ``Bad Lieutenant'' (unrated here) is included,
but the controversial ``Kids'' isn't.

   Halliwell's Film &AMP; Video Guide 1999, edited by John Walker
(Harper Perennial, $22.50)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 23,000, almost all theatrical
releases.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: Zero to four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``Godzilla,'' released May 20.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: This thing's a monster, but if you've got the
patience, it has some fun things: trivia bits, outtakes from other
critics' reviews, cast lists that italicize the names of actors who
made impressive contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: Man, is that rating system confusing. Indexes to
three- and four-star films help. The entries are so cumbersome, you
practically need a map; fortunately, a guide is printed on the
inside front cover.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 1/2

</P>
<P>
   Leonard Maltin's 1999 Movie &AMP; Video Guide (Signet Reference,
$7.99)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 19,000, including made-for-TV
movies but not TV series episodes or miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: BOMB to four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' released June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: Almost indispensable. Few movie-reference books
are as timely as Maltin's (it often covers films still in
theaters). Maltin has been accused of being too middlebrow, but he
can be contrary (he dismisses the highly regarded ``Taxi Driver,''
among others). The book's largely easy-to-follow format helps call
attention to quality foreign films, sleepers and movies of
historical importance. BOMB reviews are often laugh-out-loud funny.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: The literal alphabetization technique can be
confusing. ``Star Trek: First Contact _ the most recent ``Trek''
film before today's ``Insurrection'' _ is the first listed among
the eight ``Trek'' entries. The selective actor and director
filmographies seem arbitrary.

<P>
   Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 1999 (Andrews McMeel Publishing,
$16.95)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: About 630.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: Zero to four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``Armageddon,'' released July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: Ebert's guide, the only annual with full-length
reviews, includes everything the Chicago Sun-Times critic has
written from Jan. 1, 1996, to June 30, 1998. Few reviewers have a
more relaxed style. The book's appendixes _ Ebert's 1997 top-10
list, his informative and clever ``Questions for the Movie Answer
Man'' feature _ are unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: Sometimes, Ebert's reviews seem to be as much
about him as the movie, and he can still be a soft grader. Previous
Ebert books have included info on how to order hard-to-find videos;
that's missing here. Obviously, there are fewer reviews than in
other guides.

<P>
   Time Out Film Guide, edited by John Pym (Penguin Books, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: None.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``The Truman Show'' (June 5) is the most
recent significant U.S. release.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: This compilation from British film magazine
``Time Out'' is the capsule-review book for the film-snob crowd,
although it's not above praising the first ``Speed.'' It includes a
top-100 readers' poll (''The Godfather'' is No. 1), a thoughtful if
somewhat smug foreword, and an index that's practically insane with
categories (''Attila the Hun, film about'').
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: It brags that it covers more offbeat fare _ and
doesn't give you one clue how to go about finding it. Many people
will find its stuffily superior attitude unnecessarily snotty. Most
weekend renters would be better off with other guides.

   Video Movie Guide 1999, edited by Mick Martin &AMP; Marsha Porter
(Ballantine Publishing Group, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 17,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: ``Turkey'' (a silhouette) to five stars.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``Out of Sight,'' released June 26.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: The only one of these guides to list only titles
available on video, excluding brand-new releases. New reviews are
marked with a bullet (), making them easy to find. Probably the
only book brave enough to give three stars to the infamous ``Plan 9
From Outer Space,'' because the movie's so bad that it's
entertaining; the ``turkey'' rating is reserved for stuff that's
absolutely worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: The reviews aren't very in-depth, even by the
necessarily shallow standards of capsule reviewing. There seem to
be four- and five-star reviews on every page.

   VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever 1999, edited by Martin
Connors and Jim Craddock (Visible Ink, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Number of entries: More than 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rating system: Woof! to four bones.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent title: ``The Negotiator,'' released July 29
(synopsis only); ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is the most recent
review.
</P>
<P>
   The good stuff: This flagship book in the VideoHound series
belongs on any VCR owner's shelf. The editors have a fun, cheeky
attitude (''Citizen Kane'' is there, but so is the Tom Hanks
slob-comedy ``Bachelor Party''). More than a dozen great indexes
include chronological filmographies and a Web-site guide. It also
has the best how-to-order information.
</P>
<P>
   The bad stuff: This book may actually be too big _ it's
overwhelming. The cheeky attitude too often doesn't come out in the
reviews, which is surprising for a book that uses ``Woof!'' to rate
bad movies. But although the Maltin guide has better reviews, this
has replaced it as the one to beat.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS GEORGIA SCHOOLS MISSING MARK
 &HT;    660 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Georgia schools need to decrease classroom
disruptions, improve teacher education and boost minority
participation in math and science, according to a national report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the report shows more Georgia students are attending
college and more mothers are receiving prenatal care, minority
participation is still an uphill battle, and fewer teachers hold
certificates in the subjects they teach.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   While the number of students proficient in mathematics increased
nationally from 18 percent to 21 percent between 1992 and 1996,
Georgia achievement remains stagnant at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most states have increased the number of minorities
who receive degrees in mathematics and science, while Georgia
numbers have decreased. In 1995, 43 percent of minorities received
those degrees, compared with 44 percent in 1991. Nationally, 40
percent of minorities received the degrees in 1995, compared with
39 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The number of teachers holding a certificate in their main
teaching assignment also is dropping in Georgia and the nation. In
1994, 94 percent of Georgia teachers had certificates, compared
with 98 percent in 1991. Nationally, that number decreased from 94
percent to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More Georgia teachers are reporting that students disrupt
classroom instruction. About 46 percent of teachers said these
disruptions interfered with instruction in 1994, compared with 37
percent in 1991. Those percentages were the same for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't all bad. Georgia made more progress than any
other state in increasing the percentage of mothers who receive
prenatal care. In 1996, 85 percent received care, compared with 73
percent in 1990. Nationally, 82 percent received care in 1996,
compared with 76 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say prenatal care is important to student achievement
because children who are born healthy perform better in school.
</P>
<P>
   The state also was highlighted in a ``Promising Practices''
report for its progress in increasing college enrollment. In 1996,
56 percent of high school students enrolled in college, compared
with 54 percent in 1992. The report also showed that community
college enrollment jumped 25 percent between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the rise in college enrollment to the HOPE
scholarship program started in 1993. Under this provision, Georgia
high school students who earn a B average or better receive free
tuition to any of the state's colleges or universities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hoped the report would help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a few years ago, Neil Pepe would probably have
looked a little out of place circulating among the eggplant canapes
under crystal chandeliers in the Terrace Room at Tavern on the
Green. What, one might have asked, is the artistic director of a
172-seat, off-Broadway theater in Chelsea doing rubbing elbows with
all those veteran Broadway producers at a presentation of awards?
</P>
<P>
   This year the answer was winning one. On Nov. 23, Pepe's
Atlantic Theater Company was presented with the 15th annual
Jujamcyn Theaters Award, a grant of $50,000. And Pepe, 35, looked
at ease, accepting congratulatory hugs from Bernard Gersten, the
executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, as he scribbled notes
for his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Pepe's presence and the honor given the Atlantic, which brought
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' to New York last season, was a
small but significant indication of the recognition that
off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway nonprofit theaters are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, these theaters have toiled in obscurity and struggled
to make ends meet. But critical success for recent productions like
``Wit,'' ``This Is Our Youth'' and ``Killer Joe'' has lured more
conventional theatergoers below Times Square, increasing ticket
sales, building new audiences and attracting commercial Broadway
producers to sniff around for possible imports.
</P>
<P>
   These winning streaks would seem like a windfall for small
companies. But good times also raise questions for these theaters
about how to handle their heady moments in the sun and whether
having a commercial hit changes the artistic essence of what they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to let success change your esthetic,'' Pepe
said. ``You want to continue to do plays you believe in, that you
feel are stories worth telling. You would never want to base that
on what you feel would be commercially successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of small theater successes in the city are in abundant
supply lately. MCC Theater, on West 28th Street, has a triumph on
its hands with ``Wit,'' the play starring Kathleen Chalfant as a
Donne scholar confronting cancer. It is moving to the Union Square
Theater next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New Group has seen its production of ``This Is Our Youth,''
a play about rudderless Upper West Side rich kids, revived to rave
reviews by the Second Stage Theater Company at the Promenade
Theater. And Barry and Fran Weissler, the Broadway producers, plan
to move it to the Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village in January.
</P>
<P>
   The 29th Street Rep's production of ``Killer Joe,'' the grisly
drama it originated in 1994, is playing to sold-out crowds at the
Soho Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Adobe Theater Company is reveling in an open-ended run of
``Duet!: A Romantic Fable,'' a quirky comedy at the Actors'
Playhouse in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarter Theater Center for the Performing Arts in
Princeton, N.J., a regional theater, moved its celebrated
production of ``Electra'' to Broadway last week, where it was
welcomed with glowing reviews.
</P>
<P>
   And other off-off-Broadway companies have had similar successes
over the last few years, including the Vineyard Theater, which
produced ``How I Learned to Drive'' and ``Three Tall Women,'' both
of which won Pulitzer Prizes; the Drama Department, which
simultaneously produced ``As Bees in Honey Drown,'' ``June Moon''
and ``Uncle Tom's Cabin or Life Among the Lowly''; the Tectonic
Theater Project, which produced ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials
of Oscar Wilde,'' which is now playing in Washington, and Target
Margin, which produced ``Mamba's Daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, success with critics and audiences is just plain
sweet, executives at small companies say, giving them a much-needed
shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success that feels really good is A, the attention and B,
that you're not doing it for 12 people for four nights,'' said
Jeremy Dobrish, 30, the artistic director of Adobe. ``It feels
great that people are finally noticing and paying attention and not
just blowing us off or thinking, because we're Off-Broadway, we're
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   At MCC, the staff of five is working 17-hour days trying to
handle the volume of ticket sales for ``Wit'' and turning away 150
people a night. Suddenly, agents are returning their calls. And the
theater's executive directors, Bernard Telsey and Robert LuPone,
find themselves feeling more ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ask that director to work here even though we may only
pay $500; maybe we can do that musical,'' Telsey said. ``It has
given us the confidence to reach higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the attention often means a company can afford a
few rare luxuries, like a new computer, and make it somewhat easier
to seek contributions from donors, board members and foundations.
An infusion of money can also underwrite a theater's shakier
artistic efforts, as the long-running ``Chorus Line'' did for the
Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   But such hits are not the transforming elixir many assume them
to be, company executives say. It doesn't mean they can suddenly
hire a full-time staff or stop applying for grants or no longer
worry about their survival. Unless the productions run considerably
longer than originally planned or are moved to commercial runs that
the companies retain a piece of, critical acclaim and a growing
audience does not necessarily amount to financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Making it work off-off-Broadway remains a constant battle.
Considerably smaller than off-Broadway nonprofit theaters like the
Manhattan Theater Club or Playwrights Horizons, some of these small
companies consist of a group of actors, directors and writers, most
of whom also help build sets, clean bathrooms and lick envelopes.
Some companies consist of only an artistic director who handles the
creative side and a managing director who handles the business
side, both of whom may support themselves doing other things.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, these companies own theaters; many have to
constantly search for spaces to house their productions. Most do
three or four plays a year with runs of a few weeks. Tickets are
usually under $20.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Resident Theaters/N.Y., a service group for the
city's nonprofit theaters, is planning a workshop called ``Managing
Success'' about how to get the most buck for your bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these companies are still in the mom-and-pop stage,''
said Virginia Louloudes, the alliance's executive director.
``Sometimes they still have day jobs, so they don't have the time
to focus on institutional growth.'' With a hit, Ms. Louloudes said,
a small company has ``tremendous opportunities, but they don't have
the wherewithal to see beyond filling the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The aura of success can also be misleading, theater executives
say, creating the false impression that companies are far better
off financially than they are. Claudia Catania, executive director
of the seven-year-old New Group, which pays its actors $300 a week,
encountered this problem after the success of its play ``Ecstasy''
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception was we were more stable than we actually
were,'' Ms. Catania said. ``To get up `This Is Our Youth,' we had
to beg, steal and borrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This misinterpretation can affect day-to-day business, causing
suppliers and agents who would typically offer small theaters a
break to tighten up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assume you must be swimming in dollars,'' Dobrish of
Adobe said. ``If they think you had this big hit, they think you
can afford to pay full price.''
</P>
<P>
   Adobe, founded in 1991 by Dobrish and five friends from Wesleyan
University, has an annual budget of about $100,000 for all its
costs, including actors' salaries, sets, promotional brochures and
lighting equipment. The company cannot afford any full-time
administrative staff; Dobrish volunteers his services and lives on
savings and income from occasional directing and writing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Although MCC has been packing them in for ``Wit'' at its 99-seat
theater in a former elementary school cafeteria, the company, which
was founded in 1985, has yet to make any money on the production.
LuPone and Telsey, the executive directors, work free; Telsey makes
his living as a casting director, LuPone as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   And while financially welcome, a commercial transfer can also be
disruptive for small companies, distracting from their long-term
efforts to develop new work and to focus on pushing the envelope
rather than pleasing large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once money starts to enter into the equation, the atmosphere
changes,'' Ms. Catania said. ``What's important is that your
decisions aren't informed by commercial concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who run these companies insist that, while they enjoy
the fame, the work ultimately remains about the work, not about
trying to duplicate their good fortune. Moreover, company directors
say, it is impossible to predict which shows will take off and
which will not, and trying to do so is a futile exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to let that commercial transfer be the
thing you aspire to or require,'' said Douglas Aibel, artistic
director of the Vineyard Theater on East 15th Street. ``The minute
you try to second-guess what's going to be commercial, you're going
to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between commercial producers and their alternative
counterparts have historically been dominated by a mutual
suspicion: big, bad Broadway versus the little, dark nonprofits.
Though some of this perception persists, executives at small
companies say their success has fostered the beginnings of teamwork
between the two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, there is a recognition that they can help each
other, as Broadway looks downtown for promising new work and
nonprofits look uptown for financial support in extending their
plays for longer runs at larger theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger Endemol Productions, the Broadway company whose current
ventures include ``Titanic'' and ``Footloose,'' backed Adobe's
``Duet!'' when it was remounted this fall, having originated at the
Ohio Theater in Soho last season.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Dobrish said, he and his colleagues were now
invited to Dodger meetings, to benefit from the producers'
marketing expertise and to move forward with the possibility of
collaborating again in the future. ``They said, `We love what you
do; just keep doing it; we'll support you,''' Dobrish said. ``I
can't tell you how meaningful that is.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, artistic directors say Broadway remains
risk-averse, with producers wary of picking up plays that will be
difficult to market to a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although the Atlantic eventually teamed up with
several commercial producers to move ``Beauty Queen'' to Broadway _
having first produced this Druid Theater Company drama at its
theater on 20th Street _ the play was initially a tough sell. Pepe
said he approached several producers, all of whom said it was ``too
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the play won four Tony Awards, brought the Atlantic
to the attention of Robert De Niro's Tribeca Films _ which signed a
development deal with the company _ and created the Atlantic's
relationship with Jujamcyn, which owns the Walter Kerr Theater,
where ``Beauty Queen'' is playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit,'' however, was rejected by Broadway producers and wound
up moving to a larger off-Broadway house despite universally
impressive reviews that made it seem a sure bet for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we stopping so soon after `Beauty Queen'?'' asked
LuPone of MCC. ``Why are we giving up already?''
</P>
<P>
   Although critics and audiences have agreed that ``Wit''
transcends its grim subject matter, Broadway was apparently not
prepared to test it on a larger scale. Martin Markinson, the owner
of the Helen Hayes Theater, turned it down in favor of ``Band in
Berlin,'' a new musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you move a show up to Broadway, you're not only relying
on the people of the city and the surrounding communities, but
you're relying a great deal on tourists,'' Markinson said. ``And
although I thought `Wit' was a wonderful show and a very
well-written good piece, the subject matter in my view is not
something that is going to have legs. A great many people would
have an aversion to a play about death and dying.''
</P>
<P>
   As affirming as it may be to move a show to a commercial run,
off-off-Broadway executives say such transfers can occasion a
feeling of loss as well as gain, the sense of giving up something
that was once distinctly their own.
</P>
<P>
   The 29th Street Rep, founded in 1988, is credited in the program
of ``Killer Joe,'' for example, and gets a percentage of the
profits, but no one in the eight-member company is part of the
current production at the Soho Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   David Mogentale, the Rep's co-artistic director, brought the
play to New York from Chicago and produced it first at the
company's 60-seat theater on 29th Street, where he played Killer
Joe. But he said he was not consulted for the current production,
which is led by two well-known actors, Amanda Plummer and Scott
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard thing for me is, this play would never have gotten
done in New York if it weren't for me,'' said Mogentale, 38. ``I
don't want to say I'm bitter, but it's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mogentale, who supports himself by working as a waiter at Barney
Greengrass, the bagels and sturgeon restaurant on the Upper West
Side, said his company's production was bleaker and more daring
than the current show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had blood packs flying everywhere,'' he said. ``It was
like, you're locked in a room and you can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the work of mounting these plays with so few
resources remains so arduous, some wonder how much longer
off-off-Broadway's fragile institutions will be able to weather the
inevitable cycles of feast and famine, being anointed and being
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot about who's going to come after us, who's the
model after us,'' Dobrish said. ``It's so hard to raise the money
and you need a tenacity that's unreasonable to expect to keep going
and not say, `I'm tired of cleaning the toilets, tired of not
getting paid, tired of putting on plays and not having people
come.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, LuPone of MCC said, companies buoyed by critical
praise and its accompanying perks have to force themselves to
almost pretend it isn't happening because, soon enough, it won't be
happening anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater in this town is sort of a divine madness,'' LuPone
said. ``And right now, we're in the divine. But you always have to
remember that right around the corner is the madness.''

`MONSTERS OF GRACE': SHOCK OF THE SURREAL IN AN EERIE DIGITAL
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ineffable slow motion with which events unfold in
``Monsters of Grace,'' the ``digital opera in three dimensions''
that opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday night,
would be enough to explain why the piece has taken eight months to
get here since its opening in Los Angeles: 10 miles a day is about
the speed of the thing.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the project, the latest collaboration between
Robert Wilson and Philip Glass, creators of ``Einstein on the
Beach,'' is also being realized at this snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, only seven of the 13 images in Wilson's scenario
could be shown, as intended, by means of computer-animated film
(the rest were staged). Now all 13 are up and running, though some
of them still look decidedly sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   Two simply present gliding rods of white or black in severe
geometry on a background of Wilson blue. Other sequences,
especially one that shows several objects on a tray, are merely
essays in technique.
</P>
<P>
   Still others descend oddly and abruptly from the silent sublime
that is Wilson's forte. A dragonfly skims out from a riverbank and
stays for a moment just over the heads of people three or four rows
ahead. And this same scene ends with a sea monster that is about to
devour a floating house and its nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   More general problems include the uncomfortableness of the
cardboard 3-D viewer for those who already wear glasses and the
fact that you have to keep your head at the correct angle to get
the effect.
</P>
<P>
   The best individual sections come earlier. What is perhaps the
most effective of all shows a suburban corner at dusk, and later a
boy slowly cycling toward the audience.
</P>
<P>
   There is a real sense here of a three-dimensional world seen
through a window just behind the musicians, members of the Philip
Glass Ensemble _ an eerie digital world of homogenized shapes and
textures. As the scene proceeds, lights come on in the houses, but
the climax, if that is not too intense a word, comes when the boy
loses a boot and reaches out a hand to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot of hands reach out in this piece. An arm plunges
into the ocean. Fingers approach the fur of what looks at first
like a microphone and then like a cat. In another scene, the
process is reversed and a severed hand is reached _ stuck with pins
and subsequently, in a reference to the eyelid moment in ``Un Chien
Andalou,'' lanced with a scalpel. Touch would seem to be the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the sense of touch is vital in the verse by the
13th-century Persian poet Jelaluddin Rumi (translated by Coleman
Barks) that Glass sets in his music. ``If you want to hold the
beautiful one, hold yourself to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensuality is the touchstone of the spiritual life. But if
Wilson sometimes caresses the eyes, Glass rarely shows such
tenderness for the ears. After the overture, he has a striking
gesture of bellowing from two bass flutes in their bottom register,
a gesture that returns once again.
</P>
<P>
   Another beautiful sound suggests an Islamic bowed instrument
with sympathetic strings being sampled or imitated, though this
section soon lapses musically into travel-feature banality. And
this is the only section in the score that directly responds to the
culture from which the words come.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Glass works with his usual means: repetitions worked
on arpeggios and scales, undifferentiated amplified timbres and
backing-singer vocal style. This is not _ so far, at least _ his
most inventive score.
</P>
<P>
   As always, though, his music fits excellently with Wilson's
contribution. Just as the film, at its best, suggests a nicely
sinister children's picture book, so the score seems to be taking
its own scalpel to nursery rhymes and game songs.
</P>
<P>
   The performers are a vocal quartet (Marie Mascari, Alexandra
Montano, Gregory Purnhagen and Peter Stewart) with a small ensemble
of woodwind and keyboard players, which includes the composer and
which Michael Riesman directs.

AT HOME WITH THE MARQUIS DE SADE: AND HAVE YOU ANY HOBBIES,
MARQUIS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing to remember about the Marquis de Sade is that he
did not write bawdy Rabelaisian literature or tingling Anais Nin
erotica or even raw storefront pornography. His long novels are
about the sodomistic deflowering of pubescent girls and boys, about
dismemberment, coprophilia, incest, ritual murder, torture and
other cruel supposed pleasures. Because of his exploration of these
fantasies, Sade has in recent decades come to be regarded by some
scholars and critics as a great philosopher and a martyr to freedom
of conscience, a view treated skeptically by Laurence Bongie in
``Sade: A Biographical Essay.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the natural questions are: Was Sade in fact a great
figure in Western thought? Was he a martyr? And what kind of person
was he, to have produced his extraordinary contribution to our
cultural lexicon?
</P>
<P>
   Bongie, who makes no secret of his disdain for Sade (he calls
him one of ``the most obnoxiously adolescent, opportunistic,
tantrum-prone, egotistical, self-absorbed, puffed-up hollow men of
his age''), has written an investigation focusing on one aspect of
Sade's character and development, his heretofore neglected
relationship with his aristocratic mother. In Bongie's view, Sade,
``fiercely proud, willful and rebellious from the beginning,'' was
very much his equally willful mother's son. His guiding principle
was the same as that of his fictional character Valcour, ``that the
entire universe should gratify my every whim.''
</P>
<P>
   nother new book, ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade'' by
Francine du Plessix Gray, looks at his life far more broadly. Ms.
Gray is more genially disposed toward her subject than Bongie,
seeing in him the qualities of bravery, charm and even a brutal
sort of sincerity. But she is by no means enamored of Sade or
unaware of his gigantic egotism, and she shows an acute critical
intelligence throughout. Her account of the marquis' life and times
is vivid, stylistically fluid, discriminating and historically
informed. It will help readers to form their own judgments of this
troubling and complex figure.
</P>
<P>
   While Bongie's focus is on Sade's mother, Ms. Gray's book is in
large part the story of Sade's relationship with two other women:
his devoted wife, Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil, and her mother, the
``iron lady,'' Marie-Madeleine de Montreuil. It would be hard to
imagine wife and mother-in-law being more different.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the sedate, self-effacing Marquise de Sade steps out
from a Millet painting, robed in sober hues of dun and earth,'' Ms.
Gray says, ``her mother waltzes out of a Greuze portrait, a
flirtatious virago adorned in rose and pale violet, as sprightly of
wit and polished in her conversation as she was cunning in her
tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sade married Renee-Pelagie, the daughter of a wealthy bourgeois,
in 1763 when he was 23. Very quickly he resumed the life of what
was called ``libertinage,'' pursuing sexual liaisons with many
mistresses (one of whom was Renee-Pelagie's pretty younger sister)
and, more to the Sadean point, raiding lower-class neighborhoods
for men and women to be used in his kinky orgies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray makes it clear that some of this behavior was fairly
standard for the decadent French aristocracy of the time, which is
why the word libertinage was in common use. But while Sade
certainly preyed on his sexual targets and became notorious for
doing so, he did not engage in the bestiality or the weird violence
that is at the sadistic heart of his books. Sade, in fact, was
acquitted of the charges of sodomy and poisoning brought against
him after an infamous orgy in Marseilles. But he was imprisoned
when his formerly indulgent mother-in-law turned against him and
used her considerable power and influence at court to have Sade
imprisoned by order of Louis XV himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where mother and daughter parted company. For Sade's
entire 13 years in Charenton and the Bastille, Renee-Pelagie stayed
loyal and devoted. (It is possible that she had been a participant
in the orgies he conducted at his chateau in Provence.)
Paradoxically and interestingly, Renee-Pelagie only turned against
her husband when, in the wake of the Revolution of 1789, Sade was
released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot decode her through traditional concepts of wifely
love,'' Ms. Gray writes. ``Her obsession for her husband was
analogous to the most perfect monastic dedication, to that total
surrender of self achieved only by the most perfect nuns.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Ms. Gray subjects Sade's writings to a
sympathetic critical examination, parsing their various themes,
including, as she puts it, his ``abhorrence of the maternal
principle,'' as well as his early evocation of the unconscious, the
impulse toward destruction of man in a kind of extreme Hobbesean
state of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the terrifying orgies of his fictions he gave free rein to
those darker inclinations,'' she writes, ``to the impulses that can
compel us to regress, if only in our fantasies, to an archaic,
animal-like stage, liberated from even the most fundamental taboos
_ incest, cannibalism _ imposed by civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, including the role of Sade's mother in his early
experience, Ms. Gray and Bongie disagree. Most important, Bongie
denies any moral separation between Sade's fictional fantasies and
his real life. The ``absence of boundaries, impediments and limits
of any kind becomes in fact the defining attribute of the Sadean
novel whose monster characters ... can DO everything to their
victims that can be CONCEIVED,'' he writes, and thus do not
``exemplify art separated from life.''
</P>
<P>
   An old debate on Sade is joined once again with, in my view, Ms.
Gray's less judgmental vision carrying the day. If you can only
take on one book about Sade, your choice would probably be with her
more general treatment. But Sade is so interesting and so
ultimately mysterious, and he raises such fundamental questions
about literary morality that you might then want to read more, in
which case Bongie's more specialized, dissenting study would be a
profitable selection.

`RUSHMORE': SKEWED SCHOOL DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (``Rushmore'' was shown as part of this year's New York Film
Festival. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which
appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 9. The film opens Friday in
New York and Los Angeles for one week of screenings, to qualify for
consideration in the Oscar nominations. A wider release is
scheduled for February.)
</P>
<P>
   This portrait of the mogul as a young man arrives courtesy of
Wes Anderson, whose bright, spiky ``Rushmore'' has the brainstorm
of envisioning a 15-year-old tycoon-wannabe as a schoolboy. At
Rushmore Academy, in scenes filmed at the director's own Texas alma
mater, horrid little Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) calls the
shots. Oh, sure, the place has faculty, but none of the grown-ups
have anything like Max's natural authority. Maybe one man on the
scene, the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor played with all the
right wiles by Bill Murray, is right on the same wavelength with
Max.
</P>
<P>
   While the film embroils Max and the mogul in pursuit of the same
beautiful teacher (Olivia Williams), it's a particular treat for
its skewed, hilarious memories of a cutthroat boyhood. Spectacled
Max, who's as much of a sight gag for the wide-angle lens as he is
a flesh-and-blood character, starts off on top of the Rushmore
world and experiences a wonderfully welcome comeuppance. He's meant
to be mellowing along the way, but ``Rushmore'' wouldn't dare turn
sentimental about that. As directed by Anderson and written by him
with Owen Wilson (his partner on ``Bottle Rocket,'' which
``Rushmore'' far surpasses), it's too smart to be maudlin. Far
better to show off Max's Vietnam play, with real explosives
(earplugs and safety glasses available) or let him boast derangedly
(in one especially funny dinner scene) about having a hit to his
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' also includes a sweet turn by Seymour Cassel as
Max's father and a sputteringly indignant one from Brian Cox as the
headmaster. Of the many who auditioned for Max's role, some actors
spontaneously showed up in preppy-looking blazers. But Schwartzman
earned the part by, among other things, being the only one who made
a fake Rushmore patch. And since Ms. Williams' only other
theatrical film credit is appearing opposite Kevin Costner in ``The
Postman,'' this amounts to her feature debut.

   COW ORGANS? YOUNG ART SELLS
</P>
<P>
   A naked polyester baby boy, a polished steel gun, a man's suit
shot through with holes and four cabinets containing assorted jars
of cow's organs were among the 130 works by 97 contemporary artists
that were sold by Christie's in London on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just any auction of contemporary art. It represented
about 5 percent of Charles Saatchi's famed collection. Saatchi, the
advertising magnate who is one of London's biggest contemporary art
collectors, has been able to use his promotional skills to market
and sell his art over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was for a good cause. Its proceeds will be used, in
part, to set up a scholarship program to help pay for students'
projects and commissions at four London art schools: Chelsea,
Goldsmiths', the Royal College and the Slade. The money will also
help pay for the projects of young British artists who have
finished college. The benefits will not all flow in one direction.
Some of these artists will also show their work at Saatchi's
gallery on Boundary Road in the St. John's Wood section of London,
and he may in turn buy their work.
</P>
<P>
   The sale took place in an abandoned warehouse in London's
financial district, a space that could better accommodate the large
scale of some of the pieces than could Christie's more intimate
salesrooms at its King Street headquarters. The auction's sales
totaled $2.6 million, $1 million more than Christie's estimate,
proving that the market for young art is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sale's art was by leading ``YBAs,'' or Young British
Artists, like Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread and Jenny Saville.
Also on the block were works by contemporary American artists like
Cindy Sherman, Charles Long, Jessica Stockholder and Kiki Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Saatchi has helped create a booming market for
many of the artists he buys, in part by showing them at his
13-year-old gallery. But last year he received worldwide attention
when he lent 120 works, all by young British artists, for
``Sensation,'' a show at the Royal Academy in London that attracted
record-breaking crowds. It has since traveled to Berlin and is at
the Hamburger Bahnhof through Jan. 17. (Experts in the museum world
say the Brooklyn Museum of Art will mount the show some time next
year, although officials there said it was too early to confirm
that.)
</P>
<P>
   But even as Saatchi has been credited with boosting sales of
contemporary artists, he has occasionally sold some artists' works
in bulk, causing their prices and desirability to plummet. As a
result, before Tuesday's sale many experts said Saatchi was taking
a big gamble.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the gamble paid off. Prices for many artists reached more
than twice the pre-sale estimates. Some of the high prices were for
works by artists who had never been at auction before. Among the
top sellers was ``Grosse Geister,'' a group of three
larger-than-life robotlike aluminum figures from 1996 by the
cerebral German sculptor Thomas Schutte, which sold to an
unidentified London dealer for $245,000, above its $200,000 high
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Past and present winners of the coveted Turner Prize, an award
given annually by the Tate Gallery in London to a contemporary
British artist, performed well. Hirst, the 1995 winner, broke a
record for his pharmaceutical paintings when ``Acetic Anhydride,''
a 1991 example, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for
$202,125, more than five times its $42,000 high estimate. Hirst's
``Lovers (Spontaneous, Committed, Detached, Compromising),'' a
series of four cabinets containing jars of cow's organs, sold to
another unidentified telephone bidder for $229,350, way above its
$170,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whiteread, who won the Turner Prize in 1993 and has received
much attention in New York for the translucent resin water tower
that was installed on a SoHo rooftop this summer, scored a record
price for her work, too. Her ``Untitled (Square Sink),'' a 1990
negative plaster cast of a sink, sold for $220,275, nearly three
times its $84,000 high estimate. A record price for work by Chris
Ofili, this year's Turner Prize winner, was set when his ``Them
Bones,'' a 1995 painting of a skeleton holding in each hand balls
of the artist's signature elephant dung, brought $36,052, more than
twice its $17,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly 4,000 people visited the viewing,'' said Graham
Southern, who heads Christie's contemporary art department in
London. ``And about 50 percent of the people had never been to an
auction before.'' Christie's said 74.8 percent of the buyers were
European and of those, 39.1 percent were British. Americans
represented 24.6 percent of the buying pool and Asians 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly `Sensation' helped,'' Southern said, adding that
excitement over the construction of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art,
scheduled to open in 2000, also motivated buyers. ``It's now
obvious to the public that these artists are making a place in
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A $3.6 MILLION RICHTER
</P>
<P>
   If few buyers at the Saatchi sale were identified, one of the
most conspicuous consumers at another major auction in London this
week was the Pritzker family, who bought Gerhard Richter's
``Cathedral Square, Milan'' (1968) at Sotheby's sale of
contemporary art on Wednesday. It is the largest of his photo
paintings from the '60s _ 9 feet by 9{ feet _ and shows the Piazza
del Duomo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pritzkers paid $3.6 million, nearly twice the works' $1.98
million high estimate. The family plans to put it in the lobby of
their Park Hyatt Hotel, which is being built on Michigan Avenue in
Chicago. But until the hotel is completed, a Sotheby's official
said, the family will lend the painting to the Art Institute of
Chicago, which has the largest collection of Richters in America.
</P>
<P>
   A CURATOR FOR THE GETTY
</P>
<P>
   After a six-month search the J. Paul Getty Museum announced that
Scott Schaefer, an expert in Sotheby's Old Master department, will
be the museum's new curator of paintings. He succeeds David Jaffe,
who resigned in September to become senior curator at the National
Gallery in London. Schaefer begins his new job early next year.

BUSINESS IS ALL UP AND DOWN FOR THIS ENTREPRENEUR

 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fifth-graders and men in hard hats get weak in
the knees and queasy in the stomach when they see him.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Phelan is like a rock star. He's been featured on
television. Adoring fans ask for his signature, and he doesn't even
play the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   He's a steeplejack, the guy paid about $80 per hour to climb and
paint the tallest flagpole outside the San Francisco City Hall this
week, a job he says is just another day at the office. Except his
office is usually about six stories above the pavement, swaying in
the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare occupation, although not in this family. Phelan's
grandfather was a steeplejack in Ireland before coming to America.
His dad followed in his father's footsteps. Now Phelan's doing it
here. And so is his sister and her son.
</P>
<P>
   Are they crazy?
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't pay me enough to scale that thing,'' said John
Kyrk, 60, as he took a picture of Phelan lashed to the top of the
City Hall pole. ``There's only one way down from there, and it's
right beneath you.''
</P>
<P>
   Before painting the 90-foot pole this week, Phelan replaced the
head-sized gold ball at the peak as construction workers, city
officials and children pointed up and smiled, oftentimes with a
starry-eyed gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Children fearlessly swinging across monkey bars and diving
head-first down slides at a nearby playground had the most
incredulous looks on their faces as they watched Phelan sway and
twist in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least when you're flying, you can't see that far down,''
said Webb Allen, 10, a rambunctious daredevil who knows of one
profession in which he doesn't want to climb to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan, 46, said there's nothing to fear as a steeplejack,
except perhaps a pigeon perched above you. He would think that. His
family has climbed to the top of steeples for nearly 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job I was born and raised into,'' he said. ``It's in
the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan's wife has a baby due in July, and though he promises not
to pressure his child to follow the family business, he said, ``I'm
sure their life will include climbing of some sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelan started scaling trees when he was yea-high, he said,
leveling his hand at his hip. His parents weren't worried. By the
time he was 13, Phelan was climbing with his father into the lights
at Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a kid, climbing on top of things is something you
do,'' he said. ``My family's just made a living out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 30 years of roping and rappelling, Phelan has been
on top of many of San Francisco's highest highs. What he can't
carry up on his utility belt, he has a helicopter lower to him.
</P>
<P>
   Not much shakes him, but he still gets a mild case of stage
fright when performing in front of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get really worried when lots of people gather below me,''
Phelan said. ``I'm afraid something might fall and kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a high-wire performer, he knows safety always comes first.
And so, as Phelan pivots around the pole, painting from top to
bottom, on the street below people gawk and inevitably ask the
million-dollar question:
</P>
<P>
   ``How's the weather up there?''

 &HT;    SECURITY FOR CLINTON VISIT TAKES DAILY ISRAELI PRECAUTIONS TO
NEW HEIGHTS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-CLINTON and MIDEAST-SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM This is the land of high security, but it may never
have been as tight or complex as when President Clinton visits here
beginning Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Even on normal days, police stop drivers in the road to ask for
identification and search the trunks of cars entering shopping
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers and settlers routinely walk in restaurants or
stores with M-16s strapped across their backs or revolvers tucked
in their belts. Bomb squad vans constantly patrol the streets,
checking hundreds of suspicious packages each day during times of
suspected terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   But never before, according to Israeli police spokeswoman Linda
Menuchin, has there been such a complicated assignment for the
protection of a visiting dignitary.
</P>
<P>
   At times during the three-day visit, as many as 4,450 extra
Israeli police will be assigned to provide security for Clinton _
nearly 20 percent of the police in this small country. There will
be 500 police officers patrolling the area around Clinton's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   This does not include Israeli secret service and army units that
will handle parts of the trip, or the thousands of Palestinian
police on duty when Clinton visits areas they control.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton is coming with what former Israeli secret service
chief Carmi Gillon estimates may be 400 security personnel. If
Clinton's visit is like most other presidential foreign trips, his
security forces will have been in place for weeks examining travel
routes, ``sweeping'' hotel rooms for electronic listening devices,
positioning video cameras to monitor hallways and planting
high-tech equipment around buildings to detect unauthorized
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Menuchin pointed out, is that at times Clinton
will be at one site, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will be at
another, daughter Chelsea Clinton will be elsewhere and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright will be in yet another location. All
will need protection. Sixteen members of Congress also will be here
and they will require security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see efforts of the kind we haven't seen before,'' said
Gillon. ``The issues are much more sharp now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For every terror group, to act against the United States with
all this media around, it is their dream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues revolve around the Israeli-Palestinian agreement
negotiated in October at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. It's
intent was to keep the five-year-old Middle East peace process on
track, but extremists on both sides are dissatisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the thousands of police will be near Clinton. Many will
have their hands full trying to patrol areas of East Jerusalem
where Palestinians have been engaged in fierce battles with Israeli
troops in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, police expect right wing Jewish groups to stage
protests. On Thursday, they posted illustrations around Jerusalem
showing Clinton in an Arab head cloth with the caption,
``Palestinian, go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian terrorists have frequently launched attacks in the
days before official U.S. visits. In recent interviews, spokesmen
for Hamas, the militant wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, have appeared to try to downplay any threat to
Clinton himself, saying they have never targeted Americans.
</P>
<P>
   However, they said that their organization has small splinter
groups that could act on their own _ statements that maintain the
uncertainty that feeds their image.
</P>
<P>
   In order to help control the environment in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza City, schools and offices will be
closed when Clinton visits on Monday. He will be the first American
president to visit a Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police plan to close major roads used by Clinton for
several hours at a time and will tow away cars parked along the
route, presumably out of fear that they might be rigged with
remotely-triggered bombs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several days, U.S. security specialists have been
working on phone and radio systems to be used during Clinton's
visit. U.S. military helicopters, including one appearing to be
Clinton's white-topped official chopper, have conducted days of
</P>
<P>
   maneuvers above Jerusalem, Gaza and Bethlehem, the birthplace of
Jesus where Clinton also will visit.

HOW CHESTNUTS FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS _ AND RETURNED

<P>
   The chestnut is back.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the mighty chestnut was, if not the backbone, at
least one of the vertebrae of American food, both native and
Europeanized.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans used the whole nuts as vegetables and also
ground them to make flour for bread. The Europeans who arrived
later cooked with the nuts in the same manner and also introduced a
sweetened paste version in desserts. In eastern America, the nuts
were harvested and used as a cash crop, shipped off to cities such
as New York, Boston and Philadelphia, where they were roasted, sold
by vendors and eaten right out of the shell.
</P>
<P>
   The trees, called ghost redwoods, were mammoth, averaging 5 feet
in diameter and up to 100 feet tall. But mighty as they were, the
trees _ along with the nuts that fed man and forest wildlife _
began to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, the chestnut blight first appeared at the Bronx Zoo.
Imported Chinese chestnut trees carried a virulent bark fungus that
killed virtually all the native American chestnut trees. By 1950,
few remained.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in your very own supermarket, there the nuts are, in
among the pecans, the almonds and the cashews. Retailing for about
$4 a pound, chestnuts are starting to crack their way back into
American traditions. Most of the chestnuts we see in the
supermarkets are imported, but American growers are doing their
part to bring back the ``king of trees.'' The American Chestnut
Foundation is one operation promoting the planting of new
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   If chestnuts are new to you, here's what to look for. Shells
should have a little ``give.'' If the shell is firm, the chestnuts
may need to ripen longer.
</P>
<P>
   Store the nuts in the refrigerator or freezer. When they are
ready to cook, wipe off any dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts must be scored before cooking. To do this, make an
``X'' with a sharp knife on the flat side of the nut. (If you don't
do this, the nuts will explode when heated.)
</P>
<P>
   In the oven: Lay nuts in one layer in ovenproof dish. Bake at
325 degrees for about 20 minutes. Peel when cool to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   In the fireplace: Use a long-handled pan for roasting chestnuts,
or use a fireplace popcorn basket. Don't overcrowd pan. Shake the
pan as you would popcorn, and hold pan just above flame, not in it.
Nuts should be done in about 15 minutes, or when the outside shell
is black. Remove nuts from pan and peel as soon as they are cool to
the touch.
</P>
<P>
   On the stove top: Place nuts in one loose layer in a heavy pan _
cast-iron is best. Cook over medium heat while shaking the pan.
Cook until you can smell the nuts.

   The equipment
</P>
<P>
   You don't need special equipment to roast chestnuts, but it
certainly brings a little extra glamour to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Sur La Table, a mail-order operation based in Seattle, has just
opened a store in Dallas. The store stocks chestnut roasting pans
(a metal skillet with holes in the bottom called a ``rotisseur
marron'' by the French) that sell for $9.95. Pick one up at 4527
Travis St., Suite A, in the Knox-Henderson retail district, (214)
219-4404, or order by calling (800) 243-0852.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma also carries a chestnut cooker in its catalog.
The lidded stoneware roaster is meant for the oven and is packaged
with 2 pounds of chestnuts for $44. The roaster, sans nuts, is
$24.50. The company also sells a hooked knife for scoring the tough
nuts; it's $5. Call (800) 541-2233.

   ``I keep all my little horrors in this suitcase,'' Sandra
Manning says in the dim light of her living room.

   The American Tourister _ bright red and solid _ keeps everything
locked up tight. She flips it open, reaches in.

   ``Here,'' she says, matter-of-factly, fingering a faded
Polaroid, ``is the monster.''

   He is a handsome man, with mahogany skin and a big white smile,

regular guy's booking mug. No big white smile, just two glassy eyes
confronting the police camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's more. Tucked beneath the mug shot are the police
reports, which detail exactly what he did to her, on the winter
afternoon she almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the police reports are the court papers, which assign
Sandy Manning's monster to a brief prison term _ over, it seemed to
her, before the ink dried on the tabloid stories.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a picture of Sandy, in her hospital bed, oxygen
tubes curling up to her nose, a blue pillow resting lightly across
her chest, covering the bandages that bind the holes her husband
made when he stabbed her over and over in the marsh beyond the
railroad tracks way out on the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The stab wounds healed.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``My children, my babies, they're everything to me. They have
been through so many traumas in their short lives. One day life was
one way, and then it was just total upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsey, 9, the oldest, she saw the most violence, so she
carries the most pain. She still dreams her father's going to stab
me, shoot me. I was in the tub one night and she came in, sat down
on the toilet seat, said, `Mommy, what will we do if Daddy Mike
kills you?' And I told her, `Only thing we can do is pray, baby,'
so that's what we did, right there on the bathroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mikey's 7, looks just like his daddy. When he started
kindergarten, he was real moody. Lately, he's been worse. One night
we were lying on the couch and he kept holding his breath, putting
the covers over his head, saying he didn't want to live in this
world, that it was too painful. Mikey's counselor thinks the night
terrors are tied in with the fear he's going to grow up like his
father. Mikey has told him, why does he have to have the same name
as the murderer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtney's the youngest, 6. She's very withdrawn. Courtney
will not talk to you. I mean, she will not talk to you. She was not
even a year old when all this happened, but I feel like the
after-effects have gotten to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids, they're angry because they don't have normalcy like
other kids do, not by a long shot. And they worry just as much as I
do that he's going to come back. One time Lindsey thought she saw
him at the Texaco and she ran home screaming, `Mommy! Mommy! I
think I saw Daddy Mike!' She just freaked out. I know just how she
feels because sometimes I think I see him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple way to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in the shorthand people use when they have talked
about something too many times, Sandy will say, in a single breath,
to dispense with it: ``My husband kidnapped me and stabbed me and
tortured me and I almost died and God knows why I didn't.'' And
unless you already know the story _ perhaps you opened the morning
paper six years ago and saw the headline, or watched the TV news
accounts _ you think surely she must be exaggerating. Because who
on Earth could survive all that?
</P>
<P>
   Other times, if she's in an upbeat mood and doesn't want to
bring herself down, Sandy will refer to ``The Incident,'' pause a
bit for emphasis, and let it go at that. Only the very curious will
inquire further.
</P>
<P>
   To really understand what happened to Sandy Manning you would
have to know 100 little things:
</P>
<P>
   That one morning after a weekend of domestic abuse, she finally
got up her nerve to flee _ straight down Interstate 95 in her pink
nightgown with nothing but her three groggy children and the
promise of shelter in a safe house.
</P>
<P>
   That a few weeks later, while living an underground life, she
went to court in the morning to renew a restraining order against
her husband, and that very afternoon he forced her into his car at
knifepoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the restraining order was on the front seat of the old
green Chrysler when he held the butcher knife to her throat and
ordered her to drive, north and west through Palm Beach County,
toward nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   That when they crossed the long, high bridge on the Beeline
where she could see the tree tops blowing in the wind like unruly
mops of hair, she thought about jumping out, but he said drive
faster, Bitch _ and she fought back tears as her chance disappeared
in the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually he parked on a lonely stretch of road and
dragged her across the railroad tracks, and it was here that he
stabbed her and held her face down in the brackish water and she
said the Lord is my shepherd until her mind went numb.
</P>
<P>
   That after he stabbed her, she pulled the knife from the spot
near her heart and nearly sliced her fingers off, and still today
she can't use her right hand to pick up a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   That afterward he dragged her back to the car, where he drank
Pepsi, and smoked Marlboro reds.
</P>
<P>
   That he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That he beat her with a tire iron, picked her up and kissed her
on the forehead. ``I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That when the cops came, he blamed the crime on two masked men.
</P>
<P>
   That throughout all of this _ for 17 ungodly hours _ Sandy
Manning felt herself slipping away. But then her three children
would visit some small, still-alive place in the back of her mind,
and she would tell herself, again and again, taking up a mantra,
``Sandy, don't you dare die. Sandy don't you dare die.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you knew 100 little things, you still would not know
the whole story, or even the most important part. Because after The
Incident there was an investigation, and after the investigation
there was a plea bargain, and after the plea bargain there was a
brief prison sentence, and after the prison sentence Mike Jones
went free, but the woman who had been his wife did not.
</P>
<P>
   After The Incident, Sandy Manning wasn't Sandy Manning anymore,
she was somebody else. Somebody who heard the monster's voice in
her head. Somebody who hid in the bathtub every time a floorboard
creaked. Somebody who three years later still could not chop fresh
vegetables for her children's dinner, because chopping fresh
vegetables means picking up a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've seen Sandy Manning. She is the woman staring
blankly at the cereal boxes in the grocery store; the incapacitated
soul in the welfare office trying to string together enough
benefits to keep the lights on in her small, dim apartment; the
weekly regular at group therapy, looking for magic answers when of
course there are none.
</P>
<P>
   She is the woman who drops out of the work force so he can't
find her, then fights her way back. The woman who swallows too many
pills and has her stomach pumped, and who in despair practices
holding a revolver to her temple. The woman who wants to clear out
of town because she's terrified _ and who wants to stay put because
she has a right to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking over my shoulder forever,'' Sandy Manning
says. ``Because that day he hurt me, he killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Italic)Dec. 10, 1992. Sandy stops at her mom's house to
pick up some clothes, and there he is. He's hiding it, but he's
angry. Angry she left him, angry she took the kids and went to the
safe house. Red hot angry. They talk for a moment, and then she
gets into the car, ready to go, and suddenly he is in the seat
behind her, the knife a cold, sharp warning against her throat.
Drive, he says. Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hours pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's mom, Sharon, and sister Diane know something is wrong,
so they get in the car and go _ west past the farm fields, past
Mike's old haunts, back and forth on the roads he traveled most,
where he knew the street signs, because although Sandy had tried to
teach him, he still couldn't read too well. Maybe he's holding
Sandy captive till she says she'll come back, they think, maybe
they're just holing up to talk, maybe they're making up. Maybe,
maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   It is 6 a.m. and everybody knows what nobody's saying when
Sandy's mom turns on the news. On the screen, at St. Mary's, a
Trauma Hawk lands, depositing a stretcher, and on the stretcher is
a woman, and before Sandy's mom can process the image, the awful
truth of it, the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, We have your daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She needs surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse says, She says she loves you, and please, please take
care of the kids. (End Italic)
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is 28, pretty, with the strong, broad features of her
Scandinavian ancestors, luminous green eyes and light brown hair
that picks up highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she colors it, and once you get to know her, you
realize the color says something about how she is feeling: Her hair
is a flat, dull brown when she has been depressed; it is a lighter,
brighter shade on the weeks she is successful in keeping
appointments with doctors and social workers; and on really fine
days, after the children bring home good report cards or counseling
has been particularly enlightening, it is a beautiful, soft shade
of strawberry blond.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy has had so many setbacks in life, so many secrets, you
half expect her to pull the curtains and retreat, but withdrawal is
not in her nature. She is at heart an extrovert who relishes her
connections with the world; and despite all that has happened, or
perhaps because of it, she can be uncommonly empathetic and
generous, as if she would like to give to others all the security
and comfort she has been deprived. If, for example, while driving
to the store or the doctor's she happens to intersect with somebody
carrying a white bucket to collect change for a good cause,
especially one for children, she will give the solicitor not a few
quarters but a fistful of dollars _ then thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's dream, before Mike took it, was to win a music
scholarship to college. She still keeps a tattered Polaroid of
herself singing a Gloria Estefan hit at her high school talent
show. The auditorium was so dark that the picture is almost
entirely black, except for Sandy, the star soloist, up on stage,
arms spread wide, incandescent in a white dress in the last sweet
time in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, if you walk past her apartment window, you might hear
her deep, gutsy voice doing justice to a gospel tune, or coaching
Lindsey through a Mariah Carey hit. Her oldest daughter doesn't
always reach the high notes, and sometimes she forgets the words,
but like Sandy, she has a voice full of promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time, baby,'' Sandy will say. ``Be patient and
you'll get it right one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy's sister Betty loves to tell the story of how Sandy won a
big dance contest sponsored by Easter Seals when she was 7. When
Betty mentions this to a reporter, to make sure she understands her
sister had genuine talent _ that she could sing and dance _ Sandy
buries her face in her hands, mortified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Mish,'' Betty says, calling her little sister by her
childhood nickname. ``You have to tell the good things about
yourself, too. You can't just tell the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the good things?'' Sandy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Betty. ``You are a good singer, and a good
person. And you are a very good mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But so much bad has happened to you, I think you forget to
take any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Olson was 15, a lovely high school sophomore who liked to
study, when she met a 19-year-old Job Corps trainee named Mike
Jones. It was Dec. 5, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a date, exactly. Sandy had a friend who was seeing
Mike's cousin, and one night they all went out. Sandy remembers two
things about this meeting. The first is that she was glad her mom
wasn't home, because Michael is black and her mother would never
approve of an interracial relationship. The second is how sorry she
felt for Mike once she got to know him, even just a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat in the back seat and talked and talked. First it was
the easy stuff _ school, my hobbies, my favorite colors. But
Michael came from a family that had experienced extreme poverty and
violence. He told me in such detail about how his dad beat his mom
_ until she literally had to pile the kids on a bus and get out of
town _ that he just had me crying tears. I felt so sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he would call me the next day, and that night I went
home and I was lying in bed
</P>
<P>
   thinking, `I don't want to date this guy.' He had so many
problems, I was praying he wouldn't like me. But the next day the
phone rang, and it was Michael, and I just had this overwhelming
feeling of _ I don't know _ pity.''
</P>
<P>
   It took some doing on Mike's part, but soon after, he and Sandy
were an item. Mike was so attentive. He brought her flowers, movie
tickets, a plastic red rose that lighted up _ even a lobster tail
from Red Lobster, where he had taken a job as a dish washer and
moved up to prep cook. They went to concerts, and, because they
loved coffee and conversation, to the doughnut shop down the street
for the $6.99 steak-and-egg special. The romance was short on
money, but Sandy thought it had a fairy tale quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just the sweetest thing,'' she says. ``Back then.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she got pregnant and things unraveled. Michael and his
mother were thrilled at the news, Sandy recalls, and went out right
away to look for cribs; but her own mother and sister saw things
differently. Mike was too domineering, they said. Sandy, sweet 16,
was too young. So her sister drove her to a clinic, and, sobbing,
Sandy had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at her family's urging, she hopped a plane to her old
hometown in upstate New York, to stay with another sister.
Everybody she knew said better to end things now, make a clean
break, vanish until he forgets you, but Sandy had a terrible
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Once before she had tried to break up with Mike, to concentrate
on her schoolwork, and he had protested by dropping to his knees in
the middle of the street, vowing to kill himself. So what would he
do now that she had had an abortion and cleared out of town?
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, she had her answer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It messed up all his intestines,'' Sandy says. ``And instantly
this became my fault, in Michael's mind, and in mine. I felt so
guilty I took an extreme measure _ I got back together with him,
and I threw away my birth control. I know how crazy this sounds
now, but back then, I didn't care what my family thought; to make
everything right, I was going to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's exactly what I did _ quit school, find a job, get
pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he hit her? My God, Sandy says, you don't forget
something like that. You keep it on instant replay in your head.
</P>
<P>
   She had just returned from the grocery and was running through
their Lake Park townhouse calling Mike's name, so he could help
unload bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him in the upstairs bathroom with a Cool Whip bowl
full of these little white things. He had a can and had scrunched
it down and made it into a pipe. Well, Mike used to smoke reefer,
but this stuff was new to me. So I said, `Is that drugs?' And he
said, `Crack.' He told me to go downstairs and start cooking.
Later, when he still didn't come out, I ran back upstairs and
opened the bathroom door, and I took the bowl and said, `I'm
throwing this in the toilet.' He got mad. Slapped me. Pushed me. I
rolled down the stairs, and then he went back and did his drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always starts, with a first slap or punch, then
another, and another. And so it goes for Sandy, in her 18th year.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, to try to put him in a good mood, or at least a
better one, she tucks a napkin under his neck and serves up bacon,
eggs, grits, pancakes, biscuits, sausage _ then gets the juice
thrown in her face because it isn't chilled. Nights he smashes
dirty plates on the kitchen floor. There are many accusations _
where have you been? Are you cheating on me? No. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't matter. He's hitting her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant with her first child, she runs. Her mom says, ``Baby,
come home,'' and she does. But the monster knows where she is all
the time. He follows her to the store, the bus stop, the doctor's
office. She's so scared she sleeps at the foot of her mother's bed,
with a machete. Her stepdad has an ax.
</P>
<P>
   She asks for help, and the police say get a restraining order,
so they can arrest him when he comes close _ but Mike's a magician,
good at disappearing. Sandy swears to the ominous, off-the-record
remarks of one officer, a woman: ``Honey, if he comes for you, the
only sure thing you can do is shoot him, then drag him in the house
and make it look like a break-in. Because this kind of man, he
doesn't give up until he gets what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he disappears for seven months, only to turn up at her
baby-sitting job. Come back to me, he says, or I'll kill your
family, one by one. Don't hide from me, he says, because I'll find
you. And she believes him, so, yes, she goes back. He lays off, for
a while. Then one day she makes the wrong kind of Kool Aid, and the
next thing she knows she's flying across the dining room with a
bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on like this. Except when she's pregnant with her
younger children. He wants a boy and she's afraid of what he will
do if she says no, so they have Mikey. He forces her to have sex,
and her birth control fails, so they have Courtney. When she's
pregnant, he's Superdad _ and this is deceiving. For a while, she
has hope.
</P>
<P>
   And he finds God. They go to church. Four times a week they're
bowing their heads in the pew, and she's praying, Lord, please make
things different, but afterward, back home, he hits her. Once he
calls her a devil in front of the whole congregation, and she runs
out of church to weep on the front steps. A deacon counsels him,
but it doesn't sink in.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   He hurls a coffee table at her, and the glass shatters in
glittery pools around the children's feet. He speeds down Federal
Highway, calling her names, slams the brakes so hard Lindsey flies
from her safety seat into the dashboard. In the driveway one day,
when she is sick with a kidney infection and confined to a
wheelchair, he tries to run over her with his car.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest baby is on her lap. She thinks, ``This is it.'' She
thinks, ``No more.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, she drops him at his tree-trimming job and
kisses him on the cheek, so he won't suspect. And then she is
flying down I-95, her pink nightgown fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Italic)Dec. 11, 1992. Sandy is covered in blood and mud,
and a tangle of vines from the bog plugs the hole in her chest, and
it is just like this, a creature half alive, that she rises from
the muck at the Tri-Gas plant, on the Beeline Highway near Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The place is so quiet, so damn deserted, a rescue seems
impossible _ but suddenly out of nowhere in the mist of the dawn,
two early shift workers appear at the gate. Mike says, ``Hey,
fellas, call a tow truck, I'm stuck in the mud.'' But they're not
stupid, so they call the sheriff, too.
</P>
<P>
   And Sandy hangs on. Hangs on until the cops come, and the
ambulance, and the Trauma Hawk. Hangs on until the hospital, where
a detective leans low over her stretcher, and _ safe at last, if
you can call it that _ she says in a voice surprisingly strong:
Forget about two masked men. My husband did this. His name is
Michael Anthony Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stab wounds in all, scattered like some sick
connect-the-dots game across her stomach, her chest, her upper
arms, her ears. Her hands are like mincemeat where she grabbed the
butcher knife, and the fingers on her right hand flop around like a
marionette's. The knife pierced her lung and her breath comes in
jagged little spurts.
</P>
<P>
   When Sandy asks the doctor if she will live, he looks a long
time at her, bandaged like a mummy and lost in a jungle of plastic
tubing, and very softly, he says, ``Honey, you should have been
dead 16 hours ago.'' (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 28, 1993, in Courtroom 315 of the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, Mike Jones pleaded guilty to attempted first degree
murder and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The man who did the crime and then confessed to it made a
speech:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been searching myself, wondering why things happened
the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a person of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got plenty of love in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He got eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sandy wondered aloud if that was how long she had to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy:
</P>
<P>
   ``After The Incident, I held up real good. I was in this support
group for battered women, and I told them my whole story. People
thought, `Oh, this girl is wonderful!' I was like a role model for
people who were going to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, Michael plea bargained, and I just lost it. What
happened was, I met with the prosecutor and she handed me the
doctor's reports on Michael, which explained how upset he was about
the abortion and me leaving for the women's shelter and taking the
kids. The gist was that he was insane at the time he did this to
me. So the idea was, we go to trial, he might get off by reason of
insanity, and if we go for the plea, then at least we keep him in
the system for his prison term, and then 15 years' probation. So I
had 24 hours to decide, and I took the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, after Mike went to prison, I just broke down. I
started hearing his voice in my head, and one day I flipped out on
Lindsey. She was yelling at me about something, and I got it in my
head she was her father. I put my hand over her mouth and nose and
I didn't let go. Her eyes started fluttering, and then I came to
and realized this was my daughter I was trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up at St. Mary's. Three weeks of intense therapy. One
hundred different medications. They couldn't tell me if I'd ever be
well, but I took the medicine and I saw a therapist, and I just
kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then one day, at group, this old lady started talking
about how her husband had thrown her against the wall and something
in me just clicked. Because this woman reminded me of my
grandmother, and here somebody was beating the hell out of her, and
I just thought, `God, does it ever end?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, I left the meeting, screaming, and I went to the
water fountain. I had two bottles of pills with me, and I opened
them up and I took them all. I just wanted it to be over, all the
violence. I wanted out. Waking up in the hospital and realizing I
hadn't been successful _ that I hadn't killed myself _ that was
just the worst feeling in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the funny thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole time, I'm doing the talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because right around this time, the Nicole Simpson case broke,
and O.J. was the suspect, and suddenly domestic violence was this
really hot topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on Geraldo and Montel, and they said I had a real good
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a name for Sandy's condition. Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder. She was propped up in a psychiatric ward when she got the
diagnosis. Nightmares. Hallucinations. Anxiety attacks. Depression.
Flashbacks. Panic. Numbness. It all fit.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of the post-trauma illness as a wartime
affliction, but it can be triggered by any traumatic event: rape,
torture, child abuse, a hurricane, a flood. Or, as too many women
can testify, near-death at the hands of the men they married.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sandy got the diagnosis, she thought the wartime
explanation might be the best, after all. Hadn't she just been
through a war? Wasn't the Beeline her battlefield?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Anderson, who has 20 years' experience as a case manager at
the 45th Street Mental Health Center in West Palm Beach, tried to
help Sandy put the fragments of her life together in 1994, when she
was living in a part of town where drug shootings are not just
something you read about. He remembers how smart she seemed _ and
how scared.
</P>
<P>
   Of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of what might.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mike Jones had an eight-year sentence _ but that was just
on paper. In real life, he would be out before her youngest baby
finished kindergarten. Then what would she do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy was having visual terrors of being stabbed,'' Anderson
says. ``In layman's terms, she was having flashbacks. She was
absolutely terrified. When something like this happens, if you
don't get help, you wind up like the Vietnam vet who disappears
into the mountains and fights the war for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irreconcilable misery to be married to the man who
almost killed you, and so, while Mike Jones was in jail awaiting
trial, Sandy did the only logical thing. Divorced him.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she had found somebody else. You might even say
Mike Jones introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a few months before The Incident, and Mike had just
dropped off Sandy at her job with an answering service in Riviera
Beach, where she worked triple shifts to pay their rent. In the
parking lot, they fought. She was still sniffling when she sat down
at her desk _ with a black eye _ and the first call came in.
Something about a leaky sink. Please beep Jerry Manning.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry called back, Sandy tried to deliver the leaky-sink
message, but she was sobbing too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry had a soft, deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   So she told him. The whole unbearable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohmigod, honey,'' he said, ``you sound like a real nice lady.
You got to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   They met for the first time three months later, after the

   Trauma Hawk deposited Sandy's ravaged body at St. Mary's. When
she opened her eyes after surgery, she saw Jerry, standing over her
bed with a teddy bear, no longer just a soft-deep voice on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy thought getting married and buying a sweet little house
together and setting up shop as a blended family, his kids, hers,
might help her start over in life, but she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1996 when they said their vows _ and not too much later
when they broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Manning tried, but he stepped into a crowded marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry. Sandy. And her monster.

<P>
   It is high noon on a beautiful autumn day in 1997, and Sandy has
just washed her hair and put on a pretty gray shorts set for an
emergency meeting with the principal and teachers at her children's
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency is, her ex-husband is about to go free.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones' travels through the prison system were entirely
typical _ up to a point. He served 321 days in the county jail,
followed by three years in prison, and then, because Florida's
prisons were crowded and one way to empty them was to let inmates
out early, he was all set to walk out of his prison digs up near
the Georgia line _ a bus ticket south tucked in his pocket _ when
there was a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   He had no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   No job.
</P>
<P>
   No plan.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of monitoring his 15-year probationary term
didn't want him landing on Sandy's doorstep _ in a letter to a
judge, a Department of Corrections administrator noted that Sandy
was ``in extreme fear for her life and the safety of her children''
_ so they took the unusual step of having him assigned to a
Probation and Restitution Center in Central Florida for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the year is up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy plops down in the principal's office. Fiddles with her
purse straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he tries to take the kids?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal raises her eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he disguises himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The principal jots a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he has a gun?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just her children's physical safety Sandy worries
about. Lately her kids have been doing well in school, but Sandy
remembers what happened this time last year, when Mike's prison
term expired, before the judge sent him to the probation center:
Mikey stopped focusing on his schoolwork and started obsessing
about the safety of his family. A worried old man at the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid for my mom,'' he told his teacher then, and looking
into his small, round face, she knew right away his mom wasn't the
only one he was scared for.
</P>
<P>
   The principal pulls up her chair, touches Sandy's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The school, she says, will do everything it can to make sure her
kids are safe. And she and the teachers will get them extra
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy smiles. But under the table, her knees are shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says it, but everybody's thinking it:
</P>
<P>
   What about Sandy? Who's helping Sandy?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALIC) November 1997. What is fear, undiluted,
uncontrollable fear?
</P>
<P>
   It is the phone ringing and a voice you can't place hissing,
``Gonna getcha, gonna getcha.'' It is a stranger outside your
house, inexplicably snapping a picture. It is your ex-husband's
relatives finding your apartment, dropping by for the first time in
years, saying, casually, ``Just want to see how you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you're doing: A stranger cuts through your yard, you
hide in the tub. A palm frond tickles the window, you punch 911.
You pack your kids off to grandma's house, then shake like a leaf
alone in your bed. You come across his mug shot, and suddenly he's
in the room. You think you're safe working at a little
hole-in-the-wall restaurant _ who possibly could find you there? _
and then your boss gets a call from a stranger, asking too many
questions about you.
</P>
<P>
   You say his name, your scars itch.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the benefits office, the lady says, ``Why not file for
child support?'' You say no because you can just see his face the
day he opens his paycheck and it's short. You can hear him mutter,
Bitch.
</P>
<P>
   You move again. Change your phone again. Call the county clerk's
office, ask to seal your address. Use an alias. Hand out his
picture. You check with the cops, the probation officer, the
courthouse. You know what everybody says? ``Get a restraining
order.'' This seems so preposterous you laugh. You tell your kids,
``Don't walk alone, not even down the block.'' Tell your mom, ``If
anything happens to me, I want you to sue the whole damn state.''
</P>
<P>
   And then.
</P>
<P>
   He gets out.
</P>
<P>
   And you draw the blinds and lock yourself in. (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's worksheet:
</P>
<P>
   During a fight, what can you do to protect yourself?
</P>
<P>
   lockdoor hide
</P>
<P>
   Who can you call to help?
</P>
<P>
   cops
</P>
<P>
   Make a plan: When I see:
</P>
<P>
   Micke call 911
</P>
<P>
   ``Read it, Mom,'' the kids say. ``Read us the story. Read it so
we know what happened. What really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper clipping is titled ``The Woman Who Wouldn't Die,''
and Sandy keeps it pinned to the back of her bedroom door, so that,
in her lowest moments, when she undresses and sees her scars _
shining like fresh white wounds _ she can remind herself that she's
tough, that she survived. That headline is her Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   Read it, Mom. They already know the rough outline, of course,
but an outline is a lusterless substitute for a story in its flesh,
and they know this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really hurt you? Why can't we be a family anymore? Her
babies are standing shoulder to shoulder like little soldiers by
the bedroom door, and they are so insistent, so certain, so
tormented, that she gives in. But she is a careful censor, careful
about what she leaves out, about how she delivers the truth of what
their daddy did.
</P>
<P>
   When she finishes, Courtney is crying, and the corners of
Mikey's mouth turn down, the way they do when a math problem is too
hard, or a vocabulary word stumps him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindsey, the oldest, stands perfectly still, then draws an
arm around her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey is an accelerated reader.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been in mother's bedroom many times before.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy is sitting on her bed, wearing purple, because purple will
hide the blood.
</P>
<P>
   She has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   She puts it to her temple, then under her chin, practicing
different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey needs help in math.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey's so moody.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney climbs onto my lap when she's sad.
</P>
<P>
   Under her chin. To her temple.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps five minutes, but feels much longer than that,
when Sandy tiptoes across the hall in the middle of the night to
check on the children.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she pours a cup of coffee and three bowls of
Fruit Loops, and everybody comes running for breakfast, just like
always.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what about your night terrors, Little Man?'' the pretty
lady counselor says.
</P>
<P>
   Mikey looks at her with big wet eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty scary, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout we make a picture of them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the park?''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to punch the balloon next time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   It feels good to punch a balloon when you're angry.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Saturday morning, and the pretty lady named Zoe is
trying to find the key to unlock Mikey. She and her partner, Matt,
are from the Children's Home Society, a new program called the
Child Witness to Violence Project, which helps youngsters who have
seen far too much of what they should not see at all.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Anderson and Zoe Costello first knocked on Sandy's door the
week Mike Jones went free, and they have been back many times since
to assist Sandy in practical ways _ doctors' appointments,
shopping, parenting techniques _ but mostly, they listen. To all
the stuff she and the kids don't usually talk about. ``All the dark
spots,'' Sandy says. Sandy's dark spots go back to childhood, when
she was raped by a relative. ``I learned early,'' she tells Matt,
``how to be a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking helps.
</P>
<P>
   Matt asks Sandy to sign a contract: If she is thinking about
hurting herself, she is supposed to call right away.
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a diary, and after a while she stops looking
over her shoulder to see if anybody is snooping when she writes, on
a bad day, ``God, if you can hear me, please help!''
</P>
<P>
   He asks her to keep a daily agenda. Her whole day is mapped out,
from 6 a.m., when she gets up to make coffee, until 8:30 p.m., when
Lindsey goes to bed. In between, she reads the paper, exercises
(after The Incident, her weight ballooned), cleans the house, helps
with homework, cooks the dinner, bathes the kids, slides in a tape
and out-Mariahs Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Her last assignment, right before bed, is to look in the mirror
and repeat a sentence:
</P>
<P>
   ``I, Sandy Manning, am a good person, and I'm going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   On good days, she almost believes it.
</P>
<P>
   It is afternoon, a clean, blue, spring day, and Sandy is
scrubbing kitchen counters with the window open, a breeze
fluttering in. She has freshly painted nails, a pretty blue dress
and beautiful strawberry blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Life is looking up. Just recently, she moved her family into a
cheerful new apartment, decorated it with throw rugs and family
photos and banners from her favorite team, the Cowboys (cowboys,
you know, are tough). And on the kitchen table there is a boom box,
which means that Sandy never does dishes without LeAnn Rimes
singing How Do I Live as back-up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy likes to think of the apartment as the place she and the
kids will start fresh, put all the junk behind them and live _ dare
she say it? _ a more or less normal life. As if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, free now for nearly half a year, is living in
Lakeland, where, Sandy hears, he is working at a restaurant and
reporting regularly to his probation officer. When she feels
jittery, she pulls out the court papers and checks the terms of his
15-year probation, forbidding him from having contact with her or
her children.
</P>
<P>
   In the court file, she knows, there is also a note from Judge
Roger B. Colton of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit that states that
Mike ``should serve his probationary period outside of Palm Beach
County and/or in an area other than where the victim in this case
resides.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a comfort _ but not a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy looks out the window, ticks off recent developments:
Mikey's night terrors are worse. Lindsey still cries a lot. Sandy
still hides in the tub.
</P>
<P>
   But some good things have happened, too, and in Sandy's mind
these are worth remarking upon, because it has been a very long
time since she has been able to list so many.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy took all the kids to Kmart, and right there in the middle
of the aisle, Lindsey crossed her arms and said, ``We're not
leaving, Mom, until you buy yourself something nice,'' and that is
how Sandy got her new pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney got student of the month, and Sandy posted the
certificate on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   Matt took Sandy to sit for a practice exam to earn her GED, and
she couldn't believe it but she did really well.
</P>
<P>
   And here's some news. Sandy heard it through the grapevine,
confirmed it with a probation officer. Mike Jones met somebody, got
serious fast _ and just got married.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy Ham, 10th Circuit administrator for the Department of
Corrections, asks Mike if he will talk to a reporter for a story
about Sandy, he declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned that he doesn't want to cause any more pain and
confusion for his children,'' Ham says.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy pauses a long time when she hears this.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be great,'' she finally says. ``If it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday. Dead summer. She sees him.
</P>
<P>
   He is backing a white van into his cousin's driveway, a few
blocks from her apartment, and when she passes by on her way to a
manicure, God as her witness, he leans out and waves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike all right, she tells herself.
</P>
<P>
   She recognizes his smile.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   She's 100 percent certain.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Manning floors it, and after she adjusts the rearview
mirror, she takes a good long look back.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7, 1998. On the Saturday morning Sandy Manning left
Florida, she packed six worn suitcases and three pillows for the
kids, and she said her goodbyes on the phone and in her sister's
living room, and if she cried once she cried a dozen times. And
then she loaded everybody up in a little gray station wagon for the
ride to the Amtrak station, where in the few minutes she had while
waiting for the Silver Service she opened up the newspaper and
checked her horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Let go.''
</P>
<P>
   She had whispered about the plan for days, weeks, months. For a
long time, nobody thought she was serious; after all, she had left
town once before, a few years ago, only to come back a short time
later. So saying a thing and doing it are two different
enterprises, as Sandy Manning will tell you. But she will tell you,
too, that sometimes you have to do a thing, even if you're not
absolutely positive it is the right thing, because when you examine
your options you realize you have no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   So she had thought it all out. She had her priorities. And her
first priority was not to run into Mike Jones on her way to a nail
appointment. Or at the Texaco. Or anywhere else, for that matter.
Her first priority was not to run into him at all.
</P>
<P>
   And so on Halloween night, Sandy's family threw her a going-away
party at a karaoke joint, and since Sandy is a woman who
appreciates symbolism, she sang the old Gladys Knight hit about
leaving on a midnight train to Georgia. And right then, everyone
knew her departure was a sure thing, sure and true.
</P>
<P>
   Where she went, that's a secret. Just say it's a place far, far
away. A place where she has people who care about her and the
prospect of a good job. A place where she will live in a nice house
in a safe neighborhood, and the kids will have their own bedrooms,
freshly painted in their favorite colors, and out back there will
be a trampoline to jump on before they do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon Sandy left town _ one year and a day after Mike
Jones went free _ her train stopped in a Central Florida town where
the sun cut dappled patterns on the cobblestone as she and her
children walked toward Pizza Hut for one last celebration. If you
are going to do a thing, Sandy figured, it is best to do it right.
So she put a dollar in the jukebox, and Tracy Chapman belted out
Give me one reason to stay here. And everybody thought the pizza
tasted so, so good.
</P>
<P>
   After that they were on the train again. The kids pressed their
faces against the glass and smiled at the glittery night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way, babies,'' Sandy said.
</P>
<P>
   And when in the mist of the dawn the train whisked across the
state line, carrying them up and away, she sank to her knees on the
cold, rattling floor, unfolded a note she had written to God, and
prayed.

WORKING: THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the final graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
(th) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a business major with a concentration in information
systems. I hear that the job market is very good, but I do not have
internship experience. Should I graduate on schedule to enter that
market, or wait a year to complete an internship?
</P>
<P>
   A. The world, it seems, is your employment oyster. Regardless of
whether you graduate next spring or stay in school another year,
experts say, you're unlikely to wind up flipping hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without internship experience, someone just getting out
of school with an information-technologies-related degree can
literally find a job in almost any part of the country with a very
good starting salary,'' said George S. Smith, vice president of
media services for Alltel, a telecommunications and information
technology company in Little Rock, Ark. ``These people are a very
hot commodity. Alltel basically has a standing offer: You come to
us and we'll hire you.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for qualified employees is intense, Smith said,
noting that companies like his have had to resort to aggressive
recruiting tactics and offer tempting starting salaries. ``You
cannot find enough people to fill the jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the job seeker's point of view, however, it may be best to
stay in school for an internship _ if you can afford the time and
expense. That way, some career advisers say, you can maximize your
marketability to get the hottest job at the highest possible
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dilemma new graduates most often face is that they've got
fine academic training, but no hard experience,'' said Betsy
Collard, director of programs at the Career Action Center in
Cupertino, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Internships can provide an important edge, she said. ``You'll be
able to demand more and get farther faster when you do graduate,''
she added. The training also helps build your comfort level with
the working world, reducing the chances of falling on your face
later.
</P>
<P>
   Career centers at universities often help match students and
employers, many of whom are eager for interns. ``I've heard several
companies say they cannot get all the interns they want in this
area,'' said Dan Lohmeyer, executive director of the IT Alliance,
an economic development group for the information technology
industry near Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But will the job market cool while you're slogging through that
extra year? ``These opportunities are not going to go away,'' Ms.
Collard said. ``The numbers in school with that area of
concentration don't compare with the growing need.''
</P>
<P>
   Lohmeyer agreed. ``Even when the Y2K problem gets solved, I
don't see any diminution of demand on the horizon,'' he said,
referring to the Year 2000 computer problem. ``Everywhere you turn,
people in business are folding information technologies into what
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're talking about a wave here,'' he said of
these jobs. ``We're talking about a flood.''

INS BREAKS UP IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING RING ON CANADIAN BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. immigration officials announced Thursday that
35 have been arrested and charged in a high-priced immigrant
smuggling operation that brought some 3,500 Chinese nationals into
the United States through a Mohawk Indian reservation on the
U.S.-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the agency's new wiretap powers under
a 1996 law helped agents crack the case.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the immigrants paid $47,000 to the smugglers to sneak
them into the United States from China, traveling over air, water
and land, according to Attorney General Janet Reno. She said the
smugglers collected more than $160 million over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the $47,000 fee was the highest the INS has ever
encountered for human smuggling. The operation was ``the first
large-scale alien smuggling operation we have encountered on the
northern border,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, Operation Over the Rainbow II, led by the
Buffalo division of the INS, began 18 months ago with a tip to the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police who worked together with the Toronto
cops, the FBI, the INS, the New York State Police and the St. Regis
Mohawk Tribal Police.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation of the various agencies from the United States,
Canada, New York, Ontario, Quebec and tribal governments proves
that ``we can extend the long arm of the law so there is no safe
haven for those who seek to profit from human misery and
desperation,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Maroney, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District
of New York who will prosecute the case, said cooperation among law
enforcement agencies along the U.S.-Canada border is essential
because the border is protected by ``a very thin line of law
enforcement,'' unlike the U.S. border with Mexico. He declined to
provide details about the wiretaps but said investigators did not
use body wires.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers, who included people of Chinese descent as well as
Mohawk and Navajo Indians, were arrested over the past week in
Philadelphia, New York City and Upstate New York and charged in an
indictment with facilitating smuggling, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middlemen have been very often Native Americans and some
have been Chinese,'' Maroney said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects face up to 10 years in jail and
$250,000 fines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Chinese nationals came from the Fujian Province and
were flown to Taipei or Hong Kong, then to Germany, France,
Morocco, Greenland, Cuba or Brazil. Meissner said these were merely
transit points and that there is no evidence that people in those
countries were involved in the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation then brought the Chinese nationals into
Vancover, British Columbia, or Toronto using fake passports and
documents. They then were turned over to Chinese smugglers known as
``snakeheads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese nationals were transported to Toronto and Cornwall,
Ontario, then by boat across the St. Lawrence River to the St.
Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canadian
border near Cornwall and Massena, N.Y. From there the immigrants

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like Brasilia, Canberra and other created capitals,
by which I mean cities that are custom-built as seats of
government, Washington has been bad-mouthed from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, obviously not foreseeing the day when he would gaze
in perpetuity from his marble tempietto down by the Tidal Basin,
called this ``that Indian swamp in the wilderness.'' Dickens, who
called Washington ``the city of magnificent intentions,''
complained about ``spacious avenues that begin in nothing and lead
nowhere.'' John F. Kennedy famously remarked that our fair capital
was full of ``Northern charm and Southern efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently a local columnist named Steve Twomey groused about the
city's reluctance to laugh, especially at itself; its failure to
inspire a popular song, and even its pizza, which tastes, he said,
like drywall.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints that there are two Americas, one inside the Beltway
and one outside, have of course reached deafening proportions. It
is hard to say who is held in the lowest esteem by the average
Janes and Joes who live outside Interstate 495, as the Beltway is
formally known: politicians, journalists who write and talk about
them, or lawyers and lobbyists who seek to influence them.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, all are thought to be terminally out of touch. Henry
James observed in 1907 that ``Washington talks about herself and
about almost nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Insularity is nothing new here, nor is obsession. James' heir,
the novelist Ward Just, observed last year in ``Echo House'' that
in Washington, ``life flourishes on flat surfaces, desks,
conference tables, lecterns, dinner tables: an indoor world.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. This is still the hometown of the largest enterprise
on earth, the U.S. government. And even when the murder rate
soared, when nobody plowed the snow or picked up the trash, when
the schools couldn't open because the courts said the buildings
were unsafe, when the infamous Mayor Marion Berry went to jail on a
drug rap, when the voters perversely returned him to office, when
Congress seized his power after he devastated the city's finances _
even then Americans flocked to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To most visitors, all that stuff is irrelevant. They come not to
listen to some Claghorn on Capitol Hill or to tut-tut at the hard
streets where the city's poor live, not to count the ways the
government falls short of the Founding Fathers' ideals, but to pay
homage to the ideals themselves, to keep the ideals alive and try
to imbue the kids with them. That is why Washington is thronged
several times each year with family groups, shod in their Reeboks,
maps in hand, taking in the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   We feel a stir, even the cynics among us, when we see Lincoln up
there in his thronelike marble chair, where Daniel Chester French
put him 75 years ago, or when we walk up the awesomely broad steps
of the Supreme Court, whose very name embodies an absoluteness
unheard of in modern life.
</P>
<P>
   I feel it every time the plane glides slowly into National
Airport after dark _ Ronald Reagan National Airport, as it is now _
and I catch sight of the familiar monuments all ablaze with light,
the Capitol and the White House, too, and the Potomac glistening
darkly beneath. If Washington sometimes seems like the world
capital of hypocrisy and self-importance, it is also, almost
always, a scene of seductive grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Pillars and Porticos
</P>
<P>
   Washington is centered on the Capitol, sited on Jenkins Hill by
a grouchy French military engineer named Pierre Charles L'Enfant in
1790. As he laid out a city of broad boulevards that drew its
inspiration from Paris, the elevation seemed to him ``a pedestal
waiting for a monument.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who governed the young American Republic that was just
then setting up shop here thought of themselves as the political
progeny of the ancient Greeks and Romans, so the city is full of
pillars and porticos. But only the Capitol has a 9-million-pound
cast-iron dome, completed in the midst of the Civil War. Congress
meets in this building, the Senate in the north wing and the House
of Representatives in the south. Its original sandstone came from
Virginia quarries owned by George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Just down Delaware Avenue from the Capitol stands Union Station,
designed by the great Chicago architect Daniel H. Burnham in 1908
and restored to all its magnificence in 1988 by another Chicagoan,
Harry Weese, with busy shops and restaurants enlivening the
concourse. (Weese, who died this year, also designed the Washington
Metro, giving its stations arched and coffered ceilings that lend
them the noble air of Roman vaults.)
</P>
<P>
   Washington's four quadrants meet at the Capitol, with numbered
streets running north and south from there and lettered streets
running east and west. It is the straight, splendid avenues that
run on the diagonal, though, that give the city much of its
dignity, as well as scale and character.
</P>
<P>
   Because of laws restricting the height of buildings, plus more
than a century of zealous preservation of green spaces, Washington
has an airier, less congested feeling than many cities. On a fine
spring day, with the cherry, dogwood and redbud trees in bloom,
with the immaculately maintained white buildings gleaming in the
sun, it can be astonishingly lovely.
</P>
<P>
   If you are here on a day like that, do yourself a favor and walk
over to Washington's greatest underdiscovered treasure, the Pension
Building, now known as the National Building Museum. The city's
most stunning room lurks inside, an immense central court, as long
as a football field and pierced by eight redwood-size brick
columns, each 76 feet high and 25 feet around. They are bigger than
the pillars of the temple at Baalbek in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol is also one of the city's great outdoor stages.
There gala concerts are held on patriotic holidays, and there
presidents take the oath of office every four Januarys. Mostly
their words vanish into the chill winds, but sometimes we remember
pregnant phrases like FDR's ``The only thing we have we have to
fear is fear itself'' from 1933 and JFK's ``Ask not what what your
country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'' from
1961.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the Mall, beyond the obelisk memorializing
George Washington, now swathed in scaffolding, and beyond the
reflecting pool, and beyond Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial, a gash in
the green lawns that recalls the wound opened by that wretched war,
stands the other stage, the Lincoln Memorial. There rallies are
held on behalf of the poor or the oppressed. For members of my
generation, it will always be linked with the great oration in
which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. foresaw his people ``free
at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined to the Mall by the Ellipse are the grounds of the White
House, where presidents dwell and deal and struggle to lead an
often balky country. There you can see Ulysses S. Grant's
chandeliers in the East Room, Harry S. Truman's balcony, Gilbert
Stuart's famous Washington portrait, rescued from the fire set by
the British in 1812 by Dolley Madison herself, and perhaps the
network correspondents doing their stand-uppers on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mall is more than politics. On it or near it are
repositories of American and world history: the National Archives,
home of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill
of Rights and the Emancipation Proclamation; the Library of
Congress, the world's largest, with a collection approaching 100
million items, including a Gutenberg Bible, Charlie Chaplin movies,
a vast trove of cookbooks, 3.5 million pieces of sheet music and 5
Stradivarius violins; the National Portrait Gallery, the National
Air and Space Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, and
the National Museum of American History, an attic stuffed with
items as big as a 280-ton locomotive and as small as a postage
stamp, including Rogers' cardigan and the Star-Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   `Diffusion of Knowledge'
</P>
<P>
   Many of the museums are parts of the Smithsonian Institution,
the legacy of an Englishman named James Smithson, who died in 1829,
leaving his fortune to a city he had never visited to found an
organization ``for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men.'' It has grown into the largest museum complex in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere else, any one of these collections would be remarkable.
Here they can sometimes become mere entries on a list, in danger of
turning into the yadda yadda of a visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The glory of the city's cultural life is its art museums. Our
young capital lacks Rome's long history, Paris' sophistication and
London's royal traditions, but it can compete on equal terms with
those cities, and with New York and Berlin, in the richness of the
paintings and sculpture, drawings and prints that have been
assembled here over many decades.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly like the Freer Gallery, devoted to Asian art, and
especially the Peacock Room, flamboyantly decorated in blue and
gold by James McNeill Whistler, whom the museum's founder, the
Detroit industrialist Charles Lang Freer, saw as the link between
the esthetics of East and West.
</P>
<P>
   Also the Phillips Collection, once a private mansion, which
holds Renoir's masterpiece ``Luncheon of the Boating Party'' and
important groups by two of my modern favorites, Klee and Rothko.
</P>
<P>
   But who would want to miss the Corcoran, with its splendid
Hudson River School canvases, or the National Museum of American
Art, whose rehung collection spans the range from Hopper's economy
of means to Bierstadt's grandiose gestures, or the exquisite
pre-Columbian relics housed in Phillip Johnson's deliciously
refined little pavilion at Dumbarton Oaks?
</P>
<P>
   If you go to the latter, you can collect bonuses in the form of
a fine Byzantine collection, housed in the mansion where the
groundwork was laid for the United Nations, and the gloriously
romantic gardens, designed in the 1920s by Beatrix Ferrand, one of
the greatest American landscape architects.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaires' Gift
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, of course, stands the National Gallery of Art,
endowed by people of unimaginable wealth like Andrew Mellon and his
children and Chester Dale and Joseph Widener, and built into a
world-class institution by a succession of directors including John
Walker, J. Carter Brown and the incumbent, Earl A. Powell III, a
refreshingly unstuffy soul who is known to everyone as Rusty.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery has two buildings. The first was designed in 1941 by
John Russell Pope, whose pared-down neo-classical style left a deep
mark on Washington, through the Jefferson Memorial, Constitution
Hall and other landmarks. The second is the work of I.M. Pei
(1978), a pair of cleanly articulated triangles that house offices,
galleries and a vast atrium where Alexander Calder's enormous final
mobile twists lazily overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Inside hang the only Leonardo in America, a portrait of Ginevra
de Benci; Raphael's ``Alba Madonna,'' van Eyck's ``Annunciation,''
Vermeer's ``Girl With the Red Hat'' _ all iconic pictures familiar
from a thousand posters and a million postcards _ and dozens of
Impressionist gems.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Pei's is one of the city's few significant modern buildings.
Washington has nothing by Frank Lloyd Wright or Frank Gehry; by
Mies it has only a relatively minor library, supposedly recycled
from the plans for a Bacardi factory designed for Havana but never
built. Paradoxically, however, the city boasts two of the nation's
handsomest airports, Dulles by Eero Saarinen and National by Cesar
Pelli, both across the Potomac.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center, designed by Edward Durrell Stone, is an
architectural dud and a performing-arts triumph. Leonard Slatkin,
its elfin music director, who came from St. Louis, has raised the
National Symphony to a new level, and Placido Domingo has done the
same for the Washington Opera; both now rank just below the
nation's half-dozen best. Visiting orchestras, soloists and dance
companies share the stages, which also house touring plays. The
American Film Institute screens movie classics.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly pleasant Kennedy Center innovation is a nightly
free concert before the main events begin. Designed to draw into
the center people who could probably not afford tickets, these
widely diverse events are financed by its chairman, James Johnson,
and his wife, Maxine Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   There is music and theater all over town. Institutions as
diverse as Dumbarton Oaks, the Library of Congress, the National
Galley and the Corcoran all stage first-rate concerts of chamber
music. Experimental and more conventional theaters abound,
including the Arena Stage, founded by Zelda Fichandler, which has,
in fact, three stages. One of the nation's leading regional
repertory companies, it is housed in buildings designed by the
ubiquitous Harry Weese. Many of its productions eventually go to
New York, and it has developed outstanding actors like Robert
Prosky.
</P>
<P>
   For Some, a Hard Town
</P>
<P>
   Washington is changing. A new mayor, Anthony Williams, who
proved himself a solid if low-key manager as the city's financial
czar in recent years, takes office Jan. 2. Washington has high
hopes for him, so high that he says he feels like ``everyone's
maitre d', expected to deliver service everywhere at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Once proudly hailed as ``Chocolate City,'' 70 percent
African-American, with a flourishing black commercial and artistic
tradition of which Duke Ellington was a notable product, Washington
now has fewer blacks, more Asian and Hispanic residents, and a
prosperous white minority that plays a pivotal political role. (
Williams, who is black, got only half the black vote in the 1998
primary, which was decisive, but most of the white vote.)
</P>
<P>
   It is still a hard town for some people: those who live in
crack-infested neighborhoods, those who sleep in Lafayette Park,
near the White House, and those who find the pressure or loneliness
too much.
</P>
<P>
   One of Washington's most poignant monuments, popularly known as
``Grief,'' is a memorial by Augustus Saint-Gaudens to Clover Adams
in Rock Creek Cemetery. Married to Henry Adams _ a famous writer
himself, a grandson of John Quincy Adams, a great-grandson of John
Adams _ she committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a town of possibilities, too. Georgetown University,
President Clinton's alma mater, has emerged under its two most
recent presidents, the Jesuit priests Timothy S. Healy and Leo
O'Donovan, as the nation's premier Catholic university. Howard
University is one of the nation's oldest and best historically
black colleges. Gallaudet University has long been a world leader
in the education of the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the Neighborhoods
</P>
<P>
   This is a city of small pleasures as much as large thrills. Try
a walk or a horseback ride in Rock Creek Park, Washington's bosky
answer to the Bois de Boulogne; a visit to the little-noted
Churchill statue near Lutyens' monumental British Embassy, or a
quiet hour examining Cass Gilbert's Supreme Court Building (1935).
</P>
<P>
   I like looking at the Iowa cornstalks that replace acanthus
leaves in the ``Corinthian'' capitals, and at the sculptured
portraits on the pediment, including one of the immodest Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Different people are drawn to different things: to the National
Zoo, perhaps, or the wonderful Arboretum, to the Pentagon and the
many other military installations, to the National Cathedral or the
National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, to the city's
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Morgan is one of the funkiest and Cleveland Park one of
the pleasantest and Volvo-est, with big frame houses that used to
be refuges from the summer heat downtown in the days before
air-conditioning. Many of the city's rich live in grand houses on
Woodland Drive and in Kalorama.
</P>
<P>
   For me, nothing quite matches Georgetown, which was a modest
river port before all the grandees came to town. It is the ideal
inner-city residential enclave, leafy and full of red-brick
survivors of the Federal period, but also old wooden buildings,
intricate remnants from the Victorian era, a few modern houses
tucked in here and there and a big French-style mansion where
Katharine Graham of The Washington Post lives.
</P>
<P>
   You will best savor Georgetown's flavor and tempo by wandering
at random along its narrow streets, past Dumbarton Oaks, to be
sure, and Tudor Place, built in 1794 by Dr. William Thornton, the
original architect of the Capitol, for Martha Washington's
granddaughter, Martha Parke Custis, and her husband, Thomas Peter;
but also down N Street, NW, past John F. Kennedy's onetime house at
3307, perhaps, and one of the most beautiful doorways anywhere at
2812, and Cox Row from 3327 to 3339.
</P>
<P>
   To finish, you could pop into Miller &AMP; Arney's antiques shop, a
local fixture at Wisconsin and S, or Booked Up, an excellent
antiquarian bookshop owned by the author Larry McMurtry and the
charming Marcia Carter, across from the Georgetown post office on
31st Street just above M.

<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza The house painter says he is happy that
President Clinton is coming to town. But he doesn't look happy. He
frowns and is quick to raise his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't work. That's why I look this way,'' grumbles Shaher
I'leewa(cq), a 30-year-old Gazan, as he leaned on a car in busy
Palestine Square. He has short-term work today, but he has five
kids and has not had a steady job in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Donkey carts make their way among the cars on the streets
nearby. Based on the overall Gaza population, three-fourths of the
people passing here are refugees and a third still live in refugee
camps. Worse still, they make about 20 percent less money than they
did before the peace process began. One out of five, like I'leewa,
is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the people Clinton seemed to be talking about in a
speech to international aid donors last month: A Palestinian who
feels like he has not seen the benefits of the five-year-old peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Clinton will become the first U.S. president to visit a
Palestinian-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks to boost the faltering peace between the Gazans and
their richer neighbors in Israel. For all the diplomacy and peace
treaties, the chances for peace depend largely on whether people
like this painter think they can take care of their families better
now than before. So far, they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   I'leewa's problem is that he cannot work in Israel anymore.
Israel, concerned about security, has tightened the entrance
criteria and excluded, according to some counts, more than half of
the 150,000 Palestinians who used to commute in every day.
</P>
<P>
   I'leewa never cared much about politics, but he agrees with
Clinton that peace and prosperity are connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no work, you will go to the Hamas people,'' he says,
referring to the extremist group that sends terrorist bombers into
Israel and runs a social services network that serves the needy.
``If you have work, when Hamas comes to you, you will tell them, 'I
don't need you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Palestinian areas there are examples of the
complexities that stifle economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Khaled Rashadeh helped make
the 14,000 plastic U.S. flags that will drape across streets for
Clinton's visit. He cares about making money, not about politics.
But he has a political problem.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to work in neighboring Jordan a few years ago, he
lost his Israeli-approved West Bank identity card. He has rejoined
his family, but cannot buy a car or a house without an ID even if
he could on $340 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Rashadeh, 36, is married and he would like to put his four kids
in private schools, rather than the school in their refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to just be dependent on Israel,'' he says. ``If
the Israelis and Arabs put their minds together, this would be the
greatest place.''
</P>
<P>
   And, there's the story of West Bank resident Amjad Bader, 30,
studying nearby and trying to rebuild his life after 28 months in
Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Bader was a college activist in the Palestinian uprising that
was known as the Intifada. He organized demonstrations and riots
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, the political activity is over,'' he says. ``The
dream of my life is to become independent financially.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a wife and daughter and was working two jobs about 16
hours a day. Hoping to sell cosmetics in Jordan, he won approval
from the Israeli supreme court to travel. But, something went wrong
and, in Jordan, he was arrested for having improper immigration
papers and was sent back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is learning to be a driving instructor. The class is run
by a group that rehabilitates former prisoners. They have 31,000
others like Bader getting, or waiting for, training, and they have
trouble finding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Ex-Detainee Rehabilitation Center, gets its money
from European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Donor countries recently pledged up to $4 billion in aid over
five years to the Palestinian-controlled areas. The U.S. gives $75
million a year now.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a lot of money for a population of about 2.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Also, donors have been made skeptical by reports of rampant
corruption in Yasser Arafat's government.
</P>
<P>
   A British newspaper recently reported that aid for low income
housing was diverted to luxury flats for Arafat supporters and
parts of the local economy are controlled by cronies with favored
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, world powers have long sunk billions into this region,
trying to buy an elusive peace.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. alone gives $3 billion a year to the 6 million
Israelis, who have a per capita income about 10 times that of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian per capita income has dropped 21 percent since 1992
to just $1,630, according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Experts see potential in the Palestinian economy. Palestinians
are not as poor as their Egyptian or Jordanian neighbors. Also,
they are well-educated and entrepreneurial.
</P>
<P>
   But, their tiny, $3.3 billion-a-year economy depends on access
to the $100 billion Israeli power house next door. Israel can
isolate their economy literally in minutes, by closing checkpoints
and shipping access.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip highlights one solution. He will fly by
helicopter into Gaza International Airport Monday. The $80 million,
donor-funded airport opened a few weeks ago and allows Palestinians
to travel and ship goods with less Israeli interference.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other donor-provided improvements over the five
years since the peace process started. Flood Waters and sewage do
not overflow into the narrow streets of Gaza's eight refugee camps
as much anymore, and the camps all have potable water. Major
streets are paved and dumpsters with ``European Community''
stenciled on the side help eliminate the litter.
</P>
<P>
   On the eastern edge of The Gaza Strip, a 50-acre industrial park
is being built that could ultimately employ 15,000 people in
companies lured by tax incentives. The Palestinian Coca-Cola
distributor is the first big-name tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian economist Hisham Awartani said aid to the
Palestinians will help fix the roads and phone systems needed to
attract investment, but it should be used only in the transition
from occupied territory to a self-sufficient state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Palestinians are somewhat sensitive about aid,'' he says.
``We are not Bangladesh. Palestine is a relatively rich country.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants it to be easier for painters to get to their jobs, or
Palestinians to get identification cards that let them buy cars or
sell products in Jordan. A crucial sea port, envisioned in the
peace process, still does not have Israeli approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can help us more not just by giving aid, but by twisting
the Israelis arms,'' Awartani says.
</P>
<P>
   ENDIT.

 WASHINGTON: above M. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHERE GLORY, OLD AND NEW, AWAITS:
</P>
<P>
   A Visitor's Guide to the Nation's Capital
</P>
<P>
   Here is information about visiting Washington:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 2800 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, (202) 342-0444. A
nondescript brick box on the outside, a festival of fine fabrics
and fresh flowers on the inside, this is Washington's premier
hotel. The location on the brink of Georgetown and the air of
discreet seclusion will cost you dearly, but you won't feel
cheated. Political power breakfasts in the Seasons restaurant. Stan
Bromley, the manager, ranks among the nation's top hoteliers.
Doubles from $199 to $550 on weekends; $380 to $505 weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   WILLARD INTERCONTINENTAL, 1401 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, (202)
628-9100. Designed by Henry J. Hardenbergh, the architect of the
Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, this grand Beaux-Arts pile has stood tall
between the White House and Capitol Hill since 1908. Spectacularly
opulent lobby, brilliantly restored, and rooms of varying
dimensions, occupied by the rich, the famous and the not quite.
Doubles from $199 to $440 on weekends; $410 to $470 weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON HOTEL, 16th and M Street, NW, (202) 347-2200.
Understated, private, this 68-room gem is European in conception
and style. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who has lived in one of
its suites during his six years in the Clinton administration,
knows what he's doing. Flawless service, and there are few better
places for a civilized drink after work. Doubles are $185 on
weekends, $310 on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   RIVER INN, 925 25th St., NW, (202) 337-7600. Not for you if
you're looking for the dernier cri in interior decoration. But this
all-suite hotel, with full kitchens in each apartment, offers clean
and spacious accommodation at a bargain price, close to the Metro,
Kennedy Center and the State Department, which often uses it for
visitors on a tight budget. Doubles from $79 to $99 on weekends;
$110 to $165 weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   GERARD'S PLACE, 915 15th St., NW, (202) 737-4445. Not so long
ago, Gerard Pangaud ran a Paris restaurant that won two stars in
the Guide Michelin. After rocky passages in New York and Virginia,
he has pitched up in an understated room near the White House. As
ever, his food is sterling. Prime seasonal ingredients, impeccably
cooked, sound simple on the menu but dance a merry tune on the
palate. Try lobster with sauternes sauce.
</P>
<P>
   INN AT LITTLE WASHINGTON, Main and Middle Streets, Washington,
Va., (540) 675-3800. Self-taught, Patrick O'Connell applies modern
French technique to Virginia ingredients like oysters and country
ham, with world-beating results. Reinhardt Lynch has molded one of
the country's best wait staffs from a group of charming youngsters
who, like the inn, grew up in the shadow of the Blue Ridge, an hour
and a half west of big Washington. Hire a car and driver for the
trip, or spend the night in one of the pasha-worthy bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   KINKEAD'S, 2000 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, (202) 296-7700.
Confession time: This is my local, where I eat at least once a week
when I'm in town. It's also the city's best restaurant, a showcase
for Bob Kinkead's talent, honed in his native New England. No one,
anywhere, serves better fried clams, but that's just a start; the
menu zooms giddily but confidently from Thai fish soup to salmon in
a dill-scented broth, Scandinavian style. The wine list is equally
catholic, and there's subtle jazz downstairs at night.
</P>
<P>
   LESPINASSE, Sheraton Carlton Hotel, 923 16th St., NW, (202)
879-6900. An offshoot of the New York gastronomic shrine of the
same name, this place never quite made it the first time around.
Now comes Sandro Gamba, a 28-year-old protege of Alain Ducasse, to
push it near the top of the Washington heap in his first weeks in
charge. Feeling fancy? Perfectly grilled scallops accented with
sea-urchin roe should do you. Feeling plain? The poached guinea hen
with Napa cabbage in herb bouillon is a little masterpiece.
Sparkling room in the grand old fashion, solicitous French service,
great wines.
</P>
<P>
   OBELISK, 2029 P St., NW, (202) 872-1180. Peter Pastan isn't
Italian, but his sensibility is. Every day he offers a market-based
menu with two or three choices at each stage, each full of fresh,
unaffected goodness. Served in a little room with lean blond decor,
the food is complemented by outstanding Italian wines, many
little-known here, and knee-buckling grappas.
</P>
<P>
   PESCE, 2016 P St., NW, (202) 466-3474. No reservations, harsh
lighting, sometimes harried if always warm-hearted service, Formica
tables, but who cares when the fish is this good? Order something
French or Italian from the blackboard, in keeping with the
restaurant's parentage, or something American-fried. And look
around; the clientele is diverse and fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   VIDALIA, 1990 M Street, NW, (202) 659-1990. A celebration of
Washington's Southern roots, Vidalia serves flavor-packed grits and
pork chops that will make you forget their humble origins. In
season, the chef Jeffrey Bubin's trademark baked sweet Vidalia
onion is a savory revelation. The dining room, tucked into an
office-building basement, feels warm and sunny anyway.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS FLORIDA SCHOOLS IMPROVING
 &HT;    630 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Florida schools have steadily boosted college
enrollment and improved eighth-grade math scores and teacher
training, according to a national report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The number of Florida eighth-graders proficient in mathematics
has increased, though the numbers continue to lag behind the
nation. In 1996, 17 percent of eighth-graders were proficient,
compared with 12 percent in 1990. Nationally, 24 percent of
eighth-graders were proficient in 1996, compared with 15 percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Math achievement among Florida fourth-graders from 1992 to 1996
has remained constant at 15 percent, while math achievement among
fourth-graders nationwide increased from 18 percent in 1992 to 21
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more Florida students are receiving degrees in
mathematics and science, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in
mathematics and science increased from 29 percent to 32 percent.
However, the number of minorities receiving such degrees decreased
from 36 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995. Florida has become one of the
nation's leaders in support programs for new teachers, according to
the report. In 1994, 48 percent of teachers participated in formal
induction programs, compared with 42 percent in 1991. Nationally,
27 percent of teachers participated in such programs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The state also was highlighted in a ``Promising Practices''
report for its progress in increasing college enrollment. In 1994,
50 percent of high school students enrolled in college, compared
with 45 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the rise in college enrollment to the Florida
Bright Futures Scholarship Act. Under this provision, Florida high
school students who are enrolled in a college-preparatory program
and achieve at least a 3.0 grade point average receive a 75 percent
discount on tuition at any of the state's colleges or universities.
Students with at least a 3.5 grade point average may receive full
scholarships and a book allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't all good. The report showed more Florida teachers
report classroom disruptions that interfere with learning. In 1994,
48 percent of teachers made such reports, compared with 42 percent
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hope the report will help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

RETIRED GENERAL CHARGED WITH IMPROPER SEXUAL RELATIONS

   FORT LEWIS, Wash. _ A retired Army major general has been
charged with having improper sexual relations with the wives of
four subordinates and obstructing a Pentagon probe into the affair,
Fort Lewis officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. David Hale faces the military equivalent of a grand
jury hearing at Fort Lewis as a result of the decision by I Corps
commander Lt. Gen. George Crocker to prefer charges against him,
Fort Lewis spokeswoman Lt. Col. Melanie Reeder said yesterday.
Crocker was appointed to direct a review of the Army evidence in
October with the authority to convene a court-martial if the facts
warrant it.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Hale retired under honorable conditions in February after
serving only four months as the Army's deputy inspector general in
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   An Army statement summarizing the case said Hale has been
charged on 17 counts of violating the Uniformed Code of Military
Justice, including six alleged violations of Article 107 (making
false official statements) including lying to the Army inspector
general, the Army's vice chief of staff, and the Defense
Department's deputy inspector general. Hale also faces nine charges
of violating Article 133 (conduct unbecoming an officer), including
having improper relationships with the wife of a subordinate
officer in Hawaii from 1994 to 1997, and the wives of three
subordinate officers at Izmir, Turkey, from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He also is accused on two counts of violating Article 134 of the
military code (obstruction of justice), including threats to a
subordinate's spouse and telling a civilian government employee to
delete computer files relevant to the Pentagon probe.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all 17 counts, Hale could receive a maximum
punishment of 49 years in a military prison and loss of all pay and
benefits, said Army spokesman Lt. Col. Guy Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Hale or his lawyer were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations against Hale first surfaced last January when one of
the women with whom he is accused of having an affair reported it
to Army investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Hale requested retirement. Senior Army
officials were later criticized for allowing Hale to leave active
duty on Feb. 23 as the accusations became public.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released earlier this year, Defense Department
Inspector General Eleanor Hill concluded that Hale ``engaged in a
pattern of inappropriate behavior'' with the wives of four
subordinates while he was a senior officer based in Turkey. Hale
also was accused in that report of sanctioning misuse of government
funds for travel and making false and misleading statements to Army
investigators and Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker has appointed Col. Gary Holland, a military circuit
judge from Fort Campbell, Ky., to conduct a formal investigation
under Article 32 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice. The
proceeding will allow ``a thorough and impartial investigation of
those charges,'' Reeder said. Both Army prosecutors and lawyers for
Hale will take part in the hearing, which can include the
presentation of evidence and witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of that hearing, Holland will make a report to
Crocker that could include recommending the dropping of some or all
charges; adding additional charges, and recommending a general
court-martial on charges the investigator has confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Reeder said it will not be necessary for Hale to be recalled to
active duty to face either the Article 32 hearing or a
court-martial, should one be ordered. General officers in retired
status are still subject to the military legal code, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Hale surfaced in a report published by The
Washington Times earlier this year. It reported that a woman named
Donnamaria Carpino charged that Hale ``forced her into a four-month
sexual relationship'' in Izmir, Turkey, while her husband, an Army
colonel, was posted there. At the time, Hale was the deputy
commanding general of NATO's allied land forces in southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army probe intensified against him last August, Hale
filed a slander lawsuit against Carpino accusing her of ``character
assassination'' against him but dropped the suit two months later.

(Saturday) on a crucial mission to the Middle East with his
presidency, and peace in the region, hanging in the balance.
Clinton will face four days of difficult diplomacy in Israel and
Palestine-controlled territory. More than simply pressing the

Stanley Faulder, a Canadian whose case has galvanized death penalty
opponents in Canada. A stay in Faulder's execution was issued on
Wednesday and the Texas attorney general's office on Thursday
appealed the stay. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).

larger, 31 percent, when the state's 17 percent population growth
is factored in. Many of those crowding into hunting hot spots like
Llano are coming from other parts of Texas or other states, having
been driven from their traditional hunting land by urban sprawl or
soaring lease costs. Some see a crisis looming for a sport long

Jackie and his boon pal Michael (David Kelly) are a couple of old

`THE AMERICAN VASARI': A HISTORIAN'S VIEW OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time in the United States there were
actually more artists than art historians. In fact, there was only
one real specimen of the now ubiquitous breed, William Dunlap
(1766-1839), a man-about-culture who was also a painter.
</P>
<P>
   His two-volume ``History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of
Design in the United States,'' published in 1834, is a chatty but
far from naive rundown of American art from its inception to
Dunlap's own day, and it established his reputation as the father
of American art history. The book is still useful as a lode of
information about its period.
</P>
<P>
   Like Giorgio Vasari in 16th-century Italy, Dunlap was very much
a participant in his scene, chronicling the lives of contemporary
and earlier artists, architects, sculptors, printmakers and such
with pondered and sometimes pungent opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Not unduly modest, he devoted no less than three chapters to
himself, and he covered Benjamin West (with whom he had studied in
Britain), Washington Allston, Thomas Cole and Gilbert Stuart. He
also included artists whose names today evoke a blank stare, and
those he didn't like, among them his contemporary Charles Willson
Peale (1741-1827), whose work he brushed off with ``will soon be
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest early-American show at Hirschl &AMP; Adler Galleries,
longtime specialists in Yankee art, is a hefty salute to Dunlap and
his book. ``The American Vasari: William Dunlap and His World''
includes than 60 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and
engravings by artists who made it into Dunlap's tome.
</P>
<P>
   The names range from the ornithologist John James Audubon (``How
much science gains by increasing the picture of a bird beyond that
size necessary to display all the parts distinctly, is with me
questionable,'' Dunlap wrote) to Robert Walter Weir (1803-1899), a
drawing instructor at West Point who was lauded by Dunlap but whose
painting ``Niagara Falls'' (1856) adds nothing to nature's
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The American Vasari'' is a bright idea for a show, and
it offers a robust selection from the gallery's remarkable
inventory of early American treasures (with a few loans sprinkled
in).
</P>
<P>
   Portraits are the emphasis, as they were in Dunlap's time, and
among the most interesting is one by Edward Savage (1761-1817) of
Jedidiah Morse and his son, Samuel F.B. Morse, about 1794. It shows
the future scientist and painter, who with Dunlap helped found the
insurgent National Academy of Design in 1826, as a fat-faced little
boy at the side of his father, a Yale-educated geographer and
Congregational minister, wearing black clerical garb and an
expression of high moral purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to this austere rendering is the lah-di-dah
likeness of Elizabeth Eliot Burr (1798), by Ralph Earl (1751-1801),
a Connecticut grande dame seated in sumptuous surroundings, dressed
in a gown of gleaming white satin and holding a chain attached to a
pet squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Another standout portrait is of Rajah Rommahon Roy (1833), by
Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), the son of Charles Willson Peale. Roy
was a Hindu reformist and linguist who founded the Theistic Church
in India, and in his last years was ambassador from Delhi to
Britain. Peale's masterly portrait, in exotic high colors, shows
Roy wearing a turban and a salmon-colored shirt, his richly fleshy
but appealing face in mellow repose.
</P>
<P>
   A small but jaunty head-and-shoulders self-portrait of Dunlap
shows him in a dressy white cravat and dark coat. He gazes straight
at the viewer and doesn't hide his out-of-commission right eye,
blinded in a childhood accident. Even so, he looks every inch the
old Knick cosmopolitan that he was, a friend of James Fenimore
Cooper, Washington Irving and William Cullen Bryant, and a polymath
who, besides being an artist and art historian, also wrote plays,
diaries, a history of the theater and a history of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is by no means all portraits; there are landscapes,
still lifes, genre scenes, miniatures, historical paintings,
architectural views and even a pair of precise watercolor plans
(1806) for an underwater cannon by the steamboat pioneer Robert
Fulton (1765-1815). ``As a painter, Fulton does not rank high,''
Dunlap wrote, but he went on to praise Fulton as ``a kind father, a
fast friend, an enlightened philosopher and a good republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Among landscapists, Dunlap particularly favored Cole
(1801-1848), a founder of the Hudson River School, who is
represented here by a glowing, golden idyll, ``The Old Mill at
Sunset'' (1844). Cole, in fact, was ``discovered'' in 1825 by
Dunlap and two friends, the painters John Trumbull and Asher Durand
(at that time more noted as an engraver than as a painter).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trumbull saw Cole's paintings in the window of a Manhattan
bookstore, bought one, and then took Dunlap and Durand to see them.
``I remember the sensitive and amiable painter, then seen by me for
the first time,'' Dunlap recalled, ``standing in presence of the
three above-mentioned like a schoolboy in presence of the trustees,
and looking an image of diffidence before men, neither of whom
could produce a rival to the works he offered for the paltry price
of $25 each.''
</P>
<P>
   Works by Durand and Trumbull also appear in the show. Durand's
opus is a peaceful cliche of a landscape, dated 1860-1870, and
Trumbull's is a Rubens-influenced grisaille drawing of a female
nude, done around 1795.
</P>
<P>
   In the still life offerings, nothing quite comes up to Raphaelle
Peale's study of an ear of corn and a cantaloupe half (1813), an
austere but brilliantly rendered observation that has the character
of a fine portrait.
</P>
<P>
   As for the genre department, there is the beguiling ``What Have
I Forgot?'' (1862) by William Sidney Mount (1807-1869), depicting a
boy in a rustic yard carrying a packed basket. (Dunlap predicted
Mount would go far.) And somewhere between genre and landscape is
the jolly winter scene ``Sleigh Ride'' (1838), by the Philadelphian
Thomas Birch (1779-1851), surprising in that Birch's specialty was
marine painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists in this show were far more significant, as
artists, than Dunlap. But as a keeper of the flame, he knew that
posterity needed him. His aim, he wrote rather humbly, was to
provide ``many valuable facts, which would otherwise have been
lost; and to leave information respecting those professors of the
arts who have failed, as well as those who have attained to
honorable distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   And, agree with his judgments or not, that's exactly what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Vasari: William Dunlap and His World'' is at
Hirschl &AMP; Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th St., New York, through Jan.
30.

 &HT;    Warm weather chills donations
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jingle bells just sound more appealing in colder weather, said
Salvation Army officials, lamenting the fact that donations to
their 180 Atlanta-area Christmas kettles are down.
</P>
<P>
   They're blaming the decline, in large part, on the unseasonably
warm weather of recent weeks, said Jamee Smith, director of
development for the Salvation Army of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kettles do better when the weather's colder because donors
feel sorry for the bell ringers standing out in the cold,'' Smith
said. ``Also, in cold weather, people get in more of a Christmas
spirit of giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Donations to metro-area kettles, often manned by Santas outside
busy shopping centers, are down 5 percent to 7 percent from last
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she had no hard statistics to back up her assertion
that colder weather warms donors' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've worked with the Salvation Army for 25 years and it's
always been that way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's drop in temperatures may prompt donations to rise,
Smith predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Highs for the rest of the week are not expected to climb above
the mid-50s under partly-cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and temperatures in the lower 50s are predicted for this
weekend, according to the National Weather Service.

   AETNA _ ATLANTA _ Aetna Inc., the biggest U.S. health insurer,
agreed to acquire Prudential HealthCare for $500 million in cash
and $500 million in debt, expanding its business in nine states.
The agreement adds 6.6 million people covered by Prudential,
boosting Aetna's health-benefit coverage to about 22.4 million and
making it the largest U.S. managed-care company. Aetna will also
become the largest provider of dental benefits, more than doubling
its dental coverage to more than 15 million people. (Miller,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   AUS-AETNA-BUYS-PRUDENTIAL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Aetna Inc. is buying
the healthcare business of Prudential Insurance Co. of America for
$1 billion in a deal that Aetna said will make it the nation's
biggest health benefit provider. It also would be the biggest
health insurer in Texas and in Central Texas, after Aetna's
previously announced purchase of NYLcare. Because both Aetna and
Prudential are already big in this area, the deal could face its
biggest hurdles from regulators in Texas. (Park, Austin

POWER STRUGGLE HAS THE FAR-RIGHT NATIONAL FRONT IN DISARRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nine months ago the National Front, for years the most
powerful far-right movement in Western Europe, turned French
politics upside down: It lured moderate conservatives into regional
political alliances that had previously been anathema.
</P>
<P>
   Now the party is in disarray after its leader, the irascible
Jean-Marie Le Pen, 70, threw out the man who was behind its drive
for right-wing respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Megret, the 49-year-old architect of the new policy, was
Le Pen's principal deputy until Wednesday, when he broke openly
with the party patriarch after months of subterranean dissension
and called for a special party convention in January to thrash out
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen then dismissed Megret, had bodyguards evict Megret
loyalists from their offices in the party's headquarters, in
suburban St.-Cloud, and said there would be no convention. He
charged that he had been the victim of ``subversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Megret, whose wife is the mayor of Vitrolles, on the outskirts
of Marseilles, countered, ``The National Front does not belong to
anyone.'' This in itself was considered an affront by Le Pen, who
founded the National Front in 1972 and has said, echoing an
aphorism of Louis XIV, ``I am the National Front.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen's plan to have his wife, Jeanne-Marie, lead the party's
ticket for next June's elections for the European Parliament if he
could not do so himself was opposed earlier this fall by Megret,
who thought that as Le Pen's deputy, he should step in. Le Pen
quickly countered that his wife would run if he wanted her to.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Versailles has convicted Le Pen of assaulting a
Socialist politician there who was running against his daughter
during French legislative elections last year, and suspended his
right to vote or run for office for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, another court reduced the sentence to one
year, suspended, but Le Pen has appealed to the highest court and
can run for office next spring if, as is almost certain, his appeal
is still pending then.
</P>
<P>
   A German court is also investigating him for describing the Nazi
gas chambers in World War II as ``a detail of history'' in a speech
in Munich, a possible violation of a German law that forbids
trivializing the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Megret said earlier this year that he could not deny that Le Pen
had said such things, but insisted that such views were not part of
the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, in a rare national television appearance recently, said
it was his opponents in the party who were racists, not him. He
added that he would indeed head the ticket next June, and that he
hoped it would win about 20 percent of the vote, placing 21 members
in the European Parliament to fight plans to submerge Europe's
nation states in federalism, instead of the 11 the party won in the
last elections, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen ran for the French presidency in 1995 and won 15 percent
of the vote, as the party does routinely nationwide. It had even
higher showings in suburbs of cities like Paris and Strasbourg,
where there are high concentrations of immigrants from Turkey and
North Africa, which the party platform promises to send back home
if it ever wins power.
</P>
<P>
   Until Megret and his moderate strategy came along, it seemed
unlikely that the National Front would ever run the country. But
Megret, a former Gaullist, succeeded last spring in getting
conservative leaders in five of the 22 regional assemblies to
accept support from the National Front to stay in power after the
Socialists gained ground in regional elections.

   The conservatives, who defied President Jacques Chirac and other
leaders, were later expelled from their own parties, which have
been trying to make a comeback ever since.

   Now it is the National Front that is at war with itself, with Le
Pen claiming victory Thursday over what he described as an
``attempted putsch'' and Megret saying he had enough support among
the party's 50,000 members to force the special convention he wants
to hold.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Bitterly cold air will remain locked in far northern Canada and
Alaska for the next several days as vigorous jet stream winds
continue to direct Pacific air masses into southern Canada.
Meanwhile, expansive high pressure will promote dry conditions over
much of the northern and central United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes from the northwest will deliver slightly colder
air to the New York and New England on Friday, but temperatures
will remain a few degrees above seasonal levels. A few snow showers
will dust the mountains of northern New England as well as areas
east of Lake Ontario, especially early Friday. Otherwise, partly to
mostly sunny skies will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   A warming trend will develop from the northern Plains to the
Great Lakes states. A weak front will produce patchy clouds near
the Canadian border. Otherwise, sunshine will be plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of rain will occur from eastern parts of Texas and
Oklahoma to the southern Mississippi Valley as low pressure moves
slowly east through the western Gulf of Mexico. Some patchy light
snow will fall in western Texas, but direr air will begin to spread
south through the panhandle Friday afternoon. Farther east, clouds
and few patchy showers will move through the Tennessee Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore winds will foster coastal showers and intermittent
mountain snow in the Northwest. After a cold dawn with patchy fog
and low clouds in the valleys of the interior Southwest, ample
sunshine will boost temperature to near seasonal readings in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Imitation Chill &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures fell into the single digits and, in some places,
below zero degrees in the Great Basin across parts of Nevada, Utah,
Idaho and southeast Oregon before dawn Thursday. But the deep
nocturnal chill was not the result of a frigid Arctic air mass.
Rather, it was an imitation chill that was manufactured by the
ground. At night, the ground lost much more infrared energy than it
gained from the clear, calm and dry atmosphere. In turn, the
rapidly cooling ground chilled overlying air. Moreover, cold air
drained down from mountains, setting the stage for a convincing
imitation chill. &QL;

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BABE: PIG IN THE CITY,' starring Magda Szubanski. Directed by
George Miller (G, 95 minutes). Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice
and twitchy pink snout, remains a cute little porker in this
elaborately ambitious sequel. But once he and his mistress head for
the city, they must contend with many discouraging urban sights,
including Mickey Rooney in a purple clown suit. And once he winds
up at the eccentric, creature-filled hotel that is the film's main
setting, the film turns rougher than its G rating suggests. Had
this ``Babe'' been made first, it wouldn't have prompted a sequel
of its own. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `A BUG'S LIFE,' featuring the voices of Dave Foley, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz,'' too. With the same anthropomorphism
that gave Lasseter's ``Toy Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued,
visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage
while also incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of
nature. And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial
expressions that make this type of animation more and more
invitingly lifelike all the time. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `CELEBRITY,' starring Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis and Melanie
Griffith. Directed by Woody Allen (R, 113 minutes). Following in
the footsteps of ``La Dolce Vita,'' Allen presents a New York in
which the only thing worse than being famous for nothing is not
being famous at all. At the center of it all he places Branagh as a
journalist with all the Allen tics but none of the filmmaker's
comic flair. The bitter breakup at the center of the film (with Ms.
Davis as the journalist's beached wife) is regularly upstaged by
guest-star segments, a few of which stand out in witty relief
against an otherwise weary backdrop. Charlize Theron dazzles as a
capricious, headstrong model, and Ms. Griffith plays a pampered
movie diva with aplomb. Best of all is Leonardo DiCaprio's brief,
wicked appearance as a bad-boy wonder. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `CENTRAL STATION,' starring Fernanda Montenegro and Vinicius de
Oliviera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this
quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths
with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for
sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all in the
telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark
on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in
search of the boy's father, Salles brings great tenderness and
surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms.
Montenegro's tough bravura performance is one of the year's very
best. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `DANCING AT LUGHNASA,' starring Meryl Streep. Directed by Pat
O'Connor (PG, 94 minutes). Ms. Streep is grand, as are the other
principals here, in an actors' heyday of a film adapted from Brian
Friel's delicate play. And if O'Connor has lost some of the play's
intensity by opening it up so overwhelmingly, he's also gained a
good deal in the way of lovely Irish scenery and quaint rural
charm. Set in 1936, the story presents a family of five unmarried
sisters on the brink of change and revolves around the return of
their gently eccentric brother from many years' missionary work in
Africa. Rather than major dramatic events, this beguilingly
atmospheric film observes the sea changes that alter these
characters' lives. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `ELIZABETH,' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Queen Elizabeth I
as a royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the monarch
as if her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled,
selecting consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the
hand. For all its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant
strife at the start of Elizabeth's reign, it's historical drama for
those whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on
spectacle, complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene
reminiscent of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the
queen as a glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a
super-intense case of having it all. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `ENEMY OF THE STATE,' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology wiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics add an
additional touch of class. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at the end of the year,
McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing the
gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the
aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener ( Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker. Directed by
Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than
his ``Welcome to the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan
filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion.
Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily to
``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloging this film's
perverse details: What emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the
dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness.
Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a
respected doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget.
(Janet Maslin)

&HT;        FOX HAS ONE MORE VOTE BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE: WHETHER TO
IMPEACH
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 -- Rep. Jon Fox may have been voted out of
office, but the Montgomery County Republican still has one last
vote to cast -- whether to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   How he'll vote, he said, he hasn't decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would end my tenure in Congress with a vote
like this. I am still listening to all of the evidence and haven't
made up mind,'' Fox said this week. ``I know voters expect me to be
fair minded.''
</P>
<P>
   While many members of Congress have already decided how they'll
vote, Fox is among a group of between 20 to 30 ``swing''
Republicans and Democrats, whose undecided votes could determine
the president's future.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee almost certain to approve at
least one article of impeachment against Clinton, a vote in the
full House is expected late next week. And, despite his narrow loss
to Democrat Joseph Hoeffel, Fox's term does not expire until the
first week of January.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many hold-outs, weighing whether to be loyal to their
party or to the more moderate voters who elected them, Fox can vote
on the controversial issue and then leave office without ever
facing the voters again.
</P>
<P>
   Fox says that doesn't make his vote any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have been reelected and know I was returning to
office,'' said Fox, a former assistant district attorney in
Montgomery County. ``I don't think being an outgoing member would
help someone vote their gut feeling and be done with it. I think
everyone has to evaluate and vote fairly. It is their
constitutional obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was defeated in 1992 in his first run for Congress, elected
in 1994 and reelected in 1996 by 84 votes. A self described
``independent Republican,'' Fox, during the 1998 campaign, always
said he would consider the evidence against Clinton and not
pre-judge the outcome. Hoeffel, however, said early on that he
would support a congressional censure against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel, who is out of town and could not be reached for comment
on Fox's pending vote, won by more than 9,000 votes.

 UNDATED: (Janet Maslin) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `HOME FRIES,' starring Drew Barrymore. Directed by Dean Parisot
(PG-13, 105 minutes). An absurdist satire of sex, sibling rivalry,
Oedipal ties, homicidal jealousy, fast food and helicopters in the
American heartland, ``Home Fries'' isn't funny enough in its
particulars to make you break up laughing, but at least it tries
for a sophistication beyond the typical gross-out Hollywood comedy.
Most of the humor comes from the collision of caricatures that
suggest refugees from ``Tobacco Road,'' reinvented for a '90s
version of the parodic '70s soap opera ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman.'' Ms. Barrymore, who is winsome throughout, plays a very
pregnant server at a burger outlet who falls in love with the
stepson of her recently deceased married lover. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `LITTLE VOICE,' starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn, Ewan
McGregor and Michael Caine. Directed by Mark Herman (R, 99
minutes). The main attraction here is watching wispy Ms. Horrocks
put on a spectacular one-woman diva festival, with her phenomenal
mimicry of musical grande dames from Judy Garland to Marilyn
Monroe. What works less well is the broad and stagy story built
around her. As the timid title character, she is harangued by her
blowsy mother (Ms. Blethyn), latched onto by the talent agent who
is the mother's boyfriend ( Caine) and courted by a nice young man
who loves his pet pigeons. In that last role, McGregor makes a
telephone installer scintillating and once again shows that he can
do anything. Incidentally, the soundtrack is divine. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `MEET JOE BLACK,' starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire
Forlani. Directed by Martin Brest (PG-13, 170 minutes). Hopkins
zestily plays a noble tycoon in this otherwise somnolent,
emotion-free, nearly three-hour (!) weepie. And Pitt appears
blankly as Death with blond highlights, serving as a kind of
personal afterlife trainer to the tycoon, whose number is up. Ms.
Forlani plays the big man's beautiful daughter in a story based on
``Death Takes a Holiday.'' In a suffocatingly lavish film that
cries out for a trip to the cutting room, virtually every character
is allowed to overstay his or her welcome, with Pitt especially
diminished by the watching-paint-dry pace. The story drags on so
slowly that there's room for a subplot about party planning, and
several scenes establish how much Death loves peanut butter. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PSYCHO,' starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. Directed by Gus
Van Sant (R, 100 minutes). It turns out that the apparent rocks in
Van Sant's head, as he contrived this near-exact color replica of
Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic, were only pebbles. His remake (a
modest term, but it beats plagiarism) is artful and good-looking,
faltering only when it tries to improve on the brilliant original
blueprint. The casting of Vaughn as Norman Bates is the film's
biggest Achilles' heel, since the performance Hitchcock elicited
from Anthony Perkins remains an impossible act to follow. Still,
Van Sant has tried an outlandish experiment and come up with what
are, especially for fans of the original, intriguing variations on
a theme. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `VERY BAD THINGS,' starring Jon Favreau, Christian Slater,
Cameron Diaz and Daniel Stern. Directed by Peter Berg (R, 100
minutes). A film that means to make the most of black-humored
misanthropy had better be funnier than this mirthless exercise in
witlessness and sadistic humor. Five dull middle-class buddies
accidentally kill a prostitute while at a bachelor party in Las
Vegas, and that's only the beginning of the fun. While it's
possible to share the screenplay's eagerness to see these
unappetizing guys wind up dead, the direction reveals so little
point of view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies. Ms.
Diaz, so cleverly funny in ``There's Something About Mary,'' plays
a wedding-obsessed ninny this time. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `WAKING NED DEVINE,' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly and
Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings, and unite the town's cast
of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning career
directing television commercials means that everyone here is an
amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian
stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're
worth. This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The Full
Monty,'' but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of
elderly gentlemen in the buff. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE WATERBOY,' starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates and Fairuza
Balk. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG-13, 91 minutes). The team behind
``The Wedding Singer'' looks like honorary Farrelly brothers with a
comedy that, like ``There's Something About Mary,'' is both
cheerfully outlandish and genuinely endearing. Sandler plays an
amazing 31-year-old freshman who morphs from water-distribution
engineer to sports hero, and he succeeds in doing to football
whatever he did to golf in ``Happy Gilmore.'' There's a lot more
innocence to his happy-idiot antics here than there is in many a
film made specifically for children. Ms. Bates is a great hoot as
the waterboy's overprotective mama, perfectly in tune with the
film's sneaky sense of fun. (Janet Maslin)

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 14 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK (Monday Night)
</P>
<P>
   Jets (9-4) at Dolphins (9-4)
</P>
<P>
   Miami has been impressive at home, especially on defense,
allowing 6.7 points a game. Overall, Miami has allowed a league-low
14.2 points a game. Another good omen for the Dolphins: Quarterback
Dan Marino has thrown for more yards (7,820) and touchdowns (68)
against the Jets than any other team. But New York has the
second-best offense in the American Football Conference and Miami's
offense is average. The Jets can easily score 25 points against any
defense, because quarterback Vinny Testaverde is hot. He is 9-1 as
a Jets starter and has a conference-high 22 touchdown passes. Look
for Testaverde to pass for more than 300 yards. The only catch for
the Jets: The key players Keith Byars (arm) and Aaron Glenn (ankle)
are doubtful and questionable, respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 31-17
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals (6-7) at Eagles (3-10)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's playoff hopes may have been destroyed in a crushing
loss to the Giants last week; no one is sure how Arizona will react
against Philadelphia. Will the Cardinals be able to erase the loss,
or will it plague them? Making Arizona's job easier is the fact
that Philadelphia is struggling. It may have the worst offense in
the league, and although the Eagles held Arizona to 129 yards
passing in Week 3, quarterback Jake Plummer has improved. Look for
him to throw for 250 yards and running back Adrian Murrell to rush
for 100.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals, 30-14
</P>
<P>
   Falcons (11-2) at Saints (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta can match its club record for victories, set in 1980.
The Falcons have scored 353 points, and are on pace for a
club-record 434. In 10 of its games, Atlanta has 300 or more yards
of offense. When quarterback Chris Chandler is healthy, the Falcons
may have the third-best offense in the league behind Minnesota and
Denver. But they will face a very confident Saints defense this
week. New Orleans held Dallas to 8 yards rushing last week, a
shocking number for a great offensive line and top back like Emmitt
Smith. New Orleans will keep the Falcons from scoring 30 points,
but Atlanta is too good, and the Falcons honestly believe they have
a shot at home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, 21-19
</P>
<P>
   Bears (3-10) at Packers (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   The refrain coming from the Packers these days is, ``Go ahead,
doubt us, but we're still dangerous.'' Yet losing to a struggling
Tampa Bay team on Monday night was one of the low points for Green
Bay this season. They have a lot of issues to resolve for the
playoffs, like finding a consistent running game. The problem with
the Bears is that they don't present a legitimate threat to the
Packers in any form _ on paper. The Bears are confident against
Green Bay and even they don't know exactly why. This game is a
repeat of their most recent meeting, last season, in which Green
Bay won by just 1 point after Chicago failed to convert on a
game-winning 2-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 17-14
</P>
<P>
   Bengals (2-11) at Colts (2-11)
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has been one of the most disappointing teams in
football, and Coach Bruce Coslet will probably be fired at season's
end. On his way out the door, he will get his first loss as the
Bengals' coach in four games at the RCA Dome. Peyton Manning is hot
right now, and the Falcons barely beat him last week, while
Cincinnati did not put up much of a fight against Buffalo. Manning
has taken every snap this year (808 plays), has 21 touchdown passes
and needs just two more to break the rookie record of the former
Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 28-21
</P>
<P>
   Broncos (13-0) at Giants (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos feel almost invincible. By beating the Giants, they
can both match the 1972 Miami Dolphins, who finished the regular
season 14-0, and win a league-record 19th straight game. In their
last two games the Broncos have not looked pretty, and expect this
game to be more of the same. Look for the Giants to double-team
tight end Shannon Sharpe, and for defensive end Michael Strahan to
have three sacks. That will keep the game close, but these Broncos
win because this is a special season for them and when they want to
be, they are unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 31-21
</P>
<P>
   Patriots (8-5) at Rams (3-10)
</P>
<P>
   New England has jumped right back into the playoff race because
quarterback Drew Bledsoe has taken the team on his back. The
Patriots may be the most dangerous team in the AFC East right now,
especially because they are starting to get back their injured
offensive players. There is little chance that they lose to the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 31-10
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (7-6) at Bills (8-5)
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that a game features four Heisman Trophy winners:
Tim Brown, Desmond Howard, Charles Woodson and Doug Flutie. OK,
Howard isn't in the same stratosphere as the rest of his Heisman
buddies, but Brown, Woodson and Flutie are all critical players for
their teams. One might think the key to this game is Flutie against
a very good Raiders defense, but really it is the Oakland offense
against the Buffalo defense. There have been remarks by opposing
teams that the Raiders' offense has become predictable. The Bills
get the victory because they are predictably tough at home.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 20-14
</P>
<P>
   Steelers (7-6) at Buccaneers (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   The team that loses this game is basically out of the playoff
picture. The Steelers are coming off a bad loss to New England,
while the Buccaneers beat Green Bay last Monday night. That victory
reenergized the Buccaneers' season. Take Tampa Bay in this one,
because the Buccaneers are playing at home (Tampa Bay is 5-2 at
Raymond James Stadium) and because the Steelers still have not
found a way to cure their offensive ills.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, 26-14
</P>
<P>
   Oilers (7-6) at Jaguars (10-3)
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell will miss the
remainder of the regular season _ at least _ with a severe ankle
sprain. This totally changes the complexion of the Jaguars, because
Brunell is so critical to their offense. Jacksonville's 37-22
victory over Detroit was actually closer than it seems; it took 10
fourth-quarter points to put some room between Jacksonville and the
Lions. Will it be enough for the Jaguars to simply hand off the
ball to running back Fred Taylor 25 times? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers, 28-27
</P>
<P>
   Redskins (4-9) at Panthers (2-11)
</P>
<P>
   Redskins quarterback Trent Green is suddenly hot, though it's
about, oh, six weeks too late. Green has 12 touchdowns and only 2
interceptions in his last six games. He is the reason the Redskins
are in a mini-winning streak, last week beating the hapless San
Diego Chargers for their second victory in a row. Carolina plans on
blitzing Green crazy with a Greene of its own, linebacker Kevin
Greene, tied for second in the NFL with 14 sacks. Not enough for
the Panthers, who need to add more offensive weapons in the off
season.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 13-7
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Chargers (5-8) at Seahawks (6-7)
</P>
<P>
   If the league decided to hold a vote on instant replay tomorrow,
Seattle Coach Dennis Erickson would be first in line, holding up a
card with ``Yes'' on it. Because of the terrible call on Vinny
Testaverde's quarterback sneak last week, the Seahawks are in a
tremendous hole in terms of getting to the playoffs. They could
have defeated the Jets, improved to 7-6 and, since they will beat
the Chargers, been 8-6 after this weekend. Erickson might have won
the last two and saved his job. Now he's in trouble, but this week,
he gets a respite because San Diego, while allowing the fewest
yards in the NFL, offers little challenge offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks, 27-16
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys (8-5) at Chiefs (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   Dallas can clinch its sixth division title in the 1990's with a
victory over the Chiefs and an Arizona loss. The Cowboys were the
toast of the division until that bizarre 22-3 loss to New Orleans
last week. Look for the Chiefs to try to duplicate, at least in
some form, the defense the Saints used, which featured lots of
stunts on the line and run blitzing to shut down the running game.
The problem is, Dallas' Chan Gailey is a smart offensive coach and
won't be fooled twice. He will make some adjustments and get Dallas
back on track. How much the Cowboys win by depends on whether Deion
Sanders, nursing a toe injury, plays. He is listed as questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 30-22
</P>
<P>
   Vikings (12-1) at Ravens (5-8)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota can clinch home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs with a victory and an Atlanta loss. This could be a
dangerous game for the Vikings. In addition to Baltimore being able
to score some points, the Vikings are beat up. Wide receiver Jake
Reed (back) and running back Robert Smith (knee) will not play.
Wide receiver Cris Carter is questionable with a pulled calf, but
will most likely play. Still, with all the danger for Minnesota,
they still have quarterback Randall Cunningham and wide receiver
Randy Moss. Cunningham has passed for 708 yards and 8 touchdowns
the last two games and Moss has 14 touchdowns this season. They are
proving too much for any team.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 38-20
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Lions (5-8) at 49ers (10-3)
</P>
<P>
   League scouts say that one of the better performances put on by
a quarterback in the second half of the season has been by Batch.
In a downtrodden year for the Lions, Batch is a bright spot for the
future. But right now, Detroit is staring at a loss. San Francisco,
a playoff berth already in its pocket, believes it can still catch
the Falcons for the division title, as remote as that seems. That
belief keeps the 49ers hungry, and the Lions are the next meal.
</P>
<P>
   49ers, 30-14

BRIDGET FONDA TALKS ABOUT LOVE AND MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanies FILM-ASIMPLEPLAN-TEX) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda, looking poised and businesslike at the head of a
nearly empty conference table, is musing about how her latest film
_ the violent, downbeat ``A Simple Plan'' _ qualifies as a
Christmas movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, all that snow,'' she says. ``And greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of greed. ``Plan'' is about how the discovery of $4.4
million in cash changes _ for the worse _ the lives of a handful of
people. Fonda plays Sarah, the wife of Hank Mitchell (Fort Worth's
Bill Paxton), the respected small-town accountant who stumbles onto
the money along with his slovenly brother, Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton), and Jacob's low-life friend Lou (Brent Briscoe).
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Scott B. Smith, who adapted his 1993 novel, saw a
hierarchy in the characters, with Sarah at the top _ she's the one
who begins driving the more weak-willed Hank. But although Sarah
becomes the most ruthless of the bunch, Fonda says that there's
more to her than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a survival-instinct kind of ruthless,'' the 34-year-old
actress says. ``You really start to feel where (Hank) didn't
realize how much she'd sacrificed and what she really wanted. She's
a complicated, but very good and fair, caring, loving person. She
doesn't want to hurt people. But she's fierce. And that comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan'' isn't the first Fonda film to address greed; in 1994's
``It Could Happen to You,'' she played a waitress who is far more
altruistic than Sarah after she receives a $2 million tip from
Nicolas Cage's lottery-winning cop. They are a small part of a
long-standing tradition of greed in the movies _ and we're not
talking about the business, but the plots. Fonda says she believes
that lately, the theme is often that no good will come of money,
and she thinks she knows where that sentiment comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general discontent that's bred by advertising,'' she
says. ``The consumer society in general feeds your dreams of all
you want to do and want to have. And you get to a point where I
guess you can only be frustrated for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Fonda was best-known as Peter Fonda's
daughter. Now, despite a career resurgence that began with last
year's ``Ulee's Gold,'' he's just as likely to be referred to as
``Bridget Fonda's dad.'' Credit that to her hard work: In 11 years,
she has appeared in nearly 30 films, from a notorious scene in
1988's ``Aria'' (in her vignette, she appears nude, makes love and
then slits her wrists) to a noteworthy turn as a stoned-out beach
bunny in last year's ``Jackie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the younger Fonda worked with ``Plan'' director
Sam Raimi, with a small role in his ``Army of Darkness.'' The rest
of ``Plan's'' lead cast had its own history. Paxton and Thornton
co-starred in 1992's ``One False Move;'' Briscoe appeared in
Thornton's ``Sling Blade.'' Fonda says that it wasn't a boys' club,
however; she and the other cast members hit it off right away. She
plays most of her scenes with Paxton and says they were a good
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He, like me, gets really excited about it,'' she says. ``And
knowing the limited amount of time that we had to get across what
we wanted to about this couple, we wound up spending a lot of time
together talking about it, enjoying it. Enjoying what we knew might
not be able to be fulfilled, necessarily, with the time
constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   According to most reviews, they achieved fulfillment. Even
lukewarm reviews praise Thornton's performance, which is receiving
Oscar buzz, and some people say Paxton is also an Oscar contender.
Fonda had one advantage over both, though: She played all of her
scenes indoors. The book's plot is based in Ohio, but because of
unseasonably warm temperatures, the production was moved to
Wisconsin, right off of Lake Superior, where the wind-chill factor
was sometimes 60 below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, a California girl, isn't used to such temperatures. She's
more used to life in LA, where she spends her spare time watching
older movies (especially '40s and '50s film noir) and just hanging
out. But don't count on her to just hang out anywhere for too long.
As much as it is about greed, ``A Simple Plan'' is also about fate
_ and Fonda says she enjoys courting fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living safe can become so stagnant,'' she says. ``It's part of
that whole `nothing ventured, nothing gained' theory. There's more
to it, I think, in that it's better to attempt and fail than to do
nothing. Because some kind of movement forward or backward is
better than no movement. Because whenever you can tempt fate, at
least you're active.''

 VIRGINIA BEAHAN AND LAURA McPHEE: INTRIGUINGLY OFF-BALANCE(lb) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Color landscape photography, pressed into service to
sell everything from calendars and cigarettes to postcards and
environmental causes, is usually not subversive. But the work of
Virginia Beahan and Laura McPhee is subtly, slyly that.
</P>
<P>
   Using an old-fashioned Deardorff view camera with an
8-by-10-inch format, this photographic team produces detailed and
powerfully cinematic images that in enlargements are viscerally
appealing. But once the photographers have your attention, they
seem to make you look hard at the pictures because something is
almost always off balance.
</P>
<P>
   A tree takes center stage against a white sky in a 1995 image
from Carbon Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains of California.
Below the tree are a profusion of delicate yellow wildflowers and
some bushes with red flowers; in the distance, misty brown and
green mountain slopes dotted with houses. In the foreground is the
concrete foundation of a burned house. As though bearing mute
witness to the tragedy, the nearby tree, which looks as though it
has been burned black, stands like a spectral sentinel, its
unusually bushy branches a metaphoric widow's shroud.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguingly off-kilter work of Ms. Beahan and Ms. McPhee,
who each won a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation fellowship in 1993
for their collaborative work, appears in ``No Ordinary Land,''
published by Aperture ($35), with an afterword by Ms. McPhee's
father, the writer John McPhee.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the book's publication, Aperture's Burden
Gallery in Chelsea is exhibiting more than three dozen of the
team's photographs, a number of which are also at the Laurence
Miller Gallery in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen pictures, some different from those at Burden and
much more tightly focused, the show at the Laurence Miller packs a
wicked punch.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ms. Beahan and Ms. McPhee achieve the strikingly
unorthodox by positioning their camera and tripod in such a way
that the picture is an aggregate of almost impossible parts.
</P>
<P>
   In the strangely Hopperesque ``Kaihalulu Beach, Kauiki, Maui''
(1996), a shot taken from above, the focus of the left half is the
small standing figure of a woman in a swimsuit who is holding a
baby and not looking out to sea but sideways, at something out of
the camera's range.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind her on a smooth, chocolate-brown beach is a rumpled
beach towel. At her feet, water glides in and swirls dreamily
around the beach. But looming in front of her and forming a
ferocious barrier between her and the deep blue sea is a row of
tall, jagged black rocks, against which the sea crashes, leaving
behind white foaming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windmills and Brush Fire, Coachella Valley, Calif.'' (1995) is
similarly divided into wildly contrasted segments. In the
foreground are the forever-shifting, sensuous sand dunes. Beyond
the dunes and on flat ground is a bristling forest of tall
windmills. And beyond them are blue hills over which hang a thick
white haze and the leavings of a brush fire spewing black smoke
into a blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Lagoon'' (1988), taken at a geothermal hot-water
pumping station in Iceland, looks like the epitome of the
industrial degradation of the environment. In the foreground is a
pleasant, almost postcard-pretty scene of children and adults in
the pale blue water. Beyond the sea and the swimmers is a bank of
heavy-duty machines, many emitting plumes of white smoke. Behind
this seeming industrial inferno are blackish mountains, above which
are heavy white clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But in an added twist on a scene that looks dreadful but is
actually benign and beneficial, an assortment of chimneys play a
kind of woodwind movement on the theme of smoke. Three thin
chimneys attached to gleaming towers are like trilling piccolos.
Next to them are a pair of thicker tall chimneys, the oboes,
releasing deeper tones. To the right of the image are the bassoons,
two boxy constructions letting off fulsome sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Beahan-McPhee collaboration began in 1987 when the friends
traveled to Iceland to photograph what Ms. McPhee described as an
apocalyptic landscape. They had started with two Deardorff cameras
and two sets of other camera equipment. But after several days of
traveling and working together, they realized they were
collaborating in their picture-taking. And they have been working
mostly as a team ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Each also continues to work on separate projects, mainly in
black and white, Ms. McPhee photographing her family and Ms. Beahan
concentrating on still lifes and portraits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Occasionally, the team has taken some so-so pictures: of a
sleeping Buddha or terraced tea plantations in Sri Lanka, urban
graffiti in New Jersey, and the artificial volcano at the Mirage
Hotel in Las Vegas. But most of the time they catch the stunningly
surreal.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lava Monolith With Antenna'' (1994), taken in Italy, a
black rock rears out of the water like some fantastical Loch Ness
monster, its foreboding presence heightened by the golden glow of
sea and sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiling Mud Pot With Headlights'' (1988), taken in Iceland and
shown only at the Burden Gallery, probably offers the most
delightful surprise. At first glance one sees a forbidding
moonscape, a yawning hole in the foreground that seems to have
mysteriously appeared out of blue ash. In the distance is a
rock-strewn brown ridge. What is the off element here? Perched
unobtrusively on the horizon, against a hazy sky, are the hazy
outlines of a car, its headlights on.

   THE BURT REYNOLDS FILE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Born: Feb. 11, 1936 in Lansing, Mich. The family moved to
Rivera Beach, Fla., when he was about 9.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The FSU football connection: He played halfback at Florida
State University and suffered a knee injury his sophomore year. At
Christmastime 1955 he was in a car accident and a passerby,
assuming he was dead, robbed him. Reynolds then quit football and
FSU.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The acting bug: Studied theater and eventually was spotted by
Joanne Woodward who recommended him to an agent. In the late '50s
he got TV parts on ``Twilight Zone'' and ``Riverboat,'' eventually
being fired from the latter. One big break came in 1962 on
``Gunsmoke,'' playing a half-breed blacksmith named Quint Asper.
The role _ and his eventual relationship with Dinah Shore _
ultimately led to appearances on Johnny Carson's ``The Tonight
Show,'' lead roles in TV's ``Hawk'' and ``Dan August'' and films.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The women: Among them were Judy Carne (whom he married in 1963
and divorced), Shore (19 years his senior), Sally Field, Loni
Anderson and his current squeeze Pam Seals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Among roles and films he reportedly turned down: James Bond,
``MASH,'' ``One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,'' ``Terms of
Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Awards: Golden Globe and Emmy in 1991 for TV's ``Evening
Shade.'' Golden Globe and Oscar nomination this year for ``Boogie
Nights.''

 &HT;    A few hits and outright misses from Burt Reynolds film career
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Deliverance'' (1972) _ Aiming straight with a bow and arrow,
Reynolds leads Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox on a Georgia
rafting adventure that turns deadly. Reynolds agrees ``without a
doubt'' it was his role of a lifetime. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) _ He's understated but electric as a
porno film director showing Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) the ropes.
The film brought him his only Oscar nomination. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Longest Yard'' (1974) _ Hugely popular, overtly physical
prison yarn with Reynolds leading an inmate football team against
the guards. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Starting Over'' (1979) _ The late director Alan J. Pakula
took a chance casting Reynolds as a lonely divorced man. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Smokey and the Bandit'' (1977) _ Reynolds was adamant about
casting Sally ``The Flying Nun'' Field as a runaway bride to his
fast-driving, smooth-talking CB-radio beer smuggler. It ignited
their three-year off-screen relationship. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sharky's Machine'' (1981) _ Made in Atlanta, Reynolds
directed and played a hard-nosed vice cop. The film's budget
apparently ensured an unlimited supply of bullets. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``City Heat'' (1984) _ He teamed with Clint Eastwood in a
lackluster 1930s-era gangster comedy. Reynolds maintains a stunt
injury in this film led to his dependence on a painkiller with a
resultant weight loss that sparked false rumors he had AIDS. Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' (1989) _ He voiced, naturally, the
canine hero in a rather lame, nearly forgettable animated musical.
Perk up your ears and you'll also hear Loni Anderson. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cannonball Run'' (1981) _ Reynolds and his misguided
six-pack of un-Sinatralike pals (Dom DeLuise and Bert Convy among
them) race cars for little reason. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``At Long Last Love'' (1975) _ Singing and tap dancing with
Cybill Shepherd in Peter Bogdanovich's painful-to-watch musical.
Grade: F

 &HT;    Burt's back in familiar role as a
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it looks like Burt Reynolds is about to finally shed
that nagging image of a hardboiled, gun-toting, past-his-prime
go-getter, here he is at 62, pistol in hand, running and running
and running. Isn't this the guy who stunned much of Hollywood with
a searing acting performance last year as a porn director in the
critically acclaimed ``Boogie Nights''? If it wasn't for ``Good
Will Hunting's'' Robin Williams, wouldn't Reynolds now be holding
an Oscar instead of the pump-action rifle he grips in the final
scenes of TNT's ``Hard Time''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe yes. Maybe no.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Needham, who directed Reynolds in such disco-era fast-wheels
films as the immensely popular ``Smokey and the Bandit'' and the
immensely bad ``The Cannonball Run,'' says he and Buddy, as close
friends call Reynolds, share the same flaw _ ``We're both addicted
to adrenalin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``True. Very true,'' Reynolds says, calling recently from a Los
Angeles hotel to promote ``Hard Time,'' which debuts at 8 p.m.
E.S.T. Sunday on TNT. ``We both forget that we're not 30 anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is quick to admit where his performance passion lies.
Is it the high he gets from the knockout acting job of coaching
Dirk Diggler in ``Boogie Nights'' or picking up that pump-action
rifle and dueling with bad cops?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a close call,'' Reynolds says. ``I suppose if I was
smart I'd pick the straight-out acting. But, truly, it is the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what viewers will see if they tune in to ``Hard
Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds also directs the film, one of three ``Hard Time''
movies he's made for TNT. The second airs in February with the
third slated for later in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The directing gig is one of two promises Reynolds made to
himself after getting an Oscar nomination this year for the
independent film ``Boogie Nights.'' Reynolds, sometimes openly
bitter about past run-ins with Hollywood executives and the media,
is quite relaxed and polite this day during his phone call to plug
``Hard Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you step through how ``Hard Time'' and this three-picture
deal with TNT came about?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I talked with (executive producer) Larry Levinson, it
was a western called ``Hard Ground.'' I was attracted to the
character in terms of how he pushed the envelope. How in pushing,
how rough he was and whether the audience could forgive him for
that.
</P>
<P>
   As for TNT, it's very hard out here in Hollywood to get an
answer from most studios. With Ted Turner it was like ``OK'' and a
handshake. Q: ``Hard Time's'' got a lot of what you'd call classic
Burt Reynolds deadpan humor. Was stuff like that in the original
script or did you work that in?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I did work that in. When you have baggage like I have
with (Charles) Durning, it's like it would be dumb for, say, Walter
Matthau in a film with Jack Lemmon to say, ``I love you.'' With
Durning, I knew we brought that. I wanted to play dark humor and
sarcasm and have fun with him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your lifetime, who's the sexier co-star? Catherine Deneuve
or Charles Durning?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's close. Maybe more in love with Durning. But Deneuve's
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You still swear off marriage?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm trying. But they're closing in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You did a lot for Georgia making all those films here. You
visit Atlanta much? See any changes?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been a long time. Too long. I have so many friends
there. I think it's gotten like out here _ $1 million fixer-uppers,
you know. I had so many great times there. It was my good luck
state. Those films were such huge hits for me. I had the best time
making ``Sharky's Machine'' right in downtown Atlanta. Couldn't do
it today. Couldn't have access to that many buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Just one thing about the Oscars. What happened after it was
over, later that night?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I didn't win and went back to the hotel, I ordered some
soup or something. I'm just watching an old movie. The door was
pushed open. This French guy came in and started talking to me
about the soup. I look up. It's Jon Voight _ in the entire waiter's
outfit with a black bow tie. We sat there laughing until about 2 in
the morning. It was so sweet of him to think of me on that night.
He knew. It was the best joke.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The $100 ticket is back.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Azenberg, producer of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' starring
Kevin Spacey, said this week that orchestra seats for the
ballyhooed revival, which opens in April at the Brooks Atkinson
Theater, would go for a single crisp C-note. Other tickets will go
for $50, and 100 seats for each performance will cost $20.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty price stems from the show's length, Azenberg said. At
four hours, ``Iceman'' will require overtime for backstage staff;
the length has also limited the number of weekly performances to
seven, as opposed to the Broadway standard of eight, cutting
revenue. The show's set, by Bob Crowley, will also require
producers to lose about 100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The price also reflects the modern economics of Broadway. The
show will cost $1.5 million to mount, and about $225,000 a week to
run. Even paying the 19-member cast Equity minimum _ Spacey will
make only $1,100 a week _ the producers need to make a profit of at
least $100,000 to break even over the limited 12-week run. ``This
is expensive, and it has a short life,'' Azenberg said. ``I can't
be accused of trying to make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Broadway play to reach the $100 mark was ``Nicholas
Nickleby'' in 1981. ``Miss Saigon'' also had $100 tickets during
its first year, and a few shows now offer equally expensive
packages, with amenities like champagne at preshow receptions.
</P>
<P>
   TRAGEDY'S HAPPY TURN
</P>
<P>
   Before a review runs or a bottle of opening-night champagne
flows, the producers of ``The Blue Room,'' the scantily clad David
Hare drama at the Cort Theater, can declare themselves in
possession of the season's first unqualified hit.
</P>
<P>
   With the play's star, Nicole Kidman, on the cover of Newsweek,
advance sales topped $4 million this week, an almost unheard-of
figure for a straight play. About 95 percent of the 10-week run is
sold out, with the only tickets remaining in the second balcony,
and after Jan. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But if the reason for the ``Blue Room'' mania is transparent, a
more traditional success story was brewing at the Barrymore
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by strong reviews last Friday in The New York Times, The
New York Post and elsewhere, ``Electra'' had $305,000 in ticket
sales that day alone. The day before, the show took in a a measly
$22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The box office continued to hum, and by Thursday producers were
predicting their tally for the week would top $1 million. Not bad
for a play with a small Broadway budget of $800,000 and weekly
running costs of about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said doing Greek tragedy on Broadway is absolutely
mad,'' said Eric Krebs, one of the play's producers. ``And it is.
But everything has fallen into place.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has inspired talk of an extension for the show and
of Tonys for the cast, which is led by Zoe Wanamaker. Krebs said
the show was very likely to extend past its scheduled Jan. 17
close, though he would not say for how long.
</P>
<P>
   One complication is that the Barrymore, owned by the Shubert
Organization, is expected to welcome another play, ``The Visitor,''
in February. But this week, that show's star, Eli Wallach, said he
was uncertain about its prospects this season. ``I don't even know
what's going on, and I'm in it,'' Wallach said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said
Wednesday that he was committed to ``The Visitor,'' but stopped
short of confirming its run in the Barrymore. As for ``Electra,''
Schoenfeld said it would have a home.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Krebs said he'd talked to Schoenfeld about other Shubert
theaters. And if the ``Visitor'' is postponed, ``Electra'' could
conceivably extend at the Barrymore until late March, when the
producers of another David Hare play, ``Amy's View,'' hope to move
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet where it will be,'' Krebs said. ``But it
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   ROUNDABOUT SOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout Theater will soon inform subscribers that the
last show of the season will be a non-Roundabout production:
``Death of a Salesman,'' the Goodman Theater revival opening on
Feb. 10 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The subscribers had been expecting a revival of ``Sweet Bird of
Youth,'' opening in June. But Ellen Richard, general manager of the
Roundabout, said the show was canceled because of the uncertainty
surrounding the company's current home at the Criterion Center,
which was scheduled to be the site of a new building for Random
House.
</P>
<P>
   That deal unraveled earlier this week, but Ms. Richard said the
Roundabout had decided to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being conservative rather than risk there being a big
problem and us trying to desperately find a theater,'' she said.
``Plus we think it's a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater will pay more than $1 million to the producers of
``Salesman'' for 40,000 tickets for its members, said Ms. Richard.
</P>
<P>
   PULL UP THE SOCKS!
</P>
<P>
   As erotic as the undressing and dressing may be onstage in ``The
Blue Room,'' the action backstage is considerably less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic,'' said Iain Glen, who like his co-star, Ms. Kidman,
plays five characters. ``A hysterical personality change in 30
seconds flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The play requires four costume changes for each actor, a device
complicated by the much-hyped nude scenes. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Alyce Gilbert, the wardrobe supervisor, explained that because
the actors took their clothes off onstage, they had to forgo
traditional quick change tricks like Velcro ``zippers'' and shirts
sewn into jackets, because they would be visible to an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be real,'' Ms. Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   But this makes for some fumbling with cumbersome fastenings.
When Glen, for example, exits as the character of the playwright to
change into the politician, off goes the frumpy sweater, shirt,
pants, socks, shoes, underwear. (Not always in that order.) And on
comes the slick slacks, silk boxers, designer shoes and socks,
shirt, tie, jacket and wristwatch. Oh, yes, and a new hair style.
All in about 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Glen, the bigger test is the psychological quick
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always taught about preparation and such,'' said Glen,
36, a Scotsman who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.
``But in those moments, it's a free fall.''

MARKET PLACE: THE LINGERING COMMODITY PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The recent drop in the price of oil and natural gas
and the continuing decline of other commodity prices at year's end
is putting renewed pressure on many of the emerging-market
countries at the center of this year's global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the world's most troubled nations _ economically,
politically or both _ depend on the sale of commodities for a major
part of their economic growth and government revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at a list of oil exporters: Russia, Venezuela, Mexico,
Ecuador, Algeria, Nigeria and Indonesia. All these countries, and
others, are getting less from commodities, whether it is oil,
copper, platinum or zinc.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that the markets haven't sensed how seriously this
can be for the global economy,'' said Lawrence Brainard, head of
emerging-market research at Chase Securities. ``I think it is a
sleeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensifying commodity problem is expected to lead to bigger
bond defaults in Russia and _ at a minimum _ sharp budget-cutting
in many Latin American and other nations, which could aggravate
political uncertainty. In addition, growth will slow in a world
that, outside the United States and Europe, is already in a
recession or on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity prices have been one of the two key conduits for
transmitting the Asian financial crisis around the world. The other
has been stock markets, which have gotten more attention from
investors. Lower commodity prices are mostly seen as a boon for
investors, reducing costs on gasoline, heating oil, natural gas,
food and many manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
   The stock markets in many of the troubled countries are
rebounding now, after central bank interest-rate cuts in the United
States and Europe and an International Monetary Fund rescue package
for Brazil helped calm investor fears of a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   But the worldwide demand that is needed to turn commodity prices
around is not showing up. Two closely followed commodity indexes _
the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and the Commodity Research
Bureau/Bridge index _ are at their lowest levels in more than two
decades. Commodities are so weak that Citigroup may sell its
commodity business, Phibro Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the 10-month slide in commodity prices that began in
the fall of 1997 _ when the effects of the Asian crisis first hit
the United States _ was steeper and more damaging than the second
wave of declines that began in mid-November. From October 1997
until the end of August this year, the Commodity Research index
plunged 21 percent, then leveled off. But since Nov. 12 it has
dropped almost 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What worries analysts now is that the recent decline is a signal
that prices will not turn around soon.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Sagers, director of the energy service of Planecon, a
consulting group specializing in the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, said the consensus on oil prices ``is that we are
going to be here for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brainard and other analysts argue that an extended period of
lost economic growth and lower governmental revenues that stem from
the drop in commodity prices will raise the pressure on many
already troubled governments and economies. That could intensify
investor concern and weaken currencies. To defend those currencies,
central banks would have to raise their interest rates _ which
would mean even slower growth.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Russia, for example, has been stark. The country's
$87 billion in 1997 exports included $21.9 billion in oil, $16.4
billion in gas and $14 billion in metals _ about 60 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of every one of these commodities have fallen
sharply and are still declining. The price of platinum, for which
Russia is the second major supplier, has dropped almost 12 percent
just since July. The price of oil plunged 36 percent _ from around
$22 a barrel in October 1997 to around $14 in August _ and has
fallen another 23 percent, to $10.72, since November.
</P>
<P>
   These sectors, especially energy, are a critical source of tax
revenue for the Russian government. About a third of government
budget revenues come from energy taxes, according to Marcel
Cassard, chief economist for emerging Europe at Deutsche Bank in
London.
</P>
<P>
   The exact impact the recent commodity price decline will have on
the Russian budget and spending is hard to tell; the draft 1999
budget is already hard to interpret because of its inclusion of tax
cuts. The draft budget, which the government adopted Thursday,
reduces both the value-added tax and the corporate tax and does not
impose, as some analysts had hoped, new export taxes on energy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cassard said, ``you would have to assume lower
revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate fallout from this commodities pricing
squeeze, several analysts said, will be even more Russian defaults
on foreign loans, as the government diverts those interest and
principal payments to cover the cost of domestic programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia owes about $17 billion of interest and principal payments
this year, including $5 billion to the IMF. The government included
debt payments of just $9.5 billion in its draft budget.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government has already asked the foreign government
leaders in the so-called Paris Club and the foreign bank lenders in
the London Club to restructure and stretch out their debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   But now analysts say that even the goal of $9.5 billion will not
be met. ``Looking at the budget assumptions and the exchange rate,
they will have serious problems servicing even $5 billion of
debt,'' said Gretchen Rodkey, the Russian and East European bond
analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the only bonds they are sure will be serviced are
the Russian eurobonds that had been issued by the present
government after the fall of the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The commodity price decline is also hurting countries with more
economic importance to the United States and the world. The Mexican
government said last week that the drop in oil prices would cut its
budget revenue by as much as $1.5 billion next year, forcing it
into a tough debate on how to close the gap. The oil price decline
could also slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez, a former coup leader and
political outsider, was elected president on Sunday, oil is 70
percent of the country's exports and accounts for 50 percent of its
budget revenue. And as Chavez determines the new path in which he
will take Venezuela _ and the spending needed to do it _ investors
will remember that Venezuela's revenues will suffer more than any
other Latin American nation for every decline in the price of oil.

UPSTATE N.Y. GOP LAWMAKERS UNDECIDED ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the House votes on impeachment next week,
President Clinton's fate may well rest with five moderate
Republican lawmakers from upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The five _ Reps. Benjamin Gilman, Sue Kelly, Sherwood Boehlert,
John McHugh and James Walsh _ are among the 34 or so Republicans
whose votes on impeachment remain in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the five represent the largest geographic
concentration of undecided votes in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Their districts cut a swath through New York City's Westchester
County on the south to the St. Lawrence River and the Canadian
border on the north. They represent GOP-leaning rural and
small-city constituencies that have not gone down the same
hard-conservative path that some Republican districts in the South
and West have.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP dominating the House 228-206 (and one independent
who usually votes Democratic), Republicans need 218 votes to pass
an impeachment resolution.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, each of the New York lawmakers can expect a
deluge of phone calls in the coming days as White House operatives
and GOP congressional leaders vie for their loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republicans from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes,
also are undecided. And three New York Republicans _ Jack Quinn and
Peter King of Long Island and Amo Houghton of northwestern New York
_ have said they will oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five upstate lawmakers responded to telephone
interview requests Thursday. Kelly, whose district runs from
Westchester County through Dutchess County, ``will wait for the
Judiciary Committee to complete its work and wait until all the
facts are presented,'' said her spokesman, Drew Cantor.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, whose district centers around Syracuse and Cortland, has
actually made up his mind, said his spokesman, Jim O'Connor, but is
adhering to a request of Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde
not to make a public commitment until the committee winds up its
work.
</P>
<P>
   For Gilman, impeachment ``is no different from any other vote,''
said Robert Becker, his chief of staff. ``He takes a deliberative,
independent-minded approach to every issue that comes before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Press aides to Boehlert and McHugh said they are undecided on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While upstate voters generally are not as liberal as their
counterparts in New York City, they tend not to be hardline
conservatives either, according to Jeffrey Stonecash, a political
scientist at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate voters are independent-minded, he said, adding that 25
percent of voters in the Syracuse area are registered independents.
</P>
<P>
   For upstate lawmakers, ``this is a real chancy vote,'' said
Stonecash, who has done polling for Walsh. ``This isn't like voting
on some gas tax. It may stay out there as an issue. You don't know
if it's going to go away ... This is a tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstate polling on impeachment reflects national trends showing
voter antipathy to impeachment and a strong percentage favoring
some kind of congressional censure, Stonecash said.
</P>
<P>
   Some upstate Republican leaders voiced qualms over impeachment.
For instance, Robert Cardillo, Oneida County Republican chairman,
said, ``I hear a lot of street talk and people are saying `let's
move on' and `we don't want to hear this anymore. However we can
expedite this, let's expedite it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Donnelly, Delaware County GOP chairman, said that while
something must be done to ``restore respect and honor to the
presidency,'' few people he talks to want an impeachment. ``It's
bad for the country, bad for the American people,'' he said.

WARY ON ECONOMIC TRENDS, BRITAIN CUTS KEY INTEREST RATE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Citing persistent ``deterioration across the economy,''
the Bank of England lowered its benchmark interest rate Thursday,
by half a percentage point, the third cut in as many months and the
second consecutive time it did so by a half-point.
</P>
<P>
   The cut, to 6.25 percent, reflected anxiety over the slowing
performance of the British economy and the growing threat posed to
it by turmoil abroad. ``The prospects for global activity appear to
have weakened, and commodity prices have fallen further'' since its
last cut on Nov. 5, the central bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a week after 10 of the 11 nations joining a single
European currency, the euro, lowered their rates to 3 percent. The
cut is intended to give some relief to manufacturers and exporters
that have attributed a deep slump in sales to Britain's higher
rates and the strong pound.
</P>
<P>
   It still left the securities repurchase rate, the minimum at
which the central bank lends to commercial banks, more than double
that in the rest of Europe and the highest in the Group of Seven
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets had expected a rate cut, and stock and bond
prices showed little change. The FTSE index fell 8.80 points, or
less than 0.2 percent, to 5,660.30, and the yield on government
10-year bonds held near a record low of 4.49 percent. The pound
held at a one-month low of 2.76 German marks.
</P>
<P>
   Many industrial nations have reduced rates in recent months in
an effort to head off a global recession caused by financial crises
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England's decision brought a swift response from
lenders, with the principal mortgage banks all cutting their rates
by the same half-point within minutes of the bank's announcement.
Although the housing market has not suffered the same problems as
other sectors of the nation's sluggish economy, there has been a
marked slowdown in sales over the last six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kevin Gardiner, senior economist at Morgan Stanley
International, said ``survey data from the manufacturing and
service sectors have been consistently negative since last month,''
with a growth in inventories particularly worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   This indication of a decline in consumer confidence was cited by
business leaders and retailers worried about poor early holiday
sales. ``A cut of at least half a percent was essential to boost
flagging consumer demand before the Christmas period and also to
help encourage sterling on its downward path,'' said Dr. Ian
Peters, deputy director general of the British Chambers of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Barker, chief economic adviser at the Confederation of
British Industry, welcomed Thursday's announcement as evidence that
the central bank was alert to the dangers of deflation but warned
that more cuts were needed. ``With economic weakness now spreading
out well beyond manufacturing, this cut is unlikely to be the last
and will not in itself ward off the impending downturn in growth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Batstone, an analyst at NatWest Stockbrokers, said the
move was praised in the City of London financial district, where
most traders had expected only a quarter-point drop. ``It is a
clear sign that the authorities are becoming concerned about the
risk of deflation in the economy rather than inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England was given independence last year to set
interest rates free of government direction, but its nine-member
monetary policy committee is still obliged to maintain them at a
level that prevents inflation from sliding more than 1 percent
above or below the current 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
   Despite government forecasts of continued growth, many
economists are predicting that Britain will experience a sharp
slowdown or a small recession in the first half of 1999. Companies
have issued profit warnings not just in Britain's depressed
manufacturing industry but also in the service sector, which has
been held up by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government as the
engine propelling Britain into its future role as a leader in the
modern globalized economy.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey by MORI, a leading polling organization, of
Britain's senior executives showed that only 1 percent of those
questioned expected the economy to improve in 1999, and 89 percent
predicted it woulf worsen. In the same survey a year ago, the
figures were 50 percent with a positive view and only 12 percent
with a negative one.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have been concerned by falling factory orders and
jobs lost in recent plant closings and consolidations. They said
they had hoped for an even bigger rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, which has
740,000 members, said the half-point reduction was a ``pathetic''
response and accused the central bank of ``living in a parallel
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They should come into the real world,'' he added. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON WILLING TO ACCEPT CENSURE, NOT PUBLIC CONFESSION
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is ready to accept a toughly
worded congressional censure, but is not ready to answer the calls
of moderate Republicans for a public confession to avoid
impeachment, a White House spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is open to an idea of censure put forward in
good faith that is reasonable,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said he was not aware of any plan for Clinton to
make a public address on the issue, which some wavering Republican
House members say would make it easier to cast their vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Such members, including Brian Bilbray of California and Rick
Lazio of New York, have urged the president to abandon his
legalistic defense and publicly confess that he lied under oath
about his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have to recognize the violations of law that have
occurred,'' said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., comparing the president
to a criminal defendant who throws himself on the mercy of the
court for a reduced sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to make a new public statement, few expect it
before next week. The president leaves for the Middle East on
Saturday and is due to return late Tuesday. House members have been
advised that debate will begin next Thursday on impeachment
articles that the House Judiciary Committee is expected to approve
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some, therefore, see Wednesday as the most likely date for a
speech, if the White House still deems one necessary to influence
the impeachment vote. Clinton's attorneys are advising against an
address, because the very admissions that could help sway House
members could increase his vulnerability to criminal prosecution
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   At his White House briefing, Lockhart said presidential aides
had begun calling both Democratic and Republican House members to
push for a floor vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration believes there should be a vote on
``something that gives members a choice, members who believe that
there should be some recognition of the president's behavior, but
believe, as we do, that these allegations fall well short of
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not personally made any of these calls to lobby
members, Lockhart said, but ``I can't rule out that that may be
something he'll do in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While demurring on the specific wording of a Democratic proposal
to censure Clinton for making ``false statements concerning his
reprehensible conduct with a subordinate,'' Lockhart said such a
reprimand was ``generally'' acceptable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that people who in good faith come
forward with a reasonable solution to put this matter behind us, in
a prompt way, short of impeachment, should be considered,'' he
said. ``And looking at that proposal, I think it meets the
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart would not declare flatly that the president would
sign this proposed censure _ a requirement of the Democratic
proposal _ or to accept all the wrong-doing that it specifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he's sat down and looked at it word by word,
line by line, and said, 'This is definitely something that's
acceptable','' Lockhart conceded. ``I just wanted to give you some
sense from the White House point of view about this proposal,
because it'll go before the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he did not know how much the president would
personally be involved in the effort to avoid impeachment in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware that he's spoken to any of the members who are
undecided,'' said Lockhart. ``We have got a lot going on. We have
got a big trip coming up. He is certainly aware of this, takes some
time to get briefed, but hasn't had a chance to watch much of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would never give up the fight to retain his
office, but did not say where the campaign will next lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will judge our efforts here both by what we view as
what's appropriate and what's effective,'' said Lockhart.

 &HT;    SABBATH IMPEACHMENT VOTES CAUSE JEWISH MEMBER DISCOMFORT
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment
votes carry over into Saturday, Rep. Robert Wexler faces an
uncomfortable choice: participate in the votes and violate his
observance of the Jewish Sabbath, or observe the Sabbath and
neglect his congressional duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm uncomfortable with having to work on the Sabbath, (but)
there is no question where I need to be this Friday night and
Saturday. I need to be part of the Judiciary Committee and the
debate on impeachment,'' said Wexler, a Florida Democrat who is one
of President Clinton's staunchest advocates on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler, a member of an Orthodox synagogue, said he tries to
observe the Sabbath commandant of not working or riding from
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While declaring that he does not consider himself an expert on
Jewish laws and customs, Wexler said he believes there is an
allowance in Jewish tradition for public officials to perform their
duties on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 15 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are Jewish.
None of the Republicans are Jewish. In addition to Wexler,
spokesmen for four of the members _Reps. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, Howard Berman of California, Charles Schumer of New
York and Steven Rothman of New Jersey _ said voting on Saturday
would not cause a religious conflict for them. A spokesman for Rep.
Jerrold Nadler of New York could not be contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler said he did not seek to delay votes on Saturday and did
not feel there was any attempt by the Judiciary Committee chairman,
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to be disrespectful of Jewish members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any conspiracy of neglect or
purposefulness in trying to do things on Jewish holidays,'' Wexler
said. ``It would be unfair of me or anyone else to make that
allegation of Mr. Hyde or any of the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Jews bristled in September when the Judiciary Committee
decided to release the tape of Clinton's Aug. 17 deposition on Rosh
Hashana, the Jewish New Year and one of the holiest days on the
Jewish calendar. Like the Sabbath, it is supposed to be observed by
not working, riding, or watching television.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of marathon committee hearings this week, Wexler
said he doesn't fault Hyde for trying to press for a final vote as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee has been going day and night all week, and if
it could be done by Friday sundown, it would be done,'' Wexler
said. ``I can't fault the chairman. It would be unrealistic to
expect the impeachment of the president to be based on the Jewish
calendar.''

FLOODED TOWN FINDS RELIEF, HOPE IN ITS FIGHTING GOBBLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERO, Texas _ In the future, 1998 will be grimly remembered
here as the year of the Great Flood, when a third of the town was
inundated and hundreds of people were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But depending on what happens Saturday at the Houston Astrodome,
a footnote may be added, one to be savored as a bright spot in a
bleak year.
</P>
<P>
   At the Astrodome, the Cuero High School Gobblers (11-3 this
season) face the Aledo High School Bearcats (13-1) for the Class 3A
Division I crown. Flood or no flood, football is serious business
in small-town Texas, and for Cuero, the game is an escape for a
community that is still struggling to get back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate probably half the team was flooded out, and the
staff had four or five members who were also,'' Cuero coach Mickey
Finley said at a midweek practice.
</P>
<P>
   With three state championships already, the quarter-final finish
last year and regular playoff success, expectations are very high
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited. The whole high school is decorated inside.
I think they'll do good. They really want it bad,'' said Jessica
Brennan, 14, a Cuero High School freshman.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuero, which is 85 miles southeast of San Antonio, a fourth
state crown couldn't come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-October floods that swept through South Texas affected
many communities, but none as brutally as Cuero, a town of 6,700
that lies along the Guadalupe River.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the Guadalupe rose to record levels in record time and
swallowed up unsuspecting neighborhoods miles from its channel.
With almost no warning, few people saved anything but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said 1,076 homes _ more than 40 percent of the
housing _ were damaged, and 643 were destroyed. A preliminary
estimate shows the floods reduced the city's $132 million tax base
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the housing shortage, scores of families have
abandoned Cuero. The school district lost more than 40 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have five campuses, and every campus lost kids. The special
education campus was flooded, and the students have been
temporarily placed at other campuses,'' said Maggie Martinez,
secretary to Superintendent JohnHall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father-in-law and sister-in-law lost everything. He just
moved back into his house, but my sister-in-law and her family are
living with me. We went from a family of three to a family of 10,
and everyone is in that situation,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly two months after the flood, the affected
neighborhoods remain nearly deserted, with scattered cleanup and
construction crews the only signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Some wrecked houses remain at peculiar angles, just as the flood
waters left them. Many yards and street corners are still piled
high with debris. In a gravel pit west of town, 4,000 truck loads
of debris have been dumped, with much more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Barfield, 41, whose home of 17 years was damaged, said
she understands how football can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids can't even go home to where they used to live. Half
of them are piled up in people's apartments,'' she said. ``They
want to win. It sure takes their minds off a whole lot of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said this year's squad is considered the underdog to
Aledo, a town of about 1,400 some 15 miles west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are probably favoring them, but I don't think our
players believe that. These guys have a chance to put themselves in
a pretty elite group,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley agreed that the Gobblers' performance this season has
probably helped the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its kind of a release for people. Some of them look at
bad things all day long. You worry about money. You don't know
where you're going to live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then on Friday nights you can go out for two or three
hours, and put it all out of your mind.''

 &HT;    Insecticide sprays aim to permanently ground pesky gypsy moth in
South
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gypsy moth, that bane of the Northeastern forests
for a century, has munched its way southward and for the third time
this decade has infested an area of North Georgia's mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state forestry officials plan the aerial spraying in
April of biological insecticides across some 30,000 acres of rugged
and picturesque mountains along the Georgia-North Carolina border
near the tourist town of Highlands, N.C. The area includes the
remote Ellicott Rock Wilderness in Rabun County, Ga., as well as
parcels in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Without the spraying, foresters fear, the caterpillars of the
exotic pest will within a few years begin to ravage the majestic
hardwoods in and around Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced into Massachusetts in 1869, the European insect has
slowly spread its territory and now is found in large numbers as
far south as the Virginia-North Carolina line. Each spring when the
caterpillars hatch, they devour hardwood leaves, especially oaks,
and have defoliated large tracts of forests in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The recent outbreak in the Highlands area was first detected in
1996. Foresters think this isolated outbreak resulted from either
egg masses or moth cocoons that became attached to camper vehicles
in the Northeast and were left behind by visitors to Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters said that since oaks are the dominant tree of the
Southern Appalachians and produce acorns essential to wildlife, the
moth infestation could cause serious ecological problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several of these outbreaks in the Southeast over the
years, but this one in the Highlands area is one of the worst
examples we've seen,'' said Jeff Witcosky, an entomologist with the
U.S. Forest Service who is coordinating the control effort. ``It's
spreading very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million-plus attack on the gypsy moths will be overseen
by the Forest Service, chiefly because most of the land infected is
within the national forests of the three states.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before in the mountains of North Georgia_near Helen in1992
and near Blue Ridge in 1994_isolated infestations of the moths have
been eradicated by spraying the biological controls. ``We're going
to keep trying to stamp it out here in Georgia every time we find
it,'' said Terry Price, chief of pest control for the Georgia
Forestry Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike chemical insecticides that can poison all insects and
many other creatures, the biological agent kills only moth and
butterfly larvae. Commonly known as BT, the agent has been used for
years to control garden cabbage worms.
</P>
<P>
   But even this environmentally friendly insecticide has its down
side. Other butterfly or moth caterpillars merging at the time of
the spraying will be killed. Two rare species of butterfly are
thought to be present in portions of the spray area.
</P>
<P>
   To protect those butterflies, the Forest Service is considering
using two other biological controls that kill only gypsy moths.
Those controls are Gypchek, a virus that infects gypsy moths, and
Disrupt II, a compound that interferes with the mating of adult
gypsy moths.
</P>
<P>
   Those controls are not as effective as BT and will likely be
used only in areas where the butterflies would be endangered and in
the wilderness area, Witcosky explained.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these efforts and due to the devastation the moths
can inflict, the spraying campaign has the backing of several
environmental groups that focus on National Forest issues. Those
include Georgia ForestWatch, Friends of the Mountains and the
Chattooga River Watershed Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of doing nothing will be a loss of (tree) diversity
in the forest,'' said James Sullivan of ForestWatch. ``We think the
impact of doing nothing is worse than spraying these biological
controls.

TEXAS HUNTERS DWINDLING IN NUMBER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LLANO, Texas _ Despite a cold, autumn drizzle, a crowd quickly
circled Joe W. Self, an off-duty deputy sheriff from East Texas,
after he parked his pickup bearing a large antlered buck.
</P>
<P>
   A standout hunting season was less than two weeks old. Business
had been so overwhelming in this Hill Country county, whose
abundant game has earned it the title ``the deer capital of
Texas,'' that butcher Bryan Miiller has been turning away clients
after accepting more than 600 field-dressed deer for processing on
opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of lost track of my days,'' said Miiller, 36. ``It was
the best first weekend since we've been here _ - 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, in economic terms, is booming in Llano County.
</P>
<P>
   However, wildlife officials and others who follow the sport say
all is not well beyond the deer blind.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Texans who hunt has dropped 18 percent in the past
10 years. The decrease is even larger, 31 percent, when the state's
17 percent population growth is factored in.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those crowding into hunting hot spots like Llano are
coming from other parts of Texas or other states, having been
driven from their traditional hunting land by urban sprawl or
soaring lease costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some see a crisis looming for a sport long associated with the
Lone Star identity. Also at issue is the future direction of the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which derives nearly 60
percent of its budget from hunting and fishing licenses and, in
turn, spends a good portion of its budget on measures aimed at
enhancing hunting and fishing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's integral to our Texas heritage,'' says Jerry Warden, 51,
executive director of the San Antonio-based Texas Youth Hunting
Association, which was started four years ago in an attempt to
reverse the trend. ``It's part of our history, part of our culture,
and we need to retain it.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural East Texas, where children once learned to hunt a
decade before they learned to parallel park, sales of hunting and
fishing licenses have plummeted _ by 34 percent in Trinity County,
46 percent in San Jacinto County, 27 percent in Angelina County.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Llano, an area strongly identified with deer hunting,
license sales have declined.
</P>
<P>
   A July study by Texas A&AMP;M University found a myriad of social
and economic causes, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The state's increasing urbanization.
</P>
<P>
   _ Competition from other leisure activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ The reluctance of women and minorities to fill a gap left by
fewer white men who are hunting.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rising cost of hunting leases.
</P>
<P>
   Other wildlife experts cite the loss of traditional hunting
areas to urban sprawl and the growing number of children raised by
single mothers, who don't hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunting can never go back to the way it was because we have a
society that has changed so dramatically,'' said Clark Adams,
director of human dimensions in wildlife management research at
Texas A&AMP;M's Department of Wildlife and Fishery Sciences in College
Station.
</P>
<P>
   The state's fast-growing minority population is less prone to
hunt. Hispanics comprise about 26 percent of the state's population
but represent just 8.6 percent of its licensed hunters.
African-Americans comprise about 12 percent of Texans but just 2.6
percent of licensed hunters, according to the Texas A&AMP;M study by
Myron F. Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   But demographics explains only part of the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who began hunting ``as soon as I could carry a .22''
rifle, has backed off from the sport for many of the reasons that
have sidelined others. ``I just lost my interest in it because it's
so darn hard to find a place to hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you or your relatives own land, you're set,'' the Texas A&AMP;M
professor said. ``One-third of the hunting population will have
problems with access as more land is sold for development, more
land is fragmented into little rancheros sold by the square inch.''
</P>
<P>
   As hunting is made more difficult and more expensive, people
will weigh their leisure options, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the best possible investment for your recreational
dollar if you're an urbanite with $1,000 in discretionary money?
Use it for a hunting lease or for a golf club membership?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the loss of veteran hunters through natural
attrition. The average age of Texas hunters was 36 in 1974. By
1996, it had risen to 41, according to Parks and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   And there are gender issues.
</P>
<P>
   Men are introduced to hunting in their youth by fathers, older
brothers or other male relatives, the Texas A&AMP;M scholar said.
``Females, for the most part, are recruited by their spouses or
significant others later in life _ their mid-20s,'' he said.
Generally, ``if the family doesn't hunt, the female doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest hurdle is finding accessible and affordable
places to hunt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For its next reality special, maybe NBC could produce a live,
on-air book-burning. That would be right in line with what they've
done to the classics this season. For a blip of time, after the
success of several bookish, special-effects-laden films
(``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``The Odyssey'' and ``Merlin'') the
network turned to literature for inspiration. That may sound
high-minded, but the results might have played better as a satire
called ``Books Go Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   First there was ``Crime and Punishment,'' plodding but nothing
to be ashamed of. When the film got dismal ratings, NBC declared it
was reassessing future literary adaptations. That Dostoyevsky's
dark psychological work was falsely hyped as a tale of lurid
suspense and romance apparently meant nothing. NBC was determined
not to let any more sneaky dead writers destroy its ratings, so the
network yanked ``The Tempest'' from its original slot in the
high-stakes sweeps month of November, and dropped it into this
weekend, when people are presumably too busy with the holidays to
notice.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Tempest'' is a clunker, but don't blame Shakespeare, who
can sleep peacefully knowing he has a minimal connection to the
project. Half-baked in its conception and direction, it is a
colorful but mush-brained version that takes Shakespeare's basic
story and characters and drops them into a Mississippi bayou during
the Civil War era. Along the way it drops Shakespeare's language
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Now the magical Prospero is a Mississippi plantation owner named
Gideon Prosper, played by Peter Fonda. In 1851, as he says when
setting the leaden tone at the start, he was ``unaware of the
tempest that was coming.'' Gideon spends his time learning voodoo
from a slave named Ezeli (Donzaleigh Abernathy) and leaves the
running of the plantation to his vile brother, Anthony (John
Glover), who forces Gideon, his daughter, Miranda (Katherine Heigl)
and Ezeli's son, Ariel (Harold Perrineau Jr.) into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Gideon describes their new home as ``my sanctuary, a tiny island
in the bayou protected by snakes and alligators.'' The island is
also the home of the uncivilized character Shakespeare knew as
Caliban. Here he is the Gator Man (John Pyper-Ferguson), brutish
but not naturally evil; he simply has not made the acquaintance of
Miss Manners.
</P>
<P>
   None of these changes are outrageous. It would have been daring
for a network to have kept Shakespeare's language; the success of
Baz Luhrman's MTV-style film, ``Shakespeare's `Romeo and Juliet'''
proves the language is not box-office poison (though having
Leonardo DiCaprio speak it definitely lessens the risk). Yet even
in the realm of the loosely adapted, this ``Tempest'' is pallid.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Gideon and Anthony echoes the
brother-to-brother battles of the Civil War in the most ham-fisted
way. And without Shakespeare's poetry, these characters are mere
outlines.
</P>
<P>
   The film is most disappointing because there are glimpses of
potential that quickly flicker away. Though his Southern accent
sways in and out, it is easy to see what Fonda might have done with
a more focused production. Here he can only hint at the character
of a man who wrong-headedly isolates his beloved daughter and must
finally surrender her back to the imperfectly civilized world. And
there is no sense that his magic goes beyond special effects.
</P>
<P>
   They are, at times, striking. Gideon conjures a fierce storm:
leaves swirl, wind and rain are gradually whipped into a true
tempest. Ezeli can see visions in pools of water, and at one point
her face appears to Gideon within the giant flames of a fire. But
the effects always seem dropped in, detached from character and
story.
</P>
<P>
   The only wholly successful element is Perrineau, whose unlikely
Ariel is no sprite but a believable flesh-and-blood individual, a
slave caught in a powerful struggle for freedom. Better known as
the wheel-chair-bound inmate and narrator of the scathing HBO
series ``Oz,'' Perrineau has a greater challenge here; he must make
Ariel more than a heavy-handed metaphor for slavery.
</P>
<P>
   When Anthony is tossed ashore on Gideon's island, the Civil War
plot becomes central and the themes even more labored. ``No magic
can stop a bullet,'' Anthony growls. Of course, he's wrong;
Gideon's special effects can do wonders. The true magic of poetry
is what's missing from this ``Tempest.''

   `The Cater Street Hangman'
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E, Sunday at 9 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on an Anne Perry mystery novel, ``The Cater Street
Hangman'' is more modest than ``The Tempest'' in its ambition and
literary source, but infinitely more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Set in foggy Victorian London, the film is a luxurious tale of
romance, class and murder. When a series of young servant women are
strangled on posh Cater Street, the handsome police inspector
Thomas Pitt (Eoin McCarthy) investigates. At the Ellison household,
the indignant and proper Edward (Peter Egan) sends Pitt around to
the servants' entrance, but he gets a warmer reception from
Edward's lovely, headstrong daughter, Charlotte (Keeley Hawes).
</P>
<P>
   Pitt's carefully tousled hair and Charlotte's independent spirit
mark them as our contemporaries, ahead of their time in the 19th
century and clearly meant for each other. Their romance and the
unwinding mystery make this film smartly entertaining.

LLANO, Texas: places to hunt. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Cooper's Old Pit Barbecue, a Llano institution where
2-inch-thick pork chops are served on butcher paper, a throng in
hooded sweat shirts or camouflage jackets talked of drawing a bead
on a trophy buck.
</P>
<P>
   At one long table, three men and a teen-ager sat down for their
evening meal after arriving from Brownsville. High costs had driven
them from South Texas, where a weekend hunt can range from $1,000
to $7,500, they said. And that's just for access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before firing, you have to turn to your guide and ask, `How
much is that going to cost me to shoot?''' said George Dominguez,
40, a school district administrator. ``It could be another $3,000
for a trophy deer,'' he said, referring to a buck with antlers
large enough to merit mounting or a place in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have the bucks, and a middle-class worker can't
afford a $3,000 hunt,'' said Dominguez, whose group paid $250 each
for a three-day hunt. ``So people from South Texas are moving to
Central Texas.'' They in turn are displacing residents who had
hunted locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been priced out of hunting,'' said G.R. ``Willie''
Gonzalez, an accountant turned game warden based in Llano.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Dominguez was Brownsville architect Stanford
Knowles and his son, Chris, 14, who was on his first deer hunt.
Belying the hopeful view at Parks and Wildlife that if the father
hunts, the heritage will be passed on, Dominguez said his son
turned down an opportunity to join them, asking instead to be
dropped off in San Antonio so he could ``girl watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Zeske of Dallas hunts for free, like many Texans have for
generations. His friend, former Lewisville resident Bob Powers, who
now lives in Alabama, has a scenic, deer-rich Llano County spread
that had been in his wife's family for generations. In exchange for
their help keeping the place in shape, Powers allows his buddies to
hunt without charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person in Dallas couldn't find a good place to
hunt that he could afford,'' Zeske, 61, a mail-order marketing
consultant and sports memorabilia entrepreneur, said as he and
Powers finished off their morning bacon and eggs. ``If Bob didn't
allow me to come out here, I'd have a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, the Trinity County judge, Mark Evans, insisted,
``Hunting is as much of being Texan as having been born in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old judge, himself a deer hunter, was then taken
aback when told that hunting license sales had dropped a third in
his bailiwick during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Evans blamed subdivisions built on prime hunting land, pitting
hunter against hunter for smaller acreage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's the advent of hunting clubs,'' he said. ``Much of
the land is now leased out to them and many of these people are
from out of the county, some from out of state.''
</P>
<P>
   While the number of resident hunters dropped 18 percent, those
from out of state nearly doubled from fiscal year 1987 to 1997,
from 27,274 to 54,125.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Austin, the Parks and Wildlife Department sees the glass
as half full.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question there's been a decline in the number of
people hunting in Texas and buying licenses,'' said Gary Graham,
chief of its wildlife division. ``We're moderately concerned. We
still have a million people in Texas, more or less, actively
engaged in hunting. That's a substantial constituency base.''
</P>
<P>
   By no means is the department ignoring the issue, Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened up more than 1 million acres to public hunting for
a nominal $40 fee. Last year, it received 79,029 applications for
2,550 hunt positions distributed on a lottery basis. All
license-carrying youths under 17 can hunt at designated areas free
of charge if accompanied by a fee-paying adult. Only 415 youths
took advantage in 1984; by 1997, the number had increased to 8,206.
</P>
<P>
   Warden's Texas Youth Hunting Association has 500 enrolled in
this season's 40 sponsored hunts, up from 225 participants last
year and 100 the year before. Some 70 percent to 80 percent hail
from hunting families, he said. So, in many cases, the organization
is preaching to the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Many wildlife experts see hunting in Texas increasingly becoming
a sport of the affluent who are willing to pay top dollar for
trophy game reared on ranches bordered by 12-foot wire fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunting is going to change dramatically, with landowners
creating more `high-fence operations' _ walling in deer and calling
it their own,'' predicted Texas A&AMP;M's Adams. ``A guy drives through
a gate, shoots a deer, and that's it.''

GABRIEL OROZCO: WHEN MEANING EMERGES SLOWLY FROM MISSING PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gabriel Orozco, a clear-eyed romantic, is one of the
more ingenious artists to come along in years, and if you doubt me
I suggest you go to his ambitious new show at Marian Goodman and
play a little Ping-Pong.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall his debut at the Goodman gallery, in 1994, when
he stuck yogurt container lids on the walls, the ordinary clear
plastic kind of lids with the blue rims and the expiration dates
stamped on them. They were the only things in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it didn't seem like much, but the nature of
good new art is that often you don't recognize it; then gradually,
by virtue of its quality, it reorders your taste, which must adjust
to accommodate it. We think taste is synonymous with refinement,
which is another way of saying that we think taste narrows through
experience. Actually the reverse should be true. Taste should
broaden if you really make an effort to look. That is one lesson of
Orozco's work.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first show, he seems to have been ubiquitous. Last
summer some of his photographs were in a group exhibition. Against
a Manhattan skyline he had arranged junk to mimic the buildings.
Another photograph showed tire marks he had made by riding a
bicycle through a puddle. The work seemed slight, but it was funny
and also vaguely melancholy, the kind of modest art that waits for
you to come to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's the current show, which dispels all lingering
reservations. But of course you are still wondering about the
Ping-Pong. A few years ago Orozco concocted an oval pool table with
no pockets. This time he has come up with an X-shaped Ping-Pong
table with a lily pond in the center: call it Giverny for the
rumpus room. (He calls it ``Ping-Pond Table.'') Three or four
people can play singles at a time, with the choice of hitting
either across the water or sideways, although there are no rules.
You make them up.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from being an amusing twist on an old Surrealist idea, the
table is about pleasure _ simple pleasure _ which is almost a novel
concept in the art world these days. I played with two people for a
few minutes, had a ball and didn't worry about the meaning of the
whole thing, which you too are blissfully free to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Except that there is a serious sculptural element to the work
involving our participation in it. And to recognize it is to
acknowledge a certain ineffable sensibility in Orozco's art: One
might say the Ping-Pong table is less about its own eccentric shape
than about the space that we occupy with it and what we do in that
space. Space, both physical and psychological, is the subject.
</P>
<P>
   I gather, along these lines, that as a boy in Mexico, Orozco
listened to his mother play the piano, and for whatever reason he
also fixated on the space behind the instrument. In the show is
``Maman,'' a compact one-room pavilion with a pitched slate roof,
two upright pianos acting as walls. In this case, space is turned
roughly inside-out; the inside, where you can sit, is behind the
two pianos, which you play only when outside the pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago Orozco also sliced a vintage Citroen DS lengthwise
into three parts, removing the middle section and suturing the
other two. Being in the eviscerated car was a little like sitting
in the pavilion: snug. In France, the old Citroen recalls bygone
French style and bourgeois comfort, and when Orozco's car was
exhibited there it was inevitably interpreted as an allegory of
straitened times. There's nothing explicit about its message, just
as it is possible to interpret the Ping-Pong table as a variant on
the old metaphor of sport as social model, but the interpretation
is optional. Unlike many young artists, Orozco doesn't lecture.
Sometimes you can detect a hint of politics in his art yet only
peripherally, the way you may see actors moving on a darkened stage
only by looking away from them.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``La DS'' derived its impact from what it lacked,
meaning the missing middle of the automobile. Orozco made people
focus on the space cut out of the car, on something that was not
there. Thinking back to his first show, I'd now say that the yogurt
caps were calculated to cause a similar effect by making people
uncomfortably aware of the gallery's emptiness. The installation
was about the psychological gap between what we expected or hoped
to see and what we did see. Its subject wasn't the esthetics of
yogurt packaging but our interaction with an empty room.
</P>
<P>
   If this line of argument sounds a little convoluted, let me also
endorse Orozco more straightforwardly by saying that his work can
be very beautiful. Proust, who understood beauty as well as anyone
else, once went to a concert that he loved but his friends didn't.
He decided that they didn't like it because it had been truly
beautiful: ``For true beauty is the only thing that cannot respond
to what a romantic imagination anticipates. Everything else lives
up to those preconceived ideas: dexterity is amazing, vulgarity
soothing, sensuousness thrilling, claptrap dazzling. But beauty
which from the beginning of all things has been joined to truth in
an eternal friendship has not got all these charms at its
disposal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One big room in Orozco's present show includes materials he
recently picked from Dumpsters in New York City. He rented a truck,
which he drove around SoHo and the West Village, stopping at
construction containers, assembling chunks of cement, discarded
cables, furniture and soda bottles, then photographing what he had
put together. When he was finished at one place he packed
everything into the truck and drove on to the next site.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that links him to artists from Kurt Schwitters
through Gordon Matta-Clark to Richard Tuttle, but this is not to
say that Orozco is simply derivative. All art comes from somewhere,
otherwise it makes no sense, the trick for an artist being, as
Delacroix once said, to recognize what ``is still not enough'' in
the art that already exists.
</P>
<P>
   In Orozco's case what he found by rummaging through Dumpsters is
installed in a room with wire dandelions that he had made in Paris,
and with aluminum sculptures, enlargements of wax impressions of
the inside of his tightened fist. The impressions look a little
like human hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing sounds inchoate, which it certainly can seem,
until you get over your initial resistance to it and begin to focus
on the relationships among objects. Then, surprisingly, a formal
logic emerges out of the combination of made and found, industrial
and naturally derived materials.
</P>
<P>
   Art is ultimately about empathy, toward which Orozco's work
consistently inclines us. He has made a few videos, which the
gallery is showing, and I recommend them, especially if you still
have doubts but also if you want to grasp his work at its core.
</P>
<P>
   He made the videos by walking for a day, with no plan, taping
what caught his attention, arranging a few objects that he found
along the way but mostly just keeping his eyes open. The videos are
unedited.
</P>
<P>
   In one, made in Amsterdam, the camera follows a rut in the
street, which becomes a kind of abstract, wavering line, then
focuses on a spinning concrete mixer with a blue circle painted on
it, then presents several portraits of passers-by, and also finds a
geometry in some folded newspapers in a grid of mail slots. At one
point the camera jerks and you sense Orozco looking for something
to look at. You see how he sees, in other words, which is
intensely. And you are made aware of the crucial question at the
heart of his work:
</P>
<P>
   What is the point of looking if your mind isn't open to what you
see?

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL JUDGE PROMOTES INNOVATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why shouldn't Microsoft enjoy the fruits of victory
if it can improve the technology it licensed from a smaller rival,
the judge presiding over the Microsoft antitrust trial asked
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson posed his pointed
question after James Gosling, who created a programming language
known as Java, argued that Microsoft's high command had sought to
undermine the ``write once, run anywhere'' version of Java created
by Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't they simply grasp the significance of what you were
doing and run with that?'' Jackson said, turning to Gosling as he
was about to leave the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represented it as better,'' Gosling, who is also Sun's
chief scientist, replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Gosling added, ``their definition of better is tied
into the Windows platform. If they had technical difficulties with
what we were doing, we would have worked very hard with them to go
through a process of resolving them. But they were trying to force
us to swallow various poison pills. There was no inclination to
discuss it, to say, 'let's work this out.' It was boom _ here it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is trying the landmark case without a jury,
appeared somewhat mollified by Gosling's response. ``You were
trying to bring other people along,'' Jackson noted as Gosling
nodded in assent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge's sudden intervention seemed to unnerve David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, who had just told Jackson
that he had completed his response to Microsoft's three-day
cross-examination of the Sun scientist. Instead, Boies rose once
more to hammer home his main points until Jackson, eager to finally
call it a day, said, ``I think you are finished with your
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, the normally unflappable Boies sought to
recover from what Microsoft's attorneys clearly took to be a signal
that, after eight weeks of testimony, the trial seemed to be going
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two aspects to the judge's question,'' Boies said.
It reflects a fair point that Microsoft is making in
cross-examination _ one of the things that was going on was
Microsoft's attempt to compete on the merits and come up with
better software. But ... in addition, Microsoft was forcing people
to take its version and preventing people from having access on a
level playing field to the version submitted by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that if all that was going on in the Java controversy was
Microsoft's attempt to come up with a better version, the judge
would believe, as he indicated in his question, that there's
nothing wrong with simply trying to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if the evidence is, as Dr. Gosling
testified, that ... Microsoft attempted to inhibit the distribution
of Sun's cross-platform Java and forced people to take the
Microsoft non-compatible version for the explicit reason of
preserving its monopoly, you probably would not have had Microsoft,
in its internal documents, describing its efforts to 'pollute'
Java.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 trial days, it remains to be seen whether the
government's contention that Microsoft pursued an illegal pattern
of seeking to sabotage any outside technology that might pose a
challenge to its near-monopoly in the operating system for personal
computers will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The next corporate officer in a parade of witnesses who will try
to make that point will be William Harris, president and chairman
of Intuit Corp. Although Microsoft, which has $17 billion in cash
in its coffers, had sought to buy Intuit, it pulled back with
Justice Department officials signaled they would move to block the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, however, will not take the witness stand until Jan. 4,
when the trial is scheduled to resume after a holiday break. Next
week's witness will be Princeton computer professor Edward Felten,
an expert on Windows' browsing technology.

WHITE HOUSE PREPARES TO FIGHT IMPEACHMENT IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House mustered a second line of defense
in the impeachment struggle with Congress Thursday in a effort to
save President Clinton from suffering the humiliation of being only
the second president in U.S. history to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its strategy to prevail in the full House, White
House officials endorsed the proposed censure of the president,
laid the groundwork for personal presidential appeals to GOP
moderates and weighed the possibility of a presidential statement
of contrition before an expected House impeachment vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides, conceding they had little hope of dissuading
the House Judiciary Committee from approving one or more articles
of impeachment, focused instead on the showdown next week when some
30 undecided members will decide the verdict by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, coordinator of the president's effort to combat
impeachment, appealed for members of the full House to keep an open
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make just one plea to the members of the House of
Representatives on behalf of the president of the United States,''
Craig said. ``Before you vote to impeach and remove the president,
read the defense of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's team delivered to each of the 435 House members
a 184-page point-by-point rebuttal of allegations against Clinton,
according to White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. The White
House gave the same rebuttal of House Judiciary Committee members
previously.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff and Craig
were available to meet undecided lawmakers to help clarify any
questions that might persuade them to decide against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials unleashed a torrent of telephone
calls to both Republicans and Democrats in an effort to rally
bipartisan support for House consideration of a Democratic motion
of censure when the full House meets next Thursday to debate
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart promised that Clinton would personally sign a censure
resolution and accept the risks of subsequent legal penalties and
fines after leaving office, even if the House failed to approve
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart conceded, however, that White House entreaties to the
GOP House leadership had yet to win a pledge to permit a censure
vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a commitment now to do that, but I think we will
continue to make the case,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton had not decided whether to
address the nation prior to the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves Saturday for Israel and returns to Washington
late Wednesday _ giving him the option of delivering a nationally
televised address next Thursday night _ the eve of the expected
House vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue where twisting arms isn't appropriate, but
bending ears is,'' Lockhart said. ``We want people to read the
submission we've made; we want them to look at the facts; we want
them to ask us if there are any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Suhail Khan, spokesman for Rep. Tom Campbell,
R-Calif., said Republican and Democratic lawmakers had called for
Campbell to talk about his undecided stance on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Khan said Campbell, who is traveling in Africa, had not
spoken to any senior White House staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman is still undecided,'' Kahn said. ``He wants to
wait until the inquiry is complete and give the president every
opportunity to rebut any of the accusations that have been made
before making a final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart embraced the thrust of the censure resolution proposed
by three Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee as an
alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Reps. Rick Boucher, D-Va., Thomas Barrett,
D-Wis., and William Delahunt, D-Mass., calls for Clinton to sign a
censure resolution in which he would admit making ``false
statements'' about his ``reprehensible conduct'' with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, admit ``wrongly'' trying to ``delay
discovery of the truth'' and accept the risk of remaining ``subject
to criminal and civil penalties for this conduct'' after leaving
office.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton had not approved the wording of any
proposed censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is looking for a reasonable way to put this
behind us, short of impeachment,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' censure proposal ``seems to meet the criteria of
people moving forward and making a good-faith effort and being
reasonable,'' Lockhart said. ``I don't know that he's sat down and
looked at it word by word, line by line, and said, `This is
definitely something that's acceptable.'''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., worked to shore
up Democratic ranks with telephone calls to the 31 Democrats who
had voted with Republicans to approve an open-ended impeachment
inquiry.

   ``They represented it as better,'' Gosling, who is also Sun's
chief scientist, replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Gosling added, ``their definition of better is tied
into the Windows platform. If they had technical difficulties with
what we were doing, we would have worked very hard with them to go
through a process of resolving them. But they were trying to force
us to swallow various poison pills. There was no inclination to
discuss it, to say, 'let's work this out.' It was boom _ here it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is trying the landmark case without a jury,
appeared somewhat mollified by Gosling's response. ``You were
trying to bring other people along,'' Jackson noted as Gosling
nodded in assent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge's sudden intervention seemed to unnerve David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, who had just told Jackson
that he had completed his response to Microsoft's three-day
cross-examination of the Sun scientist. Instead, Boies rose once
more to hammer home his main points until Jackson, eager to finally
call it a day, said, ``I think you are finished with your
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, the normally unflappable Boies sought to
recover from what Microsoft's attorneys clearly took to be a signal
that, after eight weeks of testimony, the trial seemed to be going
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two aspects to the judge's question,'' Boies said.
It reflects a fair point that Microsoft is making in
cross-examination _ one of the things that was going on was
Microsoft's attempt to compete on the merits and come up with
better software. But ... in addition, Microsoft was forcing people
to take its version and preventing people from having access on a
level playing field to the version submitted by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that if all that was going on in the Java controversy was
Microsoft's attempt to come up with a better version, the judge
would believe, as he indicated in his question, that there's
nothing wrong with simply trying to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if the evidence is, as Dr. Gosling
testified, that ... Microsoft attempted to inhibit the distribution
of Sun's cross-platform Java and forced people to take the
Microsoft non-compatible version for the explicit reason of
preserving its monopoly, you probably would not have had Microsoft,
in its internal documents, describing its efforts to 'pollute'
Java.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 trial days, it remains to be seen whether the
government's contention that Microsoft pursued an illegal pattern
of seeking to sabotage any outside technology that might pose a
challenge to its near-monopoly in the operating system for personal
computers will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The next corporate officer in a parade of witnesses who will try
to make that point will be William Harris, president and chairman
of Intuit Corp. Although Microsoft, which has $17 billion in cash
in its coffers, had sought to buy Intuit, it pulled back with
Justice Department officials signaled they would move to block the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, however, will not take the witness stand until Jan. 4,
when the trial is scheduled to resume after a holiday break. Next
week's witness will be Princeton computer professor Edward Felten,
an expert on Windows' browsing technology.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS TEXAS SCHOOLS IMPROVING
 &HT;    630 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Texas schools have steadily boosted student math
scores, participation in math and sciences, parental involvement
and teacher training, according to a national report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country. Texas was one of the most improved states.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The number of Texas fourth- and eighth-graders who are at least
proficient on the math section of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress has increased. The NAEP measures student
ability on three levels: basic, proficient and advanced. Proficient
students demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter and
are well prepared for the next level of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, the number of proficient fourth-graders
jumped from 15 percent to 25 percent, compared with an increase
from 18 percent to 21 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1996, the number of proficient eighth-graders
increased from 13 percent to 21 percent, compared with an increase
from 15 percent to 24 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members attributed the increase in achievement to the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, which students are required to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas and North Carolina, the leaders recognized very early
that their economic success was dependent on the success of the
students in their schools,'' said James Hunt, governor of North
Carolina. ``They're using appropriate tests to measure how students
and schools are really doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more Texas students are receiving degrees in
mathematics and science, including women and minorities. Between
1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in mathematics
and science increased from 29 percent to 34 percent. The number of
minorities receiving such degrees increased from 35 percent to 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995. Texas also has done a better job in
supporting new teachers, according to the report. In 1994, 30
percent of teachers participated in formal induction programs,
compared with 22 percent in 1991. Nationally, 27 percent of
teachers participated in such programs in 1994. Parents in Texas
are having more of an influence on school policy than before. In
1994, 24 percent of public school principals said parent
associations have influenced school policy, compared with 14
percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hope the report will help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the Fountain of Youth. Ford Motor Co. says it has found
value in the opposite _ a suit of clothes that makes its wearer
feel old, with stiff joints, dim vision and weak muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Ford makes its young designers wear the old costume, on the
theory that it gives them empathy for aging customers, and
consequently will lead them to design cars that can be used more
easily by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is more direct: it has a focus group it
calls the Paragon Team, about 30 people with arthritis, vision
problems, artificial knees or hips, or other infirmities. It
videotapes the team members as they get in and out of vehicles, and
as they drive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best designers are young; at Ford, Fred Lupton, an
ergonomics engineer, describes them as ``new young whippersnappers,
coming in fresh off the college circuit.'' Lupton, himself only 32,
says young designers often have trouble with the concept of
building cars that can be operated safely and comfortably by older
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   So Ford has developed the ``third age suit'' _ ``third'' being
the company's diplomatic term for the period after middle age.
</P>
<P>
   The suit has rigid parts that restrict the movement of the neck,
torso, elbows and wrists. Designers use it to try, for example, to
get in the car and fasten the seat belt, which requires them to
reach across the torso to grab the belt and then insert the buckle
near the right hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really straining,'' Lupton said. ``Trying to bend over
and look down to your side becomes more difficult. With a neck
brace, you can't look down as easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Another exercise is to try to drive in reverse while wearing the
suit. Younger drivers generally twist their torsos and put their
chins over their right shoulders, to look out the back window when
they back up; wearing the suit, a driver has to do what many older
drivers with less neck flexibility must do: use the mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, special goggles simulate the effects on vision of
cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone needs the awareness the third-age suit can provide
them,'' Lupton said. ``Kind of getting a feel _ what it's like to
be arthritic, with a reduced range of motion and reduced
strength.'' Ford had one suit, which commuted between design
centers in Detroit and Dunton, England; it is currently making a
second.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, in contrast, finds people who suffer from
various afflictions of aging, and brings them in to try everything
on a car, including inserting and turning the ignition key.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Greig, the company's engineering group manager for harmony
and human factors, said one tester had suffered from polio and had
little strength in his upper body. In 10 cars, she said, he needed
a special tool to help twist the key; in the 11th, he could do it
unaided. That car, she said, was ``a competitor's vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   GM studied that design, she said, improved on it, and put it in
some Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   The company found that older drivers often caught their feet on
the piece of plastic just inside the door sill that holds the
carpeting in place. It was not obvious in person, but it showed up
on videotapes, she said. So GM switched to a more rounded design,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Paragon Team are unpaid volunteers, Ms. Greig
said; sometimes the company feeds them lunch. ``They are so excited
someone is asking them for their input,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say a major safety factor is size and contrast of
dashboard displays, and susceptibility to glare, which may be a
bigger problem for older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is designing all cars for drivers with limited
strength or dexterity; Ford and GM, for example, say that the Crown
Victoria and the Cadillac, respectively, are favored by older
drivers, but some older customers on fixed incomes will buy smaller
cars that may be designed mostly for recent high school graduates
looking for something inexpensive to buy and run. One challenge,
Ms. Greig said, is ``to accommodate the aging population without
alienating the able-bodied population.''
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, including factors like the ones mimicked by
Ford's third-age suit, older people have a high death rate in
crashes, even though many probably travel fewer miles by car than
younger people.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Safety Council, of every 100,000
people aged 65 to 74, about 17 die each year in vehicle accidents,
compared with 16 for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Among people 75 and older, the figure was nearly 33, almost
twice the rate for the general population. With growing seat-belt
use among younger people, safer cars and safer highways, the death
rate is falling in general, but it is rising for those 65 and
older.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the old people who are killed are pedestrians, but the
old people in the cars are also at risk.
</P>
<P>
   One design feature that engineers have not adapted to older
people is air bags. Nearly all of the adults killed by air bags in
low-speed crashes were elderly. Doctors say the reason is probably
that their bones cannot withstand the impact.

SOUVENIRS OF THIS LIFE TO EASE THE JOURNEY TO THE NEXT ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Texas)  (js) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ If you were packing your bags for a trip to
the afterlife, expecting to settle in for a spell, what would you
take? Something pretty? Something protective? Something
sentimental: a souvenir, maybe, of where you'd been?
</P>
<P>
   The ruling elite of ancient Egypt, who envisioned the hereafter
as a high-polish version of the here and now _ part work, part
play, part dress-for-dinner pomp _ kept all of these requirements
in mind when they chose their traveling gear. And some sense of
their taste in such matters can be gleaned from a gem of a show,
``Gifts of the Nile: Ancient Egyptian Faience,'' at the Rhode
Island School of Design Museum here.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be put off by the craft-specific title. Faience was a
medium with a particular allure for the Egyptians, and they used it
to create some of their most memorable art. The 200 or so objects
here _ sculptures, amulets, jewelry and dishes borrowed from museum
collections in the United States and Europe _ are small enough to
be carry-on luggage, but they are gorgeous and weighty with
information.
</P>
<P>
   Faience, a type of nonclay ceramic, began as a paste made from
two materials emblematic of Egyptian life: sand from the parched,
devouring desert, and water, associated with the nurturing Nile. A
coloring agent was added, usually powdered copper. Objects were
shaped by hand or in molds; kilns were heated, and the stage was
set for a magic act.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the kiln, faience was doughy and dull gray, but it
emerged transformed: rock-hard and coated with a succulent glaze,
often aquamarine, though the chromatic possibilities were wide. The
Egyptians called the results ``tjehnet,'' which, the show's catalog
explains, means luminescent, like the sun and stars. This seemingly
self-generated brilliance became emblematic of rebirth, which may
explain why the Egyptians valued faience as highly as they did and
why many spectacular examples are found in their tombs.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular is not too strong a word for much of the work in the
exhibition, organized by Florence Dunn Friedman, curator of ancient
art at the Rhode Island School of Design. True, the very earliest
sculptures of animals and insects, despite their naturalistic
verve, are a bit rough, as if their makers hadn't yet brought an
intractable medium fully under control. But a cluster of small
rectangular faience tiles on view gives a hint of a memorable,
vanished sight.
</P>
<P>
   About the size of belt buckles and glazed a soft turquoise, they
were among the 36,000 such tiles that once covered a room in the
Old Kingdom pyramid tomb of King Djoser. Individually, they are
nothing much; but when installed as part of a wrap-around sheet of
glowing color, they must have made a striking impact, as if the
viewer were floating on air or swimming under water.
</P>
<P>
   Faience was often used for royal portraits, and one of the
show's highlights, on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is
the likeness of King Amenhotep III in the form of a sphinx. The
sculpture is no larger than a doorstop or a bookend, but the
leonine body and youthful, smiling head feel gently monumental, and
the periwinkle-blue color has a visionary audacity.
</P>
<P>
   Other objects linked to royalty abound, including doll-size
faience wigs made for statues of kings or queens. And because of
its vivifying reputation, faience was closely identified with women
and fertility. The show includes several cult statues of the
grotesque god Bes, protector of infants and new mothers, as well as
images, possibly talismanic, of women as passive erotic subjects,
their limbs atrophied, their bodies marked with tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   The female realm also extended to the Good Housekeeping aspects
of domestic life, represented here by an array of cups and bowls
and a complete low-calorie brunch of faience fruits and veggies
(peas and cucumbers for starters; figs and nuts for dessert). For
the boudoir there are perfume flasks and cosmetic pots,
compartmentalized what's-it boxes with twistable lids, and a
bedside goblet shaped like a lotus, every leaf and petal
meticulously incised.
</P>
<P>
   To the Egyptian nobility, the lotus, like faience itself,
signified new life, the exalted state for which earthly existence
is a kind of dress rehearsal. In that world, one has the
impression, just about anything goes. It is life-plus, raised to
the nth degree, with all its oddities and wonders magnified,
exalted, turned urbanely surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Among objects created specifically for funerary use one finds,
for example, a pectoral on which the goddess Isis leans back
against her outstretched wings like Jean Harlow on a Deco sofa,
ready for her close-up. In one cult image, the god Thoth (patron of
writers, a thankless job) has a male model's build but a bird's
head; in another, he is a plump hermaphrodite wearing jackel-headed
carpet slippers. No wonder the face on a Middle Kingdom mummy's
mask, with its big eyes and raised brows, conveys a worried, ``what
next?'' look.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, of course, ``what next?'' was the one important
question, and the privileged classes of ancient Egyptians found
their answer. They may have had no more hard proof than anyone
else, but they were geniuses at inventing an afterlife, and ``Gifts
of the Nile'' captures its essence with a wish list cargo of
treasures suitable for sailing off into a faience-blue beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gifts of the Nile: Ancient Egyptian Faience'' remains at the
Rhode Island School of Design Museum, 224 Benefit St., Providence,
R.I., through Jan. 3. The show travels to the Kimbell Art Museum,
Fort Worth, Jan. 24 through April 25.

DESIGNER BILL BLASS, 76, SUFFERS MILD STROKE IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: New York) 
 
By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ New York designer Bill Blass was admitted Thursday
morning to Methodist Hospital after suffering what doctors
described as a mild stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old designer was in Houston to attend a benefit
luncheon for the Museum of Fine Arts. Blass will remain in
Methodist's Intensive Care Unit for further tests and at least 24
hours observation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Chu characterized Blass' problem as a TIA _ transient
ischemic attack _ or a mini-stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Blass said that he woke up in his hotel room about 4 a.m.
feeling ill. He later had breakfast in the hotel with longtime
friend and public relations consultant Helen O'Hagan, then appeared
at a breakfast for local clients at Saks and conducted at least one
interview before deciding to seek medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston event, sponsored by Saks Fifth Avenue, went on
without Blass, as models showed his Spring/Summer 1999 collection.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his humor and sarcasm, Blass quipped on the his way to
the hospital, ``At least I don't have to see that collection
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has felt fine recently except for some problems with
what he described as possibly pinched nerves in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   While he was having trouble putting some words together,
according to doctors, immediate tests indicated that there appears
to be no evidence of paralysis or other lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   The designer said in an afternoon interview from his hospital
bed that he had emerged from the MRI testing unit to find a priest
waiting in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you here for me?'' Blass said he asked the priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' the priest replied, much to the
designer's relief.
</P>
<P>
   At 76, Blass is considered one of the premier U.S. fashion
designers and one of the first designers to establish New York as
the sportswear capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years he has cut back on the number of days he spent
in his New York studio, preferring his country estate and the
company of his dogs instead.
</P>
<P>
   Blass also confirmed that in recent months he has been trying to
sell his company.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the camels hair jackets, cashmere sweater sets, finely
tailored suits, basic black dresses and luxury evening wear he
designed, Blass is also known for many licensed products
manufactured under his name, licenses that have numbered in the
40s. These include not only items such as belts, scarves, bags,
sunglasses, fragrances and household linens, but Bill Blass
outfitted Lincoln Continentals and a recent line of home
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   He dresses celebrities such as Barbara Walters, Nancy Kissinger,
Angelica Huston, Veronica Hearst, the editors of Harper's Bazaar
and Vogue, and former first ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush.
Recently a younger generation, led by their mothers' examples, has
increasingly beat a path to his door.
</P>
<P>
   Blass is his own best publicist, joking and gossiping in his
deep, booming voice. A generous man known for his love of antiques
and books, he has served on the board of the New York Public
Library to which he donated $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   He served three and a half years in the U.S. Army during World
War II, before turning to designing on New York's Seventh Avenue,
and his was one of the first names of U.S. designers to be
recognized abroad.

AMC ENTERTAINMENT CO-CHAIRMAN RESUMES TREATMENT FOR ESOPHAGEAL
CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Stan Durwood, co-chairman of AMC
Entertainment Inc., has started treatment for a recurrence of
esophageal cancer that was first detected in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Durwood, 78, plans to remain active in the day-to-day operations
of the Kansas City company while undergoing radiation treatment,
AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   News that Durwood is again undergoing medical treatment renewed
speculation that AMC, one of the nation's largest theater
companies, will become an acquisition target. AMC shares gained 1
7//8 Wednesday on the American Stock Exchange and closed at 18
7//8, up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same stock run-up occurred the first time AMC revealed
Durwood had cancer, on Jan. 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Nolte said the scenario was different this time.
</P>
<P>
   When Durwood was first diagnosed with cancer, the company
created a succession plan, which included naming Peter Brown as
president of AMC Entertainment and Phil Singleton as president of
American Multi-Cinema Inc., the operating division of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May 1998, Brown was named co-chairman of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our major shareholders understand that management
succession is in place,'' Nolte said. ``That puts us in control of
our own fate and our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The news should not affect the Power &AMP; Light District proposed
for downtown Kansas City. The entertainment and retail project, a
longtime dream of Durwood's, is being developed by Centertainment,
a subsidiary of AMC.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Kansas City Tax Increment Financing Commission
approved the formal agreement with Power &AMP; Light LLC. The agreement
now goes to the Kansas City Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement puts into writing all the conditions the
commission and the City Council had said must be met before the
city puts any public money into the $454 million project that could
revitalize a large section of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The project would rely on an estimated $176 million in
city-assisted financing supported in part by tax increment
financing. That allows developers to use a part of new real estate
taxes created by a project to help pay for improvements.

TWA TO BUY 125 PLANES FROM BOEING, AIRBUS IN MOVE TO MODERNIZE
FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Trans World Airlines has agreed to acquire 125 new
planes for its fleet, the biggest aircraft order in the company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the estimated $3.9 billion order, which includes
an option on 125 additional planes, TWA will receive 50 narrow-body
jets from the Boeing Co. and 75 later from Europe's Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   The order continues a modernization effort by the struggling
airline that will cut the average age of its planes by more than
half. But the upgrading of the fleet _ at one time the oldest in
the industry _ has raised concerns about the fate of TWA's overhaul
base in Kansas City, which employs more than 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald L. Gitner, TWA's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the new aircraft would reduce the average age of TWA's planes
from 19 years in 1996 to 11.3 years by January 2000. As more new
planes arrive and older ones are replaced, the average age of a TWA
jet is expected to drop to 7.3 years by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery of the 50 Boeing 717-299 aircraft will begin in
February 2000, replacing TWA's DC-9 fleet. TWA will then begin
taking delivery on 50 of Airbus' new planes, the A318, in 2003. An
additional 25 Airbus planes from its A320 series will begin being
delivered in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   TWA already is scheduled to receive 37 previously ordered planes
from Boeing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new aircraft are medium-range jets with about 110 seats. TWA
said the Boeing 717 would save the airline 35 percent in operating
costs over the DC-9s it now operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give TWA a modern fleet that is second to none,''
Gitner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   How TWA's new planes will affect its maintenance operations has
been the subject of much speculation. Employment at TWA's overhaul
base in Kansas City has shrunk in recent years, and local union
officials are concerned about what will happen to workers as the
newer planes require less maintenance. For instance, the Boeing
727, one of the oldest planes still operating in the industry, will
be retired from TWA's fleet by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   TWA has about 3,650 employees in Kansas City, including about
2,200 at its overhaul base. TWA's lease with the city on its Kansas
City facilities expires in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gitner declined to comment on the new order's effect on TWA's
maintenance operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of evaluating that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But establishing a modern fleet, Gitner said, ``can only bode
well for all TWA employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gitner said that the new orders would give TWA an opportunity to
expand operations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be able to go into a growth mode by the year 2001,''
he said. ``But that would depend on the economy at that time, the
competition, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists union, which represents about 16,500 TWA
employees, declined to comment on TWA's aircraft order Wednesday
because of its contract talks with the company. If no progress is
made during a current series of meetings, the National Mediation
Board could allow a 30-day countdown to begin, after which the
union would be able to strike.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, union officials have criticized TWA's strategy of
shrinking the airline, particularly its international operations,
and focusing more on its St. Louis hub. Union officials were vocal
after TWA lost money in its third quarter, a period in which most
other airlines reported record profits.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts commended TWA's latest aircraft acquisition, saying
that the airline must continue its strategy of trying to become a
carrier for business travelers with a Midwestern hub.
</P>
<P>
   TWA declined to discuss the financing of its two orders
Wednesday, except to say the planes would be leased and not owned.
That will require less cash from the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Boyd, president of Aviation Systems Research Corp. in
Golden, Colo., said TWA probably got bargain deals from Boeing and
Airbus, both of which have experienced slow sales on the aircraft
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 717 and Airbus 318 are about the same size, Boyd
said, and any disadvantages of acquiring similar aircraft from two
manufacturers were more than offset by the cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think TWA found two manufacturers that were desperate to get
some sales in the books,'' he said. ``I bet TWA whipsawed
them...and got excellent deals from both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said the airline would have to change and modernize its
fleet for its business plan to work in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely positive for TWA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts continue to wonder about TWA's long-term
prospects. After emerging from two bankruptcies in the 1990s, TWA
remains strapped for cash and continues to have problems posting a
profit, as the last quarter showed. The company has had only two
profitable quarters in the past two years and has poor credit
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beyer, editor of Avmark Inc.'s industry newsletter, said TWA
eventually might have to find a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we've been saying that for years, and they've
managed to stay independent,'' he said. ``Maybe TWA will survive as
the smallest of the major carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyer said TWA was ordering planes now in anticipation of the
next upturn in the airline industry's economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something they have to do,'' he said. ``TWA is hoping
that they are timing the market so that when these new planes
arrive, the industry will be in the midst of a travel boom so they
can pay for them.''

COMMENTARY: ON CLEANSING AMERICA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know three things for certain, and standing in the muck of
Bill Clinton's character amidst the remains of his presidency, it
helps cleanse us to think about them.
</P>
<P>
   We know that undertaking the impeachment process, wherever it
leads, was what the Constitution provided for a president who had
so betrayed the people as to lie to their faces and lie under oath,
and even as he cringes and whines, so fears the consequence of his
behavior that he despoils the meaning of contrition by refusing to
admit what he did.
</P>
<P>
   And we know that the Clinton story is not the essence of
America, nor close to it. It is one nasty episode in U.S. history,
which at least we confronted not sometime in the future when it was
too late, but while he and we could confront each other.
</P>
<P>
   And we know, with gratitude to those who created America's
particular system of government, that every national Election Day
we will get a chance to select a leader. On such a day, perhaps the
next, we will again choose a person whom voters can regard with
respect while he serves and history will remember with approval
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Those are kernel American truths, whether Bill Clinton is
allowed to serve out his second term or not. But there is no
constitutional reason for Americans to carry for two more years
this man who made himself the great American moral albatross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a crook,'' cried Richard Nixon. ``I am not Richard
Nixon,'' cries Clinton through his lawyers. ``We are not fools,''
is what Americans should reply through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the impeachment hearings, the Clinton defense army
kept informing us that presidential lying under oath was not as bad
as Watergate. That line of non-reasoning cements Nixon's
achievements in presidential depravity as the minimum standard for
impeachment _ which would have been a big surprise to him and his
fellow conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not lie simply to cover up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. He lied and lied, under oath and directly to the people,
and lied to aides who became a chain letter of lies, to build a
wall of lies around the White House. The wall was built purposely
to save his job if Congress decided to travel the impeachment road.
</P>
<P>
   For a president, there are phrases for that, which follow Nixon
beyond the grave. They are called obstruction of justice and abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton case the White House line that he should not be
impeached because most people lie to cover up sexual infidelity is
sour comedy. How many people swear they cannot remember if they
were ever alone with their lover? Could the president please
provide a list of people he thinks might have been in the room with
him and Ms. Lewinsky while they were making love?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he is not most people, but legally a person unique in
the land, in privileges and power. Weaving a skein of lies to cover
up his conduct while president is not one of these privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, surely, it was not the intent of the writers of the
Constitution or of the former colonies that adopted it that the
president should go unpunished for acts that would land any officer
under him in jail _ like adultery with a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has large adulterous company in America, but he is the
only one in the country for whom ``Hail to the Cheat'' is played.
</P>
<P>
   We are ankle-deep in Clinton's own character-gook. We are
trapped in his own sick decision to risk the presidency for
back-office sex with a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Even people on his payroll say what he did was reprehensible,
and defiling to the presidency. But now these folk say the House of
Representatives should not impeach him and send him to the Senate
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his choice. The obligation of the House is to make
its choice _impeach. The Senate would then make its own choice _
convict or not.
</P>
<P>
   The other option _ House censure without impeachment _ is
evasive, and possibly illegal. It can be wiped from the records by
any Democratic Congress, as the censure of Andrew Jackson was torn
from the books by his party.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, because America gives us blessed chances to scrub
ourselves, the country will feel clean again. Following the
constitutional process laid down to deal with the Bill Clintons
will make us fresher faster.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL JUDGE PROMOTES INNOVATION
 &HT;    Eds: Expands quote from Jackson in 3rd graf.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why shouldn't Microsoft enjoy the fruits of victory
if it can improve the technology it licensed from a smaller rival,
the judge presiding over the Microsoft antitrust trial asked
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson posed his pointed
question after James Gosling, who created a programming language
known as Java, argued that Microsoft's high command had sought to
undermine the ``write once, run anywhere'' version of Java created
by Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't they simply grasp the significance of what you were
doing and run with that and produce in a very short time a better
version than you had?'' Jackson said, turning to Gosling as he was
about to leave the witness stand. ``And they simply couldn't wait
for you to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They represented it as better,'' Gosling, who is also Sun's
chief scientist, replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Gosling added, ``their definition of better is tied
into the Windows platform. If they had technical difficulties with
what we were doing, we would have worked very hard with them to go
through a process of resolving them. But they were trying to force
us to swallow various poison pills. There was no inclination to
discuss it, to say, 'let's work this out.' It was boom _ here it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is trying the landmark case without a jury,
appeared somewhat mollified by Gosling's response. ``You were
trying to bring other people along,'' Jackson noted as Gosling
nodded in assent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge's sudden intervention seemed to unnerve David
Boies, the government's lead attorney, who had just told Jackson
that he had completed his response to Microsoft's three-day
cross-examination of the Sun scientist. Instead, Boies rose once
more to hammer home his main points until Jackson, eager to finally
call it a day, said, ``I think you are finished with your
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, the normally unflappable Boies sought to
recover from what Microsoft's attorneys clearly took to be a signal
that, after eight weeks of testimony, the trial seemed to be going
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two aspects to the judge's question,'' Boies said.
It reflects a fair point that Microsoft is making in
cross-examination _ one of the things that was going on was
Microsoft's attempt to compete on the merits and come up with
better software. But ... in addition, Microsoft was forcing people
to take its version and preventing people from having access on a
level playing field to the version submitted by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that if all that was going on in the Java controversy was
Microsoft's attempt to come up with a better version, the judge
would believe, as he indicated in his question, that there's
nothing wrong with simply trying to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if the evidence is, as Dr. Gosling
testified, that ... Microsoft attempted to inhibit the distribution
of Sun's cross-platform Java and forced people to take the
Microsoft non-compatible version for the explicit reason of
preserving its monopoly, you probably would not have had Microsoft,
in its internal documents, describing its efforts to 'pollute'
Java.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 trial days, it remains to be seen whether the
government's contention that Microsoft pursued an illegal pattern
of seeking to sabotage any outside technology that might pose a
challenge to its near-monopoly in the operating system for personal
computers will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The next corporate officer in a parade of witnesses who will try
to make that point will be William Harris, president and chairman
of Intuit Corp. Although Microsoft, which has $17 billion in cash
in its coffers, had sought to buy Intuit, it pulled back with
Justice Department officials signaled they would move to block the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, however, will not take the witness stand until Jan. 4,
when the trial is scheduled to resume after a holiday break. Next
week's witness will be Princeton computer professor Edward Felten,
an expert on Windows' browsing technology.

OWNER OF GUN USED BY BOY IN FATAL SHOOTING MAY FACE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Forty-three percent of the American
households with children have guns, according to a survey taken
last month. One of those houses sits atop a hill in Kansas City,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   In that house last Friday, 10-year-old Derrick Morris was shot
once in the face. He died before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Derrick's 12-year-old cousin has been charged as a juvenile
with involuntary manslaughter. He was released from custody
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic said charges
may be filed against whoever left that gun in a place where
children could get to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't locked up, we know that,'' Tomasic said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy occurred just after 8 p.m. Friday in the basement of
the small house after Derrick and his cousin apparently found a
revolver. The gun belonged to one of the adults who lives at the
house, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No adults were home at the time of the shooting, but a
6-year-old child and 4-month-old infant also were at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that the victim and his cousin were playing with the
revolver, a weapon without a safety lock. Originally, the officers
who investigated the shooting said Derrick's death appeared to be
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But Tomasic said that under the law, a child who commits a crime
for which an adult would be charged, also may be charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be done,'' Tomasic said. ``This definitely
was a reckless killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of the criminal case involving the
12-year-old boy, Derrick's shooting underscores the need to secure
guns inside homes, said law enforcement officials and an emergency
room physician at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (guns) are not doing you any good when you're not at
home,'' said Kansas City, Kan., Detective William Howard Jr. ``You
need to lock them up and secure them when you're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Guns in a household should be treated like any other potential
hazard for youngsters, said Howard and others. For example, adults
routinely keep medicines and toxic cleaning supplies out of
children's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't leave our keys in the car when we're not at home,
even if the car's in the garage, so that the kids won't drive
off,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also should make sure no guns are left unsecured in
households where children visit, said Denise Dowd, an emergency
room physician who works with the Center for Childhood Safety at
Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Besides finding that 43 percent of the households in America
with children ages 3 to 17 have guns, a Peter Hart Research
Associates survey found that the guns were kept loaded at least
some of the time in 23 percent of those households.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd suggests that parents telephone before sending their
children to an unfamiliar household to make sure that guns are
locked up. Dowd admits that making that call can be difficult
because of shyness about invading privacy and the
sometimes-political issue of gun ownership. Nevertheless, she
recommends a bold approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are very intriguing and very attractive to kids,'' Dowd
said. ``All we're talking about is keeping kids safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other precautions:
</P>
<P>
   - Keep all guns unloaded and locked up away from the ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   - Don't leave keys to gun closets where children can find them.
</P>
<P>
   - Teach children not to touch guns and to tell an adult
immediately if they find a gun, even if it's in someone else's
house.
</P>
<P>
   - Children in households with firearms should participate in
hunter safety or gun safety courses.
</P>
<P>
   - Familiarize youngsters with firearms to discourage curiosity
and fascination.
</P>
<P>
   - Teach youngsters three basic rules: Assume all guns are
loaded; never put a finger on the trigger; and never point a gun.

BEWARE OF THE FELINE THIEF ON THE PROWL

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Like any member of the journalistic tribe, Scoop _ the
black cat born under a newspaperman's bed _ never passes up a
chance at food.
</P>
<P>
   It's well known, among people in our trade, that if you invite
colleagues around for a party, you'd better double the order for
whatever you're serving.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, the locusts won't make off with the silver. But it
pays to lock up anything in the house you don't want eaten or
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Scoop comes out of that tradition, and if you forget it even for
a moment, he will, as they say, eat your lunch.
</P>
<P>
   He's a lean, somewhat spidery creature. We all were lean once,
though I could tell him from experience that will change. He also
is amazingly agile, and has uncommonly long arms _ the famous
boardinghouse reach.
</P>
<P>
   Say there is some especially delectable morsel that you have
kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days as a test of
character, an exercise in deferred satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you come to the considered judgment that the proper
moment has arrived. You open the refrigerator, remove the saved
delight and turn aside for a moment to get a fork from the drawer
of flatware.
</P>
<P>
   Bad mistake!
</P>
<P>
   Turning back to pick up the saucer, you find the morsel gone.
Scoop has materialized from nowhere, and is looking at you levelly,
without remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Or you pass the kitchen counter with a freshly made sandwich on
a plate. You are a moving target and thus, you would imagine, safe.
But arriving at the table, you discover your planned snack has been
reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the counter, Scoop is attending to the other half.
</P>
<P>
   He is gifted. And he is very, very fast.
</P>
<P>
   The only talent I've ever seen in a class with his was among the
pickpockets of Paris, with whom we became well-acquainted in the
year we lived there.
</P>
<P>
   One of them took a 200-franc bill from my wife's hand in a
museum line, and did it with such dexterity that by the time she
knew she'd been hit, the thief was vaulting a wall and disappearing
along the quay of the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   Another explored my coat pockets during a ride in a crowded
Metro car. I remember glancing at him. He was a striking character
_ swarthy face sharp as a hawk's, with a thick scar down one cheek.
He ignored me, staring straight ahead, though his clever hand was
busy all the while.
</P>
<P>
   And at the next stop, in the last instant before the door
closed, he darted out and away, having only taken a small notebook
instead of my wallet by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   After some months I was alert to them and the way they worked,
often in pairs or threes, and spent a whole day following a group
of them, watching them relieve tourists of their goods.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, they repaired to a fast-food place to buy burgers and
milk shakes from the morning's take. They worked hard. And,
regardless of what you might think of it, you have to admire anyone
who's that good at a trade.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I feel about Scoop. But there's an important
difference.
</P>
<P>
   We always knew that, when winter came and the raw winds blew in
from the Channel or down from the North Sea, the pickpockets would
load their caravans and migrate southward from Paris to some warmer
place.
</P>
<P>
   Or our year there would end, and we would leave.
</P>
<P>
   But Scoop's not going anywhere. And neither are we. We're all in
this together, for the duration. So it looks like a food fight to
the finish.

more than 15 million people. The transaction gets Prudential out of
the increasingly competitive managed-care industry, while giving
Aetna, which earlier this year bought New York Life's healthcare

FOR MANY WORKERS, BAD BOSSES OVERSHADOW GOOD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Wouldn't want the happy hustle of the season to put a
rosy glow on the workplace. No, sir. There are plenty of unhappy
workers out there.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that you couldn't even get on the {disgruntled.com}
Internet site this week? Its server was so overloaded by so many
teed-off workers trying to feed it or read it that it temporarily
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   What's the deal? Times are good. Why are so many people so
alienated, so eager to share tales of workplace revenge taken
against bad bosses?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a Letterman-like list of reasons I hear and see. They're
printed partly to commiserate but mostly to plead with those who
have the power to make needed changes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: Times are good. Good people can get good jobs
elsewhere. They will leave _ they are leaving _ unfulfilling,
unhappy workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   And then employers wonder why their costly turnover rates are
high.
</P>
<P>
   The gripes:
</P>
<P>
   10. Managers that play obvious and undeserved favorites.
</P>
<P>
   9. Staffs downsized so far that employees think they can never
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   8. Lack of up-to-date, efficient, ergonomic and appropriate
tools to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   7. Inadequate time or money compensation for the added strain of
on-the-job traveling.
</P>
<P>
   6. Too many, too long and too unproductive meetings.
</P>
<P>
   5. No format _ indeed, no welcome mat _ for ideas from the front
line to be shared with management.
</P>
<P>
   4. A widening gap between executive salaries and others' pay.
</P>
<P>
   3. One-size-fits-all annual staff evaluation forms that provide
little individual recognition or timely feedback.
</P>
<P>
   2. Company budget tightening that eliminates employee
recognitions (parties, gifts, awards and so forth) while the bosses
still have big expense accounts and club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   1. Managers who are stingy with public praise but quick with
public criticism.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, this must be said: Good workplace relationships are
a two-way street. Shirking, irking workers don't deserve rewards.
They deserve the boot. Appeals for recognition apply only to those
who perform honestly and well.
</P>
<P>
   But remember: Several years of annual average raises that barely
crept ahead of inflation have not left a cushion of good will.
Workers who have performed honestly and well complain that their
rewards haven't been much greater than those who barely toed the
line.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad when the good performers need disgruntled.com, too.
</P>
<P>
   Swearing update: In this column last week, I wrote about Charles
Corry, a Colorado man who swore excessively at work. Complaints
from a Christian co-worker about Corry's taking the name of the
Lord in vain contributed to his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Corry, who testified that he was a Buddhist, sued on the basis
of religious discrimination. He contended that his supervisor told
him the Ten Commandments were followed in that workplace. The
company disputed his account.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-day trial in Denver, a federal jury this week
decided that Corry had been wrongfully fired. Because of
``intentional interference with his work contract,'' he was awarded
$34,160 in lost wages and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The jury ruled against Corry, though, on his allegation of
religious discrimination.

WORLD WAR I VETERAN REMEMBERED AS MAN WHO `LIVED TO THE FULLEST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEVADA, Mo. _ Life was a long walk for McKinley Wooden. Friends
say he lived at a steady pace, standing straight and tall, always
moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   In World War I, his battery walked 100 miles through the
blood-soaked fields of France. As a cattle rancher, he would stride
through his lots for hours. When a young neighbor got fidgety, he'd
say: ``Walk, don't run.''
</P>
<P>
   His life's journey took him all over the world, but it ended
Wednesday where it began 103 years ago. He was buried in a Vernon
County field, less than 10 miles from his birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Most didn't make it as far as he did. No relatives. No former
mates from his Army battery, not even commanding officer Harry S.
Truman.
</P>
<P>
   He outlived them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a life lived to the fullest,'' said the Rev. Leonard W.
McIntire, a friend of 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some joined his journey near the end. For that, they were sad.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Richard Kempker met Wooden on Veterans Day when he
received the French Legion of Honor at the Liberty Memorial in
Kansas City. Kempker now commands Wooden's old unit, Battery D of
the Missouri National Guard's 129th Battalion.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden, who lived in Lee's Summit, Mo., couldn't get up from his
wheelchair. He sat as rigid as a statue while the medal was placed
around his neck. Dignified. This was the man, after all, whom
Truman had described in a letter as ``the straightest, stiffest
soldier I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempker and Wooden, two Missouri farm boys 72 years apart,
swapped stories. Kempker invited him to the battery post in
Independence. They were going to wait until spring when it got
warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Kempker stood as rigidly as Wooden used to while the
current members of Battery D carried his casket to the cemetery.
Kempker saluted the casket with a white-gloved hand as a bugler
played taps. The grass reflected in his polished black shoes.
</P>
<P>
   As his mates fired rifles in a salute, Kempker didn't flinch. He
stared at the casket, draped in an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Then he closed his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking that I wished I'd known him better,'' he
said.

ERICSSON TO CUT 10,000 MORE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Va., Calif., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Ericsson AB, the Swedish company that has been
aggressively reorganizing its business to resist growing
competition in its key cellular-phone business, said Thursday that
its fourth-quarter profit would be 15 percent to 20 percent lower
than expected and that it would cut 10,000 more jobs because of
flagging demand for its phones and public switching systems.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which warned investors in October to expect slower
sales because of economic turmoil in Asia and Latin America, said
it would announce a 10 percent cut in its work force, or 10,000
jobs, in January. That would be in addition to 10,000 jobs that the
company is eliminating as part of a cost-cutting effort begun a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson reported that revenue from cellular phones in the third
quarter fell by 1.6 percent, to 10.82 billion Swedish kronor, or
$1.35 billion, from 11 billion kronor in the period a year earlier.
But the company said it had maintained its global market share,
which is 16 percent, according to Dataquest, the market research
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call, which tracks company earnings,
said they expected Ericsson to earn 87 cents a share in 1998 and
$1.05 a share in 1999, up from 81 cents a share in 1997. But the
announcement of the new job cuts reflects serious worries that,
despite undiminished confidence in its long-term prospects, slower
growth in many of its key global markets in 1999 will dampen sales
of cellular phones and phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the earnings warning Thursday, shares of Ericsson fell
more than 22 percent, to 183 kronor. Its American depository
receipts fell $4.75, to $24.125. In its wake, shares of other
telephone suppliers, including Alcatel of France and Royal Philips
Electronics, turned lower. Shares of other telephone-equipment
makers also fell. Motorola declined $2.50, to $57.5625, ADRs of
Finland's Nokia lost $2.3125, to $106, and Lucent Technologies
dropped $2.1875, to $97.1875.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow Ericsson, the world's third-largest wireless
phone company after Nokia and Motorola, interpreted the
announcement as an effort by Ericsson to manage market expectations
and said it reflected disappointingly low growth in public
contracts from Asia and Latin America, where a recovery is taking
longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Douillet, who follows Ericsson at Lehman Brothers
Securities in London, said he had downgraded his earnings
estimates. ``But it is not a major downgrading,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson's cellular-phone sales have been hurt by slower
economic growth in emerging markets, and while signs are emerging
of gradual recovery in some Asian countries, Sven-Christer Nilsson,
Ericsson's chief executive, said that ``wider repercussions on
global demand'' were depressing sales and income.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ericsson began moving swiftly to increase
productivity and improve earnings, including cutting 10,000 jobs
worldwide. The company now employs about 100,000 people, including
about 9,000 in the United States. The company's U.S. operations are
based in Richardson, Texas, and it has major operations in North
Carolina, Virginia, California and New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lars Stolberg, Ericsson's spokesman, said the additional job
cuts would most likely total 10,000 workers. He said Ericsson was
more than halfway through the last round of layoffs and had not yet
decided where the additional job cuts would come.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson said in a statement that Ericsson's nine-month results
were also depressed by a shift in demand to lower-priced cellular
phones, notably those linked to prepaid phone services, which now
account for about a third of the large European market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the shift was particularly strong in key European
markets like Britain and France. Such prepaid cards generally
enable customers to own wireless phones and receive unlimited calls
while allowing them to make a limited number of outgoing calls at a
fixed rate. These phones are usually low-priced and have
correspondingly low margins for manufacturers. Nilsson said that
accounted for a lower operating profit despite increased sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson has had to act decisively to resist the growing
competition from global competitors, including Nokia, which this
year overtook Ericsson as the largest supplier of digital cellular
phones to the United States, the world's largest market, doubling
its market share to 40.3 percent, from 19.8 percent in 1997,
according to Dataquest. At the same time, Ericsson's share
plummeted to 20.6 percent, from 41.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have praised Ericsson's efforts to revamp its
operations, and they say fresh technology in the cellular-phone
business should enable Ericsson to regain its past momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Redman, who follows the cellular-phone market for Yankee
Group, a consulting concern in Boston, said much of Nokia's gains
in the United States could be attributed to its success in landing
lucrative contracts to supply digital cellular phones with advanced
technology to AT&AMP;T, the largest U.S. cellular-phone operator, which
introduced the system with considerable fanfare earlier this year.
``So 1998 for Ericsson was not a great year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson is well placed, however, to compete with a new
generation of digital cellular-phone technology that is expected to
be introduced in markets in Asia and elsewhere, with broader
capabilities than current models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be a much larger market, and also a global market,''
he said. ``So on the long-term growth cycle Ericsson is well
prepared.''

THE POLITICS OF A SENATE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who was
defeated for re-election last month, is neither a sweet guy nor a
fan of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever said he was stupid. So when he warned this week
that a House impeachment of Clinton would be a self-defeating,
``grave mistake'' for his party, it was worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for the president's Democratic defenders to
argue that a prolonged trial in the GOP-controlled Senate triggered
by a House impeachment would be a political disaster not only for
the country but for the party in charge. They are naturally
predisposed to paint a grim picture to save Clinton further legal
liability and embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But it is quite another thing when a dedicated Republican
partisan like D'Amato sees it as a political calamity as well.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato himself was burned two years ago by displaying excessive
zeal as chairman of a Senate committee investigating charges that
the president and first lady were involved in a corrupt Whitewater
land speculation deal and covered it up. The hearings ended
inconclusively, having proved nothing. Polls showed 55 percent of
those surveyed disapproved of the partisan way D'Amato handled the
sessions. Even 4 out of 10 Republicans disapproved of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   What D'Amato is saying now is so obvious the wonder is that it
doesn't seem to have occurred to more than a handful of other
Republicans. House GOP leaders are virtually in hiding, washing
their hands of the whole affair and pretending only House Judiciary
Committee chairman Henry Hyde has a duty to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Senate to spend weeks and weeks mired in this doesn't
make sense,'' D'Amato says. In his mind, House approval of any
impeachment articles ``would result in great and unnecessary
discord.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discord is already here. It is the chief consequence of the
partisan posturing in the House committee, where the anti-Clinton
outcome is preordained. No member of either party is listening to
the debate, despite serious disputes about the evidence and the
process.
</P>
<P>
   No minds are being changed. There will be no crossing of party
lines for anything so flimsy as principle or conscience. Chairman
Hyde, once highly respected, has only a 31 percent favorable rating
in this week's CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
   The committee subscribes to the flippant Gerald Ford theory that
an impeachable offense is whatever they decide it is. That is not
the way most Americans think the constitutional system ought to
work.
</P>
<P>
   After the Judiciary Committee votes to impeach, the House will
be recalled next week to pass judgment on the president's conduct
and the committee's verdict. The seriousness of this act is not
reflected in the time expected to be spent on this issue. One hour
of debate is the current estimate!
</P>
<P>
   That casual approach demonstrates beyond a doubt the real truth
of this ugly episode. It is not rooted in the law, despite all the
pretense to the contrary. The law is fuzzy and can be interpreted
to suit its manipulators. Except for the perjury question, the
charges against the president spring mainly from investigators'
rage that he failed to passively confess to everything they
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   This is only about hard-edged politics. But politics is a
two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   The danger to Republicans of continuing this farce is that the
public may conclude the GOP majority is unable to meet its
responsibility to govern. The party seems accountable only to its
own conservative furies, not to the country _ which statistically,
remember, is only about one-third Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In the November election and the public opinion polls, a
majority of voters have made it clear they do not want Clinton
kicked out of office for lying about sex. His job approval rating
is in the upper 60s, where it has remained all during the scandal.
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll this week showed 59 percent of those
surveyed do not believe he deserves impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   What voters really want is national bipartisan cooperation on
the basic economic and social issues before the country. This has
worked for the popular moderate GOP governors and for the
president, who talks a real good game on this subject. But we don't
hear it from the impeachment-oriented GOP congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For any semblance of credibility, a Senate trial would have to
seem fair and garner some Democratic support, which means providing
more opportunity for the White House to present its side than the
House committee has allowed. The president, having selfishly
decided not to resign, can be counted on to fight this every way he
can.
</P>
<P>
   That means calling as witnesses Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and
other dreary participants, rehashing in person all the repulsive,
prurient details we have heard on tape. It could go on for months.
It wouldn't be pretty, and most folks would blame the Republicans
for forcing it upon the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some unanticipated smoking gun, in the end Clinton will
still be president. There is no two-thirds majority to convict him
in the Senate. The circus will have been for nothing, except to
expose the arrogance of the clowns.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a good prescription for consolidating and enlarging
the GOP congressional majority in the 200O elections.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is deaf to this reality. It cares
not a twig about history or the political swamp it is leading the
Republican Party into. The question now is whether a majority of
the full House has more common sense. If it does, it will vote to
censure Clinton instead.

`THE MOMENT OF AHA': THUMB-TWIDDLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I am your guardian buzzard,'' declares the actor in
black plumage.
</P>
<P>
   What, you ask, is a guardian buzzard? You'll get no satisfactory
answer out of ``The Moment of Aha,'' a thumb-twiddling bit of
ephemera at the Ohio Theater. Although Leslie Nipkow's play is
billed as a dark comedy, it might be more aptly described as a bad
accident. No one emerges unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   This fitful, hammily acted piece offers up the less than
scintillating thesis that while camera work is fairly
straightforward, love is a twisty road. Moving backward and forward
in the life of Lydia (Missy Hargraves), a New York photographer,
the play records her sterile suburban upbringing, symbolized by a
mother who never takes off her oven mitts, and her failure to make
a fulfilling romantic connection.
</P>
<P>
   Among the play's many trivial conceits, the silliest is Lydia's
relationship with the buzzard, played with offensive smugness by
Sean Runnette. (Ms. Nipkow hits rock bottom in a vulgar scene in
which Lydia and the buzzard exchange fatuous observations at the
expense of a famous prize-winning photograph of a vulture perched
near a dying African child.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moment of Aha'' continually mistakes overly plotted
coincidence for whimsy. In one flashback, for instance, Lydia's
father (Robert O'Gorman) dies of an allergic reaction to the bats
he wants to exterminate in his basement. And it completely misses
the opportunity to take satirical advantage of Lydia's job. She
photographs vegetables for the pages of Martha Stewart Living, a
fact that is mentioned only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   The visually dexterous director, Richard Caliban, who has done
well by the works of Mac Wellman and Will Sheffer, is at sea with
this abstruse material. When all else fails, he has the actors move
to recorded music, the kind of vapid act that puts you in mind of
that German variety-show parody on ``Saturday Night Live'' in which
Mike Meyers would announce, apropos of nothing, ``This is the
moment on `Shprockets' when we dance!''

HASBRO TO END SUIT WITH $6 MILLION DONATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasbro Inc. will donate $6 million in toys, books and money for
children, to settle an antitrust suit in which it is charged with
unfair trade practices intended to withhold popular toys from some
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, the maker of GI Joe dolls and
Milton Bradley games will donate $3.57 million worth of toys for
distribution to children in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia. Hasbro, the world's second-largest toy maker,
will also pay the states $2.38 million, which is to be used for
toys, books and other educational material.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is subject to court approval, settles a
lawsuit that New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco brought
against Toys ``R'' Us, Hasbro and two other toy makers. The suit
accused the companies of colluding to prevent competing retailers
from offering toys at lower prices. Eventually, 43 other states
joined the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general accused Toys ``R'' Us, the world's largest
toy retailer, with brokering an illegal agreement among the
manufacturers to ensure that warehouse clubs could obtain certain
popular toys only in ``combination packs,'' which cost consumers
more and whose prices could not be compared with items sold by Toys
``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hasbro, the suit named Mattel Inc. and Little
Tikes Co. as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the settlement was not an admission of
wrongdoing. ``It's settling a case to avoid the time and expense of
protracted litigation,'' said Wayne Charness, a spokesman for
Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us also said the settlement did not change its
position on the case. ``Toys `R' Us has always acted fairly and in
the consumer's best interest,'' said Rebecca Caruso, a spokeswoman
for the retailer. ``But certainly we understand Hasbro's desire to
resolve the issue without protracted litigation, particularly since
the settlement involves a charitable component.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Toys ``R'' Us was in mediation on the case that might
lead to a similar settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco said the agreement with Hasbro was a victory for
consumers. ``What better way to settle an antitrust probe against a
toy manufacturer than to secure its agreement to distribute free
toys?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York will receive 30,000 toys worth about $241,000 as its
part of the settlement. In each state, the toys, books and other
educational material will be distributed through the Marine Corps'
``Toys for Tots'' program.

IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS ENTER THE VIDEO AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   A News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In defending President Clinton, lawyer Abbe Lowell
treated the House Judiciary Committee Thursday to a slick,
MTV-style video show aimed at viewers at home as well as members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-hour presentation, Lowell used four video screens
in the committee hearing room to jump quickly from subject to
subject, patching previously unpublicized video excerpts of
Clinton's testimony in the Paula Jones case and snippets of earlier
testimony by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowell extravaganza even had a video segment showing only a
tape recorder while the audio carried the voices of Linda Tripp and
Monica Lewinsky talking about the definition of sex.
</P>
<P>
   The show appeared to rivet the attention of the committee
members and the jammed hearing room, often eliciting laughter from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Lowell's Republican counterpart, David
Schippers, countered with his own video show that presented Clinton
as a scheming conspirator who deserved to be removed from office.
But it was Lowell's fast-paced presentation that appeared most
geared toward attracting the all-important television audience
outside the committee room.
</P>
<P>
   He provided the cameras with a bevy of sound-bites such as
``impeachment is the political equivalent to the death penalty''
and ``As my daughter would say, `duh.''' His props included a stack
of transcripts that Lowell said reflected the witnesses whose
testimony he would use during his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Using a bit of Perry Mason gimmickry, Lowell announced at the
start of his presentation that he would call witnesses to the stand
to prove the president was innocent. He said those witnesses
included Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, Vernon Jordan, Tripp and
Clinton _ then hastened to add that these people would not be there
in person but instead would appear before the committee through
their prior video testimony, audio transcripts and written
responses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the segments were less than a minute or two, with many
brief enough to be played by television stations in their entirety.
</P>
<P>
   One video showed a recent interview with former Rep. Peter
Rodino, D-N.J., chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the 1974
Watergate hearings. On the video, Rodino said the impeachment
process must be bi-partisan, a characteristic that so far has
eluded these hearings.
</P>
<P>
   One video segment was a collage of Starr testifying before the
committee last month and responding to committee questions with
such answers as: ``I don't recall'' and ``I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell used the segment to counter Republican allegations that
Clinton was actually lying when he gave such answers as ``I don't
recall'' or ``I don't remember'' in his sworn testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The video drew laughter from the audience and several Republican
committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Republican committee members conceded that Lowell had
produced an eye-catching show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look great on camera,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., adding that Lowell was ``selling his case to the American
public, not Republican committee members.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican counsel Schippers also employed videos to help his
case.
</P>
<P>
   One video used a collection of clips from Clinton's deposition
in the Jones case to show the president repeatedly saying he had no
recollection of being alone with Lewinsky despite the fact the two
had engaged in oral sex on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Other segments showed the president giving evasive answers to
questions about calls he made to Lewinsky or his conversations with
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   And like Lowell, Schippers used plenty of sound-bites,
including: ``Truth is not decided by the outcome of polls'' and
``Conspirators don't just specifically say to each other, `Go in
and lie.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers workman-like pace and nearly three-hour
presentation seemed better suited to a courtroom than Court TV.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS FLORIDA SCHOOLS IMPROVING
 &HT;    630 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida schools have steadily boosted college
enrollment and improved eighth-grade math scores and teacher
training, according to a national report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The number of Florida eighth-graders who were at least
proficient on the math section of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress has increased, though the numbers continue to
lag behind the nation. The NAEP measures student ability on three
levels: basic, proficient and advanced. Proficient students
demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter and are well
prepared for the next level of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 17 percent of eighth-graders were at least proficient
in mathematics, compared with 12 percent in 1990. Nationally, 24
percent of eighth-graders were at least proficient in math in 1996,
compared with 15 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Florida fourth-graders who were at least proficient in math has
remained constant at 15 percent from 1992 to 1996, while math
proficiency among fourth-graders nationwide increased from 18
percent in 1992 to 21 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more Florida students are receiving degrees in
mathematics and science, especially women.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in
mathematics and science increased from 29 percent to 32 percent.
However, the number of minorities receiving such degrees decreased
from 36 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995. Florida has become one of the
nation's leaders in support programs for new teachers, according to
the report. In 1994, 48 percent of teachers participated in formal
induction programs, compared with 42 percent in 1991. Nationally,
27 percent of teachers participated in such programs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The state also was highlighted in a ``Promising Practices''
report for its progress in increasing college enrollment. In 1994,
50 percent of high school students enrolled in college, compared
with 45 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the rise in college enrollment to the Florida
Bright Futures Scholarship Act. Under this provision, Florida high
school students who are enrolled in a college-preparatory program
and achieve at least a 3.0 grade point average receive a 75 percent
discount on tuition at any of the state's colleges or universities.
Students with at least a 3.5 grade point average may receive full
scholarships and a book allowance.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't all good. The report showed more Florida teachers
report classroom disruptions that interfere with learning. In 1994,
48 percent of teachers made such reports, compared with 42 percent
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hope the report will help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

 &HT;    CLINTON DEPARTS SATURDAY ON HIGH-RISK MIDDLE EAST JOURNEY.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton leaves Saturday for a three-day
Mideast visit where he will try to salvage the imperiled peace
process amid political and security conditions that are
deteriorating by the day.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement reached at the Wye
River Plantation in rural Maryland in October, Clinton, who
brokered the deal, vowed to visit Jerusalem and
Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's agreement to the trip was an important part of
the agreement made at Wye
</P>
<P>
   River,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ''He believes
that the trip is important to moving the
</P>
<P>
   process forward, to implementing the Wye River accords, and he's
doing it in the best interests of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   That process, though, is in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in very, very bad shape,'' said former State Department
Middle East specialist Charles Hill. ''There is no negotiation,
there is violence, there is terrorism, there is disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't know in October that his visit would be preceded
by a week that began with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
narrowly averting or perhaps merely postponing a political coup
that could bring down his government. The week is has seen some of
the most widespread Palestinian-Israeli confrontations in months.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian protesters have hurled rocks and taunted Israeli
soldiers across the West Bank this week. Thousands of Palestinians
marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone
mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed on Wednesday by Israeli army
gunfire, the Associate Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't know, either, that he'd be traveling as the House
Judiciary Committee debates and votes on articles of impeachment
against him stemming from the Monical Lewinsky sex-and-deception
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, expectations for Clinton's visit were so low that
some analysts were questioning whether he should go at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trip is probably not desirable and it's not going to be
what it was designed to be when it was agreed, and yet we're
trapped into it,'' said Hill, diplomat in residence at Yale
University. ''I think that the best thing the president can do is
to get through it without doing more damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes for more than that, and some analysts believe more
is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to provide all the cotton we can to be sure this
fragile egg doesn't turn into an omelette,'' said Emory University
Mideast politics and history professor Kenneth Stein, speaking of
the Wye agreement. ''And it is a fragile egg.''
</P>
<P>
   In his visit with Netanyahu on Sunday, Clinton hopes to persuade
the Israeli leader to move forward with promised troop deployments
from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Netanyahu promised at Wye to
pull back from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank territory,
but after a troop withdrawal last month he suspended further
pullouts in the face of escalating Palestinian attacks against
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   A bulls eye for Clinton would be a promise by Netanyahu to lift
his suspension and go forward with pullouts scheduled for next
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, though, is in a tight box.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners in his conservative Likud political party are
outraged at the pullouts. Many regard Wye as a sell-out of Israeli
security and some have threatened to abandon him in parliament,
where Netanyahu's coalition governs with a razor-thin majority.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates, at the same time, are losing patience with him for
precisely the opposite reason. They claim Netanyahu is dragging his
feet on a comprehensive peace process that began five years ago
with a signing of the Oslo peace accords on the White House lawn.
It quickly bogged down amid fresh violence on the streets and the
assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had
signed the Oslo accords with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has survived more than 20 attempts to unseat him in
his brief two and a half years in office. He could face renewed
attempts within a week.
</P>
<P>
   His situation is so tenuous that he suggested earlier this week
that Clinton might best stay home. But by Thursday Netanyahu made a
perfunctory statement suggesting that Clinton is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance stems from Clinton's plan to visit
Palestinian-controlled Gaza on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu fears the president's visit to Arafat's territory will
be hailed in Gaza as the legitimization of Palestinian sovereignty
just one step away from endorsing Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The mere prospect sets teeth on edge in Israel, which sees the
subject of a Palestinian state as a matter to be discussed only in
the context of so-called final status talks, aimed at a
comprehensive Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will see this odd spectacle of Palestinians dancing in the
streets for an American president, and Israelis demonstrating
against him,'' predicted Middle East expert William Quandt, who
served on President Jimmy Carter's National Security Council.
''This is such a volatile situation that I think they're almost
going to have to play this as they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to throw Netanyahu a bone from Gaza, where he
plans a speech before the Palestinian National Council.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat agreed five years ago to remove from the Palestinian
charter all of the calls for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's done so is in dispute, but Israel isn't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat agreed at Wye to invite the more than 700 members of the
Palestinian National Council to Gaza for a meeting Monday to take
up the matter. So far fewer than half have agreed to show up. Many
are expatriates and some are guerrilla fighters more inclined to
fight Israelis than to negotiate with them.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to finesse the standoff, Arafat led a sub-group of his
allies the Palestine Central Council in a vote Friday to declare
null and void all charter references to Israel's destruction. It
isn't clear whether that will satisfy Netanyahu's threat to hold
further West Bank withdrawals in suspension until the full national
council votes to rescind the offending clauses.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton urges Netanyahu to accept Arafat's approach, he'll
have something to help the bitter medicine go down.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked Congress for an additional $1.2 billion in U.S. aid
to Israel next year _ on top of the $3 billion in economic and
military aid that's already planned.
</P>
<P>
   The additional money, Clinton claims, is justified to help
Israel in the adjustments it needs to deploy from the West Bank and
other measures required to keep peace alive.
</P>
<P>
   He's also asked Congress for $400 million in Palestinian aid _
on top of $100 million already planned.
</P>
<P>
   To help sell the program to Congress, Clinton is bringing along
more than a dozen members of Congress _ a large delegation for such
a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, is whether even those billions and all the
rest of the influence Clinton can bring to bear can help salvage
peace from a region mired in street violence and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton can bring some glue to the Wye agreement,'' said
Emory's Stein, who has just completed a book, entitled ''Heroic
Diplomacy'' on three decades of attempts to make peace in the
Mideast. ''The problem is that when he leaves, the glue dries and
it comes unstuck again. The Wye agreement didn't renew the trust or
change the habits of the heart of the people who signed it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia schools need to decrease classroom
disruptions, improve teacher education and boost minority
participation in math and science, according to a national report
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the report shows more Georgia students are attending
college and more mothers are receiving prenatal care, minority
participation is still an uphill battle, and fewer teachers hold
certificates in the subjects they teach.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   While the number of students who were at least proficient on the
math section of the National Assessment of Educational Progress
increased nationally from 18 percent to 21 percent between 1992 and
1996, Georgia achievement remains stagnant at 13 percent. The NAEP
measures student ability on three levels: basic, proficient and
advanced. Proficient students demonstrate competency over
challenging subject matter and are well prepared for the next level
of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most states have increased the number of minorities
who receive degrees in mathematics and science, while Georgia
numbers have decreased. In 1995, 43 percent of minorities received
those degrees, compared with 44 percent in 1991. Nationally, 40
percent of minorities received the degrees in 1995, compared with
39 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The number of teachers holding a certificate in their main
teaching assignment also is dropping in Georgia and the nation. In
1994, 94 percent of Georgia teachers had certificates, compared
with 98 percent in 1991. Nationally, that number decreased from 94
percent to 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More Georgia teachers are reporting that students disrupt
classroom instruction. About 46 percent of teachers said these
disruptions interfered with instruction in 1994, compared with 37
percent in 1991. Those percentages were the same for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The news isn't all bad. Georgia made more progress than any
other state in increasing the percentage of mothers who receive
prenatal care. In 1996, 85 percent received care, compared with 73
percent in 1990. Nationally, 82 percent received care in 1996,
compared with 76 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say prenatal care is important to student achievement
because children who are born healthy perform better in school.
</P>
<P>
   The state also was highlighted in a ``Promising Practices''
report for its progress in increasing college enrollment. In 1996,
56 percent of high school students enrolled in college, compared
with 54 percent in 1992. The report also showed that community
college enrollment jumped 25 percent between 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the rise in college enrollment to the HOPE
scholarship program started in 1993. Under this provision, Georgia
high school students who earn a B average or better receive free
tuition to any of the state's colleges or universities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hoped the report would help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

   WASHINGTON _ Saying that some of the proposed impeachment
charges hinged on conflicting ``he-said-she-said'' versions of what
went on between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, Democrats
stepped up their efforts to undermine Ms. Lewinsky's credibility
Thursday, citing inconsistencies in her accounts of the affair and
her taped statement to Linda Tripp that she had lied her entire
life.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive day in which Democrats sought to
raise questions about Ms. Lewinsky's reliability in recalling
elements of her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   And it left Clinton and Democrats fighting impeachment in a
delicate position, not wanting to be seen as attacking the
25-year-old former White House intern but intent on challenging her
veracity over critical details like where and how the president
touched her during their sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe D. Lowell, the counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's
Democrats, said during his two-hour presentation to the committee
Thursday that if the House voted to impeach Clinton for lying under
oath about where he touched Ms. Lewinsky, it might require that the
former White House intern testify before the Senate in detail about
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a he-said-she-said drama, if you really want it, would
also have to include questions into the inconsistencies in Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony that the independent counsel seems to ignore
in his referral,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell cited statements made by Ms. Lewinsky to friends that the
Secret Service had brought the president to her apartment and that
she had sex with Clinton in the Oval Office without any clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell cited testimony by Bayani Nelvis, a White House steward,
that Ms. Lewinsky had claimed the president had invited her to
Martha's Vineyard while Mrs. Clinton was away. And Lowell said Ms.
Lewinsky had told job interviewers that she had lunched with the
first lady, who had offered to find her a place to live in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said none of those events cited by Ms. Lewinsky had
happened. ``But that type of embellishment would require scrutiny
in a Senate trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky, declined to comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell did not present any evidence that Ms. Lewinsky had lied
when she told the grand jury that Clinton had touched her in
intimate ways that would fit the definition of sexual relations
used in the deposition given by Clinton in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's denial of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in
that deposition is at the heart of the perjury charges in the
impeachment resolution the Judiciary Committee took up Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowell argued that inconsistencies in Ms. Lewinsky's
accounts of the relationship in general left the House short of the
``threshold of evidence'' needed to send to the Senate charges
based on statements by Clinton about the ``nature and details'' of
his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell also played for the committee a segment from a
conversation taped by Linda Tripp of Ms. Lewinsky saying that she
was ``brought up with lies all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the taped conversation, Ms. Lewinsky recounts how she had to
make up stories to get money from her father, how her mother had
always lied to her father, how her mother had helped her sneak out
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lied my entire life,'' Ms. Lewinsky says on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., accused Clinton during the House
Judiciary Committee's hearing on Wednesday of encouraging aides to
leak stories last January about Ms. Lewinsky being unstable and a
sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, immediately denied the
accusation, saying a ``very careful and well-considered decision
was made to do our damnedest to insure that in fact no such
personal attack was ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, however, Judiciary Committee Democrats
released a statement saying that Ms. Lewinsky's memory had been
affected by prescription drugs _ a contention that an associate of
Ms. Lewinsky's denied _ and that she had repeatedly been
untruthful.

LAWMAKER BACKS BILL BANNING GAYS FROM ADOPTING CHILDREN IN TEXAS
CUSTODY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A West Texas legislator is sponsoring a bill
that would ban gays and lesbians from becoming foster parents or
adopting children in state custody, prompting a sharp attack from a
gay Republican group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is offensive, and I think any fair-minded individual
will find this bill to be offensive,'' said Steve Labinski,
president of Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which advocates equal
treatment of homosexuals in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, filed this week by state Rep. Warren Chisum,
R-Pampa, would direct Child Protective Services not to place
children in homes with homosexual parents and defines their sexual
practices as ``deviate.''
</P>
<P>
   Private adoptions would not be affected, but thousands of
children at risk could be. Currently the state oversees 17,578
foster children and last year approved 1,548 adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Labinski called Chisum's proposal ``unrepublican'' and said it
hardly echoes the concept of ``compassionate conservatism''
championed by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Chisum, however, maintains that his research shows homosexual
parents place children at risk of an unhealthy lifestyle, illegal
activity or an unstable home life. Chisum considers homosexual acts
illegal under the state's sodomy law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is not about any rights of gays and lesbians to be
parents,'' said Chisum, who sponsored an unsuccessful bill in the
1997 legislative session that said Texas would not recognize gay
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill ensures that the state will provide the best
possible homes for children who have already been abused and
neglected,'' Chisum said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue could erupt into a divisive debate should it hit the
floor of the Texas House when the Legislature meets next year.
State Rep. Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat and the only openly gay
legislator, has said any law or policy that authorized such a
``witch hunt'' would ``create a world of hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill responds to a dispute last year when Dallas CPS
caseworker Rebecca Bledsoe was disciplined after abruptly removing
an infant from the home of a lesbian foster parent. Bledsoe said
she was told she had failed to show respect for the foster mother.
She filed a lawsuit against the state in September, and the
American Civil Liberties Union intervened the following month to
argue against Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   CPS officials have said Bledsoe wrongfully removed the child,
violating agency policy because she did not notify the child's
foster mother or the child's attorney first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a placement that is going to best meet these
kids' needs who have been abused or neglected. We simply do not
screen based on sexual preference or sexual orientation,'' said
Marla Sheely, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Protective
and Regulatory Services, the umbrella agency for CPS.
</P>
<P>
   Homes are screened to ensure safe environments, whether the
parents are ``green, purple, gay, straight, whatever,'' Sheely
said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An Egyptian gas pipeline is snaking its way east
across the Sinai desert, laying the groundwork for a regional power
network that could bind Israel closer to its Arab neighbors and
radically change its energy and security strategy.
</P>
<P>
   By directly fueling electric power plants, as its builders
intend, the Sinai pipeline would end Israel's dependence on sources
a continent or more away for vital energy imports. Israeli
officials agree that the Egyptian connection would be the easiest
and cheapest way to satisfy spiraling domestic power demands.
</P>
<P>
   But before concluding a deal, the two countries must overcome
intense mutual mistrust. Egypt has irked Israel by linking progress
on gas sales to the Palestinian peace talks, and at the moment the
pipeline is to stop 25 miles short of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions should be made on purely economic grounds, and
economically the Egyptian project is best,'' said Natan Sharansky,
Israel's minister of trade and industry. ``But the Egyptians have
wanted to make this a political issue, a way to apply political
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Maher Said, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, said
in a telephone interview that Egypt wants the project to succeed.
``If it is a question of a guarantee that the supply of gas would
continue without political vetoes, this could be done with a
statement of intent,'' he said. ``It does make good business sense.
To me, it seems like this is a go situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pipeline _ originating in Nile Delta gas fields and
paralleling the Sinai's northern Mediterranean shore _ is now being
built by a 50-50 partnership between the state-owned Egyptian
General Petroleum Corp. and the giant Italian conglomerate ENI, a
developer of Egypt's 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, gas is expected to begin coursing through the
36-inch-diameter, 150-mile-long pipeline to what is now its
official destination: El Arish, an isolated Sinai beach town just
west of Israel and the Palestinian-administered Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government has not yet put forward a formal offer
for a long-term supply deal. And Israel says only that it is
``currently considering the option'' of buying the gas from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   But the builders are banking on a deal: The scale and trajectory
of the project make it clear that Israel is the pipeline's viable
market, and ENI does not disguise its expectation that the pipeline
will extend well beyond El Arish. Already, ENI has signed an
agreement in principle to supply gas to the Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip, and company plans show the pipeline continuing to
Israel's three main coastal power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural start for a system that could extend
throughout the region,'' Enzo Viscusi, an ENI spokesman in Rome,
said. ``It has great implications.''
</P>
<P>
   The northern Sinai project represents the revival _ but this
time with contracts, cash and backhoes _ of the ``peace pipeline''
idea discussed by Egypt and Israel in the afterglow of the Oslo
peace accords five years ago. The proposal foundered with the
chilling of Israeli-Arab relations after the Likud government of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996 and
put the old Labor government's assumptions on the peace process
under review.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt was unwilling to proceed with big cross-border business
deals unless Israel continued withdrawing from Palestinian
territories as required by the Oslo land-for-security plan. Israel
was infuriated, saying its negotiations with Palestinians should
have no bearing on negotiations for gas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a flurry of deal-making and ditch-digging
resuscitated the pipeline, at a cost estimated by ENI at more than
$200 million, just as President Clinton's Wye Plantation mediation
effort led to the resumption of Israeli pullbacks from the West
Bank. Clinton is to arrive in Israel on Saturday night for further
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation today is that the government of Israel wants to
buy the gas, and we are waiting for a decision from Egypt to sell
us the gas,'' said Yossei Maiman, president of the Merhav Group, an
Israeli energy contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Egyptian Petroleum Minister Hamdi Banbi declared
that Egypt's commercial gas producers would be permitted to export
to Israel, and expressed hope that political obstacles could be
resolved. The Israeli government says it wants that policy stated
more formally and emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   The ``formal consent and commitment of the government of Egypt
is a prerequisite for a natural gas supply agreement,'' Israel's
Ministry of National Infrastructure said in a statement. ``This is
required because of the linkage made in the past, by the government
of Egypt, between the commercial negotiations and the political
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Egypt, the two issues are inextricably related as ``a
matter of the general political context in the Arab world,''
according to Said. ``If the implementation of the Wye agreement
proceeds, the project's possibility of proceeding is greatly
enhanced,'' he said. ``If Wye doesn't proceed, it will truly be
difficult.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In October, ENI board chairman Guglielmo Moscato signed a
provisional agreement in Ramallah with Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat to supply gas to the Gaza Strip. Moscato
said the agreement would allow the new pipeline to ``cross the
Egyptian border'' and fuel Gaza power plants. He called it ``the
first real step toward the implementation of the so-called peace
pipeline project, which ENI has been studying for years.''
</P>
<P>
   As ENI acknowledges, however, a gas-supply arrangement with the
Palestinian Authority cannot be concluded without the approval and
technical cooperation of Israel, which controls the Egyptian-Gaza
border.
</P>
<P>
   A power plant of the size ENI has discussed building for Gaza
would use no more than a tenth of the pipeline's planned capacity
of 7 billion cubic meters a year, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israel, fast-rising power demands combined with
environmental and budgetary considerations have led to official
forecasts of natural gas imports of 4 billion cubic meters a year
by 2005 and 12 billion by 2015, the Infrastructure Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, recent gas discoveries have tripled Egypt's
proved reserves and export potential. Sales to Israel of 4 billion
cubic meters a year could, even at today's depressed prices, earn
Egypt as much as $300 million annually, it is estimated,
representing a fivefold increase in exports to Israel. ``This type
of interdependence should be encouraged,'' said Meiman, whose
company's 20 percent share of a $1.2 billion Alexandria oil
refinery makes it the largest Israeli investor in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by nations that were the world's leading oil producers
but also its declared enemies, Israel long ago forged alternative
relationships with the biggest non-OPEC exporters, Norway and
Mexico. It also bought crude oil through intermediaries on costly
spot markets, and imported coal from South Africa and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   After the Camp David accords were signed in 1979, Egypt joined
the ranks of Israel's suppliers, and is now providing up to a fifth
of Israel's oil imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. But because of the refusal of most Arab countries
to sell to Israel directly, and its own fears that overland
supplies could easily be cut by terrorists or the producers, Israel
has never had working pipeline connections to any of its
energy-producing neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Israel needs to make decisions soon. Electricity consumption is
rising fast, and its coal-fired power plants are casting a pall of
particulates over coastal towns and beaches. Natural gas is cleaner
than most alternatives, and, here in the Middle East, marginally
cheaper. With energy prices at a 25-year low, this is a propitious
time to negotiate supply contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Infrastructure Ministry postponed until
next year a self-imposed December 1998 deadline for plans on
importing natural gas, expanding electrical generating capacity,
and possibly converting existing plants to gas from coal. The
ministry has also proposed huge gas-fired desalination plants to
satisfy demands for drinkable water in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said it was having exploratory talks with four
unnamed suppliers of liquefied gas, though it would be priced
higher than piped Egyptian gas and requires the construction of a
$600 million-plus marine terminal and regasification plant.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are billions of dollars in fuel and construction
contracts. These decisions are in turn dictated by long-term
strategic considerations. Though the Sinai pipeline alone could
satisfy Israel's demand for gas over the next decade, Israeli
officials say they favor a mix of sources, including liquefied gas
from Turkmenistan shipped through Turkey, an increasingly close
military ally. ``It is not good for us to be totally dependent on
one pipeline,'' Sharansky said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another Sinai gas pipeline is being planned. Amoco Corp., which
is being acquired by British Petroleum, signed agreements in
November with Egypt and Jordan to build a smaller-capacity pipeline
across the Sinai, under the Gulf of Aqaba from the Egyptian port of
Taba, and continuing to Amman and beyond. Nile Delta gas should
begin flowing to Jordan in 2001, through a $400 million Amoco joint
venture there with Tractebel of Belgium, said Robert Clark, an
Amoco spokesman in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the peace pipeline, but rather a discrete project
to provide gas to supply Jordan's energy needs into the 21st
century,'' Clark said. ``I don't want to preclude the possibility
that this could develop into a wider regional distribution system,
but that is a consideration for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jordan's energy demands could eventually include producing
surplus electricity for Israel, under the terms of a recent
agreement between the two countries. New transmission lines across
the Jordan River and systems to unite the adjoining electricity
grids are almost completed, Israel reports. Israel's electricity
demands are about 10 times greater than Jordan's, and Jordan
already has the advantage of connections to Saudi pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Egypt are also unifying their electricity grids, with
a new power cable under the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   And both Amoco and ENI have had continuing conversations with
Israeli energy officials about supplying gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been discussions for some time about the
possibility of exporting gas via the eastern Mediterranean coast to
the Palestinian Authority and to Israel, and those discussions are
still continuing,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities and the pipeline's developers have also
discussed building a power plant on Egyptian territory near Gaza
and exporting electricity to both Israel and the Palestinian
Authority. Israeli officials say they would not necessarily oppose
the proposal if Egypt provided long-term supply guarantees, and if
Palestinian power lines remained part of the Israeli grid _ an
insurance policy against sabotage or diplomatic reprisals.

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ The sun was setting far, far away,
casting a mysterious glow on Ebrie Lagoon here. From her villa,
Vanessa Toualy, a former hostess for Air Afrique, watched the
sunset with rather sad downcast eyes, for she did not know that the
athletic and dashing Christian Magou was thinking of her.
</P>
<P>
   A gin and tonic in his hand, Christian stood in front of a bay
window in his bachelor pad in Deux-Plateaux. He gazed longingly at
the stars twinkling in the sky, unable to get Vanessa's bewitching
smile out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   And so unfolds a scene from ``Un Bonheur Inattendu,'' or
``Unexpected Happiness,'' one of the six titles in Adoras, a new
series of African romance novels believed to be the first of its
kind. Since their premiere in May, the African Harlequins have
become such a hit in the Ivory Coast that their publishers are
rushing out five new books for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   They have also sold well in Senegal and other corners of
French-speaking Africa, apparently filling what the publishers
described as a demand for romance novels with African characters,
themes and settings.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Un Bonheur Inattendu,'' Vanessa and Christian are Ivoirian
yuppies who live here in the fancy neighborhoods of Riviera and
Deux-Plateaux. Glances are exchanged, not over candlelit French
dinners, but over plenty of couscous and tchepdiene, a Senegalese
dish. The backdrop is Abidjan, this country's commercial capital
and West Africa's most modern city, with skyscrapers and wide
highways built around Ebrie Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about Adoras is that we can experience what's in
the books, because they contain scenes from our daily lives,'' said
Denise Quenum, 34, a physical therapist. ``It's like we're living
each moment, each location, each name. The books talk about sun and
rain, not snow and autumn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Harlequin novels,'' she said, ``there's always a Prince
Charming, blond and blue-eyed. That was not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Empathy is critical to romance novels, said Meliane Boguifo,
director of the series, which is published by Nouvelles Editions
Ivoiriennes. So beyond the hero's fair looks, the staple
ingredients in traditional Harlequins made them unappetizing to
many Africans.
</P>
<P>
   What's so sexy about receiving a fur when the mercury is hitting
90, at night, in the cool season? Ms. Boguifo asked. ``And we do
not understand what is so romantic about a couple sitting together
in front of a fireplace,'' added Ms. Boguifo, who wrote one of the
novels, ``Coeurs Pieges,'' or ``Trapped Hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And `she turned red,''' she continued. ``We know what it is to
have blood rush up to your face, but we don't blush.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the stories are rooted in real trends or incidents.
``Sugar Daddy'' focuses on a relationship common in Abidjan,
between a female college student and a ``tonton,'' an older, rich
man. In ``Parfums d'Assinie,'' a student must drop out of college
when her mother loses her entire stock of cloth in a big fire in a
market, which actually occurred here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Extended families, as the anchors of African societies, play
prominent roles in the love stories. Sex scenes are tame by Western
standards, in keeping with the heroines, who, as Ms. Boguifo put
it, are all ``chaste girls who only ask to give love.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local literary critics even praised the books as efforts to
liberate this country, a French colony until 1960, from Western
culture. Kinimo Kanga, a critic for a daily newspaper in Abidjan,
likened the African Harlequins to the publication in recent years
of African children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children no longer talk only of Snow White and
Cinderella,'' Kanga said, adding that he was surprised that the
publishers of Adoras, presumably fearing bad reviews, had not
handed out free copies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the author of ``Symphonie et Lumiere'' _ the story of a
blind pianist who shows a Don Juan the secrets of the human heart _
pleaded that only her nom de plume, Joelle Anskey, be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my readers to confuse this novel with my other
novels,'' she said, adding sadly that her potboiler had far outsold
her more serious works.
</P>
<P>
   Biton Koulibaly, who wrote ``Sugar Daddy'' in 15 days and had it
published under the pseudonym of B. Williams, showed no such
reserve. One of the most popular writers in the Ivory Coast,
especially among women, Koulibaly explained with a straight face
that his story about the cash-strapped student and the ``tonton''
was supposed to be educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals of Adoras is to teach African men how to
love,'' Koulibaly said. ``Women here have evolved. They want love
with one man; they want tenderness. Men are behind.''
</P>
<P>
   On a continent where polygamy is widespread, Koulibaly, 49, said
learning about romantic love was critical to African men.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempt to Africanize culture on a continent where colonial
legacies are so fresh is, of course, fraught with contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers of the romances, at the same time they advertised
the fact that these novels were written by Africans for Africans,
gave their authors exotic pseudonyms, like Carmen Lopez and
Christopher Hill. A marketing study showed that a clearly African
name would give the book less credibility, Ms. Boguifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Patricia Mobeo, 20, a student, said she hesitated before
buying an Adoras. ``Since when do Africans write love stories?''
she said. She eventually read two and liked them, but purely as a
diversion. ``I tell myself that when two people are together, it's
always out of some self-interest. People don't experience romantic
love here. Maybe they do over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alima Konate said she did, here.
</P>
<P>
   Over a hamburger and Fanta, Ms. Konate, 30, a computer
programmer, told of how she had related to two Adoras novels. In
``Cache-Cache d'Amour,'' or ``Hide-and-Seek Love,'' the heroine _ a
Muslim member of the Malinke ethnic group, like Ms. Konate _ finds
true love despite a forced marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was ``Coeurs Pieges,'' the story of Kenza, a woman
whose true love returns to her after a long, seductive stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself in Kenza,'' Ms. Konate said. ``She nurtured a
love that finally bears fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in her village, she confided, when she was still a girl,
Lancine Konate spent summers at his grandparents' house, across
from her family's home. But like the man in the novel, Lancine left
for several years, in his case to study in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flesh is weak,'' Ms. Konate said, ``and when he left, we
weren't on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But like every Harlequin, African or not, things ended happily.
She had already started using his last name in anticipation of the
big day. She reached for her soft drink and the diamond sparkled
against the Fanta.

 &HT;    PRO-IMPEACHMENT DEMOCRAT NOT SWAYED BY CLINTON DEFENSE
 &HT;    With IMPEACH-REPUB.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, said Thursday that
President Clinton's defense team did not change his mind on voting
in favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty set on the perjury and the fact that it's a felony.
There's not any way hardly to sugar-coat that,'' he said. ``It's
almost an affront to anybody to say that the act that he and the
girl were carrying out was not sex. Give me a break. That's just
not sellable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense, presented this week to the House Judiciary
Committee, offered no new evidence, Hall said. ``I didn't hear any
of them that were witnesses ... that were in the Oval Office at the
time. I don't know what they can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is one of fewer than 10 House Democrats believed to support
impeachment. Because the Republicans hold an 11-seat majority,
Clinton would have to win about 20 Republican votes to avoid
impeachment if Democrats such as Hall stand firm.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer himself, Hall analyzed the defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have the law, we argue the law. If we've got the facts,
we argue the facts. If we don't have either one of them, we beat on
the table. ...They've been beating on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the president should have testified before the
committee himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a lawyer and I had the most persuasive guy in the
world for a client, I'd sure put him on the stand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall said he could understand why Clinton didn't testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he testifies anything different now than what he said, then
that's perjury. He's in a bad situation, `` he said. ``But he's
probably the only one that could change anybody's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he has received ``all kinds of calls'' from fellow
Democrats to talk about the impeachment vote. He said he had also
received invitations to the White House, but not to talk directly
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would come if he asked me to come over there,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``I don't want to cross-examine the president. I've
read his cross-examination and I think he's been put through
enough,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doubts anything could change his mind, Hall said he
never says no to evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A simple House majority of 218 votes is enough to impeach
Clinton. If the House approves articles of impeachment, the Senate
would be forced to hold a trial. It takes a two-thirds Senate
majority to convict a president and remove him from office, and few
people believe the Senate, which will have 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats next year, will find the 67 votes needed to do so.

 &HT;    FOLEY SAYS WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE HASN'T PERSUADED HIM
 &HT;    With CLINTON-DEM.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Rep. Mark Foley, a Republican leaning toward
voting for impeachment, this week's parade of witnesses defending
President Clinton had virtually no effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a chance to look further and more deeply into the
case,'' said Foley, of West Palm Beach, Fla., but ``it hasn't done
much to convince me at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who has not declared how he would vote on impeachment,
said he is leaning toward supporting the perjury articles prepared
by the House Judiciary Committee and is also seriously weighing the
obstruction of justice article.
</P>
<P>
   While many House members have not declared their intentions,
surveys by several news organizations indicate that Clinton would
have to win the votes of up to 20 Republicans to avoid impeachment,
while no more than half a dozen have said they would vote in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, unlike many Republicans, acknowledges that the White
House might be able to persuade him to vote against impeachment
next week. But he said it would require an additional statement
from Clinton acknowledging wrongdoing, comparing the president to a
criminal defendant who throws himself on the mercy of the court for
a reduced sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have to recognize the violations of law that have
occurred,'' Foley said. ``That would be an essential process for me
to look at,'' he said, although it would ``not be a guarantee''
that he would vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he continues to go out and have all these people
mount an offensive,'' Clinton appears to be ``an unrepentant person
doing his best to avoid jeopardy, either through an impeachment and
removal from office or from future criminal charges after he leaves
office,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   The second-term lawmaker said he had not been actively lobbied
by either fellow Republicans seeking to impeach Clinton or by the
White House seeking opposition to impeachment. Meanwhile, he said
the dozens of daily telephone calls and the hundreds of e-mail
messages his office receives on the issue continue to run about 70
percent in favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite testimony from Clinton's defenders that his deposition
answers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and his answers
to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury did not
constitute perjury, Foley said he was unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly he was not only evading, but deliberately lying under
oath, `` Foley said, adding that ``when you put your hand on the
Bible (you) must come clean with all the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly bothering him are Clinton's statements that he
could not recall giving former intern Monica Lewinsky a series of
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Foley acknowledged that a president might not recall all the
trinkets someone in his position gives away on a daily basis, but
he said it was hard to believe Clinton would not recall giving
Lewinsky such personal gifts as a book of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said he was also concerned that Clinton attempted to
obstruct justice by having his secretary, Betty Currie, retrieve
the gifts from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems highly unlikely (Currie would have retrieved the
gifts) without some involvement of the president,'' he said.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS MIXED NEWS FOR OHIO SCHOOLS
 &HT;    580 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More Ohio students are heading straight to college
and obtaining degrees in math and science, but drug use in public
schools has increased and math test scores remain stagnant,
according to a national report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of eighth-graders who are at least
proficient on the math section of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress increased, but Ohio remained the same. The
NAEP measures student ability on three levels: basic, proficient
and advanced. Proficient students demonstrate competency over
challenging subject matter and are well prepared for the next level
of schooling. Between 1992 and 1996, about 18 percent of
eighth-graders were at least proficient on the test. Nationwide,
that number increased from 15 percent to 21 percent. Overall, more
Ohio students are receiving degrees in mathematics and science,
including women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in
mathematics and science increased from 31 percent to 34 percent.
The number of minorities receiving such degrees increased from 36
percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio also has increased the number of high school graduates who
immediately enroll in college. About 55 percent of students did so
in 1996, compared with 51 percent in 1992. Comparable national data
was unavailable, but Massachusetts did the best of all states at 73
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all good. In 1997, about 25 percent of students
said they used marijuana at least once in the past 30 days. That
number was up from 16 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   More students also reported that drugs were available on school
property. Between 1993 and 1997, that number increased from 20
percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though no comparable data was available nationally, the Virgin
Islands had some of the lowest percentages of all the states at 15
percent for marijuana use and availability of drugs. Members of the
goals panel said they hope the report will help states improve
their practices and encourage them to become more competitive
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

TRIMBLE WARNS CATHOLIC MILITANTS IN NOBEL SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ The Protestant leader of Northern Ireland, David
Trimble, accepted his share of the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize on
Thursday and warned militant Roman Catholics against delays in
turning over their arms caches.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble acknowledged that splinter groups on the pro-British
side had weapons, too. But he said the Irish Republican Army and
its political wing, Sinn Fein, were to blame for resurging tensions
that have stalled the peace drive and that cast a pall over the
awards Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His Catholic counterpart, John Hume, who shared the prize, said
Trimble was premature to insist on disarmament, because the accord
provides two years to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   `The real issue about guns and arms is that they have been
totally silent,' Hume, head of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, said. He added that some militants linked disarmament to
surrender, a ``psychological factor'' that he predicted would
diminish with time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recognition of continuing problems, the tone was one
of thanks for obstacles surmounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now up to political leaders on all sides,'' Hume said,
to deliver ``agreed structures for peace that will forever remove
the underlying causes of violence and division on our island.''
</P>
<P>
   The laureates have come to personify hopes for peace in a
province where 3,200 people have been killed in 30 years of
conflict. On May 22 a referendum overwhelmingly endorsed the
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is first minister in the new provisional Assembly. But
he has threatened to put off forming the multi-party cabinet called
for in the accord reached in April until paramilitary groups begin
to hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any further delay will reinforce dark doubts about whether
Sinn Fein are drinking from the clear water of democracy or still
drinking from the dark stream of fascism,'' Trimble, head of the
Ulster Unionist Party, told an audience of 1,000 at Oslo City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament issue is also blocking progress on prisoner
releases and the creation of institutional bodies linking Northern
Ireland with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Nobel committee, praised both
men but called Hume `the architect of the peace process' and a
bridge to Catholic hard-liners without whom any agreement would be
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   While Trimble and Hume represent the largest mainstream parties
in Northern Ireland, each must mollify extremists on his own side
of the religious divide for peace to take root. This week, John
Taylor, deputy chief of Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party, told The
Irish Times that conflicting views on the way ahead posed ``a
possibility of a major collapse.''

CLINTON GOES TO MIDEAST ON PEACE RESCUE MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton flies to Israel and
Palestinian-controlled West Bank and Gaza Saturday on a trip that
was to celebrate peace and make history. Instead, it will be a
desperate mission to prevent the demise of the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a wounded Israeli government, violent Palestinian
demonstrations and an impeachment vote at home, the White House has
dampened expectations for the four-day trip. Officials suggested
that it will be deemed a success if there is no bloodshed and if
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat simply agree to fulfill promises they made at a White
House ceremony six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the goals of the visit, a senior official, partly in
jest, said, ``I just want to physically survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from reveling in cooperation of two ``partners in peace,''
as the administration had hoped, Clinton will arrive to a tense
atmosphere of violence between Palestinians and political carnage
within Netanyahu's fragile coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics experts are still massaging the itinerary to avoid
alienating either side. But that has proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The White House first considered landing Air Force One at the
new Yasser Arafat International Airport in Gaza. But the
president's jet will now touch down at Israel's Ben Gurion airport
because of logistics and Israeli complaints that a Gaza arrival
would appear as an endorsement of Arafat's call for an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will light a Christmas tree in Bethlehem, the
traditional birthplace of Jesus, in a stop that Palestinian
officials said will help legitimize their claims of statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton trip is not an official state visit, which is why,
American officials say, the president will not address the Knesset,
the Israeli parliament. Also, there is no Palestinian state, and
the White House wants to minimize differences between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Clinton is going to do is what the two leaders have not
done _ they did not really go home and sell the Wye agreement to
their people,'' another administration official said. But he
cautioned against too much optimism about Clinton's chances,
saying, ``As in any situation, there's only so much Americans can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   As State Department officials followed Netanyahu's steadily
plummeting political star Thursday, White House aides drafted
stirring speeches to revive the hopes for peace among embittered
Israelis and Palestinians. They said the president will speak
glowingly of the benefits of peace but will temper his remarks with
warnings about the surging violence.
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu and Arafat signed the Wye Plantation peace
agreement on Oct. 23 and spoke warmly about each other, US
officials have watched with trepidation as they began attacking
each other verbally.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been extraordinarily cautious about
trumpeting the gains to be made from the trip. The customary press
briefings before presidential trips overseas, when State Department
and National Security officials wax about the benefits of improving
relations with a given country, have not been held or even
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that some of the most important
arrangements still have not been concluded. Clinton has scheduled
separate visits with Arafat and Netanyahu, and his staff spent
spent days trying to secure promises for a three-way talk. But such
a meeting, tentatively scheduled for Monday evening, is not yet
definite.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Clinton has never had a comfortable friendship with
Netanyahu, whom American officials see as stubborn and
unpredictable. Indeed, a year ago, senior officials shrugged at the
possibility of an early end to Netanyahu's governing coalition. But
after nine days of tense talks at the Wye Plantation, on Maryland's
Eastern Shore, Netanyahu made significant concessions to Arafat and
saluted Clinton as a ``warrior for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Those very concessions have enabled hard-liners in Israel to
move against Netanyahu, who earlier this week managed to postpone
for two weeks a vote of no confidence against him. Aides said that
Clinton, whatever his past misgivings about Netanyahu, feels
obliged to support him. For that reason, Clinton praised Netanyahu
during an interview in Washington with Israeli television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, the administration viewed Netanyahu as a serious
obstacle, but now it appears he may be the conservative leader who
can deliver elements of peace in a very complex Israeli political
situation,'' said Steve Yetiv, a political science professor at Old
Dominion University.
</P>
<P>
   The senior White House official echoed such thinking by saying,
``The president does feel that the prime minister took some brave
polticial risks when he made the deal at Wye, and he would like to
tell taht to the Israeli people.''
</P>
<P>
   To improve the mood among the Israeli right, an aide said,
Clinton will lavish compliments on Israel for its perspicacity and
its heroism as it celebrates its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But that might not be enough. Along the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv
highway, someone has pasted photo-montages of Clinton wearing a
traditional Arab headdress as well as ``Clinton go home'' posters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very scary. There's no internal trust among either the
Israelis or the Palestinians, and there's no external trust,
either,'' said David Lukin, a senior adviser to Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat. ``The last thing the
president needs right now is to have this whole thing collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the specter in Washington of an impending
impeachment vote in the House Judiciary Committee, perhaps
Saturday, the day that Clinton departs on Air Force One. When this
trip was first planned in October, few, if any, officials predicted
that it would be framed by such crucial votes on Capitol Hill. The
full House may vote articles of impeachment against Clinton on
Thursday, two days after he returns.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton gives powerful speeches and persuades Israelis
and Palestinians to return to the path of the peace accords, the
trip could benefit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has a vital interest in entering every American home
when Congress is debating his impeachment, as the world leader who
comes on Chrismtas Eve to bring peace to the Holy Land,'' columnist
Yosef Lapid wrote in Thursday's Maariv newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   During past trips to Ireland and Russia, Clinton had hoped to
talk about peace and partnership only to face questions from
American reporters about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The White
House will not say whether Clinton will field questions in the
Mideast, but he is likely to be shadowed by reporters asking about
impeachment, not West Bank troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   This trip could resemble the visit to Panama in 1992 by
President George Bush. Bush had hoped to be welcomed as the
liberator who ousted a dictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega. Instead,
he faced angry crowds who accused the US of raising false hopes.

Israelis or the Palestinians, and there's no external trust,
either,'' said David Lukin, a senior adviser to Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat. ``The last thing the
president needs right now is to have this whole thing collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the specter in Washington of an impending
impeachment vote in the House Judiciary Committee, perhaps
Saturday, the day that Clinton departs on Air Force One. When this
trip was first planned in October, few, if any, officials predicted
that it would be framed by such crucial votes on Capitol Hill. The
full House may vote articles of impeachment against Clinton on
Thursday, two days after he returns.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton gives powerful speeches and persuades Israelis
and Palestinians to return to the path of the peace accords, the
trip could benefit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has a vital interest in entering every American home
when Congress is debating his impeachment, as the world leader who
comes on Chrismtas Eve to bring peace to the Holy Land,'' columnist
Yosef Lapid wrote in Thursday's Maariv newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   During past trips to Ireland and Russia, Clinton had hoped to
talk about peace and partnership only to face questions from
American reporters about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The White
House will not say whether Clinton will field questions in the
Mideast, but he is likely to be shadowed by reporters asking about
impeachment, not West Bank troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   This trip could resemble the visit to Panama in 1992 by
President George Bush. Bush had hoped to be welcomed as the
liberator who ousted a dictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega. Instead,
he faced angry crowds who accused the US of raising false hopes.

NOBEL CEREMONY OVERSHADOWED BY DEBATE OVER IRISH ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As two of the key authors of the political settlement
in Northern Ireland were being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
Thursday, it was awkwardly obvious that the prize of peace in
Ireland remains a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday should have been a day of celebration throughout
Ireland, as John Hume, the visionary Catholic pacifist who was the
moral force behind the peace process, and David Trimble, the
hard-liner who led wary Protestants to compromise with Irish
nationalists, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hume and Trimble were given a standing ovation in
Oslo, the reaction was somewhat muted in Ireland and Britain, where
the peace process has been stalled by a dispute over the weapons of
the various paramilitary groups, especially the Irish Republican
Army.
</P>
<P>
   While Hume and Trimble stood side by side, smiling as they were
showered with accolades, the two men are hardly friends, and have,
if anything, become more estranged since it was announced two
months ago that they would share the peace prize and the $963,000
that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Hume is horrified that a dispute over paramilitary
weapons threatens to thwart the progress made by April's political
settlement, the Good Friday Agreement, which was overwhelmingly
endorsed by voters on both sides of the border in May.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is leader of the Northern Ireland Assembly, has a
different agenda than Hume, who has always believed that getting
the IRA to put its guns away is far more important and realistic
than getting it to turn them in.
</P>
<P>
   With many in the Ulster Unionist Party he leads complaining that
he has been too soft on the IRA, Trimble says that Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political representatives, can't sit in a power-sharing
cabinet until the IRA begins turning in its arsenal. The IRA,
however, says it has no intention of turning in its weapons, while
Sinn Fein accuses Trimble of trying to rewrite the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee cited peace efforts in Northern Ireland once
before, in 1976, honoring two women who put together a grass-roots
peace group that later collapsed in a heap of personality disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, meanwhile, dragged on. This time, however, there
are political consensus and cease-fires by all the major
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel committee conferred the award on two men who lead the
largest parties representing the two main factions in Northern
Ireland: Catholic nationalists who aspire to unity with the Irish
Republic, and Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to
remain part of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   While many credit Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, with being the moral and intellectual force behind the
peace process, the Nobel committee sought to balance credit by
honoring Trimble, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee,
borrowed the words of George Mitchell, the former US Senate
majority leader from Maine who was chairman of the negotiations
that produced the Good Friday Agreement. Without Hume there would
be no peace process, and that without Trimble there would be no
peace agreement, Sejersted said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are foremost among the many who have placed themselves at
the service of peace in and outside Northern Ireland,'' he told the
laureates.
</P>
<P>
   In their speeches in an Oslo City Hall whose opulence would be
considered extravagant in Northern Ireland, Hume and Trimble showed
that while they shared the peace prize, they have dramatically
different views on how to secure peace in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now, in Ireland, a passionate sense of moving to a
new beginning,'' said Hume. ``Bloodshed for political change
prevents the only change that truly matters -- in the human
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A more circumspect Trimble said there was ``a peace of sorts but
it is still something of an armed peace.'' His idea of being
realistic is the opposite of Hume's: that if he is to bring
unionists fully into the peace process, and if the IRA is serious
about using democratic politics to bring about a united Ireland,
the IRA has to give up its guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense dictates that I cannot forever convince society
that real peace is at hand if there is not a beginning to the
decommissioning of weapons,'' he said. ``Any further delay will
reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking from the
clear stream of democracy, or is still drinking from the dark
stream of fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in the agreement that links Sinn Fein's
participation in government with IRA disarmament. Under the
agreement, Irish republican and British loyalist paramilitary
groups are supposed to begin turning in their weapons within two
years. But Trimble says Sinn Fein can't be part of the local
government unless the IRA begins disarming, and has resisted
overtures from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, that he soften his stance.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's award was a vindication both of Hume's tireless
efforts to bring about peace and reconcilation and Trimble's bold
departure from the traditional ``No Surrender'' siege mentality of
unionists.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a somber reminder that while there is a viable
peace process in Ireland, there is not yet a durable peace.

FIRST GENOME DECODED; ROUNDWORM PROVIDES CLUES ABOUT OTHER
SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists have for the first time deciphered the full genetic
programming of an animal, a landmark achievement both in its own
right and as a milestone toward understanding the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The animal is a microscopic roundworm known as Caenorhabditis
elegans and used in laboratories throughout the world as a means to
explore biology at the genetic level.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers report that its genome, or full DNA, consists of 97
million chemical units and is predicted to contain 19,099 genes. If
printed in ordinary type, the DNA sequence would take up 2,748
pages of a New York Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, deciphered by two teams of biologists headed by John
E. Sulston of the Sanger Center near Cambridge, England, and Robert
H. Waterston of Washington University in St. Louis, has given
biologists their first sight of the information needed to develop,
operate and maintain a multi-cellular animal. The only genomes
sequenced up until now have belonged to single-celled organisms
like bacteria and yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Because worms and humans have turned out to share many genes in
common, the worm genome is regarded by biologists as an essential
basis for understanding how the human genome works.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years we have come to realize humans are more
like worms than we ever imagined,'' said Dr. Bruce Alberts,
president of the National Academy of Sciences and editor of a
leading textbook on molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the worm's complete genome is humbling, Alberts said,
because it makes biologists realize how much there is yet to
understand. ``We always underestimate the complexity of life, even
of the simplest processes,'' he said. ``So this is really only the
beginning of unraveling the mystery of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Lander, director of a human genome sequencing center at
the Whitehead Institute, said of the findings: ``This is really a
landmark achievement. It is the first time we've had a picture of
the gene set needed to run a multi-cellular organism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brilliant innovation of half a billion years ago
that we are getting a look at for the first time,'' he said,
referring to the evolution of animals from their single-celled
precursors.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the worm's genome, a 10-year project that was
finished on schedule, also reinforces the credibility of the
federal human genome project, which is locked in an undeclared race
with a formidable new rival, a private enterprise named Celera.
Celera is owned by Perkin-Elmer, the company that makes the leading
brand of DNA sequencing machines.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston's work was financed by Britain's Medical Research
Council and the Wellcome Trust of London, Waterston's by the
National Institutes of Health. The two teams worked in close
cooperation although they were an ocean apart. They announced their
effective completion of the genome in the Friday issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The two laboratories are also the leading production centers of
the human genome project. When the two researchers first decided to
sequence the worm's genome in 1988 each was advised by colleagues
that the task was a lunatic venture. The longest stretches of DNA
that had been sequenced at the time were just a few thousand units
in length.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several people told me I was nuts and was throwing away my
career,'' Waterston said. ``But I have a lot of faith in John,'' he
said, referring to his colleague's ability to solve hard problems.
</P>
<P>
   When James Watson, then director of the human genome project,
first told the two researchers he would advance money for a pilot
project, they realized a long commitment lay ahead of them. Sulston
recalled that on the Syosset platform, the Long Island train
station near Watson's Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, ``I said to
Bob `The prison door has just closed behind us _ I heard it clang.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The two researchers first met in Cambridge in the laboratory of
Sydney Brenner, the biologist who selected the C. elegans worm as a
model animal for scientific study.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston was completing a study of how the worm grows from a
single egg to the 959 cells of the adult animal, and then moved on
to mapping the worm's chromosomes, the packages in which the DNA is
stored. Waterston, a physician interested in muscle disease, had
been persuaded by Brenner to study muscle disorders first in the
worm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The task of sequencing the worm's genome was not the usual kind
of academic research project. Both Waterston at the Washington
University School of Medicine and Sulston in Cambridge had to
transform their laboratories into semi-industrial plants employing
more than 200 people each in almost round-the-clock operations.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem in sequencing a genome is that the machines
that analyze DNA can read segments of only 500 units or so in
length. The full genome must be reconstituted from an inordinate
number of small overlapping pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Another complexity is that the DNA must be amplified, or copied
many times, to furnish the machines with a sufficient amount to
analyze. Many regions of the worm genome, however, resist the usual
amplification processes. Even now the genome, though effectively
complete, has a few small gaps that remain to be filled in.
</P>
<P>
   From early on in the project, Sulston and Waterston posted on
the Internet the DNA sequences they obtained, for other scientists
to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet evolved, a mechanism developed for us to
provide data to people in a practical way,'' Waterston said.
Biologists throughout the world soon learned that at the touch of a
button they could compare any gene they were working on with the
growing set of genes available from the worm project.
</P>
<P>
   The worm genome proved to be of broad interest because of the
unexpected degree of overlap between worm and human genes. A
researcher who finds that a particular gene is involved in human
disease can compare its DNA sequence with those in the worm genome
data base.
</P>
<P>
   A match with a worm gene of known function will often reveal the
role of the human gene. The worm genome is thus providing an
essential platform from which to understand how the human genome is
put together.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it will take years of work to understand even the worm
genome. Unlike computer programming, in which programmers usually
insert explanatory remarks to describe what function each segment
of code performs, biological programming comes unannotated, with no
explicit hint of evolution's intentions. Biologists know or can
guess the role of about half of the worm's genes; they have no idea
what the rest may do.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance the worm genome seems just a thicket of puzzles.
Dr. Francis Collins, director of the human genome project at the
National Institutes of Health, said geneticists had believed humans
have about 10 different genes for making varieties of collagen, the
main structural protein of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the worm turns out to have 170 collagen genes. Biologists
have no idea why it would need so many but say they trust in
evolution's wisdom that it does. Genes that contribute nothing to
an organism's survival tend to be shed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For many genes that exist in one copy in the worm, humans have
four versions, confirming the long-held suspicion that the animal
genome has twice undergone a full-scale duplication in the course
of evolution. The spare copies were presumably free to evolve new
and useful functions. The C.elegans worm would have split off on a
separate evolutionary path before the first of the two duplications
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing pattern already discernible in the general
organization of the worm's genome is that its genes fall into two
broad classes that are arranged differently on the chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   One set of genes performs basic housekeeping functions for the
cell. These genes have many counterparts in yeast and must have
been highly conserved through evolution for two such different
organisms to carry matching sets.
</P>
<P>
   The other set of genes is special to the worm and seems to be
evolving at a much brisker pace.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston and Waterston report that the two sets of genes have
different locations on the worm's chromosomes, with the older,
conserved genes lying in the central region of chromosomes and the
more variable genes being positioned toward the two ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does look as if the genome has found a way to hide
its more important genes from the vicissitudes of the evolution
that is going on more rapidly in the arms,'' Waterston said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the worm's genes occur in clusters, as if one important
gene had been duplicated many times to perform variations of the
original function. But for all the presumed importance of the
clusters' tasks, many are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I found surprising was that there are so
many gene clusters _ 402 _ yet many are of genes about whose
function we know nothing,'' said Dr. Robert Horvitz, a worm
biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston believes that only a small fraction of the worm genome's
value is yet apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genome is not an open sesame in itself,'' he said. ``It
just provides this marvelous toolkit with all the basic information
for making an animal, if biologists can just figure it out. The
value it will deliver over time is much greater than the value you
get on first analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have already found the worm genome to be of great
value. ``I can't tell you how indebted those of us who do molecular
genetics are to the people who did the genome sequence,'' said Dr.
Gary Ruvkun of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

STUDY DETAILS DEVASTATION TO LARGE MAMMALS, BIRDS BY ASTEROID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mile-wide asteroid slammed into the coast of &UR;  &LR; what is today
Argentina 3.3 million years ago, and may have caused an abrupt
cooling of the climate and killing off of 36 species of huge,
lumbering animals.
</P>
<P>
   Giant armadillos, marsupial sloths and beasts that all towered 8
to 10 feet tall, and flightless birds larger than ostriches, were
wiped out; average temperatures around the world soon dropped by 2
degrees Celsius, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
   The impact, detailed in a paper in the current issue of the
journal Science, was far smaller than the one that was believed to
have caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 65
million years ago. It probably had only regional rather than global
effects, according to the paper's lead author, Peter Schultz, a
planetary geologist at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   But because the impact was so much more recent, its effects on
climate, the local geology and living organisms may be far easier
to study in detail, and may thus provide new insight into the
details of impacts in general.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1980 that scientists first reported evidence of
the dinosaur-killing impact, and over the years since then a
growing body of evidence from around the world has been filling in
details of the results of that impact, and of the existence of many
other impact events in Earth's history.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively recent, well-preserved layers of rock on the
coast of Argentina, where the signs of the impact were found, make
this ``like a mystery story where we can go out and look at the
crime scene'' to learn more about what happens in such impacts,
Schultz said. ``That is what makes this so exciting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the site was a classic case of scientific
serendipity. Schultz, a specialist in impact events who studies the
effects of objects slamming into the Earth by simulating such
impacts in his lab at Brown, has spent six years studying craters
in western Argentina that were produced by a different, later
impact. When he was giving a talk there about his research, the
woman who had been his interpreter for the talk showed him
afterward some small pieces of green natural glass that she had
picked up as a child because they were so pretty. She wondered what
they were.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz recognized them at once as being glass produced by the
heat of an impact _ a familiar relic of such events that he had
seen before at other sites. Analysis in the lab quickly proved that
his guess was correct: the glass had the characteristic
composition, including traces of the element iridium that is rare
on Earth but common in asteroids, that proved it had been produced
by an object striking the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   He soon teamed up with Argentinian geologist Marcelo Zarate, who
for many years had been studying the unusual coastal cliffs where
the glass was found. These cliffs, world-famous for their amazing
fossils of large, ancient mammals, were peppered with large chunks
of the glassy impact material, known as ``escorias,'' and reddish,
bricklike rock, known as ``tierras cocidas.'' Some of these chunks
are as much as six feet across, and Schultz refers to them as
``impact bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the size of these chunks with those found in other
impact craters, Schultz concluded that the impact must have been
caused by an asteroid about a mile across. So far, no sign of the
actual impact crater has been found, he said. It may now lie
underwater, since the coastline has moved inland by 10 to 20 miles
since the time of the impact.
</P>
<P>
   The fossilized animals known from the area are found in
abundance in the layers of rock that formed before the impact, but
are completely absent in the more recent layers, showing that they
died off just at that time _ either because of the impact itself,
or perhaps because of changes in the climate caused by dust ejected
by the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Cores of sediment drilled from the nearby sea floor show that a
sudden drop in temperature took place at about the same time. The
colder climate lasted about 50,000 years before returning to
normal. Soon after that, the Earth entered an ice age, and began a
series of oscillations between glacial and interglacial periods
that has continued until the present time.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no way of knowing yet exactly how these events
are linked, Schultz says it is possible that the impact and the
cooling produced by its ejected dust may have provided the trigger
that pushed the climate over the edge and into an unstable pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz says that discovery of this impact will make a big
difference in the study of the fossil remains from those coastal
cliffs, because there is no other material in that whole formation
that could allow scientists to determine their exact age _ although
changes in the magnetism of layers in the rock do give a good
record of the relative ages of the layers. But the impact glass
could be dated very precisely by analyzing tiny traces of
radioactive isotopes inside it, and that provides a benchmark to
calibrate the ages of the rest of the layers.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said it's as though they had a clock that gave precise
times, but didn't know if the times were a.m. or p.m. until the new
discovery came along. ``This provides a way to pinpoint the dates
of these fossils,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, it could help scientists to understand better the
range of possible effects produced by impacts. Some, like the one
believed to have killed the dinosaurs, cause global calamity and
widespread extinction of species, and others, perhaps including
this one, do only regional damage.
</P>
<P>
   And it provides yet another warning about the reality of the
threat to Earth posed by such celestial objects, he said. ``It can
happen. If it happened to the dinosaurs, it can happen to mammals.
We're not immune.''

NEW ENVIRONMENT CHIEF HUNTS, BUT SAYS HE HAS OPEN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State Senator Robert A. Durand, named Thursday as the
new environmental affairs secretary, promised that despite being a
hunter he will keep ``an open-door policy'' with animal-welfare
activists as he decides wildlife management issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlborough Democrat, who will take the post in early
January, said: ``I'll do everything I can to have an open-door
policy to all the groups out there and listen to all sides.
Ultimately, when a decision has to be made, I'll do that based on .
. . relying on the experts'' and resisting pressure from both
hunters and their critics.
</P>
<P>
   But news of Durand's selection prompted a veteran animal-rights
activist, Dorothy Checchi-O'Brien, to declare: ``God help the
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting the fox in charge of the chickens,'' said
Checchi-O'Brien, who has been lobbying for animals at the State
House for more than 25 years. ``He does have concern for the
environment, but not for animals. He looks at wildlife as game for
his fellow blood sportsmen to kill. We should advise all the
wildlife to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Rockefeller Westropp, legislative liaison for the
Massachusetts Audubon Society, said, ``We have disagreements (with
Durand) over some issues, but 99 percent of the time we see
similarly, and he's been an aggressive fighter for the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some hunting issues where we have a
disagreement, and we will fight him on that, but the positive
aspects of Bob Durand and his heart being in the right place on
environmental issues will greatly overshadow any disagreements we
have on hunting issues,'' Rockefeller Westropp said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing her sentiments, James R. Gomes of the Environmental
League of Massachusetts praised Governor Paul Cellucci for picking
``the best environmentalist in the state Legislature, someone who
is not just committed to the environment but has the political
skills and personal contacts to get things done on Beacon Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Durand infuriated hunting foes by attaching
language to a land-buying bill that changed state law to presume
all newly acquired land is open to hunting unless state officials
decide otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Many animal-rights activists also feel that under Cellucci's
administration the hunter-dominated Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife has been scheming to undermine the 1996 ballot question
that banned use of certain animal traps and encouraged the governor
to name people other than hunters to the wildlife board.
</P>
<P>
   Durand said he has ``actually had a good working relationship''
with the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals on several issues. When questions arise about how much
hunting should be allowed, Durand said he will rely on biologists
to guide his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been fair to both sides in the past,'' Durand
said, adding that burgeoning state populations of wild turkey,
bear, bald eagles and peregrine falcons show that well-regulated
hunting can be part of a policy to promote wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he thinks the 1996 trap ban has created
``tremendous beaver disruption in the commonwealth,'' Durand said,
``It's premature for me to say whether Question 1 should be changed
or not'' by legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Durand said he will wait to become secretary until shortly after
he is sworn in to the Senate in January so he can vote to reelect
Thomas F. Birmingham as Senate president. His resignation is
expected to set off a frenzied, multi-candidate race for the Senate
seat he has held since 1991. The district ranges from Westborough
to Acton to Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Durand is succeeding Trudy Coxe, who has moved to a
historic-preservation job in Newport, R.I. While pursuing largely
the same agenda as Coxe, Durand is expected to have much stronger
relationships with the Legislature, as a former member of the House
and Senate, and also with the regional US Environmental Protection
Agency office, with which Coxe has clashed over water treatment and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The regional EPA chief, John P. DeVillars, was a top aide to
former governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Durand moved to South
Dakota for several months in 1988 to run Dukakis's presidential
campaign there _ and, famously, hunt elk in his free time. Coxe and
DeVillars have had an edgy, at times bitterly hostile relationship
that has complicated state dealings with the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Durand is expected to replace many or all of Coxe's top aides,
including assistant secretaries Jan Reitsma and John Rodman, her
chief spokesman. ``I'd be crazy not to bring in my own leadership
team'' for the executive office itself, Durand said, but added that
``there's not a commissioner in that secretariat I can't work
with.''

IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY TAKES ITS TOLL ON HYDE 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the many verbal assaults that Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., had endured, this one had an especially sharp edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to default on your good name and
leadership,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., one of the House
Judiciary Committee's most liberal members, told Hyde, its
Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ominously, she added: ``History will not be kind to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the statement went far beyond the usual quibbling over
the lineup of witnesses for the committee's impeachment inquiry or
the time allotted for committee members to question them, Hyde
listened to it Tuesday with his customary air of subdued dignity.
He even drolly asked the committee's consent that ``the gentle lady
be permitted to finish her attack on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But other committee members and Hyde's friends said that behind
that quip was undoubtedly some anguish. They said Hyde was acutely
aware not just that he was standing in the spotlight of history,
but that the glare was sometimes unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   As the committee proceeded this week toward a landmark vote on
articles of impeachment, its 74-year-old chairman found his entire
political career and public image distilled into a single act of
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter century in Congress and a carefully honed
reputation for patience, prudence and fairness had come to this:
supervision of a process that had failed to win broad popular
support, exposed bitter partisan rivalries between Republicans and
Democrats and subjected Hyde to death threats and the constant
escort of a security detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stressful, extremely stressful,'' he told reporters just
before he left the hearing room Wednesday night. Asked what he
would like to be remembered for, he did not mention the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a good congressman,'' said Hyde, who is perhaps best
known for his advocacy in 1976 of the ``Hyde Amendment,'' which
restricted the use of federal money for abortion, but has also
voted for programs to provide aid for children once they are born.
``I accomplished some things, and when my time comes, I'll be
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members said that a tone of genuine self-pity
had crept into Hyde's voice for perhaps the first time last week
when he complained during the hearings that he was being browbeaten
excessively.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hahn, a close longtime friend of Hyde's from Chicago, noted
that little fissures were appearing in Hyde's famously unflappable
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came walking into that hearing the other day looking like
he was limping,'' Hahn said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
``Last week, he barked at a few people. That's not Henry Hyde,
believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's press secretary, Sam Stratman, said Hyde had been
surprised and disappointed that most Americans, according to
opinion polls, never came to share his view of the gravity of the
allegations against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's own assessment of those charges became increasingly clear
this week. While there had been some question among committee
members about whether the primary force propelling him was his own
convictions or conservatives in his party, Hyde's actions
constituted something of a hard sell for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   He held a special press conference Monday, pointing to four tall
white columns of boxes to demonstrate that the committee had
considered 60,000 pages of grand jury testimony and was not acting
rashly in calling so few witnesses. Hyde's voice had a defensive
ring.
</P>
<P>
   He also sent a letter to Republican members of the House that
beseeched them not to state their opinions about impeachment until
the committee had finished its work. The letter was clearly aimed
at moderate Republicans who might vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearings this week, he defended a course at odds with
the prevailing public sentiment, commenting to one witness, a
Jesuit priest: ``Someone said that if Jesus had taken a poll, he
would never have preached the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   By subjecting Hyde to such intense scrutiny, the impeachment
inquiry has unearthed aspects of his past he might well have
preferred to keep buried. They include an extramarital affair of
three decades ago, remarks 15 years ago that urged leniency for a
Republican congressman facing expulsion for sexual misconduct with
a teen-age congressional page, and a statement during the
Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 that ridiculed the righteousness of
people who ``label every untruth and every deception an outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has also drawn criticism for his handling of the inquiry
itself, which has occasionally veered off in surprising directions,
like the testimony of two convicted perjurers and the suggestion
that the panel might look into Clinton's campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling of constant, constant jibes from
everybody,'' said Philip Corboy, another longtime friend of Hyde's.
``It's torture for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less sympathetic. ``He's used to being treated as if
he walks on water,'' said one staff member for Democrats on the
committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, ``and I think he's
shocked and surly that his feet have gotten wet.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not be drying anytime soon. If impeachment goes to the
Senate, Hyde would most likely be the person to supervise the
presentation of the case during the trial there.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday how involved he would be, he said, ``Haven't
thought about that, and don't want to think about that.''

IN LOS ANGELES SUBURBS, APATHY ON IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks, the
affluent suburban epicenter of California's atomized civic and
political culture, the sounds Thursday were the voices of Nat and
Natalie Cole, singing soothing Christmas carols on the loudspeaker,
and the solemn business of impeachment seemed even farther away
than three time zones and 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people give a damn,'' declared Joan
Harper, 71, a dedicated mall-walker on her morning constitutional
with her friends, Harriet Klein and Mary Thomas. ``It's boring. I
haven't watched it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   John Miele, 70, a retired AT&AMP;T worker catching up on some
Christmas shopping, allowed: ``It's ridiculous. I think he should
be censured. It's all a big ploy by the Republicans just getting
back at him. I don't think he did anything to be impeached for.
They keep nagging at it. It's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Hancock, 51, a school bus driver from Pasadena, summed
up the prevailing mood, saying: ``I'm really getting bored with it.
It just keeps rolling along. It's gotten to the point where I don't
even want to pay attention. Each lawyer is just trying to outdo the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moved inexorably toward only the third vote on
presidential impeachment in U.S. history, shoppers in the San
Fernando Valley, to a person, knew full well what was afoot. But
also to a person, they long ago decided they knew all they needed
to, and on Thursday they went on about their business _ not
uninformed, just uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   On the late local television news here, impeachment does not
even make the first 10 minutes, losing out to breathless reports
about a bout of Santa Anas, the gusty desert winds of up to 100 mph
that Raymond Chandler wrote make ``meek little wives feel the edge
of the carving knife and study the back of their husbands' necks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how little interest there is, except to those
of us who follow it professionally or personally or both,'' said
Pat Caddell, the reformed pollster who has worked for politicians
as diverse as Jimmy Carter and Jerry Brown and now lives here. ``I
think it's the weirdest disconnect that I have ever seen in
American politics between the elected and the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really does say something serious about the health of the
body politic that the American people are not more engaged in
this,'' he added. ``I think people have just had to deal with too
much information all year and they think nobody listens to them
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Patt Morrison, a local columnist for The Los Angeles Times with
a sharp eye for the wry side of Southern California life, said the
current hearings contrasted sharply with Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, there was some new revelation every day,'' she said.
``With this, we knew everything, except perhaps the nuances and
shadings, from the get-go, and so the sense that each successive
videotape will result in this tsunami of shock and horror turns out
not to be the case. We've read the ending already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it seems to be about is not substance but theater,'' Ms.
Morrison added. ``And this is L.A. We've got better theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all year long, voters and viewers have paid intense
attention to the Clinton-Lewinsky show ``only when the story line
changes,'' according to Andrew Kohut, director the Pew Center for
the People and the Press in Washington which has tracked public
attitudes about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things have remained in, let's call it the analytical or
heavy-pundit phase, the public hasn't paid a lot of attention,''
Kohut said. ``Over and over again, they've said we've made some
judgments about this. We don't like him as a person, he's made some
terrible mistakes, but it's not worth booting him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who just
happened to be waiting for the Victoria's Secret to open so she
could do some shopping at the mall in Sherman Oaks before a morning
meeting there, confessed that she had been following the hearings,
``very, very closely on CNN.'' But she said her constituents show
no interest at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not on the radar screen locally,'' she said. ``I
think people are just watching it passed on to the next level,
hoping it won't go forward. But in these cases, you never know what
will happen once the process starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the prospect that the full House of Representatives may
well vote to approve articles of impeachment seems only another
irritant, and one the public feels powerless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me now,'' said Kermit Eller, 68, a
retired engineer, and a Republican, who was waiting for his wife to
finish an appointment at a hair salon in the mall. ``Considering
the behavior of the Republicans, they seem not to expect ever to
have another Republican president, or they wouldn't be so ready to
weaken the institution this way. It troubles me to see them
behaving in this irresponsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Carlisi, shopping with her 28-month old daughter, Sarah,
said she catches only snippets of the hearings on MSNBC, and would
also no longer be surprised at a vote to impeach, but added: ``I
think it would be pointless and a huge waste of taxpayers' money. I
think there's some very strong religious right money and pressure
behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton himself, the views were remarkably consistent _ and
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a dog,'' said Alicia Verde, shopping in Sherman Oaks
with her two-year old daughter, Rory, ``but what he does is up to
Hillary. He'll have his karma. Hillary will take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Mrs. Clinton was in Los Angeles on Thursday,
visiting a historic synagogue in Boyle Heights and an old-time
movie palace in downtown Los Angeles as part of her national ``Save
America's Treasures'' campaign to preserve historic buildings and
sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the Farmer's Market in the Fairfax District in the middle of
Los Angeles, Amy Doering, a 27-year old post-production supervisor
at the nearby CBS Television City, said of the hearings: ``It makes
me sick to my stomach. I don't want to hear about it, and I don't
care about anyone's sex life. It's more than understood that the
general public is over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lurie, a 92-year-old retired electrical engineer said he
had been following the hearings _ ``every inch of it,'' as he put
it _ and still did not believe Clinton's actions warranted
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is his cup of tea,'' Lurie said. ``I think he's
done a pretty good job as president, and let him complete his
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Rubin, a 61-year-old photographer and designer from
Beverly Hills, said she and her friends were glued to the televised
hearings while at their gym the other night, but said, ``This
should have been resolved privately,'' and added, ``I think the
country doesn't have a say in this. I feel like the whole thing is
controlled by the committee and Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sherman Oaks, the mall-walker, Ms. Harper, doubted that the
Senate would ever vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break,'' she said. ``I bet you half the senators
have done the same thing.'' When her friends asked her about the
possibility of censure, she dismissed that, too. ``What are they
going to give him? Twenty push-ups? Like the T-shirt says, ``The
boat sank: Get over it.''

ANTI-TRANSPLANT GROUP SEEKS FEDERAL BAR OF RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An activist coalition Thursday petitioned the federal
government to halt clinical research on animal-to-human
transplants, saying the risk of spreading dangerous infections to
recipients and other people is too great.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Responsible Transplantation, which says it
represents public interest groups, environmental organizations,
scientists and medical professionals, said it has filed a petition
with the US Department of Health and Human Services to ban
xenotransplantation, as such transplants are called, saying it may
``unleash new viruses into the human population.''
</P>
<P>
   Alix Fano, a representative of the CRT, said the group is asking
the government to prohibit clinical trials of xenotransplantation,
which are at present regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   She said the only such trials currently under way are
transplants of pig nerve tissue to treat Parkinson's disease, and
experiments using pig livers _ outside the patient's body _ to
cleanse the circulation.
</P>
<P>
   An HHS spokesman confirmed that the petition had been received,
but had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The group's announcement came at a press conference in Boston,
which is also the site of a two-day conference on
xenotransplantation.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists pursuing xenotransplantation say that using organs
from pigs or other animals is the best potential solution to the
drastic shortage of human donor organs. Although pig brain cells
have been transplanted in the Parkinson's experiments, the problem
of immune rejection has so far been a barrier to implants of
hearts, kidneys and other animal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about transmitting known or unknown infectious agents
through such transplants is not new: last January federal
scientists and regulators held a two-day hearing on the risks and
decided that researchers could continue the work cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   The critics at Thursday's press conference included two doctors,
a lawyer, a veterinarian, a biochemist, a nurse and an author of a
book on animal testing. They said they oppose xenotransplantation
on a variety of grounds: that it is dangerous, unlikely to be
successful, is being driven by profit motives, will cause harm to
animals, and is the wrong way to solve the shortage of donor
organs.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, six of the seven said they were vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Block, chief of staff at a veterinary hospital in Rhode
Island, said that pigs and nonhuman primates harbor at least 50
known organisms that may infect people. ``Most infectious agents
start in animals,'' he said, adding that there's no way to test for
all of them and it would be impossible to create herds of donor
animals that would be free of all such agents.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is particular concern about a type of virus that
routinely infects pigs and which has been shown to be capable of
infecting human cells in the laboratory. The viruses are known as
porcine endogenous retroviruses or PERVs. Xenotransplant
researchers say there is no evidence that they infect humans
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   However, Block told the press conference that the potential for
transmitting the viruses to patients in an animal transplant is
``an undeniable risk to public health and safety.'' he told the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard G. McLellan, an emergency medicine specialist from
Los Angeles, warned that xenotransplants would endanger not just
graft recipients but anyone with whom the recipients came in
contact, threatening a ``worldwide epidemic.'' He and others called
for intensified efforts to get people to donate organs after their
death. At present there are about 70,000 people in the United
States waiting for donor organs, and many die without receiving
them.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the xenotransplant conference, sponsored by IBC
Group plc, defended their work as necessary and said there is no
evidence to suggest that transplants pose an unacceptable risk of
transmitting infections. The conference was to be followed by a
special workshop Friday on ways to check for ``xenozoonoses'' _ the
technical term for human-to-animal infections.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey L. Platt, a transplant surgeon and researcher at the
Mayo Clinic and chairman of the xenotransplant conference, said
scientists are looking carefully at the problem of PERV and other
animal infectious agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is even less reason to be concerned today than there was
a year ago,'' said Platt, because of research on the question.

ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS SANCTIONS AGAINST AUTO INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The process of setting next year's auto insurance rates
is proving to be contentious to the very end, as the attorney
general's office said Thursday it is seeking hefty sanctions
against the insurance industry for failing to provide sought-after
executive salary information.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the industry's ``deliberate and inexcusable''
noncompliance with his information request, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger asked Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt to sharply
limit how much the industry can recover for expenses in next year's
rates.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance industry spokesman said the sanctions were
unwarranted. If approved, he said, they would cost companies more
than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The spat over salaries is only the latest dogfight in what
insiders say has been one of the most bitterly fought rate cases in
state history. The industry is seeking a 15.5 percent rate hike in
1999, while opponents are pushing for a rate cut of about 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt is supposed to issue her rate decision by Tuesday, but
many expect the decision to be delayed. This year the industry and
its opponents did not stipulate agreement on any part of the case,
as they have in past years. They also filed more than 500 pages of
briefs, about twice the volume of previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The salary issue epitomized the no-holds-barred nature of this
year's hearings. Joanna Connolly, an assistant attorney general,
said the industry is seeking a double-digit increase in the expense
portion of the 1999 rates and the attorney general's office wanted
the salary information to determine whether that increase was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials said they suspected Harshbarger's office
asked for the salary information during a close race for governor
to grandstand with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office asked for the compensation of the
10 highest-paid employees at each company whose salaries were
included in whole or in part in the expense portion of the
industry's rate request.
</P>
<P>
   According to the attorney general's office, the industry had to
be repeatedly ordered to turn over the information. What was
reluctantly produced was unintelligible and of no use, Connolly
said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking sanctions, the attorney general's office said
penalties were needed ``to ensure that the public does not view the
rate-setting hearing as a process `controlled' by the insurers, a
process in which the insurers provide just as much information as
they want and no more, flouting orders to provide additional
information with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnston, president of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of
Massachusetts, said the information supplied to the attorney
general was easily understandable. ``It's quite readable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the information, which was not made part of the
public record, did not include employee or company names. ``We
never could figure out what they wanted the information for,'' he
said.

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOLS IMPROVING
 &HT;    650 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Carolina student test scores are rising,
fewer students are carrying weapons and more high school students
are graduating, but drug use in public schools has increased,
according to a national report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina improved more than any other state in the
percentage of students carrying a weapon on school property.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1995, the number of North Carolina students
carrying a weapon decreased from 14 percent to 9 percent. Most
states saw no change in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members attributed the state's success to zero-tolerance
policies, increased law enforcement presence in schools and other
community efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The number of North Carolina students who are at least
proficient on the math section of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress increased. The NAEP measures student ability
on three levels: basic, proficient and advanced. Proficient
students demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter and
are well prepared for the next level of schooling. Between 1990 and
1996, the number of proficient eighth-graders jumped from 9 percent
to 20 percent. Nationally, that number increased from 15 percent to
24 percent. Overall, more North Carolina students are receiving
degrees in mathematics and science, including women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in
mathematics and science increased from 36 percent to 42 percent.
The number of minorities receiving such degrees increased from 38
percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina also has increased the number of high school
graduates. Between 1990 and 1996, the completion rates rose from 83
percent to 89 percent. Nationally, graduation rates have remained
stagnant at 86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all good. In 1997, about 22 percent of students
said they used marijuana at least once in the past 30 days. That
number was up from 15 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no comparable data available nationally, the
Virgin Islands had some of the lowest percentages of all the states
at 15 percent for marijuana use and availability of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   More teachers also reported that student disruptions in class
interfered with learning. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of
North Carolina teachers reporting disruptions increased from 42
percent to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hope the report will help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

ARMY ACCUSES GENERAL OF AFFAIRS WITH 4 SUBORDINATES' WIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army charged a retired two-star general
Thursday with 17 counts of misconduct stemming from adulterous
relationships he had with the wives of four officers under his
command in a case that has forced the Army to revise its retirement
policy for officers facing charges of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. David Hale, had served only four months
as the Army's deputy inspector general when the Army granted his
request to retire last February, even though one of the women had
filed a formal complaint accusing him of coercing her into a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who was deputy commander of NATO ground forces for
southeastern Europe at the time of the relationship, now faces the
military equivalent of a grand jury hearing to determine whether he
should face a court-martial, even though he has retired.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Hale would be only the second Army general to face
court-martial since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military
Justice in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The other case was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert Grow, the
military attache in Moscow, was charged with dereliction of duty _
in what one historian considered Cold War hysteria _ after his
diary was stolen from a hotel room in Germany and published by East
Germany's Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   The charges come only a week after the Navy accepted what
amounted to a plea bargain by a one-star admiral accused of
steering $150,000 worth of military contracts to a woman with whom
he was having an adulterous affair. That officer, Rear Adm. John
Scudi, agreed to resign at a lower rank with a significantly
smaller pension, to pay a $7,000 fine and to spend 30 days under
house arrest rather than face a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases _ involving sexual liaisons and lies about about them
_ played out against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry now
moving ahead against President Clinton in the House Judiciary
Committee. Some Republicans and retired military personnel have
argued that Clinton, as commander in chief, should be held to the
same moral standards as those spelled out in the Uniform Code of
Military Justice.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all the charges, which include ``conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,'' making false statements
and obstructing justice, Hale could face a maximum of 56 years in
prison, as well as a reduction in rank and benefits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Army's handling of Hale's case led to accusations of a
double standard of justice, which allowed senior officers to
sidestep discipline while junior officers or enlisted personnel
faced more-vigorous prosecution. The charges surfaced only weeks
after the highly publicized court-martial of the Army's top
enlisted soldier, Gene McKinney, sergeant major of the Army, who
faced 18 counts of sexual misconduct involving six women, although
he was convicted of only one charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's chief of staff, Gen. Dennis Reimer, has acknowledged
that he knew that an internal inquiry had begun against Hale when
he approved Hale's retirement in February.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters Thursday, Reimer said he believed
he made the right decision at the time but that additional
information had come out, including a report by the Pentagon's
inspector general in July. He added that General Hale's retirement
never precluded an investigation and that the Army pursued the case
aggressively once the gravity of the allegations became known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what I knew at that point in time, I think the decision
was a solid decision,'' Reimer said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Hale, 53, grew out of accusations by
Donnamaria Carpino, whose husband served under the general's
command at the NATO base in Izmir, Turkey. She accused Hale of
trumping up adultery charges against her husband and then promising
not to pursue them if she agreed to have sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hale was divorcing his wife after 30 years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpino's accusations prompted an investigation by the
Pentagon's inspector general, who concluded in July that Hale had
engaged in a pattern of ``inappropriate behavior'' with her and the
other women beginning as early as 1994, when Hale served in Hawaii.
The inspector general's report found, however, that the general's
relationship with Ms. Carpino was consensual, not coerced.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has denied the accusations to the Army and the Pentagon,
submitting a 40-page rebuttal to the inspector general's report.

TWO SPACECRAFT TO FOLLOW THE WATER FOR SIGNS OF MARTIAN LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to find life, ``follow the water,'' NASA science
chief Edward Weiler once said. That's what two new spacecraft,
about to be launched to explore the planet Mars, plan to do, along
with another craft that is already there, waiting to begin its real
work.
</P>
<P>
   Water is the key to finding life elsewhere in the universe. The
other ingredients needed for life _ energy and organic molecules _
exist virtually everywhere on other planets, moons, comets, and
even in clouds of gas and dust. So to find out where else life may
exist, Weiler says, it comes down to the water.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter, which is to be launched at 1:45 p.m.
Friday, and the Mars Polar Lander, to follow on Jan. 3, will probe
for evidence of water in the air, on the ground, and beneath the
planet's surface. The plan is to pin down whether, and if so where,
water has existed on Mars to support the origin and evolution of
living organisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most compelling questions'' facing scientists ``is
whether life on Earth is unique,'' Weiler said Thursday at a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration briefing on the Mars
missions. ``The upcoming launches of Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars
Polar Lander are part of the process of fulfilling that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Climate Orbiter, originally scheduled for launch
Thursday, was delayed after a software glitch was discovered in a
last-minute check. But officials said Thursday that the software
had been fixed and checked out, and that the launch could go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The craft will function much like weather satellites above the
Earth do, monitoring the planet's clouds and studying the surface
for signs of moisture, including the occasional snow or frost known
to appear on Mars' surface. It will also analyze the moisture
content of the air itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Polar Lander will set down on what is believed to be
one of the wettest parts of the red planet _ the south polar
icecap. It will study the soil, and look up to examine moisture in
the air from the ground to two miles up. Together, the two craft
will scrutinize the entire atmosphere of Mars with far greater
detail than any previous spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two tiny devices resembling lawn darts, carried by
the Polar Lander, will be fired shortly before the landing and will
strike the ground with a force of about 30,000 times the force of
gravity, to penetrate an estimated two to three feet deep. They
will look for traces of water in the soil, which many scientists
consider the most promising place to look. While liquid water
cannot exist on the Martian surface because of its low air
pressure, water could flow just below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   And living organisms, which scientists say would be destroyed by
ultraviolet light on the surface because Mars lacks a protective
ozone layer, could survive underground _ if there is water to
support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to follow the water, and that's what these two
missions are all about,'' Weiler said. ``You have to track water
over the whole globe.''
</P>
<P>
   The two spacecraft were developed and built for a combined cost
of $190 million, less than the cost of the Mars Pathfinder lander,
which was touted as a sterling example of NASA's new ``cheaper,
faster, better'' philosophy. ``We have accomplished this
development of two spacecraft for the price of one,'' said project
manager John McNamee.
</P>
<P>
   The new craft will supplement information already gathered by
the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which has been orbiting the
red planet since September of last year and has discovered evidence
that Mars had water on its surface for much longer than most
scientists suspected. The Global Surveyor will not begin its
primary mission of mapping the planet until March, but it has taken
preliminary pictures that reveal clear signs of the effects of
flowing and standing water.

   Scientists have known from pictures taken in the 1970s that Mars
was marked by channels apparently carved by flowing water, but they
have vigorously debated whether those features could have been
caused by brief flash-floods, perhaps caused by large meteorites
striking frozen ground and causing a brief melting, or whether
water existed on the surface for longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   Now, pictures from Global Surveyor show the first clear evidence
for long-lasting water. Michael Malin, the geologist who designed
Surveyor's main camera, said Wednesday: ``Mars has had a
significantly more interesting history than we had conceived of''
before this mission.
</P>
<P>
   One picture in particular, Malin said, changes the whole picture
of Mars' climate history. It shows a large, deep canyon with a
tiny, meandering river channel at its bottom, providing ``one of
the most profound geological observations we've made'' on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, such formations are seen only where flowing water has
been at work on the landscape over millions of years, for example,
the channel of the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. ``The
fact that we see the channel within the valley argues that this was
a long-term flowing river,'' he said. ``This is the first evidence
we've ever had from Mars of this sustained fluid motion.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning, he added. When Global Surveyor
begins its full two-year mission in March, it will produce pictures
that are ``three to 30 times better than anything'' seen so far,
Malin said. Those pictures, he said, could help pinpoint the places
to focus on in planned missions in 2003 and 2005, which will
retrieve samples of rock and soil to be brought back to Earth by a
later mission, to search for traces of life.

AWARD-WINNING INMATE JOURNALIST SEEKS TO APPEAL MURDER CONVICTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ An award-winning inmate journalist is
attempting to convince a federal judge that he was unaware for two
decades that the race-conscious method of selecting his grand jury
might be a viable avenue for appealing his murder conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilbert Rideau, editor of the prison magazine The Angolite,
may have an uphill battle. Rideau has been incarcerated at the
Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The Calcasieu Parish district attorney is moving to dismiss
Rideau's motion for habeas corpus, based on the claim that the 37
years which have passed since the commission of the crime would
make it difficult for the state to mount another trial against him.
</P>
<P>
   A state appellate court denied his last appeal in 1973, and U.S.
District Judge Frank Polozola was skeptical Thursday when Rideau's
attorney argued that his client learned only recently through
researching another inmate's case that the composition of his grand
jury was not a dead issue.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal magistrate has recommended Rideau be either
released or re-tried, saying the Louisiana Supreme Court applied
the wrong legal standard more than two decades ago in requiring him
to prove ``prejudice'' as a result of the grand jury composition.
``To the contrary, the (Supreme) court has specifically held that a
showing of prejudice is not necessary to prevail on a claim that
there was racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury,''
U.S. Magistrate Christine Noland wrote in her late 1997
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau was tried, convicted and sentenced to death three times
for a murder stemming from a Calcasieu Parish bank robbery. The
U.S. Supreme Court overturned Rideau's first conviction because of
the prejudicial nature of pre-trial publicity. His second
conviction was overturned by the Louisiana State Supreme Court
because the judge improperly excluded from the jury people who said
they did not believe in capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau's third conviction was upheld despite Rideau's arguments
(for the second time) that the parish grand jury system violated
his constitutional rights. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled on
that last appeal in 1973 that Rideau had not proved that the system
actually discriminated against him, and that a disparity between
the percentage of blacks in the parish and the percentage of blacks
selected for the grand jury was not in and of itself
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty in 1974, and
Rideau's death penalty was commuted to life in prison. Attorney
Julian Murray told Polozola on Thursday that other attorneys
subsequently told Rideau there were no other legal avenues
available to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Mr. Rideau just waited too long,'' Polozola
said, noting that this latest appeal was filed 20 years after the
Louisiana Supreme Court last addressed the question of the grand
jury's racial makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with an incompetent defendant here,''
Polozola said, noting that the first line of the magistrate's
report is in praise of Rideau's legal ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he takes the stand, he's going to say he was not keeping up
with the new law?'' Polozola asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Murray countered that Rideau, 56, entered prison with an 8th
grade education, and that his sophistication and legal knowledge
developed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1994 on, he's sophisticated?'' Polozola asked.
</P>
<P>
   Polozola further noted that he was always inclined to disregard
procedural questions if the defendant's innocence was at question.
But even his attorney conceded that he could not argue that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been interviewed too many times ... for me to try to get
up here and say he didn't do it,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Polozola ordered an evidentiary hearing after the first of the
year on both the state's specific problems in mounting a new trial
(missing evidence, dead witnesses) and Rideau's lack of knowledge
of the legal remedies available to him.
</P>
<P>
   Calcasieu Parish District Attorney Rick Bryant and assistant
district attorney Mike Stratton were buoyed by the judge's remarks.
But Bryant said he felt certain they could still re-convict Rideau
if a new trial is ordered, based on the testimony of witness Dora
McCain, who survived a gunshot wound to the head, and Rideau's
previous statements about the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been on Ted Koppell (network television) admitting the
crime, he's been before the Pardon Board admitting the crime,''
Bryant said. He called Rideau ``the darling of a lot of criminal
defense lawyers around the state'' but added that Dora McCain is
still afraid of him.
</P>
<P>
   Rideau has published two books on prison life and has received
some of America's highest journalism awards _ including the George
Polk Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award. He
co-directed a 1998 film about Angola called ``The Farm'' that won
the Sundance Grand Jury Prize for documentaries.

ATTORNEY GENERAL SEEKS SANCTIONS AGAINST AUTO INSURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The process of setting next year's auto insurance rates
is proving to be contentious to the very end, as the attorney
general's office said Thursday it is seeking hefty sanctions
against the insurance industry for failing to provide sought-after
executive salary information.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the industry's ``deliberate and inexcusable''
noncompliance with his information request, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger asked Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt to sharply
limit how much the industry can recover for expenses in next year's
rates.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance industry spokesman said the sanctions were
unwarranted. If approved, he said, they would cost companies more
than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The spat over salaries is only the latest dogfight in what
insiders say has been one of the most bitterly fought rate cases in
state history. The industry is seeking a 15.5 percent rate hike in
1999, while opponents are pushing for a rate cut of about 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt is supposed to issue her rate decision by Tuesday, but
many expect the decision to be delayed. This year the industry and
its opponents did not stipulate agreement on any part of the case,
as they have in past years. They also filed more than 500 pages of
briefs, about twice the volume of previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The salary issue epitomized the no-holds-barred nature of this
year's hearings. Joanna Connolly, an assistant attorney general,
said the industry is seeking a double-digit increase in the expense
portion of the 1999 rates and the attorney general's office wanted
the salary information to determine whether that increase was
warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But industry officials said they suspected Harshbarger's office
asked for the salary information during a close race for governor
to grandstand with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office asked for the compensation of the
10 highest-paid employees at each company whose salaries were
included in whole or in part in the expense portion of the
industry's rate request.
</P>
<P>
   According to the attorney general's office, the industry had to
be repeatedly ordered to turn over the information. What was
reluctantly produced was unintelligible and of no use, Connolly
said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking sanctions, the attorney general's office said
penalties were needed ``to ensure that the public does not view the
rate-setting hearing as a process `controlled' by the insurers, a
process in which the insurers provide just as much information as
they want and no more, flouting orders to provide additional
information with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Johnston, president of the Automobile Insurers Bureau of
Massachusetts, said the information supplied to the attorney
general was easily understandable. ``It's quite readable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the information, which was not made part of the
public record, did not include employee or company names. ``We
never could figure out what they wanted the information for,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE>
BOARD TO CUT COD FISHING BY 80 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAKEFIELD, Mass. _ Fisheries officials said Thursday they will
slash cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine by 80 percent next year in a
drastic attempt to restore the species, and warned that government
will have to pick up the pieces of a fishing industry that stands
to be similarly decimated.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen predicted that the clampdown on fishing in the Gulf of
Maine, which includes the near-shore waters from northern
Massachusetts to eastern Maine, will drive many small-boat owners
out of business because their vessels aren't equipped for fishing
farther from shore, leaving them nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   But, faced with a new biological study that found the
once-bountiful cod population has reached a dangerous low, members
of the New England Fishery Management Council said they have to act
now to prevent the ``commercial extinction'' of the cod.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bruce Tarr, a Gloucester Democrat, predicted that the cod
cutbacks will ``necessitate unprecedented levels of social
relief,'' and said, ``You are looking squarely at the possible
extinction of an entire segment of fishing families.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 700 boats rely on cod and other groundfish in the Gulf
of Maine for an important part of their livelihood _ including 200
small boats on Cape Ann _ and they in turn support thousands of
fishing industry jobs. Unlike larger vessels that can steam out to
the Georges Banks cod fishing ground, these boats have limited
range.
</P>
<P>
   Since the closure of large sections of Georges Bank in 1994,
however, bigger boats have come into the Gulf of Maine and,
combined with increased effort from the near-shore fleet, quickly
drove the cod populations to record lows.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing ground ``is collapsing and we need to protect it
now,'' said Capt. Paul Howard, executive director of the Fishery
Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council, planning to adopt rules for the fishing season that
begins next May, chose three options for more study that would
reduce gulf cod landings from last year's 4,075 tons to 782 tons
next year. All of the choices, ranging from broad closures of the
gulf to drastic reductions in fish landings per trip, will be
painful to the small-boat fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Making the limits even tougher, some of the measures that will
protect the cod, such as area closures, will also prevent fishermen
from catching other so-called groundfish such as flounder, for
which the same type of nets are used.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the region's congressional delegation sent
representatives to Thursday's meeting, calling for compassion in
the cutbacks and more aid like the $5 million Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts secured this fall for the groundfish crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were regretful that their more modest fishing
limits over the past three years had not stopped the crash of the
cod population, forcing harsher measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of some of the most radical measures in
the council's history and it would not do justice if we don't come
out of the crisis with a new way of thinking,'' said Erik Anderson,
a New Hampshire fisherman on the council, calling for an end of the
cycle of crises and regulations that has plagued New England
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, fishermen and their advocates were angry, but, unlike
past meetings where most were skeptical of overfishing claims, many
seemed to accept that the cod crisis is real. ``We are all in the
same boat, and it is leaking,'' said Vito J. Calomo, director of
the Gloucester Fisheries Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Gulf of Maine Fishermen's Alliance put forward one
of the three options for study, a plan that calls for the gulf to
be divided into near-shore and offshore waters, with fishermen
choosing which area they want to fish. That way, they argued,
fishermen can help manage a fishing ground rather than moving from
one to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know this is your playground, your backyard, you're
certainly going to take better care of it than if you know it's
just a transient place,'' said alliance president Paul Cohan.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts for the Fishery Management Council said the
alliance proposal, while keeping boats on the water, would only
meet the fishing goals if fishermen were limited to 100 pounds of
cod on each trip, a limit so small that few would bother.
</P>
<P>
   The council also agreed to study a proposal from National Marine
Fisheries Service that would reduce the number of groundfishing
days a year from the current 88 to 70, close big swaths of the gulf
to groundfishing, and lower the cod limit from the current 400
pounds to 200 pounds per trip. That idea was the least popular with
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   The council staff will have until next month to assess the
social and economic impacts of the three choices, allowing the
council to select the least painful cutbacks, which would then be
reviewed by the National Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   But Angela Sanfilippo, president of the Gloucester Fishermen's
Wives, said she already knows what will happen to the fishing towns
if fishermen can't fish. ``The Gloucester waterfront will be gone.
Condominiums, luxury hotels, and tourists will take its its
place,'' she said. ``Who will benefit when the fish come back?''

ACTOR BANNEN FOUND CAREER, ARIZONA BY CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. - In ``Waking Ned Devine,'' Ian Bannen is the
perfect Irishman. When you meet him, he appears to be the
quintessential British actor.
</P>
<P>
   So what's he doing living in Mesa?
</P>
<P>
   Bannen fell in love with the Arizona desert when acting in his
first American movie, ``Flight of the Phoenix,'' which was shot in
Yuma in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen's latest film, ``Waking Ned Devine,'' is a winsome comedy
about two old Irishmen who scheme to get a share of big lottery
winnings in their small village. The film has the same kind of
lilting, nostalgic humor that made ``The Englishman Who Went Up the
Hill and Came Down the Mountain'' so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen is the Englishman who came to Arizona and never went home
again.
</P>
<P>
   He had a small role in ``The Flight of the Phoenix,'' which
starred James Stewart, Peter Finch and Richard Attenborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cast stayed in Yuma, and we had to make our own fun
because there weren't any girls in the movie,'' Bannen recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Stewart led us to a different cafe every night, and we
sang ``Happy Birthday to You'' every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dicky Attenborough, who never drank at all, had such a red
face that everyone thought he was drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time he worked in Hollywood, Bannen took his wife to
Yuma. ``At first she thought I had brought her to the end of the
Earth,'' he said. ``But she got to like the place, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen then made ``Bite the Bullet'' with Ben Johnson, who had
just bought a home in the Valley, and he tipped them off. The
Bannens bought a Mesa house in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   They live here in the winter months and call London and the Isle
of Wight their other homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in Mesa as much as we can,'' Bannen said. ``But
moviemaking is so all over the place now. When I first started,
they used to shoot them in the studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen has spent most of his career as a character actor, the
kind whose face you recognize but whose name you can't quite place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' could change all of that by becoming one
of the year's big sleeper hits.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie began as a questionable prospect for Bannen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the script and liked it, but wondered if they'd ever
get the money for it,'' he explained. ``You get a certain amount of
scripts, but they never get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director took four years to write the screenplay, walking
around Ireland on and off, meeting these wonderful characters.''
</P>
<P>
   When writer-director Kirk Jones finally found funding for
``Waking Ned Devine,'' he searched Ireland for the perfect village
to shoot the story _ and didn't find it.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up shooting on the Isle of Mann, where they found a
village as quaint as a magazine advertisement for Irish travel.
Many of the village residents appear in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very jolly,'' Bannen said. ``Irish actors are easy
to get on with. The villagers joined in the fun, and they liked the
free food and the occasional champagne.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen enjoyed filming there because ``there's a wonderful air
on the Isle of Mann, the sweet smell of wildflowers and things you
don't smell in England anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As a tale of ordinary men who grasp a chance to turn con
artists, ``Waking Ned Devine'' is full of amusing surprises _ not
the least of which is the scene where Bannen and his elderly
co-star, David Kelly, go skinny-dipping in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first nude scene Bannen had ever done. ``I've been in
my knickers before,'' he said, ``but that was the first time I had
to go all the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director made it easy for us. Kirk asked everyone but the
camera and sound crews to disappear behind the rocks. Then we
dropped our trousers, and he yelled action.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had to go further than Bannen. He hops aboard a motorbike
without having time to dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was terrified out of his wits riding the motorbike
naked,'' Bannen recalled. ``I don't think he'd ever been on a
motorbike before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I don't care a damn if I was stark naked, I was
in fear of my life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He envisioned himself arriving at St. Peter's Gate stark
naked, wearing only a motorcycle helmet, and he'd be asked, `Now,
where have you been?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although they seem like old friends throughout the movie, Bannen
had never worked with Kelly before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all of an age,'' Bannen said, explaining the easy
camaraderie. ``From the moment we started in rehearsal, we seemed
to get on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could talk about people like Terry Thomas and Peter
Sellers. When you tell younger people about them, they don't know
who you're talking about because they're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bannen takes a rather off-handed approach to his career as a
movie actor, it's because he fell into it by accident.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, he was visiting Dublin on a holiday with a friend
who said, ``We must get hold of some popsies.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant girls. His friend knew the wife of a movie producer
who lived there. The boys figured wherever a movie producer goes
there would be actresses around, so they wangled an invitation for
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of dinner, she asked me if I had ever done any
acting,'' Bannen said about the first time the muse called.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring she might know something he didn't, Bannen ended up
with a small part in a production at the famous Gate Theater in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't stick with acting because he knew he was going into
the army soon. He returned home to do some farming to toughen up
for the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army was better than the farming,'' Bannen said.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned from the service, he didn't want to go to
acting school, ``which is what I should have done. So I bought a
good suit, a bowler hat and an umbrella, and started going around
to producers' offices.''
</P>
<P>
   One secretary took pity on him, told him her boss was busy but
if he came back she'd try to get him in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Bannen came back 12 times before the boss wasn't busy.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, he had learned two monologues by heart. He
performed one for the producer, who asked him: ``Do you like doing
this sort of thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen said, ``No, I'm just desperate for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer sent him to an agent, and the agent got him into
the Royal Shakespeare Theater, under the theory that if he was
going to be an actor it would be a good idea if he learned how to
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all the great British actors every night from the
wings, Richard Burton, Michael Redgrave,'' Bannen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gradually get the idea that way. So when your chance
comes, you remember things that you saw, like the way Burton was so
still onstage. He never moved his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage training gives you confidence, like it does for
stand-up comedians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen turned that confidence into a movie career stretched over
70 films, including ``Gandhi,'' ``Gorky Park'' and ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now with his starring role in ``Waking Ned Devine,'' people will
remember his face _ and perhaps other parts, too. &QL;

 &HT;    REPORT SHOWS MIXED RESULTS FOR COLORADO SCHOOLS
 &HT;    610 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Colorado schools have steadily boosted student math
scores and parental involvement, but fewer teachers have degrees in
their areas of instruction and classroom disruptions remain a
problem, according to a national report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National Goals Report released by the National
Education Goals Panel gives U.S. states a snapshot of how much
their students are improving compared with others across the
country. Texas was one of the most improved states.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton in a written statement said he was pleased
with the nation's progress, but it ``still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to press Congress to help give our students
smaller classes, well-prepared teachers and modernized school
buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   States were evaluated in eight areas: children's readiness for
school, graduation and dropout rates, academic achievement, teacher
education, international standing in math and science, adult
literacy, school safety and parental participation in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In each area, states were evaluated on several factors. The
following are highlights:
</P>
<P>
   The number of principals reporting parent associations are
influencing school policy jumped from 28 percent to 50 percent
between 1991 and 1994. Most states saw no change in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members attributed the state's success to several programs
that require that parents be included in decision-making
committees. Increased public interest in education and
correspondence with parents also have helped, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Colorado fourth- and eighth-graders who are at
least proficient on the math section of the National Assessment of
Educational Progress has increased. The NAEP measures student
ability on three levels: basic, proficient and advanced. Proficient
students demonstrate competency over challenging subject matter and
are well prepared for the next level of schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1996, the number of proficient fourth-graders
rose from 17 percent to 22 percent, compared with an increase from
18 percent to 21 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1996, the number of proficient eighth-graders
jumped from 17 percent to 25 percent, compared with an increase
from 15 percent to 24 percent nationally. Overall, more Colorado
students are receiving degrees in mathematics and science,
including women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women receiving degrees in
mathematics and science increased from 43 percent to 47 percent.
The number of minorities receiving such degrees increased from 46
percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 37 percent of women and 40 percent of minorities
received such degrees in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not all good. Between 1991 and 1994, the number of
Colorado teachers holding a degree in their main teaching
assignment decreased from 74 percent to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, about 49 percent of teachers reported that student
disruptions in the classroom were interfering with learning. That
number was up from 40 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the goals panel said they hope the report will help
states improve their practices and encourage them to become more
competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often said that there's no problem in American education
that is not already solved in some American school or school
system,'' said panel chairman and West Virginia Gov. Cecil
Underwood. ``The pressing need is to discover those practices that
are working and the lessons we can all learn as we strive to
improve achievement and opportunities in our own communities.''

PATRIOTS PLAYER FOUND NOT GUILTY IN ASSAULT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRENTHAM, Mass. _ Patriots tight end Ben T. Coates was found not
guilty Thursday of assault and battery on his former girlfriend and
the mother of one of his children.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Marshall had accused him of knocking her down and
throwing her onto the hood of her car during a confrontation last
July 26 at his Franklin home over his seeing another woman.
</P>
<P>
   The six-person District Court jury deliberated less than an hour
after three days of trial before acquitting Coates of the single
count.
</P>
<P>
   Coates was not present to take the verdict. With the permission
of Judge Daniel B. Winslow, Coates left as soon as the jury retired
and flew to Greenwood, S.C., to attend to the funeral of his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   She died Wednesday night while Coates was still on trial. The
jury was not informed of the reason Coates was missing for the
taking of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sander, a spokeswoman for Coates's defense team, said
that Patriots' owner Robert Kraft had furnished a private jet that
took his star player from Norwood to Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   Coates's chief accuser Jennifer Marshall, too, was absent when
the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Coates's attorney Mark Berthiaume said he was sure Coates would
feel vindicated and added, ``These charges should never have been
brought. There was no merit to them. This was a woman that was
motivated by greed. This was a woman who tried to take advantage of
this man.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Norfolk District Attorney Glenn Cunha had told the
jury he would show that on the July evening Coates knocked Marshall
down, and when she got up, picked her up by the arms and threw her
onto the hood of her white Mercedews Benz 420.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall testified she suffered abrasions on her arms and a sore
neck and a bump on the head. Three Franklin police officers
testified they found Marshall crying when they were called to the
scene by Coates and neighbors who heard the altercation.
</P>
<P>
   But two neighbors of the expensive circular condominium complex
testified for the defense that Marshall had shouted an unbroken
string of obscenities and threats at the impassive Coates, had
struck him, slapped his face twice, taunted him to hit her back,
telling he would be arrested, and began crying only when police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors testified that as Coates stood with his arms
folded across his chest and urged Marshall to leave, she slapped
his face and bumped him with her chest and ``just waled at him,''
in the words of witness Donna Dumont.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Marshall began to hit Coates' visitor, office manager
Cynthia Modica, did he shove her away, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Berthiaume told the jury that Marshall had been involved in a
probate court proceeding with Coates at the time of the incident
and had tried to get more than the current $54,000 a year in child
support and had tried to get him to buy her a $46,000 Mercedes Benz
and a $750,000 house.
</P>
<P>
   Among witnesses Berthiaume called was a North Shore car dealer,
Manuel Cintron, who testified that when he suggested that Marshall
might not be able to raise the money for an expensive car she was
looking at, she told him that she could make the payments with her
child support money and that, besides, she would soon be in the
news and that he should keep reading the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness was real estate broker Catherine Sullivan who
showed Marshall a $750,000 house on Aug. 4, nine days after the
incident. Concerning the question of whether she could become
qualified to buy it, Marshall replied she was the girlfriend of
Coates and expected to come into some money before the probable
cause hearing on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were her exact words?'' asked Berthiaume.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she owned his contract and he would be running on the
field for the rest of his life for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing for about five seconds for effect, Berthiaume concluded
drily: ``I have no more questions.''

 &HT;    Experimental procedure may cure sickle cell
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For seven years, sickle cell disease got the best of
Keone Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's payback time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 12-year-old Centerville, Ga., boy is scheduled to
undergo an experimental procedure that could mean the end _ forever
_ of blood transfusions, unpredictable bouts of severe pain and the
worry of suffering a second stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a cure for sickle cell disease, which
disproportionately affects African-Americans. More than 2,000 metro
Atlanta residents suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, blood cells taken from the placenta and
umbilical cord of a new mother will grow inside Keone's body into
healthy new bone marrow. It will replace his defective bone marrow,
which churned out sticky, odd-shaped red blood cells, making him
vulnerable to infections and organ damage since infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanting cord blood into a sickle cell patient to regrow
bone marrow has never been done, said Dr. Andrew Yeager, director
of pediatric hematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at
Emory University School of Medicine(Ga.). Cord blood transplants
have been successful for leukemia and immune disorders, and a
similar procedure _ a bone marrow transplant from a related donor _
has cured some sickle cell patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keone and his mother are akin to pioneers,'' said Yeager,
who's overseeing the team of doctors treating Keone at Egleston
Children's Hospital. ``They are going into unknown territory
knowing there are clearly risks, some known and some unknown. But
they understand the potential justifies the means.''
</P>
<P>
   Keone's mother, Leslie Penn, puts it another way. ``I don't
really want to be the first. I'd feel much better if it'd been done
20 times before,'' she said, taking a break in the hallway outside
Keone's isolation room, which is equipped with a special
ventilation system. ``But if it works, he'll be cured of sickle
cell. Wouldn't that be wonderful?''
</P>
<P>
   Using bone marrow transplants to cure sickle cell disease is
relatively new. Emory University researchers in collaboration with
Grady Memorial Hospital are leading the nation in such procedures,
which take bone marrow from a healthy sibling and infuse it into a
brother or sister with severe sickle cell disorder. Emory has done
five such transplants in the past five years in patients ages 4 to
12; the most recent one was just two months ago, Yeager said. So
far, all are doing well, with four far enough along in recovery to
be considered cured.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager gives 50-50 odds that the world's first cord blood
transplant for sickle cell will work. Doctors should know in about
three weeks, by New Year's Day, whether it's ``taken hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Two unwanted outcomes: Keone's own unhealthy blood factory
growing back because the chemotherapy did not kill it; or the new
cells reacting against his tissues, such as the skin and liver,
Yeager said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the transplant doesn't take hold and
Keone's bone marrow remains depleted, leaving him at high risk for
infection. Should that happen, some of Keone's own bone marrow has
been saved and could be given back to him, but it would contain
sickle cells. The rest of Keone's bone marrow was killed during 10
days of chemotherapy at Egleston, a procedure that also impaired
his immune system. He runs the risk that an overwhelmingly
infection could turn fatal.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's that other 50 percent of the odds: success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to be conservative, I'd say there's a one in four
chance he'll be cured,'' said Yeager. ``But it's more like there's
a 50 percent chance he'll be cured. The first six to 12 months will
be critical. But two years out, we would definitely talk about a
cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Keone is a seventh-grader at Shiloh Middle School(Ga.), but he
started being home-schooled two months ago after missing so many
classes. Leslie Penn, 37, is a nuclear medicine technologist at
Gwinnett Medical Center(Ga.). Her employer's health insurance has
agreed to pay for the procedure, estimated to cost $200,000, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, bone marrow transplants match a patient with a
relative, usually a brother or sister. But none of Keone's
half-brothers and -sisters was a good match; neither was his mother
or father, David Hynes of North Carolina. Another possibility is
being matched with a volunteer donor enrolled in the National
Marrow Donor Program of the American Red Cross. However, it's hard
for blacks to find a match because only a small percentage of
African-Americans offer to be donors.
</P>
<P>
   The cord blood found for Keone is from the nonprofit New York
Blood Center Placental Blood Bank, and it matches five of the six
inherited traits of Keone's blood. An anonymous woman provided the
cord blood after the birth of her child. Placental and cord blood
are rich in stem cells, which eventually grow into different types
of blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow is the body's blood factory, supplying red and white
cells and platelets. Those cells carry oxygen to organs, fight
infection and help with clotting. People suffering from sickle cell
disease have crescent-shaped, sticky and hard red blood cells
instead of round, smooth red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Flowing through blood vessels, sickle cells get stuck, resulting
in excruciating pain throughout the body. These bouts of pain,
called ``crises,'' along with numerous infections, landed Keone in
the hospital seven times this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hurt so much, I wouldn't even want to blink,'' Keone
said.
</P>
<P>
   After his blood disorder led to a stroke at age 5, Keone started
monthly transfusions through the American Red Cross' Partners for
Life donor program. Keone has no physical reminders of the stroke,
but he does have learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, before becoming a medical case study, before
starting a regimen of drugs and discomfort, Keone chowed down on
Papa John's pizza and popcorn when two buddies and his 16-year-old
half-sister, Seterria, visited the hospital. But the past week has
turned into chills, fever, nausea, mouth sores and no interest in
food _ all side effects of his oral chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy decision to make,'' Leslie Penn admitted.
``Do you take a child who feels pretty good and make him sick? He's
gone through seven years of blood transfusions, but he's just not
responding to them as well anymore. They can't say how much longer
he'd live. He didn't want to die but he didn't want to live like he
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd rather go for the chance.''

SPORTS COLUMN: HERE'S HOW A CAPTAIN OPERATES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Sometimes captains lead by example, even if it
costs them two minutes in the penalty box. Last week, Trevor Linden
of the Islanders creamed Ulf Samuelsson of the Rangers because he
felt Ulf was doing ugly things, if you can imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was late in the game, and he took a cheap shot, so it
seemed like the right thing to do,'' Linden said later.
</P>
<P>
   This was no Ewingian ramble to the edge of a brawl, costing a
season-crippling suspension. This captain did the minor crime and
he did the minor time, which is why Linden wears the ``C'' on his
jersey, 3,000 miles away from the last town he wore the ``C.'' He
is that rare breed, an instant captain, having shifted to the
struggling Islanders last season after Mike Keenan and Mark Messier
forced him out of Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Linden is a former farm boy from Alberta, who used to wrestle
cattle to the ground for branding. (So what is an Ulf Samuelsson to
him?) In appearance, he seems like a teacher, tall and slim and
reserved, wearing glasses and reading books, particularly about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the assistant equipment manager, Eric Miklich, gave
him ``The Boys of Summer,'' Roger Kahn's loving look at the
Brooklyn Dodgers. The hockey captain felt a kinship with the
baseball captain, Pee Wee Reese, who once told a young Dodger, ``If
you're in a hurry to get out of the clubhouse, you're in a hurry to
get out of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Real captains say those things, rather than appear to be in a
hurry to get out of the clubhouse themselves. They are even allowed
to speak to the referee, not to win the last call but to set up a
fair shake on the next one. And when the team is slumping, some
captains call a team meeting, the way Linden did recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also got to organize our Halloween party,'' Linden said.
</P>
<P>
   Linden, 28, was recently elected president of the players
association _ captain of his peers, so to speak. Captains set a
tone. Don Mattingly exuded his love of baseball and his love of
Yankee stripes. Franco Baresi seemed a foot taller when he wore the
yellow arm band for AC Milan and the Italian national soccer team.
I call Willis Reed ``Cap'n,'' because that is who he is.
</P>
<P>
   A hockey captaincy, formalized by a serious ``C'' on the jersey,
is perhaps more wide ranging than in other sports. The Vancouver
captain was also known for giving real time to terminally ill
children, and was a favorite adopted son of that urbane Canadian
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to play there my whole career,'' Linden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago, Vancouver acquired Mark Messier, who felt
unwanted with the Rangers, although money had nothing to do with
it, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great, getting Mark,'' Linden said. ``He's a
great player, a leader. I thought the situation would help me.
Maybe I was just naive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Linden drove around Vancouver and saw Messier's jaw on
billboards, linked with the word ``Commitment,'' he began to get
the picture. The Canucks went to Japan to open the season, and
Japanese reporters kept asking if he was going to give up his
captaincy. He did, before the first game, and said it wasn't the
jet lag, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to happen before the first game, not after the
10th game,'' Linden said the other day. ``I didn't want a
controversy. It wouldn't change the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it would have worked out, except that Keenan, who has done
it to other people, openly maligned Linden, who recently said:
``The situation had deteriorated. It was evident there would be a
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Linden came to the Islanders, now operated by neophyte owners
who seem most enthusiastic about building just what Long Island
needs _ oh, goodie, another mall.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Linden arrived, there was a ceremony with the old
Islanders _ the Boys of Winter, if you will _ coming back to lend
some credibility to the new operation. Management arranged for
Denis Potvin to hand Linden the Islanders' ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, who runs the Islanders, said, ``There was no need
to dally.''
</P>
<P>
   Linden said: ``It was a delicate situation. I didn't expect it
with 25 games left in the season. I was leery of it, and I told
them so.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also leery of Long Island, but eventually he discovered
it is not all a blight of shopping centers. This summer he showed
his commitment by taking a one-year contract for less money than he
wanted. (``I bit the bullet,'' he said.) Linden felt he was needed
in camp. That is a captain.

SOME PHYSICIANS ARE DISTRESSED AT AETNA MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AETNA-PRUDENTIAL) 
(lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aetna and health-care providers have different views
about how the company's merger with Prudential Health Care will
affect patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't be worse,'' said Dr. David Kaufmann, a New York
internist, who accepts Prucare, Prudential's health-maintenance
organization, but dropped Aetna when the company bought U.S.
Healthcare. ``Aetna U.S. Healthcare is essentially a low-cost
provider that is highly controlling of the delivery of medical care
and pretty unresponsive to physician concerns,'' he said. ``We will
probably have to drop Prucare now.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna is largely viewed as one of the most stringent
managed-care companies, pushing hard for cost reductions, disputing
claims, questioning out-of-network services and insisting on
mountains of documentation.
</P>
<P>
   But Aetna said Thursday that doctors and patients had little to
fear. ``We will be looking at those areas where Prucare rates are
out of touch with the market,'' said Joyce Oberdorf, an Aetna
spokeswoman. ``But our chairman doesn't believe the future of
health care is squeezing pennies from providers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients may have more physicians to choose from, and doctors
who already accept Aetna may pick up some business, but both groups
may also find stringent reimbursement policies and tougher stands
on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aetna is going to be more rigid and disciplined,'' said Alex
Chernoff, managing partner of Chernoff Diamond &AMP; Co., a benefits
consulting firm in New York. ``Providers will be upset to the
extent that they will get paid less and to the extent that they
have more patients on Aetna requiring more of them in terms of
processing claims.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen calls to doctors' offices Thursday informing them of the
merger were met with deep sighs and exclamations of distress.
``U.S. Healthcare was felt to be pretty draconian and to have
become even worse with Aetna,'' said Dr. Charles Aswad, the
executive vice president of the Medical Society of the State of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers enrolled in Prucare may face some of the same issues
doctors fear. They may have enjoyed programs that offered services,
such as expensive fertility treatments, that Aetna packages will
not offer. What is more, they may not find their claims honored as
easily as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in Prucare,'' Chernoff said, ``chances are your
plan will not be as liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even consumers who have nothing to do with Aetna or Prucare may
find themselves affected simply because doctors may raise prices on
fee-for-service procedures to shift some of the pain from possible
lower reimbursements from Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Employers who offered Prucare, Chernoff said, may also be in for
sticker shock when it comes time to negotiate rates. ``Aetna
believes in controlling costs,'' he said. ``They are not reaching
to please everybody. They will walk away. That is not what
employers have seen in Pru. Pru would reach.''
</P>
<P>
   However, patients already enrolled in Aetna may find a few new
doctors added to their lists of choices. Prucare never developed a
deep network, and many doctors who dropped out of Aetna will rejoin
through the merger. ``Over time, as our networks combine, we
believe it will result in more choices for customers,'' Ms.
Oberdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, there are some experts who think that this merger will
ultimately benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that it will be better for everyone,'' said
Bradley Hamburger, vice president of Halland Companies LLC, an
insurance broker in Jericho, N.Y. ``Rather than 12 medium-sized
networks, in the not-too-distant future you'll have five very large
ones. The advantage in that is that there won't be a choice for
providers which network to be in. Everyone will be in every network
and the ones that serve the patients best will get the lion's share
of the business.''

 &HT;    ONCE BRANDED AS TERRORISTS BY AMERICA, NOW THEY HOST THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENT
 &HT;    EDS: Pls note time element. This story should run no later than
Sunday because Clinton's Monday visit with Palestinian leaders will
likely have taken place by the time our readers get their papers.
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, Dec. 13, but may be used prior to
that.

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank This unassuming man, a dentist, has a
controversial past that still makes it hard for him to visit the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United States is coming to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Palestinian legislator Azmi Shuaibi was on the
secret council that coordinated the Palestinians' (ital)Intifada
(endital) uprising. Israel and its ally, the United States, both
viewed him as an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has since made several trips to Washington for peace
talks, each one required special permission because, he says, he is
on a ``black list.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, President Clinton will go to Gaza City to be hosted
by Shuaibi and hundreds of leaders many of whom America once
consider terrorists of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have come a long way. Many of the Palestinian leaders
have converted from warriors to politicians as their people verge
on self-rule. American security forces that used to hunt
Palestinians now train Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some point of crossing between the demands of the two
people,'' Shuaibi explains. ``The United States cannot resolve this
region without solving the Palestinian problem, and you cannot
solve the Palestinian problem without good relations with the
PLO.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he points out, ``Palestinians understand that
the world has changed. We cannot rely on the Cold War. We must deal
with the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting in Gaza was the original purpose of Clinton's
three-day trip to the region. It will be the first visit by a U.S.
president to a Palestinian-controlled area. There, he is supposed
to witness the PLO leaders reaffirm that they no longer seek the
destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The event evolved from last October's Israeli-Palestinian peace
deal that Clinton mediated at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland.
The Wye agreement was an attempt to restart the faltering
5-year-old Oslo peace process. Under Oslo, Israel conducts phased
troop pullouts from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank in return
for a Palestinian cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Gaza meeting comes in. Though the PLO
maintains that it already, in 1996, revoked passages of its charter
that call for the destruction of Israel, the process was unclear
and unfinished. As part of the Wye agreement, Israel demanded
another meeting of the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Clinton was asked to attend to make sure the
event happens. There is great uncertainty over just who will show
up to see him on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those eligible include Palestinian legislators known to be
affiliated with Hamas, a group that opposes the peace process and
sponsors terror attacks in Israel. They, however, are expected to
boycott the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Mohammed Abbas, who attended the 1996 meeting.
Intelligence services consider him the organizer of the Achille
Lauro cruise ship hijacking in 1985, in which an elderly American
was executed. Abbas lives in Gaza now, but is said to be out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
PLO faction led by Arafat rival and guerrilla-in-exile George
Habash might show up.
</P>
<P>
   Several Palestinian groups are urging a boycott of the meeting.
They say that Israel should not dictate to them how to form their
goals and that they have already revised their charter.
</P>
<P>
   But even moderate Palestinian politicians, like Shuaibi, have
had what the U.S. and Israeli officials have considered outlaw
pasts. They were fighters against Israel in Lebanon or served
repeated terms in Israeli jails. Some were on the run with their
military leader, Yasser Arafat, now president of the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   While many Israelis disagree with the procedures laid out for
the meeting, they do not seem to mind that Clinton is meeting the
group itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is as much a terrorist as any of them,'' says right
wing Israeli parliament member Reuven Rivlin. ``It's not who you
are talking to, but what you are doing (that matters).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Andrew Young lost his job as U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations because he met with PLO representatives in New York.
But, Israeli political scientist Efraim Inbar notes that when
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook Arafat's hand during a
1993 White House ceremony sealing the Oslo accords, it made it
acceptable for Americans to meet openly with the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Israelis, he said, who gave Arafat his ``kosher
certificate.''

PINOCHET INDICTED IN SPAIN FOR GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Chile)  (mk) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ A Spanish judge indicted Gen. Augusto Pinochet
Thursday ``for the crimes of genocide, terrorism and torture''
during his 17-year dictatorship in Chile, a key step toward his
trial in Madrid if he is eventually extradited from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The 285-page indictment lays out the most detailed case to date
against Pinochet, 83, who has been under arrest in London since
Oct. 16. It will be sent to support a Spanish extradition request,
which Britain's home secretary ruled on Wednesday could go forward
in English courts. Extradition proceedings could last for months.
</P>
<P>
   After Pinochet's 1973 coup, the indictment charges, he created
and led a ``criminal organization'' supported by Chile and five
other South American countries to kill or cause the disappearance
of about 3,000 opponents of his right-wing regime.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Baltasar Garzon, who drew up the indictment, also issued
the arrest warrant for Pinochet in October and later decreed a
worldwide embargo on his assets, which the indictment reiterated.
It declared that Pinochet is ``provisionally'' liable for
undetermined civil damages stemming from the human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has so far asked investigators to search for
Pinochet's assets only in the United States, Switzerland and
Luxembourg, and the search has only just begun, a Madrid court
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of genocide is included in the indictment, even
though Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled that genocide was not an
extraditable crime in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The final charges will depend on the extradition conditions set
by the English courts and the Spanish court's interpretation of
them, said Manuel Murillo, a Madrid lawyer for families of the
victims of repression in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon's indictment detailed a ``fierce repression'' that it
said began with Pinochet's coup on Sept. 11, 1973, which ousted
President Salvador Allende Gossens, and continued until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After consolidating control in Chile, the indictment says,
Pinochet arranged for coordinated repression against Chileans and
citizens of other countries with the help of military leaders in
Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   It named more than 2,500 victims, including Orlando Letelier,
the former Chilean foreign minister, and an American, Ronni
Moffitt, who died when a bomb exploded in their car in Washington
in 1976. The indictment says the bombing was carried out by Chile's
secret police on orders from Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, meanwhile, Pinochet's lawyers asked the House of
Lords Thursday to reconsider its judgment last month that Pinochet
does not enjoy sovereign immunity from arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the five Law Lords, who make up England's
highest court, said no one had ever tried to appeal one of the
court's decisions. The petition will be discussed by a committee of
the Law Lords, who will decide whether to have a full appeal
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's petition was believed to center on a charge of
potential bias against Lord Hoffmann, who cast the decisive vote in
the 3-2 decision and who, it has emerged, has been an unpaid
director of a charity for Amnesty International since 1990. A
lawyer for Amnesty and other rights groups was permitted to take
part in the presentation of the case against Pinochet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he presides over the Judiciary Committee's
Democrats, speaking in a deliberative cadence, Rep. John Conyers
Jr., the ranking minority member, projects a quiet tone and almost
disinterested demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Democrat, the only Watergate veteran on the
committee, has shouldered the task of leading the committee's
Democrats, a normally fractious group credited with never letting a
view go unexpressed. And Conyers' loose hand has meant that he
seldom reels in committee members when their monologues take them
in peculiar directions.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains an important back-room dealer for the Democrats
on the Judiciary Committee. It was Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
who took control of the Democratic response last summer and who has
remained in charge of keeping his caucus together.
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings, however, Conyers takes the lead in
suggesting strategies for minority members on the committee and his
views often, although not always, carry the day, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers' early strategy was to shift the focus from Clinton to
Starr when ever possible. Even before the Judiciary Committee's
inquiry began, Conyers took up the well-known list of charges that
the prosecutor's inquiry was tainted by leaks and ties to
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the committee Thursday evening, Conyers
offered a plea to moderate Republicans to vote against impeachment
and again criticized Starr for delving into sexual details, calling
him the ``occasionally obsessive counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers has argued that Starr abused his powers and launched
investigations into matters best left alone. He has gone so far as
to argue that Starr's decision to probe Clinton's extramarital
affair was worse than Clinton's decision to initiate it.
</P>
<P>
   The day Starr appeared before the Judiciary Committee, Conyers
was attacking Starr before the prosecutor had a chance to open his
mouth. Conyers condemned the referral as ``tawdry, salacious and
unnecessarily graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all that we had in the beginning, it was only Starr,''
Conyers said Thursday. ``And his excesses were pretty apparent to
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Detroit lawyer, whose district includes
impoverished parts of the city and well-to-do Grosse Pointe, made
it plain that he is not finished with Starr. He plans to turn the
committee's attention again to the independent counsel during next
year's discussion on renewing the statute that created the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The methods Starr employed will be studied with great detail
long after the impeachment process itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only member of the Judiciary Committee to weigh the articles
of impeachment against President Richard Nixon and Clinton,
Conyers' service on the Watergate committee has at times appeared
as much a liability as an asset.
</P>
<P>
   His scathing comments against Nixon have come back if not to
haunt him, at least to make off-the-cuff defenses of Clinton more
difficult. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the Judiciary Committee
chairman, invoked Conyers' Watergate-era words several times,
including during a debate over whether to limit Charles Ruff's role
in the committee inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the charges of hypocrisy, Conyers firmly believes his
experience with Watergate has been an asset. And, Conyers has not
so gently reminded his Republican colleagues: ``Watergate was not
about an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with some of the most partisan Republicans in Congress on
the Judiciary Committee, Conyers' assigned task has never been seen
as easy or perhaps even possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I failed?'' Conyers said, his voice tinged ever so
slightly with sarcasm directed toward his Republican colleagues.
``Yeah, I failed to persuade any of the 21 Republicans to consider
more reasonably the fact that even if the whole narrative of Ken
Starr's was assumed to be accurate, there would be nothing that
would reach an impeachable offense.''

   BOSTON _ As he pulled up to a parking meter outside Fenway Park
Thursday, Dennis Eckersley fumbled around for change like any other
fan attending an event at the 600 Club.
</P>
<P>
   For him, admission to the exclusive club was still free because
for one last time, he was the chief attraction. But soon he became
a civilian. At an 11 a..m. press conference, Eckersley announced
what had been expected after the Red Sox declined to offer him
arbitration: After 24 years, the party's over.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the long drive from his home in Sudbury that it
began to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that kept coming to me on the way to the ballpark
was how much I loved baseball and how much I'm going to miss it,''
he said as he made his retirement official. ``A big part of my life
is behind me. I'm looking to the next part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say goodbye. You almost need some help. I
finished good, and that's a nice memory. But I'm looking at the
whole picture now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite ready to be reflective. Right now I'm just going
to concentrate on the good stuff. The stories are quite frankly
getting out of hand. How I punched out so many people; how I was
the baddest dude in the league. What I had was a run, a good run. I
had some magic that keep me around for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic, of course, was in Eckersley's arm _ and heart and
guts. That's why he's a shoo-in for the Hall Of Fame. For almost a
quarter-century, in Cleveland, Boston, Chicago (Cubs), Oakland, St.
Louis, and, finally, Boston again, he transformed himself from a
premier starting pitcher into one of the most devastating relievers
in baseball history, coping with alcoholism as he came back from
the depths. A 20-game winner for the 1978 Red Sox, Eckersley went
on to register the third-highest save total ever _ 390, trailing
only Lee Smith (478) and John Franco (397). He won the 1992 Cy
Young and American League Most Valuable Player Awards for his epic
1992 season with Oakland, when he posted 51 saves in 54 chances.
And he made the most pitching appearances in baseball history _
1,071. Along with his career 197-171 won-lost recordf (48-41 as a
reliever), all that gives him a guaranteed membership card in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   But on his second tour of duty with the Red Sox, Eckersley
became the setup man for Tom Gordon last season. He wound up with a
4-1 record, 1 save, and a 4.76 ERA. Now 44, he said he'd like to
return for one more year, but only with the Red Sox. When general
manager Dan Duquette told him this week that the Sox wanted
longer-term options in their bullpen, Eckersley mulled his options
before deciding that this was it. Now he'll be free to spend more
time with his family _ wife Nancy, and children Mandee (22, from
his first marriage), Jake (8), and Alexandia (2) _ and to savor his
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Eckersley never bothered with numbers. He dwelled on
winning. And perhaps that's what he'll miss most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just starting to get the feel of what it's like when you
quit,'' he said. ``Initially, it was like, `Wow!' But now I realize
the pressure is off. I woke up one morning and had just started
gearing back. All of a sudden, I didn't feel like running. I
started thinking about my family. I realize that once you retire,
that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Eckersley has been waiting to hear those words for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to a summer trip to the Cape,'' she said.
``We're never had one. Once he gets over the initial feeling that
it's over, things will be fine. We're becoming a tight family. And
he knows he can do things without the interruption of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Living with the Eck has been no picnic, she added. Her husband
had a drinking problem in the '80s and lived life on the edge much
too much. She's seen him rise and fall and then rise again. That's
the best part.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won that MVP Award, that did it for me,'' said Nancy.
``It really sticks. It came after he had really achieved a lot.
He'd been through starting and had done so-so. He went to the
bullpen and did well but got hurt. Then he came back as a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley said he'd been around too long to pinpoint the
highlights of his career with the Red Sox _ 1978-84 and last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first arrived,'' said Eckersley, ``it was like a
coming-out party for me. I had played in Cleveland. But I had no
idea of what the big leagues was. This place was an awakening, and
I'll remember those times (1978, when the Sox lost the AMerican
League East title to the Yankees in a one-game playoff). It was a
great team, one of the best I ever played for. I'll always remember
the 1978 team.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of his return?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're lucky to be in the big leagues, much less play where
you live,'' he said. ``I was lucky to finish up here. To come out
of it now is like being rescued. I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in his second incarnation that Eckersley earned his most
enduring fame. Rescued from the scrap heap in Oakland, he pioneered
the role of the one-inning closer. He also perfected it, as
evidenced by the A's three straight World Series appearances
(1988-90) and one world championship (1989).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really take credit for it,'' said Eckersley. ``Tony La
Russa did it with me, and it changed the game. A short man 1 1/3
inning, mamixum. That is what relief pitching is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was smart. You lasted longer. You were ready to pitch (more
often) and you were more effective. Problem is, no one can keep it
up all the time. I did it in 1992, but that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As parting gifts, Eckersley received a Red Sox uniform and the
apparent promise of a spot in the organization, if he is
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank Dennis for coming home to the Red Sox and
being a part of the family for this past year,'' said general
manager Dan Duquette. ``I know he has a great future ahead of him,
whatever he decides to do. He's a real professional.''

NINTH `STAR TREK' VOYAGE BUMPY FOR CASUAL FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``Captain, Captain, the hypothermal vents in the
positronic metaphasics are threatening the flux levels of the
tachyon harmonics, and the substrata may go
supercalifragilisticexpialadosis!''
</P>
<P>
   Dialogue like that would be music to my ears if I were a Trekker
and had the slightest idea what they were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Trek'' movie series has always flown along that thin
warp line between working in enough in jokes and technically starry
references to keep the loyal fans happy and making the story simple
and exciting enough for non-fans to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' plunges across that line with a
Trekker-pleasing, jargon-intensive story that should satisfy the
cult but leave outsiders wondering: Are they actually speaking
English?
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' also challenges the tough odds of
being an odd-numbered movie in the series (No. 9). ``Trek''
insiders promote the theory that the even numbers are the good ones
</P>
<P>
   and the odd numbers the bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   To disarm that attitude, director Jonathan Frakes (who also
plays Commander Riker) overloads the movie with Trekker trivia.
Along the way, he sacrifices the story.
</P>
<P>
   That tale concerns a planet that's a demi-paradise, whose Ba'ku
inhabitants live in a technology-rejecting society.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federation and Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham) of the Son'a
are plotting to take over that planet.
</P>
<P>
   When Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew intervene,
they are ordered to leave the Ba'ku planet and must decide which to
violate: their orders or a Prime Directive.
</P>
<P>
   That story is just barely substantial enough for a thoughtful
science-fiction movie. The ideas and analogies to our world are
there, as they always are in ``Star Trek'' stories, but they're not
presented in particularly dynamic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the movie its grace is how well Picard's crew works
together, with Worf (Michael Dorn) and Data (Brent Spiner)
providing just enough humor, and Picard enough character
dimensions, to humanize the technologically enwebbed proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' needs those amusing touches because
of the sluggish pace and the tinny special effects.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not already a ``Star Trek'' fan, this isn't the best
one to start with. You'll be able to follow the story even if
you're not ``Trek'' conversant, but it's a bumpy ride.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan, you're probably reading this standing in line
at the theater. You won't be sorry you went, but then, are you
ever? Even the bad ``Star Treks'' satisfy the Trekker urge.
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG, ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' has a few moments when the
violence approaches semi-gruesome. 2 stars. &QL;

TRINITY INVESTMENT WON'T CONFIRM OPPENHEIMER RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Trinity Investment Management Corp. has intensified
talks with suitors, but it declined to comment on persistent rumors
it would be acquired by New York-based OppenheimerFunds Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's seven executive owners, who are spread out across
Boston, Denver, and the firm's headquarters in Bellefonte, Pa.,
told clients in late 1997 that they were seeking a new corporate
owner. Trinity chairman and chief executive Stanford Calderwood,
78, who owns more than half of the firm, wants Trinity sold before
he retires.
</P>
<P>
   Citing conversations with Wall Street bankers, a mutual fund
source in Boston named OppenheimerFunds, a fund company with $97
billion in assets under management, as Trinity's likely future
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that over the last several months, we have been
in serious talks with several entities,'' said Trinity spokesman
Richard Tucker Thursday in Boston , where the firm's marketing
operations are located. The firm retained New York investment bank
Goldman, Sachs in March to look at strategic options, Tucker said,
but no sale deal had yet been signed.
</P>
<P>
   OppenheimerFunds is owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of Springfield. MassMutual spokesman James Lacey said it was
against company policy to comment on any deals under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is home to a host of privately held investment firms that
are likely to be sold off as their owners near retirement. Such
sales are more than estate planning _ they are also part of a trend
of consolidation in the investment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity uses computerized, quantitative models to manage $8
billion for over 100 institutional clients, mainly state and
corporate pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   By selling to Oppenheimer, rather than to an investment holding
company, Trinity's owners may win a quick sale amid calmer markets
but greater tax burdens, too. For its part, Oppenheimer would gain
in Trinity coveted access to pension plan clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could probably go straight out and sell the business,''
Tucker said. ``But we want the right strategic combination.''

ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, A SPECIAL-EFFECTS TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON RENFROE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - One of the more dramatic events of the Old Testament
required dramatic cinematic interpretations: the parting of the Red
Sea and the walk across by the children of Israel. This is how two
films tackled it: &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Ten Commandments'' (1956) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many would say the Red Sea parting was the most memorable scene
in Cecil B. DeMille's epic. For years, viewers would wonder, ``How
did they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, DeMille makes it sound simple: Over the
course of 18 months and by spending $1 million (big bucks in those
days), shots ``from the Red Sea itself and in the studio were
combined.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more light is shed in Charles Higham's 1973 biography
of DeMille. He says the Red Sea shots were ``matched to the pouring
of tanks into a vast adjoining set, then the shots reversed as the
water rushed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a viewing of the scene today is a lot less mystifying
than it used to be. But on the 1956 big screen, shot in
VistaVision, it must have really wowed 'em. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Prince of Egypt'' (1998)
</P>
<P>
   You'd think, heck, in a cartoon they just draw the darned thing.
Maybe in years past, but this is the age of digital animation, and
nothing's as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks required 10 digital artists, two programmers and 16
traditional animators to create the one scene. The studio claims it
took 318,000 hours of rendering time to create the 7-minute
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   New computer tools were developed to blend two- and
three-dimensional artwork. In the end, the parting of the Red Sea
combined traditional animation, traditional painting techniques and
3-D computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   One other detail: This ``parting'' will have more of a circular
pattern than a split. &QL;

ELECTION COMMISSION VOTES AGAINST REPAYMENTS FOR CLINTON AND DOLE
ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a 6-0 vote, the Federal Election Commission
rebuffed its own professional staff Thursday and refused to order
multi-million-dollar repayments from the 1996 presidential
campaigns of President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The decision nullified the recommendation of the commission's
auditors and general counsel that the campaigns repay nearly $25
million for exceeding federal campaign spending limits and
illegally coordinating their advertising with the two political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's vote, which came on the heels of Attorney
General Janet Reno's decision earlier this week not to ask for an
independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's involvement
in an advertising blitz paid for by the Democratic Party, all but
obliterates the spending and contribution limits that have been a
cornerstone of the post-Watergate election laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also almost surely means that the proliferation of issue
advertising, will intensify in the 2000 presidential campaign. The
issue ads, which benefits presidential and other federal
candidates, are paid for by the national parties with money raised
outside the federal election laws, which put a $1,000 limit on
individual campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal that inaction by the commission sends is that there
is no limit to the type of presidential campaigning you can
encourage others to do and avoid the limits,'' said Kent Cooper, a
former FEC official. ``It basically removes the limits that the
presidential public financing system had imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the six commissioners was not unexpected. Although
the FEC itself was a creation of the post-Watergate election-law
reforms, the agency has a history of timidity. Evenly divided along
partisan lines, the six commissioners often reflect the views of
their political parties in 3-3 ties. But the decision Thursday not
to seek the multi-million-dollar repayments from the Clinton and
Dole campaigns could reflect the parties' views unanimously,
because Democrats and Republicans alike view unfettered spending as
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout several days of public hearings on the 1996 audit,
the commissioners expressed grave doubts about the auditors'
conclusions. Karl Sandstrom, a recent Democratic appointee, was the
most vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process has been unfair to the responding
committees,'' Sandstrom said. He also said, ``I don't adopt the
recommendations, I don't adopt the findings and I don't adopt the
legal analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ann Elliott, a Republican commissioner since 1982, said she
thought it was legal for the parties to coordinate some activities
with the presidential candidates. She also said that as long as
party issue ads did not expressly contain an electioneering message
for a candidate they were proper. ``There is an exhortation to vote
for a specific candidate in an election _ that should be our
standard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC did not decide one important issue related to the audit:
whether the party ads should be considered as in-kind contributions
to the Clinton and Dole campaigns. It is likely they will refer
this issue for further investigation by the Commission's
enforcement division, but it is unlikely the FEC would approve
further action on issue advertising after rejecting the repayments,
several agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending repayments of $7 million from the Clinton
campaign and $17.7 million from the Dole campaign, the auditors and
the agency's chief counsel had agreed that the money paid for party
ads represented an illegal end-run around the spending limits for
presidential candidates who receive federal matching funds. But on
Wednesday, the commissioners agreed to dramatically reduce the
repayment for the Dole campaign, presaging the Thursday decision to
require no repayments for the issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's decision was hailed by lawyers for both campaigns.
``I'm pleased with the commission's decision on the issue ads,''
said Kenneth Gross, counsel to the Dole campaign. ``It's the
correct position in our view.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Utrecht, a lawyer for the Clinton-Gore campaign, said, ``As
we've said on numerous occasions, we feel it's clear the issue
advertising run by the Democratic National Committee was fully in
compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding not to seek an independent counsel, Reno emphasized
the fact that President Clinton had relied on the advice of
campaign and party lawyers that the issue ads were legal.
</P>

   The rise of issue advertising is a byproduct of the growth of
soft money, the controversial large donations from wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions that are raised by the
political parties in unlimited amounts. Soft money has played an
increasingly important role in presidential elections since 1988.

 WASHINGTON: since 1988. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton's re-election campaign came up with
an innovative plan to finance early advertising with Democratic
party soft money. The ads were created by the president's campaign
consultants and featured Clinton prominently. As long as the ads
did not contain an express exhortation to vote for a candidate,
Democratic lawyers said, they could be paid for by the committee,
in large part with soft money. The Clinton-Gore campaign and the
Dole campaign were limited to spending about $30 million each in
the primaries. The DNC, with no spending ceiling, paid for $46
million in issue ads. The Republican party bought similar ads, but
began them later in the election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to order the repayments from the Clinton and Dole
campaigns, the FEC effectively blessed the legality of this
arrangement. Because the party ads were in some instances identical
to ads run by the Clinton and Dole campaigns, the FEC auditors and
general counsel viewed the issue ads as crossing the line into
impermissible electioneering. The commissioners disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will send a message for 2000,'' said former FEC Chairman
Trevor Potter. ``It validates the Clinton tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some potential presidential candidates for 2000 are
raising soft money through political action committees established
at the state level and through non-profit organizations. Some
contenders, including billionaire Steve Forbes, a Republican, have
broadcast issue ads in early primary states like New Hampshire.
Some campaign finance watchdog groups fear that in 2000 it will be
the candidates, as well as the two political parties, who
creatively circumvent the federal campaign spending and
contribution limits with issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Issue ads are not confined to presidential elections. In the
1998 congressional elections, the National Republican Congressional
Committee financed $30 million is such ads, some of which raised
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. More of these ads are likely in
congressional races in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC's decision means we've returned to the law of the
jungle when it comes to campaign spending,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
an advocate of overhauling campaign finance practices who has
unsuccessfully urged the FEC and the Justice Department to limit
party issue advertising. ``There are really no limits left.''

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR HAS SMALLER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ National Semiconductor Corp. reported a
smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss Thursday excluding
one-time items, but sales were still down and executives remained
cautious about the company's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Nov. 29, National Semiconductor reported a
deficit of $94.4 million, compared with earnings of $28.9 million,
or 17 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales fell
29 percent, to $510.1 million from $719.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter included previously announced one-time charges
related to plant closings and the termination of a foundry
agreement with IBM. Without the charges, the net loss for the
quarter would have been $48.6 million. Analysts expected the
company to lose 49 cents a share, according to First Call Corp.,
which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of National Semiconductor fell $2, to $14.625.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a difficult year for National Semiconductor, with
many of its factories running well below capacity. The company's
microprocessor business suffered from a glut in personal computers
earlier in the year, while its analog products were hurt by the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The company also lost market share in the key networking segment
because it was slow to introduce new products. But National gained
ground in the fast-growing market for computers that cost less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite pleased with the progress we made in the second
quarter,'' Brian Halla, National Semiconductor's chairman,
president and chief executive, said in a telephone conference call
with securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution of our manufacturing and Cyrix groups, working
together, exceeded our expectations and brought us along much
quicker on our road to profit recovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   National acquired Cyrix in November 1997 in a bid to move into
the more profitable realm of microprocessor chips.

`TREK' CLOUT SPANS GLOBE, AUTHOR FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - With the holidays closing in, I'll use the release of
``Star Trek: Insurrection'' to suggest a fine gift for anyone
interested in the ``Trek'' saga(s), science fiction, television,
our culture in general.
</P>
<P>
   It's a book called ``Future Perfect: How Star Trek Conquered
Planet Earth,'' by Jeff Greenwald. Released over the summer by
Viking Press, it's the best writing about television I've read in a
month of parsecs, although I wouldn't know if a parsec is
measurement of time or distance, neither or both.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I'm not nuts about space opera. But Greenwald, author
of several cool travel books as well as articles and columns in
such cutting-edge publications as ``Wired,'' ``Details'' and
``Salon,'' made me care about a topic that normally drives me to
dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald spanned the globe to chase down the meaning of ``Star
Trek,'' a grand global myth now powering through its fourth decade.
En route, he interviewed fans in Germany, Japan and Ind ia _ not to
mention Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, Leonard Nimoy, Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr., Arthur C. Clarke, and none other than the Dalai
Lama.
</P>
<P>
   I started reading ``Future Perfect'' somewhere in the middle.
(It's a terrible habit called `'surfing for the good bits.'' Any
idea where I might've picked that up?) But Greenwald's writing is
so supple, and his wit so wicked, I quickly found myself sucked in.
This almost never happens when I book-surf, but I eventually turned
back to the beginning and read the whole thing, in just a couple of
sittings, front-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   While making his way to an audience with the Dalai Lama _ with
whom he also discussed such ``Tre''k-tangential topics as the
Internet, human cloning and artificial intelligence _ Greenwald
witnessed a Klingon wedding in Germany, visited a space-themed
nightclub called NASA in Bangalore, India, and hung with an
intrepid British rocketeer pursuing his own personal space program.
</P>
<P>
   While there's enough inside-the-soundstage interviews with
``Trek'' actors, writer and producers to satisfy any hard-core fan,
the most interesting chapters deal with far-flung rerun-watchers,
whom Greenwald discovered to be ``educated, active and insightful
people, and not at all the kinds of people who need to get a
life,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his Oakland
home. ``They're people who have lives, and ``Star Trek'' is a big
part of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, Gene Roddenberry, a former airline pilot
and motorcycle cop, sold the original ``Star Trek '' series to NBC
as kind of an interstellar ``Bonanza.'' It might've begun as mere
(and marginally successful) TV product, but the impact that
frequently cheesy little series and its sequels have had on the
world is significant and measurable, Greenwald says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of millions of dollars are now spent by people in
technology, in industries like computers and aerospace, who are
trying to build what they saw on ``Star Trek,'' said Greenwald.
``It's life imitating art.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``There's an amazing feedback loop going on here
that's unique in human history,'' he said. ``The people creating
the mythology _ the writers and actors and producers of ``Star
Trek'' _ get real-time feedback from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if _ in the ancient days of Greek and Roman
myths, of African myths, Hindu myths _ people writing the myths
ever even know who their audience would be, or how it would affect
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting creative synergy has created an ongoing phenomenon
that deserves just this kind of detailed examination. Greenwald
writes with humility and great humor, and has a veteran travel
writer's gift for transporting readers to strange places _ other
worlds, even _ and showing them around.
</P>
<P>
   (For example, visit the online version of this story _ at
www.azcentral.com _ for a link to a wonderful piece Greenwald wrote
for ``Salon'' about his recent cameo on the NBC sitcom
``NewsRadio'').
</P>
<P>
   Odd, but Greenwald claims to be no more than a casual fan of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that's important about ``Star Trek''
is that, when you look at a bunch of murals on the walls of ruins
in Pompeii, you don't have to like the paintings to appreciate how
they are as a record of their society,'' he said. ``That's true of
``Star rek'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're not a big fan of the show, you have to
appreciate the story cycle, and how it is a reflection of our
society and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're into ``Star Trek'' _ or have a friend or loved one who
is who you'd like to understand better _ treat yourself to ``Future
Perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it'd make an ideal stocking-stuffer for the Vulcan
who has everything.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both sides in the impeachment inquiry put President
Clinton on the witness stand on Thursday, showing snippets of video
from his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit to present him
alternately as: a) unfairly ganged up on by a bunch of lawyers, and
b) quite a talented liar.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up their case, the Republicans wanted to use the
tape, which had not been seen before, to embarrass the president.
In the end, Democrats pre-empted them by showing it first. They
used the tape to suggest that Clinton could not reasonably have
been expected to grasp a legal definition of sex when a roomful of
smart lawyers and an Arkansas judge could not agree on it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the tape selected by the Democratic counsel, Abbe
Lowell, shows Clinton watching his lawyer, Robert Bennett, dispute
the broad definition of sex offered by Mrs. Jones' attorneys for
the purpose of deposing the president in connection with Mrs.
Jones' sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposed definition, Bennett said, ``If the president
patted me and said I need to lose 10 pounds off my bottom, you
could argue that I had sexual relations with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge Susan Webber Wright said that she herself
found the definition a bit too complicated and agreed to narrow it
somewhat. ``It's going to make it difficult for me to rule, if you
want to know the truth, and I'm not sure Mr. Clinton knows all
these definitions anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the same bit of tape, Clinton seemed to undercut the
point the White House counsel was trying to make in showing it.
When one of Ms. Jones' lawyers asked him _ twice _ whether he
understood the meaning of the words, he pored over the definition
and nodded in assent, then said, ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   After the lights in the hearing room went back up, White House
counsel told the House Judiciary Committee that the tape showed the
president ``being set up by the Paula Jones attorneys and Linda
Tripp,'' and that his reactions were those of a cornered man
instinctively trying to protect himself from a sucker punch.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton gave the deposition on Jan. 17, he knew that Monica
Lewinsky had been subpoenaed by Ms. Jones' lawyers. But he was
clearly surprised by the detail of the questions by lawyers, who
knew even that he had given her a hat pin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of the afternoon, Republican counsel David
Schippers used the same video to quite different ends,
interspersing his closing argument with video bits intended to
catch Clinton in what he characterized as outright lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like you to look up at the screens to see his lies for
yourself,'' Schippers said. ``Watch!''
</P>
<P>
   In the first cut, Clinton answered a question about whether he
was ever alone in his office with Ms. Lewinsky. ``I don't recall,''
he said, ``but it seems to me she brought things to me once or
twice on the weekends,'' staying in the office only long enough to
drop off some papers and exchange pleasantries. ``When Congress is
there we're working all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Were he and Ms. Lewinsky at any time alone in the hallway off
the Oval Office? ``I don't believe so, unless we were walking back
with the pizza,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in any room in the White House? Again, with annoyance, he
repeated that Ms. Lewinsky may have, in working overtime in the
legislative affairs office, dropped by to deliver some documents.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers seemed to take particular pleasure in showing a video
clip of Clinton saying he did not necessarily remember exchanging
gifts with Ms. Lewinsky. The Jan. 17 deposition took place less
than three weeks after he had given Ms. Lewinsky a number of
Christmas and going away gifts, including ``a bear, symbolizing
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall,'' he said, smirking. ``Do you know what they
were?''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if he remembered her giving him any gifts _ she
gave him at least 40, Schippers said, in a ritual they went through
at virtually every meeting _ Clinton scratched his head and said,
``Once or twice I think she's given me a book or two.''
</P>
<P>
   At another moment in the deposition, Clinton is shown watching
his lawyer, Bennett, make the case that he was well aware of Ms.
Lewinsky's affidavit claiming that she had no sexual relationship
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said that he allowed Bennett to make this
comment without knowing that it was less than completely truthful
because he had not been paying much attention to his lawyer. ``The
whole argument just passed me by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers ballyhooed this piece of the tape, saying, ``Take a
look at this tape and you will see what the president of the United
States doesn't want the people ever to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And as promised, Clinton is shown riveted to his lawyer,
appearing very much absorbed in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As Bennett read Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, the president nodded
in agreement with several points, and then affirmed, ``That's
absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you have an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, he was
asked. ``No, he said.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she said otherwise, the lawyer asked, would that be a
lie?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hesitated. Then he said, ``It's certainly not the
truth.''

THIRD WRITER IN A MONTH IS MISSING IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Another Iranian dissident writer was reported
missing Thursday, the third in the last month, adding to concerns
that critics of the government are becoming the targets of violence
and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   The two writers who had previously disappeared were both found
dead in mysterious circumstances, and associates of the latest
missing man, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, said they believed he had
been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Pouyandeh, a 45-year-old author and translator, disappeared
after he left his Tehran office on Wednesday afternoon, just hours
after the body of Mohammad Mokhtari, a dissident and poet who was
reported missing last week, was identified.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian newspapers reported Thursday that Mokhtari had died of
suffocation, and one of them quoted a relative saying his body bore
bruises around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearances come at a time of heightened tensions between
President Mohammad Khatami, who has been promoting reforms, and
conservative forces in the Islamic government who have been the
main target of the secular opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Pouyandeh and Mokhtari were among six prominent writers who were
questioned about their activities in October by a Revolutionary
Court. The six were trying to reactivate a banned writers'
association that had previously been the target of government
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of that small group, Houshang Golshiri, said in a
telephone interview Thursday night: ``We feel that this is being
done by those who have information. They have our address, and they
know where and when we leave the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri said the incidents struck him as an unsettling echo of
what occurred in 1994, after he and more than 130 members of the
writers' association signed a letter that called for an end to
censorship in Iran. Five of those who signed that letter were
killed or died soon afterward in circumstances that have never been
fully explained.
</P>
<P>
   The next summer, 30 members of the group who were traveling by
bus to a poetry conference in Armenia narrowly escaped death in
what one of them, Mansour Koushan, described in a recent interview
as an assassination attempt by the Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Golshiri would not say Thursday night whom he believed
responsible for the death of Mokhtari and the disappearance of
Pouyandeh. But he said, ``I believe this is the continuation of the
story of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Pouyandeh disappeared somewhere between his Tehran office and
his home, which are just two miles apart. A relative said the
family had contacted police, hospitals and the city morgue, but had
found no trace of the missing man.

   BC-TEXAS-EXECUTE-NYT (moved on Monday, Dec. 7)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Dec. 7,
about Joseph Stanley Faulder, a Canadian who is on death row in
Texas and whose case has drawn attention from the Canadian
Government and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, misstated
the outcome of a case against Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, an American
boxer who spent 19 years in prison and is supporting Mr. Faulder's

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Western diplomats and dissident Yugoslav
officials say the forces of President Slobodan Milosevic appear to
be turning to politically motivated arrests to counter the rapidly
spreading influence of rebels in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the assassination last week of a guerrilla commander,
which was initially thought to be a result of a feud within rebel
ranks, is now described by diplomats and Yugoslav officials as the
first in what they predict will be a series of back-and-forth
retaliatory attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Under threats from NATO, Yugoslavia has all but stopped
conventional attacks on the ethnic Albanian rebels who now operate
freely in widening areas of the Serbian province. But by resorting
to traditional methods of repression, the government can strike at
the rebels and avoid a NATO reaction, Yugoslav officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will trigger a response,'' a Western diplomat said. ``My
expectation is the Albanians will do something like set off a bomb
in a Serb market or assassinate a Serb official. If that happens,
then the lid is off the next phase of the war, and there will be no
stopping it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav security official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity added: ``The war will move to the cities, and it will be
very bloody. This is a dangerous move for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Yugoslav government has stepped up one of the most
effective measures of a police state: mass arrests and trials where
the absence of elementary legal protections nearly insures
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, as many as 2,000 ethnic Albanians have
been detained or are being sought for allegedly helping the rebels,
according to United Nations estimates. As Kosovo's Albanians say
has often been the case since Milosevic stripped away their broad
autonomy in 1989 and began imposing tight police control on the
province, suspects are routinely tortured into signing confessions,
which almost guarantee that they will be convicted, international
human rights officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors say those detained are so terrified they
do not reveal that they have been tortured.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But not always.
</P>
<P>
   Under two bare light bulbs dangling from a stained ceiling,
police guards brought Ismet Gashi, a 36-year-old farmer, to stand
before a three-judge panel last Friday in the Western city of Pec.
He stood in an attitude of submission, shoulders down, his eyes
fixed on the dirty orange carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   When they removed the handcuffs, he kept his wrists jammed
together, silently assuring his guards that he was still under
their control.
</P>
<P>
   A judge read his signed confession. He had admitted joining the
rebels and being with them in three villages. In essence, the
confession was the same as hundreds of others in which defendants
say they fought for the rebels or fed them or in some way were a
party to what the government calls terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But when the chief judge asked Gashi to affirm his confession,
the defendant did something that made the police officers present
begin to fidget. For one of them, his right leg began twitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me and made me sign that,'' Gashi said, mumbling at
first. As he continued, his voice gained strength. ``They beat me
so much that I could not walk afterward. I needed 10 minutes just
to put my signature on the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he indicated why statements like his were so rare. ``Just
before court, the police told me they would be waiting for me
afterward, and if I did not agree with the confession, I would see
what happened to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anything like it before,'' said Ariana
Zherka, a field worker for the Humanitarian Law Center, who
attended the hearing. ``He will have big problems now.'' Ms. Zherka
said she thought that the presence of a reporter for an American
newspaper in the courtroom had emboldened the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and in
Belgrade had no comment on the accusations of torture and forced
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Like the looting and burning of ethnic Albanian villages over
the summer, the arrests leave ethnic Albanians feeling completely
vulnerable to government abuse. The government's actions seem to be
radicalizing those here who had thought their differences with the
government could be settled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke in October,
Yugoslavia committed itself to providing amnesty to those arrested
on terrorism charges, and to stop further arrests. The aim was to
reduce tensions between the ethnic Albanians who dominate Kosovo
and the Serbian leaders who govern it. But amnesty has not been
granted, and the arrests are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   While most of those arrested seem to be ordinary people, about
10 percent are described by foreign officials as community leaders.
They are people whose status would allow them to counsel restraint
as ethnic Albanians try to decide whether to follow rebel leaders
who advocate war to attain independence, or politicians who favor
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Xhevap Avdijaj, the only ethnic Albanian physician in the
area around the village of Sinaj, says he favors peace. But, he
said, after 48 hours in police custody in September, he signed a
false confession that he was setting up a medical system to help
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held me on a table and beat me with sticks. At first
there was a regular police night stick, then one about this long,''
he said, holding his hands about four feet apart. ``They could
swing that long one really well, and it hit a lot harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely black and blue from the back of my neck to my
feet,'' he said. ``But it was nothing compared to others. They
carried some out of the interrogation room on stretchers.'' Avdijaj
said he suffered internal bleeding for several days after the
beatings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With many ethnic Albanians favoring the rebels, it is likely
that at least some of those arrested have done something to give
the rebels support. But foreign diplomats say the Yugoslav justice
system is tilted so much in the government's favor that once it
snares a citizen, guilt or innocence is seldom a significant
factor.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the judge in the case of Gashi, who told the judge
his confession was the result of torture, can decide to accept the
confession anyway. Gashi's assertions against the police can be
ignored, according to foreign lawyers studying the Yugoslav system.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants can be charged on the basis of statements from
witness who do not appear in court, foreign diplomats say. They can
be held incommunicado for months, then allowed to speak with an
attorney for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk to our clients about anything, as long as it is
not about the charges against them or conditions in prison,'' said
Destan Rukiqi, a defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   When Rukiqi asked a judge to intervene on behalf of a client he
said was being tortured by police, Rukiqi was detained for several
days and beaten, he said. His client is one of at least five who
have been beaten to death in custody, according to foreign human
rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats say special police teams have been sent to
some jails to carry out torture that guards refused to do. The
diplomats say they believe that the police are using electric shock
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally lawyers file formal complaints about the abuses.
But Barbara Davis, of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights, said, ``We do not see those allegations treated
seriously by judges.''

MURDERS LEAVE OLDER PEOPLE FEARFUL IN SMALL SOUTHERN CITY

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Miss. _ Peggy Cantelou, a grandmother of seven whose
Southern accent is as soft and sweet as divinity candy, carries a
baseball bat when she steps out to get the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the killings of three older people in this drowsy
Mississippi city in just seven weeks, she seldom goes anywhere
alone. Like other, older people in Columbus, a city of 23,000
people just across the Alabama border, she has learned much about
home security systems, neighborhood watches and looking over her
shoulder. In a city where it was once considered polite to speak to
strangers, a simple ``hello'' can draw a quick, hard stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think nothing of going into my storeroom in my
house,'' said Mrs. Cantelou, 65. ``Not now. It's changed our lives.
People just aren't as carefree anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus police have been reluctant to use the words ``serial
killer'' _ investigators have said there may be more than one
killer _ but in this changed city, that is little comfort to older
people.
</P>
<P>
   Three of their friends and neighbors have been taken from them,
not by sickness or accident or by other things that people here
could understand, but in gruesome fashion. All three victims were
bound, gagged and strangled in their homes in quiet, middle-class
neighborhoods, as sane, normal life went on just outside their
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The dead, who had all lived in this city's northern section,
were well known in the tight community of elderly residents. Betty
Everett, 67, had been a beautician at the Trinity Retirement
Center. Louise Randall, 80, was the retired owner of a corner
grocery. Robert Hannah, 61, had often been seeing strolling the
sidewalks of the north side.
</P>
<P>
   The murders appear to be linked, but police here are saying
little else about them.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first. Two more elderly people were killed in
similar fashion in 1996 and 1997. Those crimes, too, are unsolved.
Both victims, elderly men, were also strangled, although police
have said the slayings might not be linked to the the latest
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing anyone seems sure of is that someone is killing
the older residents of Columbus, and the investigation has not
produced a firm suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a couple of prime suspects,'' said Mayor George Wade,
but ``not to the point'' of charging anyone. The city has offered a
$45,000 reward in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Older people are buying locksmith shops out of deadbolts and
other locks and have installed security systems in houses that they
once thought nothing of leaving unlocked. Pistol sales have tripled
at least, and a firearms instructor at a city gun range is teaching
a class for elderly residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where people used to wave, even at strangers, people
spend a lot of time looking hard at people they do not know, and
some they do know. No one seems to go out much after dark unless
they are in a group, and many carry weapons of some kind, even if
it is just a baseball bat, like Mrs. Cantelou.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like a good idea,'' said Mary Francis Edmondson,
who will be 80 on her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus is a landscape of old-money mansions and small frame
homes, like other small Southern cities. Highway 82, a
strip-mall-lined main artery, ferries traffic away from a pretty,
tree-lined downtown dominated by the huge courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had anybody go into somebody's house and kill
them,'' said Jackie Ball, a city councilman. ``We have no way of
comprehending that. We're just hoping and praying this comes to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings started in 1996, when Mack Fowler, 78, was found
dead in his kitchen on July 8, stabbed and strangled. Then, on Nov.
2, 1997, George Wilbanks, 75, died the same way. Both had lived
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Oct. 13, Hannah, a retired employee at a hospital
cafeteria, was found bound, gagged and strangled. On Oct. 21, Mrs.
Randall was strangled in her house. She was found days later, also
bound and gagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stuffed a sock in her throat,'' said Mrs. Edmondson, who
had known her for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Nov. 17, police found the body of Mrs. Everett, a
gentle and very religious woman who was beloved for her work as a
beautician at the retirement home because she did perms for the
women when they were going out for church functions or family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were going somewhere special, she gave them something
nice,'' said Amanda Hartel, the food service director at the
retirement home. ``She was a wonderful person.''
</P>
<P>
   All five victims lived within a three-mile radius in the
northern part of Columbus. Residents described their neighborhoods
as middle-class and religious, with many of the houses owned by
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   At the Trinity Retirement Center, the residents are protected by
employees, and by each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still afraid,'' Ms. Hartel said. ``Everybody is.''
</P>
<P>
   With police reluctant to say anything about the cases, residents
have been left to speculate on whether there is one killer or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all I heard, there are some distinct similarities,'' said
Jack Marshall, chief operations officer for the city of Columbus,
``but we have not been able to officially say that the murders were
committed by the same person or persons. We don't have anything
major at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbery did not seem to be the motive in any of the slayings,
city officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   That, residents said, is more frightening that anything else. A
killing done in the course of a robbery, as evil as that seems, is
easier for the elderly people here to accept than the notion that
someone is murdering their friends and neighbors for some twisted
satisfaction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the most disturbing things about it, the people say, is
how it upsets the natural order of living, and dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an older person dies in their 70s or 80s, we like to say,
`Well, they lived a good life,''' said Roger Short, assistant
director of the Lowndes County-Columbus Parks and Recreation
Department, and one of the many here who are enraged and frightened
by the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The killings have stolen the end of a life of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you sick, because you don't know what life they had
left, or how they might have relished it,'' said Short, whose
father died from black lung disease from decades of working in the
coal mines near Cordova, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' he said, ``are like the people who raised
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss seems greater, somehow, because people who have lived a
long time just naturally leave more of themselves in the collective
memory of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edmonson, whose husband owns a gas company, remembers when
she used to chat with Mrs. Randall at her store, ``back in those
days when they delivered your groceries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a house full of children, and I was so busy, back
then,'' Mrs. Edmonson said. ``One day Louise told me, `You know,
Mrs. so-and-so came in with some of these little green butter
beans.' And I said I'd love to have them, but I didn't have time to
shell them. When the boy brought my groceries home, there was a
sack of little green butter beans, already shelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have told reporters they are searching for links between
the victims that could pinpoint a suspect, and a criminal profiler
with the FBI has been helping them identify the kind of criminal
they are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Lilienfeld, an assistant professor of psychology at
Emory University in Atlanta, said the killer could be preying on
the elderly for the simplest of reasons: that they are often weaker
and more helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Randall could barely walk. Her house has a wheelchair ramp
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have just been the easiest thing to do,'' Lilienfeld
said.

WHAT'S FURRY, LITERATE AND _ TO SOME _ ESSENTIAL? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Iowa, Pa., R.I.)  (lb) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATTOON, Ill. _ Betty Martin was examining a plush pony at the
Big K store with a grandma's appraising eye. What she really
wanted, she said, was the season's hottest toy, a Furby, ``but I'm
not looking for one, because I know I won't find one.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in an event repeated from Massachusetts to New
Mexico, shoppers in Mattoon started gathering at 4 a.m. at the
Wal-Mart across the parking lot to wait for a chance to buy the
talking furball that is on thousands of Christmas lists.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart in Mattoon had advertised a sale at 6 a.m., but
after 250 people lined up, managers were able to hand out only 58
numbers, each giving the right to buy one Furby for $30. Casie
Thompson, the assistant manager, said the sale ended in 15 minutes,
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Des Moines, Iowa, where Sandy Yingst, 53, and her
husband, Roger, arrived at 2:30 a.m. to stand first in line at a
Wal-Mart sale, hoping for a Furby for their granddaughter. When the
doors opened at 6 a.m., Mrs. Yingst said, ``people started pushing
and shoving and rushing.'' She was pushed into the door, where her
arm was trapped and badly bruised before she freed herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through the Cabbage Patch, I've been through the
Elmo, and I've never, ever experienced anything like this,'' said
Mrs. Yingst, who left the store sore and empty-handed. ``I told my
granddaughter, `Grandma tried.' She understood. She was upset
because I had to go through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In O'Fallon, east of St. Louis, 13-year-old Kira Wright told
reporters she had just picked up a Furby when a woman ``took my
hand and chomped on it.'' Kira, a seventh-grader, told The
Belleville News-Democrat that the woman held her wrist until she
let go. Then the shopper and the Furby vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The police were also called that day to maintain calm in
Rantoul, and were brought in by anxious store managers faced by
large, disappointed crowds in Arlington, Texas, and Lynn, Mass. Two
shoppers were reported injured in a stampede at a store in
Nazareth, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The F.A.O. Schwarz store in New York, where the Furby made its
national debut on Oct. 2, now tells callers, in a recorded message,
it can no longer take telephone, mail or Internet orders for
Furbys, as it has exceeded its allocation. But it promised to
deliver before Dec. 25 all orders placed before Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Lana Simon, public relations manager for Tiger Electronics,
which is based in Vernon Hills, north of Chicago, and is now a
subsidiary of Hasbro, advises would-be buyers to be patient. ``Keep
it in perspective,'' she said. ``If you can't find it, give your
child a rain check.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Ms. Simon said, 2 million Furbys _ which ``speak'' 200
words in a language called ``Furbish'' and can also squeal, sneeze,
snore and sneeze _ will have been produced by Christmas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Fritz, director of child and adolescent psychiatry
at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, confessed, ``I
couldn't believe people were fighting over toys.''
</P>
<P>
   What children want from their parents, he said, is love and
affection. Toys are only symbols. ``If we forget that, then how
much we love our kids depends on how much effort we went to, to get
them a particular present. I think that's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   For those with plenty of money and no patience, Furbys are hot
items on Internet auction sites, where bids this week were starting
at prices ranging from $60 for a gray and white Furby to $1,300 for
12 assorted Furbys in a box.

FIRST ASTRONAUTS ENTER INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first people entered the international space
station Thursday, beginning an era that in a few years should lead
to permanent human occupation of the mammoth research outpost 250
miles above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts aboard the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour, slowly
working their way through a series of hatches, entered the first
part of the station at 2:54 p.m. Eastern time, emphasizing the
international nature of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Col. Robert Cabana, the commander, entered the U.S.-made
Unity connecting module with Russian astronaut Sergei Krikalev at
his side. More than an hour later, they entered the Russian-made
Zarya module side-by-side in a gesture of international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't wait to see the outcome of what we started,''
Cabana said, ``I just see us in the embryonic stage of this. It's
just a small beginning, and it's only going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-member shuttle crew entered the first two sections of
the station, checking air pressure and quality, and turning on
lights. After posing for pictures, the astronauts turned on systems
and detached components stored in the modules.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant and almost momentous event,'' said lead
flight director Bob Castle from mission control at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It will take 16 nations, led by the United States and Russia,
five years to complete the station, expected to cost $40 billion to
$60 billion just to construct. The finished station will weigh
almost a million pounds and will cover an area the size of two
football fields.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the station comprises two segments and docking adaptors
weighing 70,000 pounds and towering seven stories above Endeavour's
cargo bay. The station has come alive since Endeavour joined the
two modules Sunday and the astronauts took two space walks in which
they connected outside power and data lines and deployed equipment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The astronauts remarked on how spacious the empty Unity
passageway module felt as they entered and inspected its clear,
bright white and yellow walls and hatches. Zarya also looked shiny
and new, but not as spacious. It resembled a corridor, with
instrument compartments on both walls and storage lockers on the
ceiling and floor.

IRAQ CONTINUES INTERFERENCE OF INSPECTIONS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief arms inspector for Iraq has told the
Security Council in a letter that the Iraqis have been interfering
with inspections at a number of sites. And Thursday, Baghdad
toughened its stand against allowing entry to the ruling party's
offices, in contravention of council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, the chief inspector also said the Iraqis had
refused to explain why and where equipment and microorganisms
thought to be associated with a biological weapons program had been
moved during a break in inspections last month.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington said the Iraqis were on their way to
creating a very serious situation, but drew back from a direct
threat of force. On Nov. 15, after Saddam Hussein lifted a ban on
arms inspections, President Clinton said any new obstructions could
be met with a military force.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad Thursday, Saddam's government declared that political
sites were off-limits to inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of Hussein's Baath Party stood on the steps of
a building that inspectors were barred from entering on Wednesday
and announced that they would never be permitted access. Iraq is
required under council resolutions to allow inspectors to go
anywhere they wish to search for weapons material or documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer would be the same,'' said the Baath Party official,
Latif Nsayif Jassim, when asked what would have happened if
inspectors had returned Thursday, which they apparently did not.
``This is a party. Political parties are not included.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also stalled for 45 minutes the start of an
inspection at another location.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the council, Richard Butler, the executive
chairman of the commission charged with disarming Iraq, detailed
Iraq's recent acts of noncooperation, including a bar on
photographing bombs last Saturday and an Iraqi decision the day
before not to allow inspections on Fridays, the Muslim holy day.
</P>
<P>
   Butler also told the council that last Saturday, during an
investigation concerning biological weapons, ``the Iraqi
representatives made efforts to prevent videotaping and interrupted
and sought to direct site personnel's responses.'' The Iraqis also
tried, but failed, to stop inspectors from photocopying documents.
</P>
<P>
   At the same location, Butler said, the director of the Iraqi
project under investigation said that none of his employees were
allowed to answer the inspectors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Butler has inadvertently been drawn into speculation again here
about his relationship with Secretary-General Kofi Annan after
Annan said in an interview with an Arab newspaper that he sometimes
regretted undiplomatic comments made by Butler about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``His diplomacy is seasonal,'' Annan was quoted as saying in the
interview with Ashraq al-Aswat, a London-based publication. ``I
have spoken with him on this.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Annan added that Butler's work ``is difficult
and associated with high pressure'' and that pressure causes people
to say things they would not say under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who was Australia's representative at the United Nations
before becoming head of the disarmament commission, is a
straight-shooting arms control expert who says he has been
regularly lied to by the Iraqis. His frank style has upset some of
Annan's aides, who have often been more conciliatory to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who still has
20,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf area, said he agreed
with Butler in calling the situation ``very serious.'' But he said
the administration wanted more time to study a full report on
inspections expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is in Paris, had a
tougher message, when she repeated the Clinton administration's
warning to Iraq that ``the option of using force is on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Although diplomats here, including those from the United States
and Britain, do not expect military action soon, they say that the
Iraqis are isolating themselves again from their would-be defenders
on the Security council, among them France.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who met with President Jacques Chirac for about an
hour Thursday, said later that she and Chirac ``very much agreed''
that Hussein had no choice but to cooperate with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, a spokesman said that the first
casualty of the Iraqis' defiance would be the comprehensive review
of sanctions promised by the Security Council three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, the spokesman, said the use of force was an issue
that the United States would decide alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never signaled the timing or even the decision
concerning the use of force,'' he said. ``That's not something you
want an adversary to have advance knowledge of.''
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat at the United Nations said the United States
would be unlikely to return to the Security Council for support in
the use of force because any such move would be vetoed by Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq cannot hope to have sanctions lifted until it has satisfied
the Security Council, through Butler's Special Commission, that all
its weapons of mass destruction _ biological, chemical, nuclear and
the missiles to deliver them _ have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say the sanctions have caused intolerable hardships
in Iraq. Thursday, through the United Nations Children's Fund, they
released new statistics showing that more than a million children
are not in school this year because of the sanctions.

ELECTION COMMISSION VOTES AGAINST REPAYMENTS FOR CLINTON AND DOLE
ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct slug to 2 takes)  (htv) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a 6-0 vote, the Federal Election Commission
rebuffed its own professional staff Thursday and refused to order
multi-million-dollar repayments from the 1996 presidential
campaigns of President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The decision nullified the recommendation of the commission's
auditors and general counsel that the campaigns repay nearly $25
million for exceeding federal campaign spending limits and
illegally coordinating their advertising with the two political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's vote, which came on the heels of Attorney
General Janet Reno's decision earlier this week not to ask for an
independent counsel to investigate President Clinton's involvement
in an advertising blitz paid for by the Democratic Party, all but
obliterates the spending and contribution limits that have been a
cornerstone of the post-Watergate election laws.
</P>
<P>
   It also almost surely means that the proliferation of issue
advertising, will intensify in the 2000 presidential campaign. The
issue ads, which benefits presidential and other federal
candidates, are paid for by the national parties with money raised
outside the federal election laws, which put a $1,000 limit on
individual campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signal that inaction by the commission sends is that there
is no limit to the type of presidential campaigning you can
encourage others to do and avoid the limits,'' said Kent Cooper, a
former FEC official. ``It basically removes the limits that the
presidential public financing system had imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the six commissioners was not unexpected. Although
the FEC itself was a creation of the post-Watergate election-law
reforms, the agency has a history of timidity. Evenly divided along
partisan lines, the six commissioners often reflect the views of
their political parties in 3-3 ties. But the decision Thursday not
to seek the multi-million-dollar repayments from the Clinton and
Dole campaigns could reflect the parties' views unanimously,
because Democrats and Republicans alike view unfettered spending as
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout several days of public hearings on the 1996 audit,
the commissioners expressed grave doubts about the auditors'
conclusions. Karl Sandstrom, a recent Democratic appointee, was the
most vocal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole process has been unfair to the responding
committees,'' Sandstrom said. He also said, ``I don't adopt the
recommendations, I don't adopt the findings and I don't adopt the
legal analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ann Elliott, a Republican commissioner since 1982, said she
thought it was legal for the parties to coordinate some activities
with the presidential candidates. She also said that as long as
party issue ads did not expressly contain an electioneering message
for a candidate they were proper. ``There is an exhortation to vote
for a specific candidate in an election _ that should be our
standard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC did not decide one important issue related to the audit:
whether the party ads should be considered as in-kind contributions
to the Clinton and Dole campaigns. It is likely they will refer
this issue for further investigation by the Commission's
enforcement division, but it is unlikely the FEC would approve
further action on issue advertising after rejecting the repayments,
several agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending repayments of $7 million from the Clinton
campaign and $17.7 million from the Dole campaign, the auditors and
the agency's chief counsel had agreed that the money paid for party
ads represented an illegal end-run around the spending limits for
presidential candidates who receive federal matching funds. But on
Wednesday, the commissioners agreed to dramatically reduce the
repayment for the Dole campaign, presaging the Thursday decision to
require no repayments for the issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's decision was hailed by lawyers for both campaigns.
``I'm pleased with the commission's decision on the issue ads,''
said Kenneth Gross, counsel to the Dole campaign. ``It's the
correct position in our view.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Utrecht, a lawyer for the Clinton-Gore campaign, said, ``As
we've said on numerous occasions, we feel it's clear the issue
advertising run by the Democratic National Committee was fully in
compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding not to seek an independent counsel, Reno emphasized
the fact that President Clinton had relied on the advice of
campaign and party lawyers that the issue ads were legal.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of issue advertising is a byproduct of the growth of
soft money, the controversial large donations from wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions that are raised by the
political parties in unlimited amounts. Soft money has played an
increasingly important role in presidential elections since 1988.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton's re-election campaign came up with
an innovative plan to finance early advertising with Democratic
party soft money. The ads were created by the president's campaign
consultants and featured Clinton prominently. As long as the ads
did not contain an express exhortation to vote for a candidate,
Democratic lawyers said, they could be paid for by the committee,
in large part with soft money. The Clinton-Gore campaign and the
Dole campaign were limited to spending about $30 million each in
the primaries. The DNC, with no spending ceiling, paid for $46
million in issue ads. The Republican party bought similar ads, but
began them later in the election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to order the repayments from the Clinton and Dole
campaigns, the FEC effectively blessed the legality of this
arrangement. Because the party ads were in some instances identical
to ads run by the Clinton and Dole campaigns, the FEC auditors and
general counsel viewed the issue ads as crossing the line into
impermissible electioneering. The commissioners disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will send a message for 2000,'' said former FEC Chairman
Trevor Potter. ``It validates the Clinton tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some potential presidential candidates for 2000 are
raising soft money through political action committees established
at the state level and through non-profit organizations. Some
contenders, including billionaire Steve Forbes, a Republican, have
broadcast issue ads in early primary states like New Hampshire.
Some campaign finance watchdog groups fear that in 2000 it will be
the candidates, as well as the two political parties, who
creatively circumvent the federal campaign spending and
contribution limits with issue advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Issue ads are not confined to presidential elections. In the
1998 congressional elections, the National Republican Congressional
Committee financed $30 million is such ads, some of which raised
the Monica Lewinsky scandal. More of these ads are likely in
congressional races in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC's decision means we've returned to the law of the
jungle when it comes to campaign spending,'' said Fred Wertheimer,
an advocate of overhauling campaign finance practices who has
unsuccessfully urged the FEC and the Justice Department to limit
party issue advertising. ``There are really no limits left.''

RUSSIA OFFERS 1999 BUDGET: `HONEST' OR `UNREALISTIC'? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After three months of vacillation, the government on
Thursday finally unveiled its 1999 spending plan to halt Russia's
economic tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Primakov called the economic blueprint, his first as
prime minister, a bold effort to boost Russia's hard-pressed
factories and farms while clamping down on wasteful spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is honest,'' Primakov said Thursday. ``We have not included
what we cannot pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 1999 budget was roundly criticized as a political
exercise to attract Western financial aid while placating powerful
constituencies at home.
</P>
<P>
   From tax revenues to inflation, the budget is based on highly
optimistic assumptions, which are unlikely to survive their
bruising contact with Russia's dour economic realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget is based on a best-case scenario,'' said Peter
Westin, an economist with the Russian-European Center for Economic
Policy. ``It all looks very unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office three months ago, Primakov has talked of
the need for state intervention in the economy to prop up faltering
enterprises. Thursday's budget includes billions of rubles of new
subsidies for the coal industry and for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In a bow to Communist sentiment and to buy peace in the ranks of
the military, enlisted soldiers will have their pay increased by 62
percent, and officers by 102 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the government all but broke, the new budget was the
subject of considerable infighting between Yuri Maslyukov, the
Communist member of the Primakov team who oversees economic policy,
and Mikhail Zadornov, the reform-minded finance minister. At the
insistence of Zadornov, spending plans were trimmed back and
revenue projections decreased.
</P>
<P>
   But the budget still reflects the premium Primakov has placed on
achieving political consensus by distributing credits, writing off
debts and avoiding unpopular reforms.
</P>
<P>
   With politicians increasingly consumed with the struggle to
succeed the ailing president, Boris Yeltsin, it is unclear whether
any of Russia's leaders have the will to put the nation's financial
house in order.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that by the time the Communist-dominated Parliament
approves the Primakov budget plan, the government will be left with
a sizable deficit. That will force it to print even more rubles and
heighten the already considerable inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The shaky state of market reform in Russia is a big concern for
Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, and Lawrence
Summers, the deputy treasury secretary, who have come to Moscow for
high-level talks on economic and security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 budget calls for spending of 573 billion rubles ($29
billion). The U.S. 1999 federal budget, in contrast, is $1.7
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Russian revenue is projected at 474 billion rubles ($24
billion). That leaves a budget deficit of 101.5 billion rubles
($5.1 billion).
</P>
<P>
   The projected budget deficit is equivalent to 2.5 percent of
Russia's gross domestic product. When Russia's large debt servicing
costs are excluded, government revenue will actually exceed
spending by 1.7 percent of GDP, Zadornov boasted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have long been urging Russia to slash its
enormous deficit, which was one of the main causes of its current
economic crisis. But the fine print of the budget is less than
persuasive, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government is forecasting tax receipts that far
exceed Russia's current level of tax collection. Indeed, in recent
weeks the government appears to have dealt a blow to
revenue-raising efforts by deciding to cut the nation's value added
tax from 20 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The action was taken at the urging of Georgi Boos, the new head
of the State Tax Service. Invoking Russia's version of ``supply
side'' economics, Boos has argued that the cut in the VAT will
encourage economic growth and increase tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   But few economists agree. They say Boos has simply handed out a
costly favor to his business friends and deprived the nation of an
important source of income. In a country where cheating on taxes is
a national pastime, the VAT, a type of sales tax that is applied at
each stage of production and distribution, is one of the few levies
that the government is able to collect on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say the budget's inflation estimate (30 percent) is
also based on wishful thinking. Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed
as prime minister in August, said the best the country could hope
for was an inflation rate of 60 percent or 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the budget also assumes optimistically that
Russia will attract billions in foreign credits from the
International Monetary Fund and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also put the West on notice that it is counting on its
cooperation to renegotiate its debt. The budget calls for paying
only $9.5 billion in foreign debt and interest payments next year,
of the $17.5 billion due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without an easing of the debt burden in 1999 and 2000 and the
following years, it is simply not possible for Russia to exist,''
Zadornov said. ``It is simply like that.''

   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton's fate in the House hanging
on a razor-thin margin of perhaps one or two votes, Republican and
Democratic leaders are scrambling to insure that a handful of
ailing, retiring or traveling lawmakers are present for next week's
historic vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., had hip surgery last week that
normally requires six to eight weeks of recuperation. But Miller's
doctors have cleared him to travel _ so long as he's lying flat
much of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he needs to be there, he'll be there, but he needs to go on
a military plane or some other plane with a bed,'' said Danny
Weiss, Miller's spokesman, who said he had notified the White House
and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., of Miller's special needs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gephardt, Erik Smith, said Thursday night:
``We're going to try to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Clinton's destiny will be decided by a lame-duck
Congress, 40 lawmakers who are retiring, lost re-election or failed
in a bid to win Senate or governor's races now find their final
vote will be their most momentous.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they make it here.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic aides worry about Rep. Henry Gonzalez of Texas, who
is retiring this year after a 38-year House career. Gonzalez is 82
and missed much of the 1998 legislative year because of heart
problems, although he returned in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes it here, he makes it; if he doesn't, he doesn't,''
said a spokesman for Gonzalez, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have their own concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harris Fawell, a seven-term Illinois Republican who is
retiring this year, had a quadruple-heart bypass on November 13,
but his aides say he is rested and ready to vote (although they
won't say which way).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not supposed to carry anything heavy, like
luggage,'' said Kristin Wolgemuth, Fawell's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may have trouble reaching Rep. Jay Kim of
California, who lost his primary race after pleading guilty to
accepting $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. Kim was
sentenced to one year's probation, fined $5,000 and was required to
wear an electronic-monitoring anklet for two months. Repeated
telephone calls to Kim's offices in California and Washington went
unanswered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of House Republicans set to vote to impeach
Clinton, rumors swirled Thursday that a few retiring Republicans
who oppose impeachment might not show up next week, to spare
themselves the scorn of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine someone shirking this most important of
constitutional duties,'' said Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., who is
leaving this year. ``These are just unfounded rumors and idle
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Three representatives who won election to the Senate _ Democrat
Charles Schumer of New York and Republicans Jim Bunning of Kentucky
and Mike Crapo of Idaho _ could vote twice _ on impeachment in the
House, and on whether to remove Clinton, in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All three lawmakers have said that barring any congressionally
required recusal, they would vote in the Senate, if such a vote is
held.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress out of session, at least until next week, many
legislators are scattered all over the globe on official business.
A few are planning to jet in just before the votes begin next
Thursday _ no doubt driving their nervous leaders to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick White, R-Wash., who lost his re-election bid, is to
give the keynote speech Tuesday before the International Internet
Conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   White, whose district includes the headquarters of Microsoft,
will deliver his address (in fluent French), and hop on a
trans-Atlantic flight the next morning. He is still in the
undecided camp, aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``His duty is to represent his district as long as his term
allows,'' said Randy Pepple, White's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., newly named to the House National
Security Committee, left for Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia on
Wednesday night. She is due back next Wednesday. &QL;

 &HT;    Aetna buying Prudential's health unit
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Aetna would double its managed-care membership in
metro Atlanta and Georgia by acquiring Prudential HealthCare in a
$1 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's plan to purchase Prudential's health care business,
announced Thursday, would make the combined entity the leading HMO
and overall managed-care company in metro Atlanta. Statewide,
Aetna/Prudential would rival the size of Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Georgia in managed-care members.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the acquisition would make Aetna the No. 1 health
insurer, covering one in 10 Americans, the company said. It would
add 6.6 million Prudential members _ about 5 million of them in
managed-care plans_ ballooning Aetna's health-benefits membership
to 22.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the proverbial offer we couldn't refuse,'' said Richard
Huber, chairman and CEO of Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna. ``We've
been talking to Prudential for a long time. The price has come
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna officials said the purchase, for $500 million in cash and
$500 million in debt, gives it new health care members at a cost of
about $200 apiece. That's much lower than the per-member price the
company paid for New York Life Insurance Co.'s health care business
earlier this year _ about $1 billion, or $600 a member. Aetna's
acquisition of U.S. Healthcare in 1996 for $8.9 billion cost it
even more per customer.
</P>
<P>
   That deal accelerated Aetna's transition from traditional
fee-for-service health insurance to managed care, which aims to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna shares fell $1.62 1/2 Thursday, closing at $79.18 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential, in the process of converting to a publicly traded
company from one owned by policyholders, had been seeking to sell
its money-losing health care business to concentrate on becoming a
global financial company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting Prudential's members at an incredibly low
price,'' Ira Zuckerman, a Nutmeg Securities Ltd. analyst, told
Bloomberg Business News.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Prudential was reported in talks to sell its
business to Louisville-based Humana. Another previous suitor
reportedly was California-based WellPoint Health Networks, which is
buying Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would vault Aetna U.S. Healthcare into a top-three
position among managed-care providers in nine states, including
Georgia, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential, whose health care headquarters is in New Jersey, has
more than 270,000 managed-care members in Atlanta, most of whom are
in its HMO or a similar plan, called Point-of-Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudential has had one of the better health plans here in
Atlanta,'' said Lew Yeouze of consulting firm William M. Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Among Prudential's current health care clients in Atlanta are
SunTrust, Georgia-Pacific, NationsBank, BellSouth, Emory University
and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, by doubling in membership, would be able to negotiate
better deals with doctors and hospitals, said Brent Layton of
Atlanta consulting firm Layton &AMP; Associates. Those providers would
receive more patients through those contracts, but their
reimbursement may be less, he said. That way, Aetna can offer a
lower premium to attract employers.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna spokesman Walt Cherniak said the acquisition's effect on
pricing would be hard to predict. But he added: ``We hope our size
will make us more affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's HMO premiums increased about 7 percent for Atlanta-area
employers for next year, while its other health insurance products
climbed about 10 percent. That range of increases has been typical
for the entire insurance industry, reeling from losses in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But such insurer consolidation could lead to fewer choices of
health plans for employers _ and thus their workers, Yeouze said.
``We're getting toward a real end game'' on consolidation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction also makes Aetna the nation's largest provider
of dental benefits, more than doubling its coverage to more than 15
million people, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it could cut about 1,000 to 2,000 jobs from
Prudential HealthCare's work force of 16,000 over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential HealthCare has 540 employees in Atlanta. Its local
headquarters is on Paces Ferry in Vinings. Aetna's local health
care headquarters is in the North Point area of Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to
close in the second quarter of 1999. Huber said he doesn't foresee
regulatory snags. ``This is still a very fragmented industry,'' he
said. ``It's a highly competitive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Frino, a senior research analyst with A.M. Best Co., told
Dow Jones News Service that the timing and size of the Aetna
acquisition are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they'd do a smaller, local-market type deal, but I
guess they saw this as a great opportunity, given the price,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna will have to prove, though, that it can integrate both
NYLCare and Prudential, Frino said. ``That's the big question about
all of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna encountered widespread problems in integrating U.S.
Healthcare. Earlier this year, about 20,000 metro Atlanta members
of Aetna failed to receive new ID cards in time for the new year,
or weren't entered in the Aetna computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The company doesn't expect the same problems with integrating
Prudential, Huber said. ``You get better the more (acquisitions)
you do,'' he said.

 &HT;    Collier to add depth to Ga. Tech outside game
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jason Collier refuses to talk about the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the 450 or so days he spent in Bloomington, Ind.,
participating in war games under the iron hand of Bobby Knight,
``The General.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 7-0, 250-pound product of Springfield, Ohio, was
one of the most highly recruited high school players. He eliminated
overtures from Duke, Notre Dame and North Carolina and narrowed his
choices to Georgia Tech and Indiana. Indiana won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just two hours and forty-five minutes away from home,''
he said. ``It was the closest big-time basketball program around.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Collier started 27 of 33 games at Indiana as a freshman and
eight of nine as a sophomore, averaging 10 points and six rebounds
a game. He walked away one Wednesday morning last December. The
night before, he had had 11 points, seven rebounds and four assists
in a win over South Alabama. The next morning, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The word out of Bloomington was that Collier felt he was more of
a perimeter player and wasn't being allowed to play his game.
Supposedly, his parents were pressuring him to leave after they
weren't allowed free access to him on a trip to a tournament in
Hawaii. One story is that when his roomates, Luke Recker and
Michael Lewis, threw him a going-away dinner the night he left,
some of the team members didn't come, splitting the team. Some
Hoosier players thought that once he returned for his sophomore
year he had made a commitment and should see it through, not walk
out during the season.
</P>
<P>
   By January, Collier had enrolled at Georgia Tech and when the
Yellow Jackets play Georgia on Sunday, the big man will be eligible
to play for the first time in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to dip into it,'' Collier said about his time at
Indiana. ``Every time I talk about it, it gets in the Bloomington
newspapers, and I get letters.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made his decision to attend Indiana, he said, it wasn't
what his mother or sister had expected. ``They both cried,'' he
said. ``They love Atlanta, and coach Cremins has been a friend of
the family for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out a year was excruciating for Collier, who had to sit
and watch when he knew he could be helping.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone through it, Collier said he thinks the NCAA rules
governing transfers need to be changed. ``If you get married and it
doesn't work out, you can get divorced and re-marry the very next
day,'' he said. ``But if you're a 17- or 18-year-old kid and make a
mistake, you lose a year of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he must come out of the gate at full speed against Georgia,
with Kentucky and North Carolina following in the next two weeks.
``With Travis (Spivey) and Pablo (Machado) gone (as transfers) and
Dion (Glover) hurt, it's been a hard year,'' he said, ``but with
what I've been through over the past two years, that's not a
problem with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier will wear No. 52 Sunday afternoon, the same number worn
by his father, Jeff, when he played for Dwane Morrison at Tech,
1973-76.
</P>
<P>
   His presense will add immediate depth to a depleted Tech lineup
without Glover, who is out for the year, and Jon Babul, who hurt an
ankle. He will complement the inside game of Tech's 6-11 Alvin
Jones and give the Jackets a big body to take up some of the
rebounding slack in Babul's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Collier started his athletic career as a swimmer and won
national awards as an 11- and 12-year-old. But by the sixth grade,
he was six feet tall, and he gave up swimming in the seventh grade
to concentrate on basketball. When he entered Catholic Central High
as a freshman, he was 6-6 and weighed 156. ``I was a toothpick,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the toothpick grew, and so did his value. By Collier's
senior year, he was rated as the best big man in the country by
four different recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Collier won't talk about his off-court differences with
Knight, he said his on-court expectations at Georgia Tech are
different than what was expected of him by Knight. ``I was
inside-oriented all the time at Indiana,'' he said. ``I was told
not to shoot threes, not to do this, not to do that. There was a
lot more I wasn't allowed to do than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Collier's first day at practice at Tech, he says he knew
things were going to be different. ``Coach Cremins handed me the
ball out beyond the three-point line and told me to shoot it,'' he
said. ``I shot it and made it. He said, 'We're going to try to get
you back to where you were.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Collier will be listed as a power forward on the basketball
program, but his role will be more of a small forward, much like
Matt Harpring played last year. Cremins plans to exploit all of
Collier's talents, including his long-range abilities. ``The reason
people talk about my perimeter game,'' Collier said, ``is that not
many big guys can do it.''

 &HT;    Kollar's line plays in his style
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Jackson Browne playing on the radio in his
office, it's tempting to think that Bill Kollar has an easy-going
demeanor. But after watching him yell on the practice field, it's
obvious that he's anything but mellow.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Kollar, the Falcons defensive line coach, than
his trademark hollering, and defensive end Chuck Smith knows that
as well as anyone on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's genius to his madness,'' Smith said. ``He yells, but
for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Kollar, the senior member of the Falcons coaching staff, arrived
in 1990. When Smith arrived as a second-round draft choice in '92,
they mixed like gunpowder and matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being in meetings, and I thought him and Chuck were
going to come to blows,'' defensive end Lester Archambeau said.
``They both care so much about what they're doing. It's like
anything else. You're going to butt heads, but Chuck has developed
into a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Kollar, 46, has become very adept at developing great defensive
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are ranked No. 2 in the league against the run,
yielding 76.6 yards per game, and the line has contributed mightily
to that statistic. Last year, Atlanta was No. 8 against the run,
and the defensive linemen accounted for 43 of the team's
franchise-record 55 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Kollar's linemen play as he did when he was with the
Bengals (1974-76) and the Bucs (1977-81) _ like madmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't one of those guys who was that big and strong, so I
always ended up having to work hard to get where I was getting,''
he said. ``I've always been sort of high-energy. I can't just go
out and stand on the practice field. I don't give a (darn) what
other people are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes to get my guys going ... if that means
hollering or whatever, that's what I'll do. No matter what, I'm
responsible for what happens with the defensive line. If you go out
and work hard ... you can be proud of what you put on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, too, is a prideful man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some knock-down drag-outs,'' he said. ``We had our
words years ago, and we moved on. He keeps wanting to do better.
The thing is, he says what he means, and I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no mixing words with Kollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abe Gibron was my defensive line coach (at Tampa Bay), and he
was a guy who would stay on you,'' he said. ``A lot of my coaching
style comes from Abe. If you let people slide, they'll try to slide
as much as they can. But if you're pushing them to get better,
they're going to get better. You rely on their pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Kollar and his wife, Jan, love living in Atlanta. Although he's
had offers to coach elsewhere the last two seasons, he has stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has been nothing but great to me,'' he said.
``I had chances to go other places, but unless you get fired ... or
get a great opportunity ... I'm not the type to pull up stakes
every two years. If (a chance to be a coordinator) comes, great; if
it doesn't, it won't bother me. I like the hands-on action of
coaching guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kollar won't be able attend his oldest son's graduation at SMU
on Saturday. Chad was a defensive back there for three years before
a neck and shoulder injury prevented him from playing this season.
Kollar's other son, Clint, is a junior linebacker at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Kollar is pleased that both sons appear to be on their way to
high-paying jobs in the white-collar world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he'll gladly remain a member of the proletariat. And
he'll continue to wear sweat pants and a sweatshirt on the practice
field, whether it's 50 degrees or 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs are too damned skinny to go out in shorts, and I like
sweating to where you feel like you're in the action, so I wear the
sweats,'' he said. ``I like it where you're sweating like crazy
just like those guys. I'm always into it. From Day 1, that's how
I've been.

 &HT;    Barr's drive to impeach Clinton fueled by ``very strong'' case
against him
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the U.S. Capitol looming in the backdrop,
Georgia Republican Bob Barr looked directly into the television
camera like a man on the verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reciting the articles of impeachment against the president as if
they were the alphabet, Barr told the CNN audience that impeachment
case against President Clinton is ``strong, very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   As the House Judiciary Committee prepares for a vote on four
articles of impeachment against Clinton today or tomorrow, perhaps
no single member of Congress has lusted after his impeachment more
than Bob Barr.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Barr stood alone in his resolve to oust Clinton
from the Oval Office. He even introduced a resolution to impeach
him three months before the nation had even heard the name Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barr is on the cusp of a historic vote recommending to the
House of Representatives that the president be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   And he is hitting the media circuit at every turn to make sure
that this particular moment does not slip away.
</P>
<P>
   There he was at 7:30 a.m. Thursday morning gulping coffee and
nibbling on pancakes at the posh Carlton Hotel, telling
Washington's media elite at the Sperling Breakfast that now is the
time to get rid of Clinton. (Although he still thinks that the
investigation into campaign fundraising abuses will yield fruit if
this one fails.)
</P>
<P>
   One hour later, Barr was back in the ornate Judiciary chambers
on Capitol Hill listening with rapt attention to the closing
arguments of the Republican and Democratic investigative counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans have reserved judgment, Barr almost beams
when the ``I'' word comes up. ``All of the charges are very strong
and can be defended in terms of the facts and the Constitution,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a full day of hearings, Barr went straight to the
microphones, followed by a gaggle of reporters who routinely swarms
around him down the marble corridors of the Rayburn House Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   And while this may be what is known as The Bob Barr moment, he
worries that the White House will take away his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel is a great deal of apprehension,'' said Barr, in
between television spots. ``An awful lot can happen in one week.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, he said, would stop at nothing to prevent the
House vote. So is he worried that he will become a target? Of
course. Is he going to do anything about it? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment I am waiting for is after the floor vote,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he won't rest until he is sure there are 218
votes to remove Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Well, lunch did consist solely of a handful of Georgia pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Where exactly does Barr's palpable antipathy for the president
stem from?
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that I hate him,'' Barr said. ``I just take great
offense to what he has done to our country.''

 &HT;    Money laundering allegations against Voinovich go to special
investigator
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Ohio Elections Commission on Thursday voted
to name a special investigator to look into allegations that Gov.
George Voinovich and others laundered 1994 campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also dismissed a second complaint filed by
Democrats seeking to participate in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member commission unanimously decided to have a
special investigator with subpoena power look into allegations that
Voinovich and others laundered about $60,000 from his 1994 campaign
to reimburse Voinovich's brother, Paul, and a lobbyist for payments
made to a campaign supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did not say who the investigator would be or when
the appointment would be made, but officials said he would have 90
days to look into the case and would be given wide latitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll look at evidence, test responses, and he will determine
his own course,'' said Philip Richter, the commission's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the parties named in the elections complaint all
said they agreed with the appointment of a special investigator and
hoped it would clear up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At Thurday's preliminary hearing before the commission, they all
reiterated that their clients did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor did not approve of any diversionary scheme,''
said Voinovich's attorney, David Young.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed Oct. 28 by Secretary of State Bob Taft names
George and Paul Voinovich; former lobbyist Michael Fabiano; Frank
Fela, vice president of Paul Voinovich's company; and Vincent
Panichi, Gov. Voinovich's campaign treasurer. The allegations
surfaced in an ongoing FBI and IRS investigation and were forwarded
to Taft by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the person most able to explain what happened,
political consultant Nick Mamais, had died by the time the governor
became aware of the allegations late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never an opportunity to go back to Mr. Mamais and
say, `What in the world; how can you explain these bizarre events?'
'' Young told the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says Gov. Voinovich approved a deal to send
$60,000 to Mamais, who would forward money to Fabiano and Paul
Voinovich to reimburse them for payments made to a campaign
supporter, Anthony ``Ray'' Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign reported the Mamais expenditure as voter
registration services.
</P>
<P>
   Panichi told a federal grand jury last year he was present when
Voinovich approved the deal, but he recanted some of that in a
recent affidavit to the commission, saying he did not know what the
governor heard during the meeting and that he may have
misinterpreted the governor's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Panichi's attorney, Donald Brey, said the parties need to know
more about what has come out of the federal investigation in order
to defend their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should see the court order that sent the information to the
commission,'' Brey said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the grand jury testimonies included with the complaint
have portions deleted and that could lead to inaccurate
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking about who said what to whom, you have to see
it in context,'' Brey said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Sandy Beckwith issued an order, the
contents of which are sealed, allowing Taft's office to use the FBI
and IRS information to enforce Ohio election law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, we have no authority to discuss it,'' said John
Bender, the secretary of state's election counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Commission member Norton Webster criticized the handling of the
information from the federal investigation, saying he is ``troubled
the Department of Justice did not come forward earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfair to the governor. I think it was unfair to his
opponent,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed just five days before the Nov. 3
election and came to light the day before the vote in which
Voinovich defeated challenger Mary Boyle for a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   After voting to appoint an investigator, the commission
unanimously dismissed a similar complaint filed by labor leader
Harold Nichols. Nichols' attorney, Don McTigue, argued against the
dismissal but said afterward he was satisfied an investigator would
take up the case now.

 &HT;    Norwood: I'll vote to impeach
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the two Georgia Republicans in the House
targeted by Democrats as potential opponents of impeachment said
Thursday he will vote to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charlie Norwood, a conservative from Augusta, broke his
silence on the matter to say he believes Clinton is guilty of
perjury and obstruction of justice, charges included in the four
proposed articles of impeachment under consideration by the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention is to vote for impeachment,'' Norwood said in a
telephone interview from Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Republican, in his second term, said he could
hold his tongue no longer in the wake of his appearance on a list
20 to 30 undecided Republicans the White House and other Democrats
planned to lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood said he considers the list, leaked to news organizations
earlier this week, one more piece of misinformation put out by the
``tricksters at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they believed Norwood might have been open to
persuasion because his district is more than a third
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans overwhelmingly oppose impeachment, according to
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Norwood said his constituents are strongly in favor of
impeachment. And, he said, ``I have not had one black Georgian from
the 10th District come up to me and say, 'Don't vote for
impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood is the fourth Georgia Republican representative to
commit publicly to voting for impeachment. The others are Bob Barr,
a member of the Judiciary Committee, Mac Collins and John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Two Georgia Democrats in the House, John Lewis and Cynthia
McKinney, have said they will oppose any article of impeachment
approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Saxby Chambliss, the other Georgia Republican on the White House
wish list, indicated he will not make his views on impeachment
known until after the Judiciary Committee votes.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the Georgia congressional delegation _
Democrat Sanford Bishop and Republicans Newt Gingrich, Jack
Kingston and Nathan Deal _ have not said how they will vote.

EFFORT UNDER WAY TO MOLD OPINION IN IMPEACHMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The jostling over the impeachment of President
Clinton fanned out over several fronts Thursday, as the White began
actively courting Republican moderates and interest groups on both
sides of the issue urged members to flood congressional offices
with calls and letters.
</P>
<P>
   With the climactic vote in the full House a week away, the
Democratic National Committee has sent a set of talking points to
state party leaders suggesting they ``write letters right away'' to
their local newspaper and call talk radio programs to speak out
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urge your constituencies to call or write members of Congress,
and remind them that these are not impeachable offenses, and that a
lengthy Senate trial will keep members of Congress from doing what
people sent them to Washington to do,'' according to the talking
points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Christian Coalition dumped the last batch
of more than a quarter-million petitions on Capitol Hill urging
members of the House and the Senate to vote for impeachment. Many
of the petitioners have followed up with calls to their
congressional representative, said coalition Executive Director
Randy Tate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Washington-based group called People for the
American Way has mobilized against impeachment, setting up a
toll-free number number this week for people to call to urge their
member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the flurry of lobbying intensified in the shadows of the
impeachment hearings, there was no public change Thursday among the
20 to 30 Republicans who are undecided whether to vote for
impeachment, including Representative Charles F. Bass of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding an 21-seat majority in the House and at
least three Democrats expected to vote for impeachment, Clinton
will need the votes of at least 14 Republicans. Some Democratic
aides say that as many as seven Democrats may vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, worried that the president may end up on
the short end of a close vote, Thursday said they would open their
doors to any undecided House member who wants to talk to Clinton's
attorneys, Charles Ruff and Gregory Craig, or other senior
officials about the law and the facts of the president's case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials sent every member of the House a copy of
Clinton's 184-page rebuttal document that was delivered to the
House Judiciary Committee this week. Senior White House officials
also burned up the phone lines talking to House Republicans and
Democrats about the effort to get a vote on censure to the floor of
the House as an alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joseph Lockhart said it was ``very
hard to assess'' whether the administration was making progress in
rounding up the votes to avoid impeachment. ``We believe that to
the extent there are people with open minds and open hearts, that
this is a convincing case.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some clamor for Clinton to make a personal appeal to
House members before he leaves Saturday on a four-day trip to the
Middle East, White House aides indicated it was unlikely. More
possible, some said, was that Clinton might reach out to moderates
with phone calls while overseas or make some sort of statement
before the full House vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   One undecided moderate Republican, Representative Rick A. Lazio
of New York, will decided Friday whether to accompany the president
on the trip. Lazio was a replacement for retiring House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who had been invited to join Clinton, but asked
Lazio to go in his place.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri began calling some of the 31 Democrats who
voted for the impeachment inquiry in October, and plans to make
more calls. The congressman also is expected to formally announce
his opposition to impeachment on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on
Sunday, and plead with Republicans to bring a censure vote to the
floor, said a source close to the leadership office.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Democrats _ Representatives Gene Taylor of
Mississippi, Virgil Goode of Virginia and Ralph Hall of Texas _ say
they plan to vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's chief of staff, Wayne Weidie, said the congressman
believes that ``censure is a copout. If people are allowed to lie
under oath, our judicial system would crumble.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two Democrats are undecided on impeachment, including
Representatives Charles W. Stenholm of Texas and William Lipinksi
of Illinois, they said Thursday through aides.
</P>
<P>
   Though Representative Jack Metcalf, a Republican of Washington,
had appeared on a White House list of undecided Republicans, an
aide said the congressman would vote in favor of at least one
article of impeachment _ the charge that Clinton lied to a grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Ratcliff, a DNC spokeswoman, said many Americans have
not focused on the possibility that Clinton may be impeached.
``It's a very serious issue and people have been calling and saying
what can we do to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The literature contends that the entire impeachment process was
being ``controlled and manipulated by partisan elements of the
Republican party led by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican and a member of
DeLay's whip organization, said Thursday: ``This is strictly a vote
of conscience.'' In the most the recent conference call with DeLay
on Tuesday, ``we were told not to whip it,'' said Miller, who
personally is ``leaning'' to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he has no idea where the counts of Republican
pro-impeachment votes are coming from, since neither he nor any of
the other whips have been instructed to contact or lobby members.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition's Tate said his group was not lobbying
members of Congress, but certain individuals were calling their
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Robert Ney, whose Eastern Ohio district includes
the conservative but union-affiliated residents of steel and coal
mining towns, has seen a surge in phone calls from constituents in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, ``we received about 250 phone calls from within
the district, and they were running 8-to-1 for impeachment,'' said
Neil Volz, an aide to Ney. ``We're getting even more calls today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass of New Hampshire is also being flooded with calls, said
Sally Tibbetts, his press secretary. ``The calls have been steady.
In fact, we have been getting calls outside the district and
outside the state.'' Most calls, she said, seemed to be in favor of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman is always happy to hear from his
constituents,'' said Tibbetts. ``But public opinion is not one of
the things he will weigh heavily as he makes his decision. It will
be based more on the evidence, the testimony and the
recommendations of the Judiciary Committee.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dripping sarcasm, the Republicans' chief
investigative counsel turned from a video clip of President
Clinton's testimony and told the House impeachment inquiry, ``Life
was so much simpler before they found that dress, wasn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   If the minority Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had any
remaining doubts that they were representing the president in the
fight of his life, they were put to rest by the words, skeptical
tone and upraised eyebrow that the Republican counsel, David
Schippers, avidly applied in his summation attempt to demolish the
president's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The rawest of emotions were evoked in the committee room as
Schippers attacked Clinton the man as much as the president,
describing him as someone with a ``conscious indifference and
complete disregard for the concept of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He picks out a single word and weaves from it a deceitful
answer,'' Schippers scornfully contended, lambasting the president
as much as indicting him. ``He also invents convoluted definitions
of words and phrases in his own crafty mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats could only sit fuming in silence for three straight
hours as Schippers, while insisting his task was a ``sorrowful''
one, belittled in particular the president's apologies to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know he's only admitted what he couldn't deny,''
Schippers said acidly, ``And he's continued to play games with the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats later accused Schippers of
``sanctimonious lectures'' and a variation on McCarthyism, citing
his dark assertion that he had come upon even more abuses by
Clinton but could not comment on them because, he insisted,
criminal investigations were under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empty threats,'' said Barney Frank, D-Mass., arguing that the
president merited censure for his misdeeds, not impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case on Thursday, the Democrats appealed through
the day to history and to the American public. Their summation
counsel, Abbe Lowell, repeatedly invoked the Watergate scandal of
President Nixon as a measure of impeachable deeds that dwarfed the
sex-and-mendacity scandal of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans cited their own Watergate lessons. ``America
emerged from that national nightmare a much stronger country,''
said James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, echoing the Watergate
era language in arguing Clinton would leave a moral ``cancer'' on
the nation were he to escape unimpeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defenders were criticized as $500-an-hour
``beltway spinmeisters'' by Howard Coble, Republican of North
Carolina who said his head clears when he drives home. ``All of a
sudden I'm aware of the definition of sex,'' he said, mocking some
of the president's defense arguments. ``All of a sudden I know what
`is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day one member referred to as ``the MTV presentation'' for
its reliance on various video and audio excerpts, Democrats opened
with a clip of Peter Rodino Jr., the House Watergate chairman,
stressing that partisanship was vital in any attempt to impeach.
``Listen to the American people,'' Lowell pleaded even as the
inquiry wound down toward a vote expected to fall firmly along
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, a former federal prosecutor with a bare-knuckle
demeanor who likes to stress that he is a registered Democrat,
showed no hesitancy to lay into Clinton as ``a president caught in
his own legacy of lies.'' ``There's no one left to lie to,'' he
exclaimed in accusing the president of lying to family, government
aides, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He charged that Clinton would still be lying if not for the
laboratory tests on Monica Lewinsky's dress, which provided DNA
evidence of a liaison between the president and the White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it ever stop?'' Schippers demanded in dismissing as
distorted the defenses offered by presidential witnesses this week.
``This again proves the arrogance of the White House and its total
disdain of the intellect of the American people,'' he declared
dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   To a denial that the president had committed perjury, Schippers
scoffed, ``Now that's a good one.'' He peppered his presentation
with such comments as ``That, by the way is another lie.'' And he
mocked various instances of the president's claiming vague
recollection: ``This from a man who is renowned for his remarkable
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' performance only reinforced the Democrats' alarm at
the approaching vote. ``I think the American people still don't
believe that we're foolish enough or partisan enough to impeach the
president,'' said Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., sounding shocked as he
sadly predicted that impeachment by the full House seemed more
likely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The committee put in a grueling day, with the 37 members finally
starting their own 10-minute final statements in a grave, almost
drained mood that the ranking Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan,
described as ``staring into the void below'' as the vote looms this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an abstraction until now,'' one of the Democrats,
William Delahunt of Massachusetts, said in an interview as the
impeachment decision approached after a tumultuous, wearying year
of scandal investigations. But he welcomed the vote as a relief of
sorts even as he worried at the enormous stakes and fairly prayed
for the public to show its opposition. ``The vote is necessary for
the public to begin to comprehend the reality, and by Saturday they
will be totally re-engaged in this,'' Delahunt said with an edge of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers bore down with prosecutorial zeal in warning
against weighing the president's strong standing in opinion polls
as a factor in the impeachment decision. He talked to the end of
``the president's lies and obstructions'' and denounced the
``gaggle of witnesses'' presented in his defense. As he finished,
Schippers left no doubt on where he stood on the ``monumental''
question the committee now faced in ``deciding whether William
Jefferson Clinton is fit to remain at the helm of the ship of
state.''

STOCKS FALL SHARPLY AFTER DISAPPOINTING REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell sharply Thursday as investors continued
to react to warnings from major companies that earning and sales
reports would be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest retreat amounted to 167.61 points on the Dow Jones
industrial average. It spared no major index as investors appeared
to seize on a combination of unsettling developments as a reason to
lock in profits from what still shapes up as a fourth straight year
of an exceptional advance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides corporate ``confessions'' or downgrades by analysts
involving the likes of Merck, J.P. Morgan, Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP;
Gamble this week, investors were said to be disturbed about a
Federal Reserve Board survey showing less vigorous retail sales,
and the prospect of an impeachment trial for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed to some extent by success, particularly in the Nasdaq
market that made two record highs this week, investors ``may be
locking in gains before the end of the year,'' suggested Timothy
Morris, the chief domestic strategist at Bessemer Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And while impeachment is still far from topic A among investors,
Morris and others said many people seemed nervous that the
proceedings remained unresolved even though Clinton's removal from
office is widely thought to be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the market's skittishness is the pounding taken
by Merck shares, down 5 11/16 Thursday and 6 3/4 on Wednesday,
after the company projected earnings next year of $4.85 to $4.95 a
share, compared with a Wall Street consensus of $4.97. The shares
closed Thursday at 146\.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bit of an overreaction,'' said Philip Orlando, the
chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday an analyst at Paine Webber downgraded the United
States' second-biggest drug company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, to
neutral from attractive, and the stock slumped 4 5/8, to 123.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's third straight decline, 1.86 percent, meant that the
blue-chip average has retreated 532 points, or 5.68 percent, from
the peak it hit the Monday before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   After Merck, the biggest pressure on the average Thursday was
from IBM, down 4{, to 165; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, off
3\, to 74{, and J.P. Morgan, down 2 13/16, to 101 3/8. Only three
of 30 components _ American Express, Union Carbide and AT&AMP;T _ eked
out gains.
</P>
<P>
   The selling pressure embraced computer, software and even
Internet companies, which had been strong recently. Internet
losses, however, were mostly small, and Ebay, which has been
experiencing some system bugs, stood out with a gain of 6 19/32, to
186 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Nasdaq market fell 34.46 points, or 1.68 percent,
to 2,015.96, while the Russell 2000, which is made up of
small-capitalization stocks, fell 1.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, widely used as a
benchmark by professional managers, fell 18.47, to 1,165.02. This
decline, 1.56 percent, left the broad index ahead for 1998 by a
little more than 20 percent, compared with 11.8 percent for the Dow
industrials and 28.4 percent for Nasdaq. The Russell 2000, by
contrast, was down 9.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downdraft, two initial offerings did well. Infinity
Broadcasting climbed to 23 1/16 from 20{, while Abovenet surged to
16} from 13.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues swamped
advancing ones 2,118 to 943, while new lows edged new highs 75 to
72. Volume was a moderate 760.95 million shares.

   WASHINGTON _ Despite increasing pressure on Rep. Bob Livingston,
the incoming speaker of the House, to indicate whether he would
allow a censure vote against President Clinton on the House floor,
he maintained his public distance on the topic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every intention of bringing the product of the
Judiciary Committee to the floor and making sure that we get a vote
on it,'' he said when asked if he would allow a censure vote. He
spoke briefly to reporters outside the Capitol Hill Club, where he
addressed the National Jewish Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed censure was constitutional, he said:
``That's not for me to determine. That's for the parliamentarians
and the historians to determine. It's an issue that frankly I don't
want to prejudge until I see exactly what the Judiciary Committee
reports out.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who is to be sworn in as speaker Jan. 6., has
maintained a public neutrality toward the impeachment process,
although, as he told the coalition Thursday, he wants it to be over
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have anything to say about it, by the end of this year
the House of Representatives won't have anything to do with it
anymore,'' he said. ``It will be over with.'' But he allowed that
the Senate could well be dealing with the matter, if the House
approves articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As he alluded to the Republican agenda, Livingston told the
group: ``Yes, we have endured six years of the Clinton presidency;
we've got two more years.'' Then, apparently realizing that he
sounded as if he expected Clinton to remain in office, he added
offhandedly: ``At most.'' &QL;

 Landing a Job in France  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'd like to move to France but don't know how to find
work there. I have an associate's degree in landscape horticulture
but am willing to take any kind of job. Unfortunately, I don't
speak French. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You've got as steep an uphill climb ahead of you as if
you were you were standing at the foot of les Alpes.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the eternal Catch-22 of work permits: As in many
countries, foreigners can't legally get work in France unless they
have work permits. But the government won't issue a work permit
unless you already have a job offer in hand.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because French unemployment is over 10 percent,
you'll be competing with a lot of local people for work.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the French are notoriously unforgiving of visitors
who don't speak their language.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other place in Europe, France will be difficult
to find work if you don't speak the language _ and speak the
language well,'' said Cheryl Matherly, co-author with Robert
Sanborn of ``How to Get a Job in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Matherly suggests lowering your sights and aiming for temporary
work such as seasonal farm labor.
</P>
<P>
   Joining a grape-harvest crew, for instance, would let you get a
feel for French culture, start learning the language and perhaps
use your horticultural skills to make connections toward a
permanent job.
</P>
<P>
   Jeunesse at Reconstruction, a group that recruits grape pickers
for French vineyards, can be reached by telephone at
33-1-47-70-15-88. Nature et Progres, which provides lists of French
organic farmers seeking temporary help, can be reached by writing 3
Place Pasteur, 84000 Avignon, France.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas: Check with the trade association for your
profession to see if there's a similar group in France with leads
on horticultural jobs or internships. Pick the brains of anyone you
know with friends in France.
</P>
<P>
   And sign up for classes at a French cultural center like the
Alliance Francaise in San Francisco _ both to start learning French
and to meet other people with an interest or contacts in France.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Fired Without Notice
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm an independent contractor who was fired by phone call
from my position. However, my contract had said that I would be
given five days' written notice before termination. Can I file an
unpaid-wages claim for those five days of pay?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't file an unpaid-wages claim because you weren't an
employee: You were a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But you can pursue your case another way _ by filing a
breach-of-contract suit in small-claims court.
</P>
<P>
   In California, small-claims courts handle disputes of $5,000 or
less. You don't need a lawyer to file a claim. And the small-claims
court in your county can give you instructions about how to file.
</P>
<P>
   Your case sounds straightforward enough that merely filing a
claim may be enough to make the company pay whatever it owes you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the company is served with a complaint, they will pay up
if they have any brains,'' predicted Stephen Fishman, a Berkeley
attorney and author of ``Wage Slave No More! Law &AMP; Taxes for the
Self-Employed.''
</P>
<P>
   Contractor Factors
</P>
<P>
   Q: I used to work as the word processing coordinator for an
appraisal firm. I was considered an independent contractor and had
a contract that said either party would give 10 days' written
notice before terminating the relationship. One day, I called in
and said I'd be taking the day off because it was a slow day and
that my assistant could handle things. The following day, I was
fired for taking that time off. Was this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: This situation is more complicated than the previous one
because it raises two separate questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Did the company violate its contract with you by firing you
without 10 days' notice?
</P>
<P>
   _ Were you incorrectly classified as an independent contractor
to begin with?
</P>
<P>
   On the first question, it does sound like the company violated
your contract by denying you 10 days' notice. And like the
contractor in the previous item, you could pursue that issue in
small-claims court.
</P>
<P>
   But that still leaves the interesting question of whether you
may have been illegally misclassified as a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service looks at a number of different
things to determine whether someone is legally an employee or a
contractor. One of the main things the IRS considers is whether you
direct and control your work or whether the company does.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hiring firm normally does not have the right to control the
way an IC (independent contractor) performs agreed-upon services,''
Fishman said. ``Its control is limited to accepting or rejecting
the final results.''
</P>
<P>
   In your case, the company's decision to fire you for missing a
day of work seems like the way an employee would be treated, not a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   That alone wouldn't necessarily jeopardize the company's right
to consider you a contractor. But it's enough of a red flag that
you should consult with a lawyer who is familiar with
employee/contractor issues.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out you were misclassified, the IRS would refund
half of the Social Security taxes you paid. You also might qualify
retroactively for employee benefits. And you might be owed a heap
of back wages if you worked overtime but were never paid
time-and-a-half for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ The Central Council of the PLO ratified
amendments to the group's charter on Thursday, setting the stage
for a broader meeting with President Clinton next week that is to
affirm that articles calling for the destruction of Israel have
been revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Thursday
that the real test would come at that meeting on Monday, when
members of the PLO's largest decision-making body, the Palestine
National Council, and other officials are to endorse the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted in 1964 as the founding document of the PLO, the charter
has been a focus of dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.
Its amendment was the subject of a separate section of the
Israeli-Palestinian accord, known as the Wye Memorandum, signed in
Washington on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say that the charter's anti-Israeli clauses
were annulled by a vote of the Palestine National Council on April
24, 1996, which was welcomed then by both the Israeli and U.S.
governments. The current Israeli government says that vote was
inadequate, because it failed to specify which particular articles
were revoked and did not adopt an amended charter.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is demanding a vote on Monday, but Palestinian
officials assert that no actual vote is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye accord makes no explicit mention of a vote, saying only
that National Council members and other Palestinian officials will
be invited to a meeting addressed by Clinton to ``reaffirm their
support'' for decisions by smaller PLO bodies _ the Executive
Committee last month and the Central Council on Thursday _ to
ratify amendments to the charter.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's meeting, the PLO Central Council voted, 81-7 with
7 abstentions, to approve changes in the charter specified in a
letter sent by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to Clinton
last January. Factions opposed to the accords with Israel boycotted
the meeting of the 124-member council, which is an intermediate
body in size and importance in the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PLO Central Council decided to ratify the letter of
President Yasser Arafat which was sent to President Bill Clinton on
Jan. 22, 1998, concerning the articles which were canceled or
amended by the Palestine National Council,'' said a statement from
WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning against a ``farce'' at the meeting with Clinton on
Monday, Netanyahu hinted that a Palestinian failure to hold a vote
on the charter would halt Israeli compliance with the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This coming Monday is a very important test day in the meeting
of the Palestine National Council,'' Netanyahu said. ``Will there,
or will there not be a vote to change the charter? If there will
not, the result is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat retorted: ``It is not their business. We are following
our rules and regulations, and we are following what has been
accepted in our committees, in our councils, in our meetings, and
not from outside orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Abdel Rahman, general-secretary of the Palestinian
Cabinet, said during a break in Thursday's meeting: ``We are not
here to answer Israeli blackmailing of the PLO and the Palestinian
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Salim Zaanoun, the speaker of the National Council, was
decidedly vague when asked on Thursday whether there would be a
vote to amend the charter on Monday. ``I can't say,'' he said.
``This matter will be decided later, the way and manner.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Monday's meeting to be attended by Clinton, Zaanoun added,
``there will be a kind of expression of agreement on what was
decided by the Central Council.'' A speech by Arafat will ``convey
to President Clinton and the whole world that all Palestinian
institutions have agreed on the issue of the amendment, as detailed
in the letter sent to President Clinton in which it was specified
precisely which articles, one by one, were amended and canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   The articles in question deny Israel's right to exist and call
for armed resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Article 9 asserts that ``armed struggle is the only way to
liberate Palestine, and is therefore a strategy and not tactics.''
Article 15 says it is ``a national duty to repulse the Zionist
imperialist invasion from the great Arab homeland and to purge the
Zionist presence from Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 19 says: ``The partitioning of Palestine in 1947 and the
establishment of Israel are fundamentally null and void, whatever
time has elapsed.'' Article 22 asserts that ``the liberation of
Palestine will liquidate the Zionist and imperialist presence and
bring about the stabilization of peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials argue that the PLO's recognition of Israel
and the 1993 Oslo accords have rendered the PLO charter irrelevant,
turning it into an anachronistic remnant of a different era.
Israel's repeated insistence on repealing the charter is a pretext
for avoiding its own commitments, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is looking for reasons not to implement its
commitments.'' said Zaanoun. ``We are implementing our commitments
fully, to the letter.''

 &HT;    Carson sells Cutex, gets help with debt
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carson Inc. has sold its Cutex nail care business for $30
million as part of its strategy to focus on its core ethnic
products business.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second major transaction this week for the
Savannah-based company, which has struggled to pay a $50 million
note to Ivax Corp. after Ivax sold its Johnson Products hair care
line to Carson in July.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Carson received an $83 million loan to help
pay the debt, and indications are the loan came from billionaire
George Soros' Quantum Fund. Neither Quantum, one of the world's
largest hedge funds, nor Carson would comment on the source of the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to have been able to close on the
refinancing of our debt and divest ourselves of Cutex,'' said
Carson Chairman Leroy Keith. ``With those two things we have
accomplished a lot, and it allows us to put our focus and attention
on growing the value of our overall business.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beck, an analyst with Cromwell, Miller &AMP; Greer in New
York, said the loan deal ``has to be constructive. This is a
tremendous opportunity to recapture some of the lost ground in the
marketplace. Really, that is the critical focus of management now
that they have cured some of their balance sheet problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The nail care business was sold to Cutex Co., a new entity
formed by San Francisco-based investment firm the Shansby Group.
Carson, however, can continue to sell Cutex nail polish and
treatment through a licensing agreement with Shansby.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expressed concern that Carson, which makes such
flagship brands as Dark &AMP; Lovely, Magic Shave and Excelle, would
not be able to repay the debt to Ivax.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Merrill Lynch downgraded Carson's stock to
``neutral'' from ``buy.'' The stock, which closed at $3.31 1/4
Thursday, is down from its 52-week high of $10.75 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the company had planned to pay Ivax with proceeds
from a partial equity sale of its South African operations and the
sale of its Cutex and Dermablend lines. But that plan did not
materialize as quickly as the company had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 18 months, Carson has experienced highs and lows.
It acquired several strong brands, including Cutex and Johnson
Products, and expanded its international operations.
</P>
<P>
   But it also was saddled with more debt and suffered from a
softening in its domestic business. Carson also recently underwent
a management realignment, which included the removal of Joyce Roche
as president, a title assumed by Chief Executive Officer Gregory
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the $83 million loan has been used to pay off the note
to Ivax, and the rest will be used for general purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already using $8 million from the Cutex sale to
begin repaying some of the $83 million loan. Carson Chief Financial
Officer Robert Pierce said the rest of the proceeds from the sale
will be applied to the remainder of the loan. Pierce said the
company was no longer ``aggressively'' trying to sell the
Dermablend line, ``at least for the time being.

 &HT;    Will Parcells fall to SI-cover jinx?
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the desk in Bill Parcells' second-floor office at
Weeb Ewbank Hall are a half-dozen elephant figurines, all with
their tusks and trunks pointed toward the ceiling for good fortune.
A ceramic four-leaf clover serves as a paper weight.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the New York Jets coach fretting as his team prepares
for its Sunday night showdown with AFC East co-leader Miami?
Because his face graces the cover of this week's Sports
Illustrated. While Parcells attempts to debunk talk about his
superstitious nature, he's aware of the alleged jinx that
accompanies the SI-cover-boy status. In fact, Parcells claimed
earlier this week that he had a guarantee from the editors that his
picture would not be out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my gosh, why don't you just cover him in salt or put some
black cats and ladders out there on the way to the practice
field?'' backup guard Alex Bernstein asked when told of the cover
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   His protests aside, Parcells' superstitions are well-documented.
Earlier this season he booked dental appointments three consecutive
Tuesday mornings, each preceding a Jets victory. The fourth week,
he went back again, even though he didn't need any more work. When
his team lost to the Colts, the dental streak ended with the
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   In the week's marquee matchup _ Parcells versus Jimmy Johnson in
``The Tuna and the Kingfish'' _ the high-octane New York offense
will need both skill and luck against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami defense, arguably the quickest in the NFL, has sparked
a 6-0 home record while surrendering a paltry 6.7 points per game.
In last week's victory against Oakland, the defense had eight sacks
and six interceptions, two returned for scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of a pressure scheme and having incredibly
quick personnel, they are the best we'll see all year,''Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the ``bests'' for this weekend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upset opportunity: Without injured quarterback Mark Brunell,
the Jacksonville Jaguars could have some problems with a Tennessee
team still in the playoff race. The best bet of the weekend,
though, could be Monday night's Detroit-San Francisco matchup. If
the Lions' Barry Sanders can stop giggling at the 49ers' depleted
defensive line, he might run for more than 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Individual matchup: After an early-season slump, Jets center
Kevin Mawae has played at a Pro Bowl level. He'll need to maintain
that excellence against Miami middle linebacker Zach Thomas, who
will be keying on tailback Curtis Martin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy play: The beleaguered Bad News Bears can't stop the
run, and with all the injuries to wide receivers, Green Bay
quarterback Brett Favre will rely more on the running game. Look
for Packers tailback Darick Holmes to post big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grudge match: There is mutual respect between Parcells and
Johnson, but that doesn't mean they like each other. The New York
Daily News conducted a poll of NFL personnel directors and coaches
last week and asked this question: With one game to win, would you
want Parcells or Johnson as your coach? Parcells won in a
landslide, 14-7. The real-life battle of wits will be even more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Division game: Because of Atlanta's seven-game winning streak,
the rivalry with New Orleans has waned a bit in recent years. It
will be restoked, however, on Sunday.

   WASHINGTON _ As the formal debate on impeachment began Thursday
night, the House Judiciary Committee sounded as if this were more a
routine political dispute than a grave constitutional matter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the second-ranking
Republican on the committee, declared in the first of the 10-minute
opening statements that President Clinton's values were
``completely opposite to the values parents want to teach their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican who spoke early, Rep. George Gekas of
Pennsylvania, declared, ``Perjury, perjury, falsehood under oath.
We can't escape it.''

   On the Democratic side, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the only
member of the committee who sat on the panel that recommended
impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, accused the
Republicans of ``trying to overturn the results of two national
elections'' and of ``attempting a legislative takeover of the
executive branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the case at this point of the 1974 debate, there was
little sense Thursday night that the lawmakers had anguished over
the votes they were about to cast. Presumably that is because all
38 members of the Judiciary Committee had long ago made up their
minds _ the Republicans in favor of impeaching Clinton and the
Democrats against it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Rep. William Cohen of Maine, one of the Republicans who
broke with his party to support impeachment, spoke of his
``anxiety,'' his ``apprehension'' and his ``sense of law.''
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the most memorable speeches in Congress in the
last quarter century, Rep. Barbara Jordan, then a freshman Democrat
from Texas, spoke of ``the solemnness that I feel right now'' and
added: ``My faith in the Constitution is whole. It is complete. It
is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator
to the dimunition, the subversion, the destruction of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, few talked of the Constitution and even fewer
seemed to have any doubts about where they stood.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts articulated the essential
Democratic point. ``The president had a private consensual sexual
affair and lied about it,'' he declared. ``The fact is, that's all
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did not disagree. They just said that perjury, about
sex as well as anything else, was a serious crime that justified
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do otherwise,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., ``would
undermine the rule of law and undermine our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between Thursday night's debate and the one
of July 24 and 25, 1974, is that this time the opponents of
impeachment acknowledged the president's wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the president lied,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., was especially harsh in his
treatment of the president. ``There something
Alice-in-Wonderland-like,'' he said, ``watching someone so smart
and so skilled, so admired by the American people for his intellect
and his talents, digging himself deeper and deeper and deeper into
a rabbit hole, and us along with him, and allowing him to escape
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This troubles me greatly, and I know it motivates many of the
calls for impeachment. People do have a right to ask, `What will
America's children believe about lying, about reverence for the
law, about lying under oath?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's mistakes, his Democratic critics said, simply did not
rise to the level of impeachable offenses. ``Impeachment must not
be pursued if the body politic opposes impeachment,'' Berman
declared.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nixon debate, few of the president's supporters made such
concessions of error. For example, Trent Lott of Mississippi, then
a first-term congressman from Mississippi and now the Senate
Republican leader, said of Nixon: ``The president didn't
participate in the Watergate cover-up. The contempt of Congress
charge is so ludicrous that it deserves no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker who did address the historical and Constitutional
importance was Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic senator-elect
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes to impeach, he said, ``We will be
substantially lowering the bar for removal of a sitting
president.'' That, he continued, would encourage future Congresses
to investigate and try to impeach presidents on trivial charges.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer read his speech, looking through glasses. Many, on the
other hand, spoke extemporaneously.
</P>
<P>
   One who spoke without even notes was Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,
and he was one of the toughest in his ridicule of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I return to my district,'' Coble said, ``I sometimes
motor south on Highway 29 through the fox and the wine country of
Virginia. And as I approach the North Carolina boundary line, my
mind begins to clear, as I am at that point removed from the
Beltway spin.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``All of sudden I am aware of the definition of
`sex.' All of a sudden I know the meaning of `alone.' I know what
`is' is, as do the majority of my constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was also challenged by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. The
president should be impeached, he said, because of his uniquely
high office and his ``repeated and deliberate pattern of lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country will endure,'' Smith added, ``because the
Constitution works and has for 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats argued that the solution was for Congress to pass
a resolution censuring the president. That, said Rep. Rick Boucher,
D-Va., would ``place the nation, the Congress and the president on
the path to restoration of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said, ``The Constitution does
not authorize a censure of a president of the United States who has
committed high crimes and misdemeanors.''

U.N. GIVES RIGHTS AWARDS TO GRASS-ROOTS ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Over the last quarter-century, the United
Nations has given its highest award for human rights work to the
greatest names and institutions that shaped the movement. Eleanor
Roosevelt, who steered the United Nations into human rights, won
one of the first awards, posthumously, in 1968. Other towering
names and institutions followed. Among them were the International
Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International and the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., in 1978, and Nelson Mandela in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, on the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the men and women who stepped up to
receive their awards from Secretary-General Kofi Annan were a very
different group.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one _ former President Jimmy Carter, who did not
attend because he has been involved in monitoring the presidential
election in Venezuela _ this year's winners are internationally
unknown people who have learned to wage often lonely battles for
the rights of ordinary people at the grass roots. ``This is a sea
change for the U.N.,'' said Felice Gaer, director of the Jacob
Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Measured in thousands of small organizations _ local women's
groups, student-led voting drives, campaigns against child labor or
for better environmental protection of villages and neighborhoods
around the world _ the human rights movement has changed profoundly
in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions and international covenants against a range of
abuses are in place and being tested. The laptop, the Internet and
the fax machine have created once-unthinkable networks for sharing
strategies, sources of help and the power of example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged by this high office acknowledging what we
are doing,'' said Angelina Acheng Atyam of Uganda, a nurse-midwife
in a local clinic who received one of this year's awards for
fighting to keep children out of war. ``It gives us strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Atyam was recognized for trying to stop the abduction,
forced recruitment and sexual abuse of African children by a group
called the Lord's Resistance Army and other forces in a region
engulfed by guerrilla wars.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thousands missing in northern Uganda is her daughter,
Charlotte, who was seized two years ago at 14. ``I found myself in
the middle of it,'' Ms. Atyam said in an interview Wednesday,
explaining how she came to be among a few who spoke up for the
rights of thousands of Ugandan families. ``We made up our minds to
rise up. When we found that many other parents were scared of
repercussions, we decided to shout for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners this year were Sunila Abeyesekera of Sri Lanka,
who has worked to safeguard democracy and women's rights in the
face of civil war; Jose Gregori of Brazil, a former student
activist against the military who now, under a democratic
government, heads the National Secretariat for Human Rights, and
Anna Sabatova of the Czech Republic, who was once sent to jail for
urging people to vote and later became a founder of Charter 77, an
action organization that led a democratic resistance to Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sabatova took the opportunity at a news conference Thursday
to keep her gadfly reputation alive. She criticized the present
Czech Republic government under President Vaclav Havel for what she
sees as inattention to minority rights, police behavior and prison
conditions.

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Hercegovina _ Three years after the Dayton
Peace Accords ended the ethnic war here, a lot of progress has been
made in the reconstruction of Bosnia. Bridges and roads have been
rebuilt, schools reopened, electric lines re-connected. Food
shortages are a thing of the past, as is the systematic violence of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the peace here remains tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, and the result, is 1.1 million Bosnian refugees who
haven't gone home yet, people like Jusif Mujic and Ilic Marko.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton Peace Accords, signed in Paris three years ago
Monday(Dec. 14), divided Bosnia into two states: the Serb Republic,
and the Muslim/Croat Federation. The two states are largely
autonomous, each with the right to elect its own president and
parliament, maintain its own military and even negotiate agreements
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Mujic, a Muslim schoolteacher, fled his home at the beginning of
the war when Serbian special forces stormed into his hometown. Now
he lives in the Federation in an apartment owned by Serbs who fled
that area. The apartment he owns, now in the Serb Republic, is
being occupied by Serbs who fled fighting somewhere else in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Marko's case is similar. A retired engineer and a Serb, he fled
his home when his town was taken by Muslim forces. He's living in a
Muslim's home in the Serb Republic while the house he owns is being
occupied by a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Peace Accords reached at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, accomplished the most important goal,
ending the war and the ethnic cleansing that so horrified the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been unable to undo the resulting damage. Bosnia is
still sharply divided along ethnic lines. And while enabling people
to go home wasn't the first goal of the peace plan, it remains the
one that cannot be achieved. That failure has confounded all other
attempts to rebuild Bosnia into a country that doesn't need
international peacekeepers to prevent it from tumbling back into
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a quantum leap forward in the coming year,'' said
Carlos Westendorp, Bosnia's international supervisor. ``This
country is not going to be reconstructed unless there is a degree
of multi-ethnicity, unless people are living together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Accords give Westendorp extraordinary powers over
Bosnia. He can impose legislation, suspend laws passed by Bosnian
lawmakers and even remove officials from office. But that power
does not reach into the hearts of people, and he is frustrated by
his inability so far to solve the critical problem at the core of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we fail, then I am very pessimistic about Bosnia,''
Westendorp said. ``Last year, we had only 30,000 returns. With
every year that passes, the number reduces by half. People get used
to living where they are. In a way, it's now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Accords also included guarantees that refugees would
be allowed to go home. But it didn't anticipate that some would
refuse, like a tragic game of musical chairs in which some of the
players refuse to get up when the music starts.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Bosnia began after Communist Yugoslavia fell apart in
1991. While the other republics of Yugoslavia had ethnic majorities
that controlled politics, Bosnia's society was a mixture of Croats,
Muslims and Serbs. The three groups fought each other, with the
Croats and Serbs getting help from neighboring Croatia and Serbia,
for 44 months. At the end of the war, there were almost no
multi-ethnic communities left.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, less than 300,000 Bosnians have gone home and of
those, only about 55,000 went to areas where they were ethnic
minorities. Another 800,000 refugees are still scattered around
Bosnia, most of them occupying homes of other refugees. And more
than 300,000 are living in other countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of waiting to go home, Mujic and Marko have
done exactly what Westendorp feared they and others like them would
do. They've given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was sure I'd go home after the war ended,'' Mujic
said. ``But I still don't feel safe here. And the people in my
apartment, they're just not leaving. They don't want to go home.
They like my apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men met on the street in Brcko, in northern Bosnia, one
morning this fall. Over a beer in a small cafe, the Serb and the
Muslim, perfect strangers until that morning, discussed exchanging
the apartments they owned before the war because they had given up
on ever returning to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problem with each other, Serbs, Muslims,
Croats, as people, individuals,'' Marko said. ``But so much has
happened. At some point, you just have to forget about life ever
being the way it was before the war and make a new life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended, politics here have been dominated by ethnic
nationalists who have done little to help the country recover. The
economy, social services, taxes, none of those are issues in
election campaigns here. The only issue is the degree of
nationalism of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Republic has usually chosen the most fervent
nationalists. NATO bombed the Serbs here in order to bring them to
the negotiating table and end the war. Many feel like the peace
that was negotiated left them as second-class citizens of a nation
they fought a war against.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Serb Republic elected a hard-line,
anti-Western, anti-Dayton president.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Poplasen, a former political science professor and
military leader during the war, is cagey with the media. He has to
walk a thin line, satisfying the people who voted for him while
placating the international community. He knows Westendorp can
remove him from office if he says too much.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen declines to say what he thinks the future holds for
Bosnia or for the Serb Republic, saying only that he hopes the
people will decide their own future. If a referendum were held to
decide whether the Serb Republic should be allowed to break away
from Bosnia, he would vote for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would try to vote several times,'' he said, laughing.
Then he got serious. ``But that would be possible only if the
Muslims and the Croats agreed. Otherwise it would lead to violence.
I'm not inclined to resolve political problems with violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she didn't vote for him, Natasha Predojovic, a
20-year-old Serb interpreter working for the international
community in the Serb Republic, agrees with Poplasen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself, my friends, my family, we didn't want to be part of
Bosnia. We didn't vote for that,'' she said. ``It was imposed on
us. I don't have any feelings for my country. I would never cry at
the national anthem. You might as well tell me I'm Romanian or
Bulgarian.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the issue of refugees going home, she's not sure it will
ever be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can't live together anymore, but at least we can be
good neighbors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Republic and the Federation exchange very few refugees
each month. But even within the Federation, Bosnians are having
trouble being good neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there have been 70 violent incidents, mostly arsons
but also two murders, prompted by Muslims trying to return to Croat
neighborhoods in the Mostar area. Though the Croats and the Muslims
formed an alliance against the Serbs towards the end of the war,
and though they agreed to live in the same state when Dayton was
signed, they haven't been able to reconcile their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia, says reasonable
Bosnian citizens of all three nationalities will never be able to
reconcile their difference with the extreme nationalists among the
Serbs and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say why can't we agree, the answer is, why didn't
you agree with Hitler,'' he said. ``It was impossible. The man
wanted a racially pure land.''
</P>
<P>
   Silajdzic, a Muslim, believes justice is the only thing that can
guarantee peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Bosnia can have justice, he said, is for all the
refugees to return to their homes. Thats the only thing that would
undo the results of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have territory under Serb control in which close to one
million non-Serbs lived,'' he said. ``They are not there now. So
who lost? We all lost by allowing that to happen. The project (of
ethnic cleansing) still lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silajdzic resorts to the same answers Poplasen does when
talking about refugees who want to return to his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those now in Sarajevo were expelled from their homes,'' he
said. ``They came here because this was the only safe point. What
should we do with them? Expel them again?''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of the continuing divisions in Bosnia, and the
Bosnian government's inability to overcome them, sometimes borders
on the absurd. To call Bosnia from another country, the caller must
first determine which part of Bosnia he's calling. There are three
phone systems here, a Croat system, a Serb system and a Muslim
system, each with a different country code. An operator on the Serb
system, asked recently how to make a call to a phone on the Croat
system, said it simply couldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Westendorp ordered the government to fix the phone
system. He has also ordered the issuance of passports, a common
currency and car license plates that didn't reveal the driver's
ethnicity. And when it came to something that might seem simple,
like adopting a national anthem, his office took over the job after
the Bosnian government failed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's economy is as unreconstructed as its government.
Unemployment hovers around 40 percent, higher in some regions.
Westendorp says the economy is growing at about 35 percent a year,
but he qualifies that by pointing out that there was no economy
here when the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war interrupted a normal transition from communism and a
lack of a market towards democracy and a free-market economy,'' he
said. ``We've had to start almost from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marinko Misic's daughter and son-in-law, the economy is the
reason they won't come home. Even though they are Croats and
welcome in their hometown of Sarajevo, seven months ago they moved
from Germany, where they spent the war, to Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a house here, but no job. That's why they didn't
come back,'' he said. ``The international community, they give
someone a new roof. But what can that man do now that he has a new
roof? He doesn't have a job. We need jobs before we can be a
country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Westendorp knows the governments of the world are beginning to
wonder how much more they'll have to spend making Bosnia into a
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia is dependent on the international community, of course,
right now,'' he said. ``This dependency syndrome must
little-by-little disappear. We must do things here and then say to
them, 'OK, this is your responsibility. We are not going to support
you forever.' But more risky and more expensive would be to
withdraw the troops.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks to the small steps that have been taken here as proof
that international efforts are working, however slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Lipovac is one of those small steps. The tiny village was on the
frontlines during the war and was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But Lipovac is going to be rebuilt because the 31 families who
used to live there, some of them Serb, some Muslim and some Croat,
have decided they can live together again.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, humanitarian organizations, eager to
encourage multi-ethnicity, will have rebuilt almost all the houses
in the village. It may be the first truly multi-ethnic village in
all of post-war Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Lipovac offers hope that lasting peace may be
attainable, it shows why the wounds of war are too deep to be
healed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Risto Djokic, a Serb from Lipovac, went back to
see his farm after the war, he ran into one of his old neighbors, a
Croat man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, 'Screw Alija, screw Tudjman, screw Milosevic,
screw Karadzic. They caused all this.''' Djokic related. His
neighbor was referring to the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and
Serbia and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'Alija and Tudjman and Milosevic and Karadzic,
they didn't do this to my house. They weren't here with the
dynamite. My neighbors did this.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of abortion providers continues to decline, making
the procedure less accessible to many rural women, according to an
Alan Guttmacher Institute report being released today.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion intimidation has contributed to the 14 percent
national decline in providers from 1992 through 1996, said Stanley
Henshaw, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Texas reported an even steeper 19 percent drop, from 79 to 64
providers, during the same period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now actual fear among abortion providers,'' said
Henshaw, deputy director for the New York City-based nonprofit
institute, which describes itself as pro-choice. ``It's not worth
the harassment or inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with the Rev. Flip Benham, national director of
Dallas-based Operation Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people that are telling the truth are out front and
that's bothering (doctors), then maybe they should stop doing it,''
Benham said.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ the 12th analysis by the institute since the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision _ also found that the number of Texas
abortions declined 6 percent from 1992 through 1996 compared with
11 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Another abortion analysis, published last week by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the number of
abortions rose slightly from 1995 to 1996, after falling steadily
every year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas women travel from as far away as Wichita Falls and
San Angelo to reach the Fort Worth clinic operated by Planned
Parenthood of North Texas, executive director Michael Comini said.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin, executive director of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said she worries most about poor
women in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman with four children on an hourly wage who is not paid
for time off, who already can't afford the procedure, you are
doubling the cost of the procedure for her,'' McLaughlin said.
``Sometimes it really does make it impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician practices and hospitals, which perform 9 percent of
the nation's abortions, are most likely to have eliminated
services, Henshaw said. Young doctors are less likely to be taught
the procedure in residency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors may contribute to the declining abortion
rate, including better contraception use in the wake of AIDS and
the decreased stigma of teenage motherhood, Henshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   As with slavery, an emotional shift will occur before the laws
can change, Benham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening here in this country is heart by heart, the
truth is getting out and the battle is being won in the streets,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 86 percent of U.S. counties and one-third of the cities
had no identified abortion provider, according to the institute's
report. That same year, the number of pregnancies ending in
abortion _ 26 percent _ reached its lowest rate in two decades, the
report said.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Dec. 11:
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in some days, the main action in the
impeachment crisis seemed to be taking place outside the House
Judiciary Committee. Given Rep. Henry Hyde's determination to pass
an impeachment resolution on a party-line vote, this is a positive
development. Public opinion, constitutional wisdom and the national
interest all demand agreement between Congress and President
Clinton on a censure that would sternly condemn the president, but
leave him in office.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes bargaining seems to be moving at the pace
of a bug swimming across a saucer of molasses. But at least there
is movement, because the White House is scared now. Whatever they
say in public, no smart lawyer would advise Clinton to go on trial
in the Senate on the initial count of grand-jury perjury. So
Thursday the White House announced that Clinton would, in effect,
welcome a censure deal. It is directly lobbying moderate House
Republicans and using intermediaries to contact other influential
Republicans. The time has come, in fact, for party figures like
former Sen. Bob Dole to follow the example of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
in urging a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, censure advocates should avoid any deal that lets the
White House get away with the semantic game insisted upon by
Clinton's lawyers. They want to substitute the word ``misled'' for
``lied.'' Average citizens who receive merciful treatment at the
bar of justice do not get to dress up their failures with fancy
language, and neither should Clinton. The president knowingly lied
under oath, and that needs to be written into the history of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the Judiciary Committee heard two presentations of
widely divergent quality. The committee's Republican counsel, David
Schippers, used almost three hours for a needlessly sarcastic
reading of the public record. The Democratic counsel, Abbe Lowell,
made a detailed and impressive argument that the House should not
cast a ``rubber stamp'' vote to impeach in the belief that the
Senate would acquit the president. That would sacrifice a ``double
protection that the Founders intended'' to write into the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these events suggest a penetration of the veil
of unreality that has surrounded the impeachment proceedings. If
Clinton and opinion leaders in both parties shake off their
lethargy, the likely passage of an impeachment resolution by the
Judiciary Committee on Saturday need not determine the outcome in
the full House. When he returns from Israel next week Clinton may
have the opportunity to seal a censure bargain with an honest and
full confession to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and moderate Republicans should not let this
serial evader use a squishy word for his lies. For while the
Constitution requires prolonging Clinton in office, Congress does
not have to hedge its demands for contrition that is full, candid
and, at long last, not misleading.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. said Thursday that it had agreed to buy Prudential
Health Care from Prudential Life Insurance Co. for $1 billion,
creating the United States' biggest managed-care company with 22.4
million customers, including 18.4 million in health-maintenance
organizations and other managed-health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, a hard-driving health insurer known for
tight-fisted relations with doctors, would swallow Prudential, a
household name for generations. Prudential Health Care nurtured a
reputation for reliability and caring but never learned how to make
money in a tough new world of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which must be approved by federal and state
regulators, would increase Aetna's ability to negotiate on fees and
working rules with doctors and hospitals and eventually to raise
premiums for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, there were four national health-care insurance
carriers; now there are three,'' including Kaiser Permanente and
United Healthcare, said John Erb, a consultant with the Arthur J.
Gallagher consulting firm. ``I wouldn't be surprised if there are
only two by this time next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and Prudential officials said that consumers, including
500,000 Prudential members in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Connecticut, would not immediately notice any change. They said
many doctors were already in both companies' networks and that
health-plan rules would not change much over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors expressed concern on Thursday. Aetna is largely
viewed as one of the most stringent managed-care companies, pushing
hard for cost reductions, disputing claims and questioning
out-of-network services.
</P>
<P>
   And some doctors might have to take patients in plans that
reimburse treatment costs at lower rates than their other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Huber, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna, said
the company would ``absolutely'' continue a policy of requiring
doctors to take part in all Aetna health plans or none. Doctors say
the all-or-nothing choice sometimes forces them to drop all Aetna
plans, disrupting care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of medical societies in a dozen states discussed the
issue this week at a meeting of the American Medical Association in
Honolulu. Louis Goodman, executive director of the Texas Medical
Association, said the state groups would urge state officials to
pressure Aetna to change the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Aetna-Prudential deal, Thomas Reardon,
president-elect of the AMA, said that doctors were concerned about
``the increasing consolidation and integration, which results in
greater and greater market power for these managed-care
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give Aetna more negotiating weight. It would have
about 30 percent of the managed-care business in New Jersey and
Texas and would also be one of the three largest managed-care
companies in seven other states _ New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Ohio. It would surpass Kaiser
Permanente of California, which has 8.5 million members, as the
nation's biggest managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., said its earnings would rise
immediately after completion of the deal, which is half in cash and
half in debt, in late spring or early summer next year.
</P>
<P>
   It said the merged company would save $130 million to $150
million a year, including savings by eliminating 1,000 to 2,000
jobs over the next two years. Prudential Health Care has 16,000
employees, including 1,000 at its headquarters in Roseland, N.J.
Aetna has 32,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second big merger this year for Aetna, which is
still in the throes of integrating NYLCare, a health-care business
it bought from New York Life Insurance Co. in March for $1.05
billion. With NYLCare, Aetna is the fourth-largest managed-care
company and Prudential is fifth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Consultants and analysts said the deal posed serious financial
risks for Aetna, which will face the costs and uncertainties of
running multiple information systems, especially as companies face
the worrisome challenge of computer changeover problems in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The big danger for Aetna would be to misjudge its medical costs
and fall behind in paying doctors and hospitals, a sequence that
has caused deep trouble for Oxford Health Plans and other
managed-care companies, including Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong long-term concern that there won't be
as good operating control and financial information as if the
systems were fully integrated,'' said Mimi Willard, a Wall Street
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   But Huber said Prudential had ``made an offer we can't refuse.''
The price, calculated as less than $200 for each managed-care
member, compared with $600 a member that Aetna paid for NYLCare.
And Prudential agreed to certain financial guarantees that would
repay Aetna if the Prudential contracts made less money than
projected in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steven Shulman, president of Prudential Health Care,
increased sales drastically and cut operating losses in half, to
about $100 million this year, the asking price for the health-care
unit dropped at least $500 million in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Life, which plans to change to a shareholder-owned
company from a mutual company owned by policyholders, had long been
eager to sell the health-care unit, which has had operating losses
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna had said no before, but this time, ``they wanted very
badly to do a quick transaction,'' Huber said. The health-care unit
was ``an albatross, and they had to rid themselves of it,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ryan, chairman and chief executive of Prudential Life,
said the proceeds of the sale would be channeled to insurance and
financial-services units.
</P>
<P>
   Huber said that Prudential Health Care had become more
attractive after it cut costs by folding 44 service centers across
the country into just four.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, Huber told Wall Street analysts that Aetna
would make no further acquisitions for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just surprised that they stepped up to a rather
large acquisition when they had very definitely said they would
not,'' said Joyce Albers, a partner at Deerfield Management, a
health-care investment management firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers advising Prudential were Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Prudential Securities. Wasserstein Perella advised Aetna. Skadden
Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom was Prudential's law firm in the deal,
and Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell represented Aetna.

`60 MINUTES' PRODUCER TO APOLOGIZE FOR DISCREDITED REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Hewitt, the executive producer of the CBS News
program ``60 Minutes,'' will apologize on the air Sunday night for
a report his news magazine broadcast that turned out to have been
faked. It is the first time in the 30 years since he created the
program that Hewitt he has appeared on it, he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to put an exclamation point on it, that it wasn't
just another correction,'' Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was broadcast on June 1, 1997, originated with
a British documentary about drug smuggling, which showed people it
described as Colombian drug couriers swallowing latex-glove fingers
filled with heroin and then boarding planes to London. It also had
interviews with alleged drug traffickers in Cali about how they
planned to forge new European markets for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, called ``The Connection,'' won many awards, but
last May the British newspaper The Guardian published a lengthy
report calling aspects of the film faked. It said the alleged
couriers had been hired by the filmmaker to play those roles, and
that an interview with the cartel's alleged leader said to have
been conducted in ``a secret location'' had actually been conducted
in the filmmaker's hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker, Marc de Beaufort, denied the newspaper's
accusations last May. But Carlton Communications, the company that
produced the film for Britain's ITV network and later sold it,
began an investigation. This week, Carlton announced that it had
found portions of the film to have been faked.
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office, the pay-cable network, showed de Beaufort's
documentary in its entirety on its Cinemax channel in June 1997,
the week of the ``60 Minutes'' report. Sheila Nevins, the HBO
executive in charge of documentary programs, showed the film to
Hewitt earlier, hoping ``60 Minutes'' would do a report on it and
mention that the film would be on Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' did, but first explored the report further,
sending Steve Kroft, a correspondent, to London to interview de
Beaufort and to review his raw footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only were we doubly careful,'' Hewitt said Thursday. ``But
in our piece we showed an interview with the United States Drug
Enforcement Agency, and they said, `Yes, this is what happens, and
it's very common, and hard to detect' and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beaufort, who is Colombian, could not be reached for comment
Thursday. But in May, responding to The Guardian's charges, he
said: ``The nightmare is that this whole article is based on three
people who either lied to us or lied to the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' rarely uses stories based on outsiders'
reporting, but Hewitt said the filmmaker's reputation and his
staff's reporting had persuaded them that the film was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Carlton Communications
pledged to return the awards and refund the money paid by
broadcasters for the rights to show it.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement he intends to read Sunday, Hewitt concludes:
``We, you and television viewers in 14 other countries were taken.
To make amends, we felt obligated to lay it all out in detail and
ask you to please accept our apology.'' &QL;

   Electronic Data Systems, seeking a marquee leader able to
restore its primacy in computer services, named Richard H. Brown,
chief executive of Cable and Wireless, as its chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is leaving Cable and Wireless after just 29 months,
brings a reputation as a tireless deal maker and management
shuffler, credited by analysts with raising the company's sales,
profits and share price in his short tenure there.

are being eroded by the incumbent's aggressive push for
technological change.
</P>
<P>
   ORACLE REPORTS SURPRISING GAIN
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the world's largest database software company, reported

revenue helped propel results past expectations. Oracle stock,
which fell $1.6875, to $34.9375, during regular Nasdaq trading,
rose to $36.50 in after-hours activity. The company reported its
results after the close of regular U.S. trading.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor reported a smaller-than-expected
second-quarter loss excluding one-time items, but sales were still

NUMBER OF ABORTION PROVIDERS DECLINING, REPORT SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Resending to include summary line. No other changes) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHARLOTTE HUFF 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of abortion providers continues to decline, making
the procedure less accessible to many rural women, according to an
Alan Guttmacher Institute report being released today.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion intimidation has contributed to the 14 percent
national decline in providers from 1992 through 1996, said Stanley
Henshaw, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Texas reported an even steeper 19 percent drop, from 79 to 64
providers, during the same period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now actual fear among abortion providers,'' said
Henshaw, deputy director for the New York City-based nonprofit
institute, which describes itself as pro-choice. ``It's not worth
the harassment or inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with the Rev. Flip Benham, national director of
Dallas-based Operation Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people that are telling the truth are out front and
that's bothering (doctors), then maybe they should stop doing it,''
Benham said.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ the 12th analysis by the institute since the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision _ also found that the number of Texas
abortions declined 6 percent from 1992 through 1996 compared with
11 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Another abortion analysis, published last week by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, found that the number of
abortions rose slightly from 1995 to 1996, after falling steadily
every year since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas women travel from as far away as Wichita Falls and
San Angelo to reach the Fort Worth clinic operated by Planned
Parenthood of North Texas, executive director Michael Comini said.
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin, executive director of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said she worries most about poor
women in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman with four children on an hourly wage who is not paid
for time off, who already can't afford the procedure, you are
doubling the cost of the procedure for her,'' McLaughlin said.
``Sometimes it really does make it impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Physician practices and hospitals, which perform 9 percent of
the nation's abortions, are most likely to have eliminated
services, Henshaw said. Young doctors are less likely to be taught
the procedure in residency, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors may contribute to the declining abortion
rate, including better contraception use in the wake of AIDS and
the decreased stigma of teenage motherhood, Henshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   As with slavery, an emotional shift will occur before the laws
can change, Benham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening here in this country is heart by heart, the
truth is getting out and the battle is being won in the streets,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 86 percent of U.S. counties and one-third of the cities
had no identified abortion provider, according to the institute's
report. That same year, the number of pregnancies ending in
abortion _ 26 percent _ reached its lowest rate in two decades, the
report said.

   CHICAGO _ In a move that could reassert the power of floor
traders fearful their positions could be eroded by the 24-hour
electronic age, members of the Chicago Board of Trade voted
Wednesday to unseat their chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After six years in office, Patrick Arbor, who portrayed himself
as a champion of technology and change in a world dominated by hand
signals and shouting, narrowly lost his bid to lead the largest
financial futures and options exchange for an unprecedented fourth
term.
</P>
<P>
   The new chairman, David Brennan, is a 41-year-old soybean trader
who was popular with floor traders and who had managed to win the
backing of seven former Board of Trade chairmen in the weeks
leading up to the election. Brennan won an 608-589 vote. The
late-night count concluded early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Arbor, a tough-talking commodities trader, had dubbed his
opponent a ``member of the flat earth society.'' Thursday, however,
he conceded that some of the more than 1,400 voting members of the
exchange had soured on his aggressive leadership, his push to align
with Eurex, an all-electronic German-Swiss derivatives exchange,
and his ill-fated effort to forge a common clearing operation with
the board's crosstown rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The push for technology, I think, was maybe too much for the
membership to digest right now,'' Arbor, 62, said in an interview.
``This means that the old guard is back; they thought we were going
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said the exchange was probably due for a
change. Some members had criticized Arbor for investing so heavily
in technology, and eroding membership power through alliances. But
others say the close vote demonstrated a membership split over
which course to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't draw any major conclusions from so close a vote,''
said Leo Melamed, the former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. ``There's not a major message here.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Arbor was credited for building a new $182 million
trading floor and enlarging the board's profile and profitability,
Melamed and others said that Arbor's portrayal of Brennan as
``inexperienced,'' ``immature'' and opposed to change was unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Brennan's a smart man and he's not going to put his head
in the sand,'' said Melamed, who has worked with Arbor and Brennan.
``But there will certainly be a fresh look at things.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan declined to be interviewed Thursday, but Burt Gutterman,
chief executive at Sangamon Trading and a veteran board member,
said this of the new chairman: ``There's no Luddite consequences
here, despite the spin. David is very knowledgeable about
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, the Board of Trade _ like most of the
nation's financial exchanges _ has been grappling with how to
compete in a world that is rapidly moving toward electronic
trading, global financial networks and low-cost trading. Earlier
this year, Cantor Fitzgerald moved to trade futures electronically,
and in Europe electronic trading of derivatives is growing.
</P>
<P>
   If electronic trading comes, though, it could displace the
thousands of ``locals,'' the traders who now populate the raucous
pits here. While Arbor supported the open outcry system, his
electronic course was viewed as less supportive of floor traders.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, however, is now in the hot seat, and some industry
officials are already trying to gauge his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will slow down the evolution of our exchange and
change some of the tracks,'' said Leslie Rosenthal, a former
chairman of the exchange. ``He's a conservative; he's part of the
floor. I think he will be more protective of the open outcry
trading pit.''

AGGIES' PROGRESS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Great football season in the Big 12. Good
thing, too. It's kept the focus away from a rather ignoble start to
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State's octogenarian winning streak against
nonconference opponents at Gallager-Iba Arena comes crashing down
after 80 games to _ Florida Atlantic? Equally stunning, mighty
Kansas falls to a lightly regarded Iowa team in Allen Fieldhouse,
putting an end to the nation's longest home-court winning streak
after 62 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Miller watch is on at Baylor. Texas struggles to a 1-5
start under new coach Rick Barnes, who inherited a depleted roster
and the nation's 16th-ranked schedule, according to statistics guru
Jeff Sagarin.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, however, is not upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be fine,'' he says with that trademark confident
attitude, and the track record says believe him.
</P>
<P>
   And almost unnoticed in the hullabaloo over a Big 12 football
championship, Texas A&AMP;M and its new coach Melvin Watkins have
started the season 7-1 _ in eight games having carved out a number
of victories equal to last season's total under deposed coach Tony
Barone.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed? Well, yes. Watkins' Aggies are playing before crowds
of 3,000-and-change in new Reed Arena. But the scenario is fitting
perhaps, since even Watkins' hiring last spring took second notice
to the Tom Penders melodrama and his subsequent ``resignation'' at
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   None of which makes any difference to Watkins, a most pleasant
person who focuses on perspective and the big picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care,'' Watkins said of the relative lack of
notice. ``Because I do understand the process. All things
considered, I'm pleased where we are. We should be 8-0. But I know
the road is going to get tougher, and we've got to get tougher as
well. I don't want to get people bent out of shape because we have
had some success. We always talk to our players about balance _ not
getting too high or two low.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the two situations _ A&AMP;M and Texas _ is fudge to
fruitcake.
</P>
<P>
   First, Watkins managed to stoke his program last spring with two
junior college transfers (point guard Clifton Cook, center Paul
Jacobs) who have stepped into starting roles, because he had
scholarship openings. Two, the Aggies have played an early schedule
that Sagarin ranks 241st in degree of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aggies are winning the kinds of games they began to lose
about this time last season after a 5-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we didn't keep our composure like we do this
year,'' guard Michael Schmidt said after Wednesday's Tulane victory
_ in which A&AMP;M lost 10 points of an 11-point lead before rallying
to win, 59-53. Seven times last year the Aggies lost games they led
by nine or more points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know I see a positive attitude on their faces when my
kids come to practice,'' Watkins said. ``And we surely want them to
feel good about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That's progress. Any way you measure it.
NO FORWARDS LEADS BACKWARDS
</P>
<P>
   Kansas' problems are evident, as is the fact that the Jayhawks
are over-ranked at No. 10 this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us is wrong,'' coach Roy Williams said, referring to
The Associated Press poll. ``And I see this team every day.''
</P>
<P>
   What Williams sees is a lack of scoring punch and a weak front
line beset by injuries. Lester Earl (knee) and T.J. Pugh (ankle),
the top two returning rebounders, have been slowed all season by
injury. Doctors shaved the back of Earl's kneecap earlier this week
in hopes of curing a continuous swelling problem since
reconstructive surgery last spring, but he may be out two more
weeks. Transfer Ashante Johnson, at 6-8 expected to be another
strong rebounder, has yet to play after October knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is averaging seven fewer boards a game than last season
and, Williams said, fewer points than any team he's had at Kansas.
The 85-81 loss to Iowa boosted Kansas' scoring average to 71.1
points a game _ 13 less than a year ago. A Kansas team has not
averaged less than 70 points since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Ryan Robertson, who was in the 11th grade the last time
Kansas lost at home, is the only player to score in double figures
through seven games. A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's NCAA-berth hopeful Lady Bears (4-3) may not have made
the early-season impact for which coach Sonja Hogg had hoped _
losing at home in the second round of the Women's National
Invitation Tournament by Florida (70-58) and dropping another home
game to Southwest Missouri State (87-86). But Hogg was encouraged
by Tuesday's win at Arkansas State _ significant because Arkansas
State had defeated No. 21 Virginia and No. 23 Kansas (the Big 12
preseason favorite) on their home court, where they had won 39 of
their last 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited until after the game to tell our players that they
had won 39 of 40 at home,'' Hogg said. ``This was a major step in
the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Further clue should come tomorrow night, when Baylor plays No.
25 California-Santa Barbara in the Ferrell Center. BACK AT YOU
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (4-1) aptly demonstrated the radical bounces of
December college basketball last week. The Sooners lost at home to
Murray State, then a week later in their next game shocked then-No.
18 Arkansas, 87-57.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing is not a crime, but you don't have to accept it,''
Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``We're not 30 points better
than anybody. \RThe Arkansas game\S was a fluke in a lot of ways.
We're not that good and they're not that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being able to bounce back like we did spoke a lot about
our team's character. The week we went through, if we'd had a bunch
of knuckleheads on our team, we couldn't have responded like we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Sooners' first over a ranked opponent since
beating No. 15 Colorado in February 1997 and the only victory by a
Big 12 team over a ranked opponent in nine such matchups this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Tim Heskett, who played in only two of Oklahoma's 33 games
last season before undergoing back surgery, has added needed
scoring punch to help compensate for the loss of Corey Brewer's 20
points a game. Twenty-one of Heskitt's 23 baskets are 3-pointers.
He's averaging 15.4 points and playing 33 minutes a game. He also
averages 3.6 assists and is shooting .909 from the free-throw line.
FREE THROWS
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran is heading the legal
team of Hampton University women's basketball coach Patricia Bibbs,
her husband Ezell and assistant Vanetta Kelso. They were falsely
detained in Lubbock (Nov. 17) for alleged participation in a
pigeon-drop scheme before a subsequently canceled game with Texas
Tech. Cochran said this week his clients will ``demand justice''
(read big bucks) after his own investigation, which he estimates
will take 30 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State point guard Doug Gottlieb leads the league in
assists and technical fouls _ three in the last two games. He was
tossed at halftime of the loss to Florida Atlantic after elbowing
the Owls' Baron Davis in the face. Davis retaliated by practically
blocking Joe Atkins' last shot in the Cowboys' 83-81 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug and I have had a long talk,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie
Sutton said. ``He needs to control his emotions if he's going to
play basketball at Oklahoma State.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. Texas wins against a good Oral Roberts team in Tulsa
without Kris Clack (dislocated shoulder), who plays most of the
second half in a subsequent loss at San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our worst game of the season,'' sophomore Gabe Muoneke
said of the loss to the Aztecs. ``We need to play harder. It's
ridiculous to know how good we are and then to play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, incidentally, says he and the sometimes volatile Muoneke
_ of all his inherited players _ probably most see eye-to-eye.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State coach Tom Asbury says 6-8, 230-pound transfer Tony
Kitt could be a great player if he ever gets in shape. Kitt pulled
down 20 rebounds 10 days ago against Loyola-Chicago and also has
19- and 16-rebound games. He plays only about 20 minutes a game,
yet leads KSU in scoring (13.3 points) and rebounding (10.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``He never coasts or rests,'' Asbury said. ``But if we can get
him playing 30-32 minutes _ and that may not happen until next
season _ we're looking at some amazing numbers.''

STUDY ESTIMATES FREQUENCY OF CONTROVERSIAL ABORTION METHOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when the political fight over abortion centers on a
late-term method that anti-abortion groups call partial-birth
abortion, a new study by a nonprofit research group has estimated,
for the first time, how often the method is used.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, based
on a survey of all known abortion providers in the United States,
there were about 650 such abortions, known medically as ``intact
dilation and extraction,'' at 14 hospitals or clinics in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimates that the procedure _ in which the legs of
the fetus are partially delivered, the skull is punctured with a
sharp object and the contents are removed by suction, to allow it
to fit through the cervix _ accounted for about 0.03 to 0.05
percent of the 1.4 million abortions in 1996. Those numbers are
projections based on the responses of nine abortion providers who
collectively performed 363 such procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said Thursday that those numbers were too low and
might not include responses from the clinics and doctors that use
the procedure most.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality concerns, Stanley Henshaw, deputy
director of research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, would not
identify which providers had reported using the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers aren't exact, but I'm pretty sure it's in the 500
to 1,000 range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the numbers is in part definitional: The
Guttmacher survey counted only procedures in which the fetus is
killed by the ``partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of
a living fetus.'' But many doctors kill the fetus before the
contents are removed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, 28 states have passed legislation banning so-called
partial-birth abortion, using a broader definition than the survey
did. Most of those bans have been blocked in court _ as New
Jersey's was on Tuesday _ with several courts ruling that they were
so broadly written as to cover other kinds of abortions. Congress
twice passed a partial-birth abortion ban, but each time President
Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Guttmacher study sought information for the first time about
the use of nonsurgical abortions, using either mifepristone, the
French abortion pill known as RU-486, or methotrexate, an
anti-cancer drug now being used to induce early abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that these abortions, known as medical
abortions, in which women take a combination of pills over several
days, are spreading rapidly, with about 4,300 medical abortions in
the first half of 1997, compared with 4,200 in all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved
the sale of mifepristone, some clinics offer it in clinical trials
sponsored by Abortion Rights Mobilization, while other doctors and
clinics use methotrexate, either in clinical trials for early
abortions or as a use beyond the one for which it is specifically
labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA found in 1996 that mifepristone was
``approvable,'' the effort to get the drug to market bogged down in
a tangle of legal, financial and manufacturing difficulties. Final
FDA approval could come late next year.

COWBOYS WENT ABOUT TASK TOO EASILY IN THE BIG EASY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ah, Christmas in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The food. The Royal Street shopping. The streetcar ride along
moss-draped St. Charles Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The football game.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Clearly, as they escorted their wives and/or girlfriends
around The Big Easy last weekend _ as many of them reportedly did _
the Cowboys forgot something.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence exists in the videotaped lowlights of the team's 22-3
defeat, a game in which coach Chan Gailey suggested the Cowboys had
``the dog'' beaten out of them.
</P>
<P>
   He should hope so. Because as some of us saw it, there was
plenty of dog in the Cowboys to go around.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics from last weekend suggest a thorough, physical
domination by the New Orleans Saints, hard as that is to fathom.
The Saints were 5-7 for a reason. They were ranked 27th in the
league in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys are no better than the Saints _ something that
the casual observer could have deduced by watching the 22-3
spanking _ then the joke has been on us. The Cowboys are paper
tigers, and the paper is the NFC East standings.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no joke. If you buy into the paper-tiger theory, the
loss in New Orleans stands as evidence of a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't _ and I don't _ you're left with the equally
disturbing notion that the Cowboys, mentally, were not ready to
play. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   In private this week, Gailey was asked if he felt his team
didn't treat the weekend in New Orleans as enough of a business
trip.
</P>
<P>
   He said he'd rather not answer that.
</P>
<P>
   To answer it, I believe, would intrude upon wives, girlfriends,
bar tabs at Pat O'Brien's, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying exactly how many Cowboys wives/girlfriends
accompanied their player-husbands on the weekend trip. But it was
more than just a few.
</P>
<P>
   One of them accidentally left her bill in the same hotel room
that I was assigned Sunday night. Forgive me, I peeked. The lady
and her husband clearly had a marvelous, fun-filled time.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the game, presumably. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up. The Cowboys had neither blocked nor tackled anyone in
earnest for 10 days. The NFC East was a gimme. The offense had
stamped itself as a bona fide scoring machine. The owner had been
telling everyone that he likes what he sees. And then there were
Mike Ditka's allegedly cowardly Saints, speedbumps on the planned
promenade down Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was that the Cowboys numbly staggered through the
motions, ofttimes appearing confused or disinterested.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line, mostly Flozell Adams and Mike Kiselak, never
did adjust to the blitzing pressure put on by the Saints' 46
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Two other things happened. First, tight end David LaFleur tore a
ligament in a knee early in the game. Gailey had planned to utilize
LaFleur as a pass target, even splitting him wide on some plays. It
likely would have forced the Saints to cover the big tight end with
a linebacker, which would have meant one less blitzer.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing was that the sold-out Superdome crowd was much
louder than the Cowboys had planned. As a result, there were times
when quarterback Troy Aikman came to the line, saw that a bad play
had been called, but was unable to do much about it.
</P>
<P>
   Things snowballed. The Big Easy was anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, as has been well-chronicled, Gailey did not read
his chihuahuas the riot act in the post-game dressing room. His
idea of admonishment apparently was to wait until they returned to
Valley Ranch and then tell the players how disappointed he was in
them. He also made them watch tape of the entire game _ ouch _
leaving them to squirm as he pointed out each mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're a good team, we'll respond,'' Gailey said, simply.
</P>
<P>
   He is correct, of course. If the Cowboys play poorly in Kansas
City this weekend, then the paper tigers could well be in for a
brief and bogus playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, however, they are still the same team that won
eight of its first 11 games. In New Orleans, they were on vacation.
Yeah, that's it. A vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the mission. Or bust.

SMITH MAY BEAT SANDERS TO FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In a surprising twist, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said that cornerback Kevin Smith (sprained back) has a better
chance of playing against the Kansas City Chiefs than Deion Sanders
(sprained toe).
</P>
<P>
   Neither player practiced with the team yesterday because of
rain. And Gailey said he would like to wait until today's practice
before making a final decision on their playing status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is probably now a little closer than Deion,'' Gailey
said. ``I was encouraged about what Deion did in practice
Wednesday. But I'd like to see him do a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of both players were reversed earlier in the week
when Smith was listed as doubtful on the injury report and Sanders
was listed as questionable. Gailey said the situation is more
indicative of progress by Smith than of Sanders being set back.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams are still slated to start at
cornerback. Warren frustrated Cowboys running back Chris Warren,
who has missed the past two games with a strained groin, is growing
frustrated with his injury woes this season.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't practice yesterday, and the Cowboys are not optimistic
about his chances for the Chiefs game.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who played the past eight years with the Seahawks, came
to the Cowboys in the off-season to be an insurance policy for
starting running back Emmitt Smith, who has been hampered by a
variety of injuries the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Warren has been the one unable to stay healthy. He also
missed the first three games of the season with a similar groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   What's most troubling to Warren is that he doesn't have a
history of injury problems, missing only five games over the
previous eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand it,'' Warren, 30, said. ``I've played
with broken ribs before. Nothing has ever kept me from playing
until now.'' Flag fest Among the subplots in Sunday's
Cowboys-Chiefs game is the it shapes up as a possible flag fest.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs are the league's most penalized team with 125
infractions for 1,052 yards, while the Cowboys are third with 112
penalties for 981 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's biggest issue is with pre-snap penalties that have
plagued the Cowboys all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do what it takes to prevent those,'' Gailey said.
``I can live with the judgment calls by the officials after the
ball has been snapped but it's the pre-snap penalties that really
hurt.''

   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock deflects the question
as quickly and decisively as Ed Belfour kicks aside a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I don't want to think about that
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it Hitchcock can't face? The prospect of playing without
Mike Modano? Whether or not to send Bryan Marchment a Seasons
Greeting?
</P>
<P>
   No, nothing that horrible. Hitchcock merely has been asked what
he will do when Brett Hull returns to the lineup, which likely will
happen tonight against Montreal or Sunday at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it seems as though it should be a no-brainer.
Restore Hull to the ``Firing Line'' with Modano and Jere Lehtinen.
Easy, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The complicating factor is the outstanding play of Jamie
Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year forward has rebounded from a training-camp
holdout to become one of the most productive Stars of late. His
first-period assist against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday night
gave him 11 points in the past 10 games. He is third on the team
with 18 points and second with 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has come on the first line. He has been playing
alongside Modano and Lehtinen since a slight groin strain caused
Hull to miss five of the past six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line's really played well,'' Hitchcock said. ``You've got
three people that work hard. That's not to say the
Modano-Lehtinen-Hull combination hasn't been sound and good; it
has. When Hull left our group, he was playing as well as he's ever
played. We're assuming that's the way he's going to start up. If he
does, we've got some real hard decisions to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner is prepared for whatever the coach decides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely an adjustment, but it's something I've gotten
used to over the last couple of years,'' he said. ``I'm kind of the
yo-yo guy who can move back and forth to where I'm needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he plays, Langenbrunner will skate with the all-out,
reckless style that's become his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I've got to play,'' he said. ``I've got to play
with a lot of energy and try to outwork the other team. I don't
have the skills to go out there and skate around everybody. Just
going out there and working hard is my calling card.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the season, though, that style was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner missed most of training camp in a contract holdout
before signing a two-year deal five days before the season opener.
But Hitchcock dismisses that as a factor in Langenbrunner's slow
start. He said Langenbrunner was playing the way he did in the
playoffs last season, when he had five points in 16 games and a
plus/minus rating of minus-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to play a skilled game rather than an
in-your-face game,'' Hitchcock said. ``Now, he just plays in your
face. When the work is there first, the skill will be a reflection
of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in Langenbrunner's scoring surge is a move to
right wing. He began the season playing the left side on a line
with Joe Nieuwendyk and Pat Verbeek, which is not a natural
position for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no coincidence that he's up and running since moving over
to the right side,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's a very competent left
winger, but if I want to get a lot out of him, there's a better
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever decision Hitchcock makes when Hull returns almost
surely won't involve moving Langenbrunner back to the left wing.
He'll stay on the right side somewhere, or perhaps move to center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Langenbrunner is a better center-iceman and a better right
winger than he is a left winger,'' Hitchcock said. ``When Brett
comes back in, the change might be in the middle of the ice or on
the right side. I think that has to be our focus.''

COMMITTEE DEBATE BEGINS ON ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Working in the shadow of history and the
Constitution, the House Judiciary Committee began debating
impeachment articles on Thursday as President Clinton looked to
moderate Republicans to end the threat to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grave matter we're about today,'' Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., said as the panel took on the solemn task of
deciding Clinton's fate. ``Sadly, I conclude that, when all is said
and done, I must vote to impeach President William Jefferson
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee all but certain to approve articles
of impeachment Friday or Saturday, Clinton's allies focused on
Thursday's showdown vote in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials made a flurry of telephone calls to
undecided lawmakers and sent every member of Congress a
point-by-point rebuttal of the allegations against the president.
The draft resolution of the four articles of impeachment accuses
Clinton of 17 counts of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse
of power in his efforts to hide an extramarital affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people may wake up next Friday morning to
discover that the House of Representatives has indeed impeached the
president,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think the
American people are waiting for us to come to our senses and end
this political game of chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisans on both sides agree that the outcome in the House will
be determined by about two dozen undecided Republicans. The
30-member Texas delegation is expected to vote along party lines,
with the exception of Rep. Ralph Hall of Rockwall, one of three
House Democrats who publicly support impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
Republican Whip Tom DeLay, both of Texas and the No. 2 and No. 3
House leaders, reaffirmed their opposition to any House vote on a
compromise censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of censure is born out of a desperate imagination by
those too timid to uphold their own sworn oath to `support and
defend' the Constitution,'' DeLay wrote in an opinion piece for the
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, Armey's spokeswoman, said the majority leader
adamantly opposes a censure vote. Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of
Louisiana has not taken a position on censure, which some of
Clinton's backers believe is his best hope for avoiding
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of partisan sniping, Judiciary Committee members
adopted a somber tone as they opened a debate that has occurred
only rarely in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, lawmakers sitting in the same high-ceilinged hearing
room approved articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon, but he
resigned to avoid a vote in the full House. The House impeached
Andrew Johnson in 1868, but the Senate fell one vote short of the
two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the echoes of history, committee Republicans
labored beneath a portrait of former Rep. Peter Rodino, the New
Jersey Democrat who presided over the Watergate investigation
nearly 25 years ago. Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the current
chairman, gazed over the Democrats from his portrait on the other
side of the dais.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are standing perched on a constitutional cliff, staring
into the void below into which we have jumped only twice before in
our history,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the panel's
leading Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that Clinton's behavior left them no choice
but to pursue the ultimate punishment for the nation's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did the president tell a judge and then a grand jury
less than the truth, he also told lies to the American people, the
news media, members of Congress, his Cabinet and senior White House
advisers,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio. ``If we keep
excusing away the president's actions, we as a nation will never
climb upward because there will be no firm rungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives took up the impeachment resolution after final
arguments by committee lawyers for both parties. Democratic counsel
Abbe Lowell warned that a House vote for impeachment would clear
the way for a lengthy Senate trial that would almost certainly
include detailed, graphic testimony about Clinton's relationship
with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perjury that some in the majority have said `tears at the
fabric of our judicial system' comes down to whether the president
lied about whether he touched Ms. Lewinsky,'' Lowell said. ``Is
that what you want to put the country through?''
</P>
<P>
   Majority counsel David Schippers, a Chicago Democrat who was
hired by the committee's Republican majority, countered with a
scathing recitation of Clinton's efforts to keep the relationship
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sex or private conduct. It is about multiple
obstructions of justice, perjury, false and misleading statements,
witness tampering and abuses of power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Directing the committee's attention to oversized television
screens, Schippers played damaging snippets from videotapes of
Clinton's sworn statements in the Paula Jones' sexual harassment
case and to a Washington grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Lewinsky in the Jones case, Clinton denied
having a sexual relationship with her. He told the grand jury that
he had engaged in ``an inappropriate intimate relationship'' but
insisted that his earlier statements had been legally accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answers are a gratuitous insult to your intelligence and
common sense,'' Schippers told the panel of 21 Republicans and 16
Democrats. ``He lied to the people, he lied to his Cabinet, he lied
to his top aides and now he has lied under oath to the Congress of
the United States. There is no one left to lie to.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee began debating four
articles of impeachment Thursday night after Republican and
Democratic lawyers made their final arguments over President
Clinton's fate, marshaling videotapes, the words of the nation's
founders, and competing views of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As the committee began pushing to finish its impeachment inquiry
this weekend, Speaker Newt Gingrich instructed the lame-duck 105th
Congress to be ready to return next week. He set Thursday as the
date that the House could begin considering the impeachment of
Clinton. It will be only the second time in history that the House
would be called on to take such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The circus atmosphere that had so often pervaded the panel's
hearings gave way to grim solemnity, as the 37-member committee
neared decisions about whether to charge Clinton with two counts of
perjury, and one count each of of obstruction of justice and abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say it is certain the committee will vote for
Clinton's removal from office. The only question is how many
charges it will approve.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner opened the debate Thursday night by
calling for impeachment. ``I do so with no joy, but without
apology,'' the Wisconsin Republican said. ``What is on trial here
is the truth and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., the committee's ranking Democrat,
however, warned Republicans that they were ``trying to overturn the
result of two elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the committee room, a fierce struggle was under way for
the hearts and minds of the two dozen or so undecided Republicans
who can swing the impeachment vote one way or another on the full
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, most of the day was devoted to the summations of
the committee's senior lawyers, with the Republican counsel going
beyond the case to question the president's character and the
counsel for the Democrats imploring the committee to consider how
the nation would react to a months-long Senate trial with Monica
Lewinsky on the witness stand. For the first time, the nation saw
excerpts of Clinton's videotaped deposition in the Paula Jones
case, testimony that has been central to the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' said David Schippers, the Republicans' chief
investigative counsel, ``I come to the point that frankly I prayed
I would never reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse William Jefferson
Clinton of obstruction of justice, false and deliberately
misleading statements under oath, witness-tampering, abuse of power
and false statements to and obstruction of the Congress of the
United States in the course of this very impeachment inquiry,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His lofty tone changed as he went beyond discussing impeachable
offenses to describe Clinton in scathing terms as a deeply flawed
man unfit for office. Schippers referred to ``cover stories'' and
Clinton's ``crafty mind'' and his ``lame and obviously contrived''
testimony. And he charged that there were ``allegations of possible
serious wrongdoing'' and of ``probable'' crimes that he could not
disclose because of ongoing criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats said he was not
defending the president but the sanctity of the Constitution, as he
argued that the case against Clinton did not justify his removal
from office. ``From listening to our constitutional scholars, we
learned that impeachment is like the wall protecting the fort
around the separation of powers,'' he said. ``The crack you put in
the wall today, becomes the gash tomorrow which ultimately leads to
the wall crumbling down. It is that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell spoke of a ``constitutional quagmire'' over ``the
definition of sex'' and said impeachment was not used ``when
President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, nor when
President Roosevelt misled the public about United States
involvement in the lend-lease program, nor when President Reagan
misled the country and Congress about involvement with
Iran-Contra.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the White House protested Schipper's
presentation. ``We are disappointed and saddened that the committee
majority brought this solemn constitutional process down to a level
of innuendo, anger, and unfair unsubstantiated charges,'' said
Gregory Craig, special counsel to the president. Two committee
Democrats, Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Zoe Lofgren of
California angrily compared Schippers' intimations of secret crimes
to McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde signaled Thursday that he would allow a censure vote in the
committee, but could postpone it until next Tuesday. He made clear
that he opposes censure. Democrats, who are trying to put forward a
censure measure in place of impeachment, were looking at toughening
their own proposals to demand that the president pay a fine, in
order to draw more Republicans to their side. It was still not
clear, however, whether Republican leaders would allow a censure
measure to reach the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting to see what the Judiciary Committee reports,''
said Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming speaker, as he
sidestepped the question, ``and I'll deal with the procedure
according to what they report. I've not yet found out what they
anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   In presentations Thursday, both lawyers used different parts of
the same tape to present their contrasting views of the case
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Instructing the committee to ``listen to the president's
deceptions for yourself,'' Schippers played on large television
screens several clips in which the president said he could not
recall having been alone with Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was so much simpler before they found that dress wasn't
it?'' Schippers sarcastically asked, referring to the blue dress
Ms. Lewinsky had saved which contained evidence of her sexual
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   He also showed the president watching intently _ staring off
screen _ as his lawyer, Robert Bennett, read aloud Ms. Lewinsky's
false affidavit saying she had not had a sexual relationship with
Clinton. ``That's absolutely true,'' the president affirmed on the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   On the same television screen, Lowell displayed a different
segment showing Clinton first studying a written definition of
sexual relations given him by the lawyers for Ms. Jones then
listening as those lawyers, his lawyer and Judge Susan Webber
Wright squabbled over the legal description of ``sexual
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding prescient, Bennett complained ``this is going to lead
to confusion'' and argued that a deposition is not supposed to be
``a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of perjury against Clinton stem from his denial that
he had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. The president's lawyers
have argued that the president was not lying because he believed
that sexual relations meant intercourse, not other kinds of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schipper and Lowell did more than just argue the facts.
Faced with public opposition to impeachment, Schippers, a former
prosecutor, tried to raise fundamental questions about Clinton's
character, suggesting several times that he simply was not fit to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Ms. Lewinsky, then a 22-year-old intern, had never
spoken to the president before their first intimate encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime on November 15th, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky made an improper
gesture to the president,'' he said. ``What did he do in response?
Did the president immediately confront her or report her to her
supervisors, as you would expect? Did he make it clear that such
conduct would not be tolerated in the White House? No. That would
have been an appropriate reaction, but it's not the one the
president chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the president of the United States invited this
unknown young intern into a private area off the Oval Office, where
he kissed her,'' Schipper said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point he charged that the ``president's illegal
actions constitute an attack upon and utter disregard for the truth
and for the rule of law.'' And he said Clinton had ``arrogant
disdain'' for fellow citizens, like Ms. Jones and for the other
branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lowell tried to force the committee to think about
the prospect of a long Senate trial featuring the entire cast of
characters of the scandal, from Ms. Lewinsky to Linda Tripp.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a new criminal prosecution that points to
toughening enforcement of Mexico's fiscal laws, the president of
the board of Mexico's third-largest airline was arrested Thursday
and charged with tax fraud, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Mexican attorney general accused the
executive, Alberto Abed Shekaiban, of Taesa _ formally Transportes
Aereos Ejecutivos SA _ of failing to notify tax authorities about
money he withheld from employees for income and other taxes in
1996. The amount in question was put at 28.8 million pesos, or $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Abed, 46, was jailed pending arraignment, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Taesa's offices here declined Thursday to identify
Abed's lawyers or any corporate spokesman. Rafael Montero, a Taesa
representative in New York, did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's tax-collection rates have been among the lowest in the
world's major economies, and government officials have repeatedly
lectured business leaders about complying with their tax
obligations.

ADVERTISING: TRUE NORTH TO ARBITRATE ON VALUE OF ITS PUBLICIS
STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bickersons of Madison Avenue _ Publicis SA in
Paris and True North Communications in Chicago _ are back in court
again as True North has submitted a dispute over the valuation of
its stake in Publicis to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The two giant agency companies have become known for their
fractious relationship after years of tangled disagreements over
expansion and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The war seemingly ended in May 1997, when Publicis and True
North dissolved an international cooperative agreement. But six
months later, Publicis unexpectedly began a hostile takeover bid
for True North, which only intensified the enmity between them.
</P>
<P>
   When True North defeated the unfriendly deal in late December,
the bitterness between the former partners appeared to subside.
Last month, Publicis announced that it would begin to sever its
remaining ties with True North by merging a subsidiary, Publicis
Communication, into Publicis.
</P>
<P>
   True North owns 26.5 percent of Publicis Communication, which is
not publicly traded. The stock swap to complete the merger would
give True North shares in Publicis that represent about 8.8 percent
of the total outstanding, which could then be sold by True North to
close the books on l'affaire Publicis. A special shareholder
meeting to vote on the merger is scheduled to be held Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But when Publicis executives detailed terms of the merger, True
North executives pronounced themselves displeased. The reason, they
said, was that the book value of the True North investment in
Publicis was higher than the value of the Publicis shares that True
North would receive. That would result in a pretax loss for True
North of about $30 million in the fourth quarter, according to a
10-Q filing it made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports in the trade publications Adweek and Campaign
that True North executives were considering legal action to block
the merger. But True North said Thursday that it would ``not
institute legal action to impede the merger of Publicis
Communication and Publicis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, True North said, it had decided to submit the issue of
the share valuation to the London Court of International
Arbitration. Hearings on a request by True North for unspecified
monetary damages from Publicis have been scheduled for the week of
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully this is the beginning of the last chapter of a very
bad book _ the tortured saga of True North and Publicis,'' Bruce
Mason, chief executive at True North, said in the statement. ``This
will enable us to finally exit the acrimonious relationship with
Publicis.''
</P>
<P>
   There did seem to be an effort by True North to tone down some
of the rhetoric against Publicis, which became bitterly caustic at
the height of the takeover fight. The tone of Mason's remarks was
more conciliatory, and the decision to seek arbitration was
disclosed not in the first paragraph of a news release but in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The release even carried a kinder, gentler headline: ``True
North Nears Final Chapter With Publicis.''
</P>
<P>
   And Publicis sidestepped an opportunity to fire back at True
North. Asked Thursday for a response to the True North
announcement, Seth Goldschlager, a spokesman for Publicis, replied
that Publicis would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geanuleas, a spokeswoman for True North, declined to
disclose how True North would vote its shares at the special
meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a special meeting of True North shareholders a year ago,
Publicis voted its shares in True North against a deal for True
North to acquire Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &AMP; Eckhardt. Other True
North shareholders supported the deal and it was overwhelmingly
approved.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of 1997, True North ranked as the world's
sixth-largest agency company, with $10.8 billion in billings.
Publicis was ranked No. 14, at $4 billion.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee stood on the brink
Thursday of a historic decision to recommend the impeachment of
President Clinton, the panel's partisan divide as wide as ever.
</P>
<P>
   With at least one of four proposed articles of impeachment
virtually certain to win committee approval either today or
Saturday, Speaker Newt Gingrich formally put the House on notice to
be ready to do its duty next week.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to every House member, Gingrich said the impeachment
debate in the full House would begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's videotaped image from his deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, used in closing arguments by the
chief Republican and Democratic lawyers, dominated Thursday's
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, committee members one by one began delivering their
statements, which will be followed by the consideration of the
proposed articles of impeachment and a Democratic alternative, to
censure Clinton for his efforts to conceal his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   More than five hours of presentations by the lawyers appeared to
change no minds in the tense, partisan environment that has marked
the Judiciary Committee's work.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the Republicans' lead investigative counsel,
told committee members they have a ``sorrowful duty'' to remove
Clinton from office because he committed perjury, obstructed
justice and abused the powers of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, his Democratic counterpart, said the lack of public
support for impeachment should be a powerful signal to Republicans
that they should embrace the Democratic proposal to censure Clinton
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the American people, who are asking you to find a
truly bipartisan way to avoid the course you are about to
undertake,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   New polls released Thursday continue to reflect public distaste
for impeachment and the attractiveness of censure as a way to
punish Clinton for his sex-and-lies scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll contained troubling news for
Republicans. The Republican Party's popularity has dropped to
levels not seen since the early 1990s, and its negative rating has
almost doubled from where it stood in January 1995, when the GOP
took control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, however, said they would
take no notice of the polls as they lined up, one after another
Thursday, to declare their support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot erase from my mind ... the falsehoods uttered under
oath,'' said Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.).
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, restated their intention to vote
against impeachment. Summing up his view of the case against the
president, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) said, ``The president tried
to hide an extramarital relationship from the glare of his family
and political opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the intended target of most of Thursday's commentary
was the small band of undecided, mainly moderate, Republicans who
appear to hold the key to impeachment in the closely divided House.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, a Chicago Democrat who is working for the
Republicans, barely concealed his contempt for the White House's
defense of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He spiced his account of the president's relationship with the
young former intern and efforts to cover it up with repeated digs
and sarcastic remarks about Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers painted a picture of a devious chief executive who
would stop at nothing to conceal the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sex or private conduct, it is about multiple
obstructions of justice, perjury, false and misleading statements,
witness tampering and abuses of power, all committed or
orchestrated by the president of the United States,'' Schippers
declared at the start of his three-hour narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer proceeded to weave together a long list of meetings,
phone calls and exchanges among Clinton, Lewinsky, presidential
secretary Betty Currie and adviser Vernon Jordan that, taken as a
whole, suggested a ``sinister, or even criminal connotation when
observed in the context of the whole plot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers attempted to undercut Lewinsky's grand jury testimony,
which was not contained in independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
referral to Congress, that ``no one ever told me to lie, nobody
ever promised me a job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course no one said, 'Now, Monica, you go in there and
lie,''' said Schippers, speaking in a low, conspiratorial voice.
``They didn't have to. Monica knew what was expected of her.
Similarly, nobody promised her a job, but once she signed the false
affidavit, she got one, didn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers charged that Clinton's deceptions might have succeeded
if not for the semen-stained blue dress that was found in
Lewinsky's possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was so much simpler before they found that dress, wasn't
it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers concluded his summation on a loftier note.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do here will be incised in the history of the United
States for all time to come,'' he said. ``Unborn generations ...
will learn of these proceedings and will most certainly judge this
committee's actions. What will be their verdict?
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it be that you rose above party and faction, and
re-established justice, decency, honor and truth as the standard by
which even the highest office in the land must be evaluated? Or
will it be that you announced that there is no abiding standard and
that public officials are answerable only to politics, polls and
propaganda? God forbid that that will be your legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Gregory Craig, speaking at the White
House after Schippers presentation, sharply criticized the attorney
for resorting to ``innuendo, anger and unfair, unsubstantiated
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Schippers' argument, Lowell offered a lofty
discussion of the standards of impeachment and the paucity of
evidence to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Republicans to think twice before removing the
president for lying and concealing a sexual affair, contrasting it
with what he said were far more serious affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Clinton is not, he said, about the president
directing his staff to spread misinformation about the progress of
the war in Vietnam. It is not about breaking into the Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate apartment complex or about how funds
from arms sales in Iran were diverted to aid the Contras in
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a president repeating to his staff the same denial of
an inappropriate and extremely embarrassing relationship that he
had already denied to the public directly,'' Lowell said. ``Bill
Clinton's alleged crimes are not those of an errant president, but
that of an unfaithful husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee started its day by meeting in closed session to
authorize the release of Clinton's videotaped deposition in the
Jones civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers and Lowell made use of snippets of tape to bolster
their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit, the president appeared in the ornate
Judiciary Committee chambers on large-screen television sets. He
sat silently through a discussion among lawyers and U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright about what constitutes sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's understanding of that term is a key question in one of
the proposed impeachment articles that allege he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell also broadcast parts of independent counsel Starr's
testimony before the committee last month to demonstrate that even
Starr at times said that he would have to ``search my
recollection,'' before answering committee questions.
</P>
<P>
   Before Republicans use similar constructions from Clinton to
justify his impeachment, they should consider ``what an unfair
tactic that really is,'' Lowell said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House is expressing growing confidence
that it can defeat proposed articles of impeachment on the House
floor and is quietly exploring with Republican leaders a deal under
which President Clinton would accept a punitive censure resolution
to escape impeachment, officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a broad effort to sway undecided Republican House
moderates, presidential aides have contacted 45 potentially
persuadable members of Congress in the past few days to offer
further evidence or explanation in the president's defense and to
urge them to vote against impeachment, according to White House
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself spoke to ``a handful'' of House members this
week to try to answer their concerns, a White House official said
on Thursday night. The official would not provide the members'
names.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said that two undecided House
members, Reps. Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes, both Republicans from
New York, are scheduled to travel with the president on his trip to
the Middle East on Saturday, giving Clinton a further opportunity
to make his case. Lazio said on Thursday that he had not yet
decided whether to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Another undecided Republican, Rep. Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, is
also scheduled to accompany the president to Israel, according to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of a compromise that would save Clinton from
impeachment was fuzzy Thursday night, but advisers to the president
suggested that Republican leaders in the House might permit a vote
on a harsh censure resolution, including a substantial fine to be
paid by Clinton, if it appeared that the impeachment bill was going
to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have so far been adamant that the full House
would vote only on articles of impeachment, not on censure. Rep.
Robert Livingston, the speaker-designate of the House, refused on
Thursday to say whether he would allow a vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said that Republican leaders were not putting
pressure on members to vote for impeachment, but that the White
House is engaged in an aggressive anti-impeachment campaign. ``The
president's administration and his people have not hesitated to
lobby,'' Livingston said. ``We hear they're lobbying in all
sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary discussions with members of Congress have cheered
White House partisans, leading to at least momentary optimism that
Clinton can avoid a Senate impeachment trial on any of four
impeachment articles charging perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're fine, today,'' said one presidential adviser,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Today,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's greater sense of optimism among presidential
advisers, the Clinton White House has frequently misread the mood
of Congress. As recently as last weekend, Clinton and his top aides
were certain that the full House would approve at least one article
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said privately Thursday that
the White House was engaged in wishful thinking and predicted that
the House would vote to impeach Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   In another danger sign for the president, a senior Republican
aide in Congress said that four moderate Republicans that the White
House is actively courting will announce on Friday that they will
vote to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to pleas from his own advisers and fence-sitting
members of Congress, Clinton is considering a public statement on
the impeachment matter before he departs for Jerusalem on Saturday
or shortly after his return on Tuesday. If the Judiciary Committee
approves one or more articles of impeachment, as expected, the full
House will begin debate on Thursday.

CHANGE IS PROPOSED BY ACCOUNTING BOARD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The board that sets the United States' accounting rules agreed
Thursday to proceed with a plan that would require more companies
to consolidate their financial statements with those of companies
they control.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board is concerned that when
a company controls another, the controlling concern may be able to
profit at the expense of the smaller company's shareholders. For
example, the larger company may sell goods to the other at inflated
prices, creating big profits for itself while causing losses for
its smaller partner.
</P>
<P>
   Although a current rule requires related companies to
consolidate their financial statements, companies can now avoid
that accounting by owning less than 50 percent of the other
company's stock. For example, Coca-Cola Co. now owns about 44
percent of its largest bottling company, Coca-Cola Enterprises, and
does not consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would eliminate the 50 percent ownership rule
and instead look at the relationship of the two companies to
determine whether one controls the other. The board plans to issue
a draft of the new rules in February. Companies will then have 90
days to comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over five years ago, President Bill Clinton stood on the
White House lawn watching Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and the
Palestinians' Yasser Arafat shake hands on a historic peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Oslo'' accord truly was historic _ the first such deal
after 45 years of mutual hatred and non-recognition _ and much has
changed since then. Yet much, much more remains to be changed _ and
much has not changed at all, or even changed for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   This paper in 1993 foresaw a long, hard, potholed road to peace.
When Clinton arrives to visit both sides on Dec. 12 he will find
that the road has been even harder, and the potholes deeper, than
skeptics foresaw; and that the road ahead may well prove longer and
harder still, or even lead nowhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate sign of that has been the row over the recent Wye
mini-accord. Palestinians have been angered _ into disorder and
violence, some of them _ to find that a promised release of
Palestinian prisoners in practice meant more common criminals than
of the 2,000-odd political prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government replied last week that freeing people
``with blood on their hands,'' or Hamas members, was no part of
Wye, and that it would stop implementing the accord unless the
Palestinian Authority admitted as much, halted and punished
violence and incitement to it, and renounced Arafat's threat to
declare a Palestinian state next May whether Israel agreed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such roadblocks are removable; Arafat went halfway on Dec. 6,
talking only of ``agreement'' on a Palestinian state, not of a
unilateral declaration if none could be reached. But the spirit
that sets roadblocks up is far harder to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the five years since Oslo, Palestinians gravely doubt
that Rabin's current successor (and old opponent), Benjamin
Netanyahu, really wants peace at all; and he does not trust them to
mean peace when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Next May was supposed _ hence Arafat's deadline _ to see the end
of the ``final-status'' negotiations. They have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The straightforward answer is that things were always
bound to get bad and bitter as the final-status talks, and the
really hard issues such as Jerusalem grew nearer, and neither side
was ever likely to be in a hurry to grapple with those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other answers too, which make a normal
deadlines-concentrate-the-mind optimism hard to share.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, in particular, has dragged its feet, though not without
reason: more Israelis have been killed by terrorism since Oslo than
before it, and Arafat is widely blamed for failing to prevent such
outrages by Hamas and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was shock at suicide bombings that brought Netanyahu to
office; now, having engaged reluctantly (and damagingly late) in
the Oslo and Wye procedures, his government looks on the verge of
collapse thanks to right-wing desertions.
</P>
<P>
   The side that must give up most if a durable peace is to be
found _ Israel _ remains profoundly unwilling to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say nothing has altered. Palestinians do not
govern most of ``their'' land, but nearly all Palestinians are
under their aegis.
</P>
<P>
   And although the result is more of a patchwork than a country,
Netanyahu talks of a Palestinian state in terms that he would have
denounced as treason five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is change overdue only among Israelis. Palestinians and
their media are readier to vilify them than the other way about;
Palestinian hate is a barrier to peace, like Israeli contempt, and
uglier.
</P>
<P>
   However, the onus is inevitably on Israel, for it is Israel that
rules. It is Israel that since 1967 has occupied another people's
homeland, making changes _ after Oslo almost as before _ that may
yet render real peace unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   It has walled off Arab east Jerusalem with Jewish suburbs. It
has colonized the West Bank, under rules that allow any Israeli, be
he newly arrived from Omsk or Alaska, to settle, while exiled
Palestinians whose family may have lived there for centuries
cannot. Even now it confiscates Palestinian land and water.
</P>
<P>
   All this is natural enough in a people with Jewish history
behind it, and in a state whose neighbors long denied its right
even to exist.
</P>
<P>
   And it does require a leap of faith to believe that the
Palestinians, with no democratic history, few resources, fledgling
institutions and at least as many fundamentalist hotheads as Israel
itself, will quickly be capable of assuring the security of their
future state, let alone Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is just what has to occur. President Clinton's task _
and no one should envy him it _ must be to help persuade Israelis
to make that leap. &QL;

SUN MICROSYSTEMS EXECUTIVE TELLS OF MICROSOFT RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft trial Thursday offered an inside view
of the wary, distrustful relationship between Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., like two scorpions circling each other.
</P>
<P>
   They joined by a common interest in Internet software, a
programming language called Java, developed by Sun. Two years ago,
Microsoft signed a license agreement with Sun to use the Java
technology, but as testimony and e-mail evidence chronicled, there
was always more antagonism than cooperation between the two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view was that when Microsoft was holding out its hand,
there was a knife in that hand and Microsoft was asking us to grab
that knife,'' said Dr. James Gosling, a Sun vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft-Sun clash is an issue because the government
alleges that Microsoft saw Java as a threat to its dominance of the
personal computer software market and illegally used its market
power to squelch the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of Java is that programs written in the language _
from word processors to games _ can run on any operating system,
making it a ``cross-platform'' technology. But Microsoft introduced
its own version of Java tailored for Windows. The company says it
did this to make Java applications work better with Windows, which
helped consumers and software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The government _ and Sun, in a separate contract suit in
California _ say Microsoft's tactics were intended mainly to stifle
Java's cross-platform challenge to Microsoft by making the Windows
version incompatible with versions for other operating systems.
Last month, a federal judge in San Jose sided with Sun and ordered
Microsoft to make its version compatible with Sun's Java within 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   The government introduced documents and e-mail showing that
Microsoft did indeed regard Java as a serious threat. One internal
Microsoft document said that is was a ``strategic objective'' for
the company to ``kill cross-platform Java'' by expanding the
``polluted Java market'' _ an apparent reference to Microsoft's
altered version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail on July 14, 1997, from Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft
executive, to a group of Microsoft executives including chairman
Bill Gates, identified Sun's Java technology as ``our major
threat'' and added that the Internet browsing software of its
rival, Netscape Communications Corp., was Java's ``major
distribution vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft agrees that it viewed Java as a threat, but says its
response was to build a superior version of Java technology. ``What
we saw in court today is that competition between Microsoft and Sun
is strong and vigorous,'' said John Warden, Microsoft's lead trial
lawyer. ``Microsoft competed hard and got ahead of Sun, and Sun is
understandably unhappy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hit that theme repeatedly Thursday in the
cross-examination of Gosling, one of Java's creators.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson asked Gosling a
question that suggested the Microsoft legal team might have made
some headway. The drift of Microsoft's cross-examination, Jackson
said, was that ``Microsoft recognized the significance of what you
did and ran with it. They produced a better product and couldn't
wait for you to catch up. What's your response to that
implication?''
</P>
<P>
   Gosling replied, ``Their version of better was tied to the
Windows platform.'' Later, he added that Microsoft's
Windows-tailored Java seemed intended to ``completely destroy our
goal for Java _ to make it run on many platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   On the courthouse steps Thursday evening, David Boies, the
Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Jackson's inquiry
seemed to indicate that he was impressed by points Microsoft had
made in its cross examination but added that the judge also seemed
impressed by Gosling's answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue in this case is whether Microsoft used its monopoly
power to forcd people to take its incompatible version of Java and
to inhibit the distribution of Sun's Java,'' he said. ``Yes,
Microsoft was trying to compete and make better software, but it
also had its thumb on the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gosling testified that Java's goal was to ``break the coupling
between software applications and the underlying operating system,
effectively decoupling these two markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, to be sure, has a huge vested interest in making sure
that the markets for applications and operating systems remain
tightly coupled. Its dominant position in work-related applications
like word processing and spreadsheets and the dominance of its
Windows operating system reinforce each other.
</P>
<P>
   With Windows running on more than 90 percent of personal
computers sold, Microsoft is a crucial partner, even for rivals
like Sun.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail on Sept. 12, 1996, after visiting senior Microsoft
executives, Eric Schmidt, then Sun's chief technology officer,
urged that Sun collaborate with Microsoft on Java. Schmidt, who is
now chairman of Novell Inc., offered a simple rationale:
</P>
<P>
   ``They will ship 50 million-plus copies of Java next year.''

<P>
   Just over five years ago, President Bill Clinton stood on the
White House lawn watching Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and the
Palestinians' Yasser Arafat shake hands on a historic peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Oslo'' accord truly was historic _ the first such deal
after 45 years of mutual hatred and non-recognition _ and much has
changed since then. Yet much, much more remains to be changed _ and
much has not changed at all, or even changed for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   This paper in 1993 foresaw a long, hard, potholed road to peace.
When Clinton arrives to visit both sides on Dec. 12 he will find
that the road has been even harder, and the potholes deeper, than
skeptics foresaw; and that the road ahead may well prove longer and
harder still, or even lead nowhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate sign of that has been the row over the recent Wye
mini-accord. Palestinians have been angered _ into disorder and
violence, some of them _ to find that a promised release of
Palestinian prisoners in practice meant more common criminals than
of the 2,000-odd political prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government replied last week that freeing people
``with blood on their hands,'' or Hamas members, was no part of
Wye, and that it would stop implementing the accord unless the
Palestinian Authority admitted as much, halted and punished
violence and incitement to it, and renounced Arafat's threat to
declare a Palestinian state next May whether Israel agreed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such roadblocks are removable; Arafat went halfway on Dec. 6,
talking only of ``agreement'' on a Palestinian state, not of a
unilateral declaration if none could be reached. But the spirit
that sets roadblocks up is far harder to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the five years since Oslo, Palestinians gravely doubt
that Rabin's current successor (and old opponent), Benjamin
Netanyahu, really wants peace at all; and he does not trust them to
mean peace when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Next May was supposed _ hence Arafat's deadline _ to see the end
of the ``final-status'' negotiations. They have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The straightforward answer is that things were always
bound to get bad and bitter as the final-status talks, and the
really hard issues such as Jerusalem grew nearer, and neither side
was ever likely to be in a hurry to grapple with those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other answers too, which make a normal
deadlines-concentrate-the-mind optimism hard to share.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, in particular, has dragged its feet, though not without
reason: more Israelis have been killed by terrorism since Oslo than
before it, and Arafat is widely blamed for failing to prevent such
outrages by Hamas and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was shock at suicide bombings that brought Netanyahu to
office; now, having engaged reluctantly (and damagingly late) in
the Oslo and Wye procedures, his government looks on the verge of
collapse thanks to right-wing desertions.
</P>
<P>
   The side that must give up most if a durable peace is to be
found _ Israel _ remains profoundly unwilling to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say nothing has altered. Palestinians do not
govern most of ``their'' land, but nearly all Palestinians are
under their aegis.
</P>
<P>
   And although the result is more of a patchwork than a country,
Netanyahu talks of a Palestinian state in terms that he would have
denounced as treason five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is change overdue only among Israelis. Palestinians and
their media are readier to vilify them than the other way about;
Palestinian hate is a barrier to peace, like Israeli contempt, and
uglier.
</P>
<P>
   However, the onus is inevitably on Israel, for it is Israel that
rules. It is Israel that since 1967 has occupied another people's
homeland, making changes _ after Oslo almost as before _ that may
yet render real peace unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   It has walled off Arab east Jerusalem with Jewish suburbs. It
has colonized the West Bank, under rules that allow any Israeli, be
he newly arrived from Omsk or Alaska, to settle, while exiled
Palestinians whose family may have lived there for centuries
cannot. Even now it confiscates Palestinian land and water.
</P>
<P>
   All this is natural enough in a people with Jewish history
behind it, and in a state whose neighbors long denied its right
even to exist.
</P>
<P>
   And it does require a leap of faith to believe that the
Palestinians, with no democratic history, few resources, fledgling
institutions and at least as many fundamentalist hotheads as Israel
itself, will quickly be capable of assuring the security of their
future state, let alone Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is just what has to occur. President Clinton's task _
and no one should envy him it _ must be to help persuade Israelis
to make that leap. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: Linda Tripp.''

   He showed how a defense lawyer might attack the case against the
president in a trial, by using tapes and videotapes. He attacked
the credibility of Ms. Lewinsky by playing a tape of her telling
Ms. Tripp on the phone how she had learned how to lie and deceive
her whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the issues of the president's conduct in this case so
grave,'' he asked, ``that you would doom the country to additional
months of this ordeal and government paralysis _ on the slimmest of
votes on the House floor and no likely conviction in the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is to begin voting on four separate articles of
impeachment Friday. They charge Clinton with perjury in testimony
before a grand jury, perjury in the Jones lawsuit, obstruction of
justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the committee Republicans, who have a
21-16 majority, have solid support for perjury and obstruction of
justice charges. But Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said he was still
undecided on abuse of power, based on the president's claims of
legal privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are expected to debate the articles vigorously but are
not expected to try to water them down, which might make them more
palatable to Republican moderates. ``We have no interest in
improving what we regard as a fatally flawed proposal,'' said
Julian Epstein, the committee's Democratic counsel.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as it was preparing to hang out the bunting for its 50th
birthday next April, the world's strongest military alliance has
teetered on the brink of real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In backroom discussions, NATO diplomats found they could not
agree on what the alliance was for, what weapons it would threaten
to use and in what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the Soviet threat that once glued NATO and its
16 members together, such disagreements have an ominous feel about
them; however effective it has been in the past, nothing guarantees
that this partnership will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Such existential traumas were successfully covered up at this
week's gathering of NATO foreign ministers. Madeleine Albright, the
American secretary of state, assured her allies that future NATO
missions would take them a bit further afield, but not all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this means the alliance might set off to keep the
peace in the Caucasus or rescue hostages in North Africa, but it
will not be dragged off to fight wars in South America or
Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, beat a tactical
retreat after his proposal that NATO renounce the first use of
nuclear weapons was dismissed as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Other Europeans, for their part, assured Mrs. Albright that they
shared American worries about ballistic missiles and chemical or
biological weapons in the hands of dictators or terrorists. She in
turn promised them that NATO would never abandon its core function
of protecting its members from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no room for complacency about the future of a
partnership that was created half a century ago, in a different
world. Perhaps because they do not follow the mood of the American
Congress closely enough, European governments were thrown into a
state of shock by some of the messages they have received recently
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, American taxpayers have little enthusiasm for an
alliance designed to fight yesterday's wars in Europe. So America's
interest in transatlantic cooperation will be proportional to
Europe's willingness to face future challenges: poison gas, germ
warfare, rogue missiles, ethnic wars on _ or a little beyond _
NATO's periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk makes Europeans feel distinctly queasy. They felt
comfortable with a military structure that was mainly geared to
warding off conventional threats to their own territory _ and where
all the hardest strategic decisions were, and are, taken and
implemented by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, NATO will not disappear overnight, even if the
Europeans dig in their heels and refuse to adapt. But the alliance
could very rapidly lose its place in the pecking order of America's
overseas security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from transatlantic tiffs over military theory, there have
also been squabbles about military practice _ especially in the
Balkans. While Americans have longstanding doubts about Europe's
competence in handling the multiple crises of former Yugoslavia,
the Europeans are now grumbling about the tactics of the United
States in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They say it handled the high-wire diplomacy almost unilaterally
_ and left them alone with the risky job of preparing an
intervention force to stand by, in nearby Macedonia, in case the
cease-fire in Kosovo fails and international monitors there need
rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   To this complaint, Americans will reply that Kosovo would never
have reached boiling point if, at earlier stages in the crisis, the
Europeans had not been complacent.
</P>
<P>
   How much do these differences matter? The practical ones maybe
more than the theory. If NATO ever does break up, the occasion is
likelier to be some real-world crisis than a difference over
mission statements or military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   No strategic theory will compel a NATO government to risk its
soldiers unless it feels vital interests are at stake; and no
doctrinal nicety will stop NATO acting when it sees a deadly
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis _ in which NATO made a highly unusual threat
to intervene in a sovereign state, because the alternative seemed
disastrous _ shows how far practice comes before theory.
</P>
<P>
   No diplomatic formula can foresee all the crises of the future;
that is why NATO should pledge to respect international law, but
not always wait for a U.N. Security Council resolution, which
implies Russian and Chinese consent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet arguments about NATO's mission, and grumblings about its
practice, as in Kosovo, both highlight an important geopolitical
reality. The alliance will not survive, in any solid sense, unless
Europeans and Americans do some hard, honest talking about their
division of labor.
</P>
<P>
   America will not indefinitely bankroll the security of wealthy
countries whose military budgets are a fraction of its own, and
falling _ let alone if those countries are unwilling to adapt to
new security challenges.
</P>
<P>
   As well as tinkering with institutions, European governments
should spend more money on modernizing their arsenals. This does
not mean vastly increasing their power; but it does mean deploying
firepower more efficiently by harnessing information technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a transatlantic partnership in which Europe
pulls more weight can only be developed successfully if Europeans
are convinced of American good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Europeans provide most of the troops for peacekeeping
operations, they need to be assured that America stands ready to
support them with logistics and intelligence and to extract them if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other, very tangible way in which European and
Americans can demonstrate good faith _ and that is by procuring
weapons from one another, or jointly developing new technology to
cope with 21st-century threats.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the defense industry at a crossroads it is
more important than ever that NATO governments face down
protectionist lobbies and ensure themselves the broadest possible
choice of modern weaponry and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   A dense network of relationships between defense companies could
do more than any form of words in a summit communique to keep NATO
intact. &QL;

SMITH MAY BEAT SANDERS TO FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In a surprising twist, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said that cornerback Kevin Smith (sprained back) has a better
chance of playing against the Kansas City Chiefs than Deion Sanders
(sprained toe).
</P>
<P>
   Neither player practiced with the team yesterday because of
rain. And Gailey said he would like to wait until today's practice
before making a final decision on their playing status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin is probably now a little closer than Deion,'' Gailey
said. ``I was encouraged about what Deion did in practice
Wednesday. But I'd like to see him do a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of both players were reversed earlier in the week
when Smith was listed as doubtful on the injury report and Sanders
was listed as questionable. Gailey said the situation is more
indicative of progress by Smith than of Sanders being set back.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mathis and Charlie Williams are still slated to start at
cornerback. Warren frustrated Cowboys running back Chris Warren,
who has missed the past two games with a strained groin, is growing
frustrated with his injury woes this season.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't practice yesterday, and the Cowboys are not optimistic
about his chances for the Chiefs game.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who played the past eight years with the Seahawks, came
to the Cowboys in the off-season to be an insurance policy for
starting running back Emmitt Smith, who has been hampered by a
variety of injuries the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Warren has been the one unable to stay healthy. He also
missed the first three games of the season with a similar groin
injury.
</P>
<P>
   What's most troubling to Warren is that he doesn't have a
history of injury problems, missing only five games over the
previous eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand it,'' Warren, 30, said. ``I've played
with broken ribs before. Nothing has ever kept me from playing
until now.'' Flag fest Among the subplots in Sunday's
Cowboys-Chiefs game is the it shapes up as a possible flag fest.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs are the league's most penalized team with 125
infractions for 1,052 yards, while the Cowboys are third with 112
penalties for 981 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's biggest issue is with pre-snap penalties that have
plagued the Cowboys all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do what it takes to prevent those,'' Gailey said.
``I can live with the judgment calls by the officials after the
ball has been snapped but it's the pre-snap penalties that really
hurt.''

<P>
   Just as it was preparing to hang out the bunting for its 50th
birthday next April, the world's strongest military alliance has
teetered on the brink of real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In backroom discussions, NATO diplomats found they could not
agree on what the alliance was for, what weapons it would threaten
to use and in what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the Soviet threat that once glued NATO and its
16 members together, such disagreements have an ominous feel about
them; however effective it has been in the past, nothing guarantees
that this partnership will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Such existential traumas were successfully covered up at this
week's gathering of NATO foreign ministers. Madeleine Albright, the
American secretary of state, assured her allies that future NATO
missions would take them a bit further afield, but not all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this means the alliance might set off to keep the
peace in the Caucasus or rescue hostages in North Africa, but it
will not be dragged off to fight wars in South America or
Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, beat a tactical
retreat after his proposal that NATO renounce the first use of
nuclear weapons was dismissed as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Other Europeans, for their part, assured Mrs. Albright that they
shared American worries about ballistic missiles and chemical or
biological weapons in the hands of dictators or terrorists. She in
turn promised them that NATO would never abandon its core function
of protecting its members from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no room for complacency about the future of a
partnership that was created half a century ago, in a different
world. Perhaps because they do not follow the mood of the American
Congress closely enough, European governments were thrown into a
state of shock by some of the messages they have received recently
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, American taxpayers have little enthusiasm for an
alliance designed to fight yesterday's wars in Europe. So America's
interest in transatlantic cooperation will be proportional to
Europe's willingness to face future challenges: poison gas, germ
warfare, rogue missiles, ethnic wars on _ or a little beyond _
NATO's periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk makes Europeans feel distinctly queasy. They felt
comfortable with a military structure that was mainly geared to
warding off conventional threats to their own territory _ and where
all the hardest strategic decisions were, and are, taken and
implemented by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, NATO will not disappear overnight, even if the
Europeans dig in their heels and refuse to adapt. But the alliance
could very rapidly lose its place in the pecking order of America's
overseas security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from transatlantic tiffs over military theory, there have
also been squabbles about military practice _ especially in the
Balkans. While Americans have longstanding doubts about Europe's
competence in handling the multiple crises of former Yugoslavia,
the Europeans are now grumbling about the tactics of the United
States in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They say it handled the high-wire diplomacy almost unilaterally
_ and left them alone with the risky job of preparing an
intervention force to stand by, in nearby Macedonia, in case the
cease-fire in Kosovo fails and international monitors there need
rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   To this complaint, Americans will reply that Kosovo would never
have reached boiling point if, at earlier stages in the crisis, the
Europeans had not been complacent.
</P>
<P>
   How much do these differences matter? The practical ones maybe
more than the theory. If NATO ever does break up, the occasion is
likelier to be some real-world crisis than a difference over
mission statements or military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   No strategic theory will compel a NATO government to risk its
soldiers unless it feels vital interests are at stake; and no
doctrinal nicety will stop NATO acting when it sees a deadly
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis _ in which NATO made a highly unusual threat
to intervene in a sovereign state, because the alternative seemed
disastrous _ shows how far practice comes before theory.
</P>
<P>
   No diplomatic formula can foresee all the crises of the future;
that is why NATO should pledge to respect international law, but
not always wait for a U.N. Security Council resolution, which
implies Russian and Chinese consent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet arguments about NATO's mission, and grumblings about its
practice, as in Kosovo, both highlight an important geopolitical
reality. The alliance will not survive, in any solid sense, unless
Europeans and Americans do some hard, honest talking about their
division of labor.
</P>
<P>
   America will not indefinitely bankroll the security of wealthy
countries whose military budgets are a fraction of its own, and
falling _ let alone if those countries are unwilling to adapt to
new security challenges.
</P>
<P>
   As well as tinkering with institutions, European governments
should spend more money on modernizing their arsenals. This does
not mean vastly increasing their power; but it does mean deploying
firepower more efficiently by harnessing information technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a transatlantic partnership in which Europe
pulls more weight can only be developed successfully if Europeans
are convinced of American good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Europeans provide most of the troops for peacekeeping
operations, they need to be assured that America stands ready to
support them with logistics and intelligence and to extract them if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other, very tangible way in which European and
Americans can demonstrate good faith _ and that is by procuring
weapons from one another, or jointly developing new technology to
cope with 21st-century threats.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the defense industry at a crossroads it is
more important than ever that NATO governments face down
protectionist lobbies and ensure themselves the broadest possible
choice of modern weaponry and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   A dense network of relationships between defense companies could
do more than any form of words in a summit communique to keep NATO
intact. &QL;

TEAGUE'S LAST STAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Exhale? Not George Teague. Yes, he'll make his
second consecutive start of the year in Kansas City on Sunday. But
he will be desperately fighting to show he can be a starting free
safety in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   From Green Bay, to Atlanta, to Dallas, to Miami, and back to
Dallas, Teague's six-year tenure has been marked by the
all-too-frequent assertion that he wasn't good enough. At 27, he
has been waived, traded, or demoted more times than he'd care to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how I play and how we do,'' he said, ``these next
few months will probably determine my future. I've got another
chance here to make it as a free safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys gave that chance to Omar Stoutmire. He received most
of the reps with the first team in training camp and most of the
starts in the preseason. At 24, Stoutmire was younger, faster, and
stronger against the run than Teague, which is where the Cowboys
felt they needed the most help going into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Teague began the year as a reserve used primarily in passing
situations. Stoutmire played the run fairly well, but struggled as
the quarterback of the Cowboys' pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   He broke up just two passes and had no interceptions. He was
often replaced in passing situations with Teague. Stoutmire's
demise hastened with the toe injury to Deion Sanders. Without
Sanders the past four weeks, the Cowboys' pass defense has dropped
from 13th to 24th.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the secondary was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good idea of what kind of player George was,''
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``We felt like we'd like to
have one of the younger guys step up and do it. We gave Omar as
much of an opportunity as we could. We just thought it was time to
get a veteran and George has been known as a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey is confident that Teague's insertion
into the starting lineup will not compromise the club's
run-stopping ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like what you gain in other aspects offsets George not
being involved in the running game,'' Gailey said. ``And Omar
hasn't gone out and been one of those guys lighting people up in
the running game. That \Rrunning game\S has not been the
difference. It's pass defense that we need expertise in and wanted
George back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Teague has been here before. Drafted in the first round by the
Green Bay Packers in 1993, Teague started 43 games in three seasons
before the club traded him to Atlanta. The Falcons waived him a
month later and he signed with the Cowboys, where he started eight
games in 1996 after Brock Marion was lost for the season with an
arm injury.
</P>
<P>
   Teague thought he was gone from Dallas for good after the 1996
season, when he signed a three-year, $2.1 million contract to play
free safety for Jimmy Johnson in Miami. But Johnson made him
compete for a job at strong safety, where he'd be needed more for
his play against the run, not the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Teague made six starts for the Dolphins and was benched midway
through the season. The club terminated his contract when he would
not take a paycut in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Jimmy disagreed on a lot of things,'' Teague said.
``They didn't tell me I was playing strong safety until after they
signed me. My strengths have always been as a cover guy. It was
tough because we were not on the same page. I fought through that,
but it was hard with all of the ins-and-outs of the rotation. From
week to week, I didn't know if I was going to be the nickel safety,
or not be playing at all, or be put on the inactive list.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows where he stands with the Cowboys. If he continues to
play well, he'll continue to start. There will be competition for
the job next year, Campo said, but Teague knows he can get ahead of
the game by making big plays the rest of the year. In his first
start against the Saints last week, he had eight tackles and two
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best place, system-wise, for me, and I'd love to
continue playing here,'' said Teague, who signed a two-year deal
with the Cowboys last spring. ``This defense compliments my style
of play, which is aggressive on the ball. They like the free safety
to cover and try to make plays. And that's exactly what I try to
do.''

ARRESTS MADE IN SMUGGLING OF IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)  (js) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and Canadian authorities announced Thursday
that they had broken up a sophisticated ring that smuggled Chinese
immigrants into the United States, and ultimately to New York City,
through a Mohawk Indian reservation along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the ring, made up primarily of Chinese
nationals and members of the Mohawk tribe, transported more than
3,600 Chinese immigrants across the lightly patrolled border along
the St. Lawrence River and into upstate New York during the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 47 people had been indicted for conspiracy
to smuggle aliens into the United States. Of those, 35 have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first large-scale alien smuggling operation we
have encountered on the northern border,'' Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in
announcing the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a dozen of the immigrants who were smuggled in have
been taken into custody. Officials said the immigrants, primarily
young men from Fujian Province, paid as much as $47,000 for the
journey from China.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said she had no information on what types of
companies or businesses the aliens worked in once they arrived in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The break-up of the ring comes three weeks after Attorney
General Janet Reno announced cracking the largest immigrant
smuggling ring to be dismantled in the nation _ an operation that
brought in more than 12,000 people, mainly Indians, Pakistanis,
Syrians and Afghans during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement highlighted the extent to which the
28-square mile Indian reservation, which straddles two Canadian
provinces and one U.S. state, has become a haven for smugglers. The
foggy creeks and wooded islands featured on the Indian territory,
which is known as the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation on the U.S. side
and the Akwesasne Indian Territory in Canada, have long been used
to spirit gasoline, cigarettes, tobacco and drugs between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, more and more of the contraband has been human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geography of the Akwesasne is perfect for smuggling,''
said Thomas Maroney, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of
New York. ``It's in Canada. It's in the United States. It's in
Ontario. It's in Quebec. A look at a map shows you how easy it is
to use the place as a vehicle for smuggling. It isn't just aliens,
though that's what we're involved with here. There have been cases
of alcohol and tobacco going north and drugs going both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
investigation into the smuggling ring began with a tip they
received 18 months ago. But the transport of illegal immigrants
across the Mohawk territory was widely known in the reservation and
surrounding territories.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Pakistani woman drowned when a smuggler's rickety
boat capsized in rough waters between Corwall Island, part of the
Indian territory in Canada, and the U.S. mainland. And residents of
the reservation say they are used to seeing Asian people traveling
across their land at all hours of the day or night, easily evading
the 40-officer tribal police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go outside and it's not uncommon to see people of a
different color going through,'' said Joyce Mitchell, a spokeswoman
for the Mohawk National Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Canadian police broke a smaller immigrant smuggling
ring that was importing Chinese nationals, sending some into the
U.S. through the Mohawk reservation but keeping most of the aliens
in Canada. The tip Canadian authorities received involved
information that not all the top people in that ring had been
captured and that a similar and larger operation was still
functioning. Thursday's announcement concerned that second
syndicate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Authorities said that the ring transported immigrants through
Hong Kong and Taipei and a number of intermediate countries,
including Germany, Brazil, Morocco, France, Greenland and Cuba.
Once in Toronto or Vancouver, the aliens took advantage of Canada's
relatively liberal refugee laws and gained entry by claiming to be
fleeing persecution in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 24,852 individuals applied to Canada's Immigration
and Refugee Board for asylum. The board, a quasi-governmental body,
approved 10,042. But, officials say, it can take up to 12 months to
get a hearing on a refugee claim. In the interim there are no
restrictions on the applicant's freedom. Officials could not say
how many of those whose claims were rejected had been removed from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, individuals who seek asylum in the United States
are incarcerated while awaiting a hearing on their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian police officials said that while waiting for their
hearings the aliens who had been brought to Toronto and Vancouver
by the smuggling ring melted into the large Asian populations in
those cities. Eventually they were driven to Corwall Island,
Ontario, in the St. Lawrence River about 50 miles southwest of
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers then moved the immigrants by boat to the Mohawk
reservation in upstate New York or to a swatch of Indian territory
in Quebec on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, where they can
easily cross into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement the tribe has with the U.S. and Canadian
governments, there are no border controls between the Quebec and
New York sections of the reservation.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S MIDEAST JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 11:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's trip to the Middle East this weekend,
originally intended to nudge along the Wye peace agreement, now
looks certain to encounter turbulence. The Wye agreement is
bedeviled by delays, mutual recriminations and new violence. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is fighting for his
government's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these circumstances and his own impeachment problems,
Clinton must be realistic about what he can hope to achieve. His
main goal should be to make sure that the deal he brokered in
Maryland survives with minimal damage and delay. To succeed, he
will need help from both Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader. The two men must handle the visit with
restraint and not seek to exploit it for political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the visit is Clinton's trip to Gaza City next
Monday to witness a vote by the Palestinian National Council to
nullify language in the Palestinian Charter that calls for Israel's
destruction. Israel is now saying that only a roll-call vote at
that meeting would be acceptable. The demand is unreasonable, as
Clinton, just by attending, will lend American authority to the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although Netanyahu suggested that Clinton go to Gaza for the
charter vote, the Israeli government is now concerned that the
visit will be seen as somehow endorsing or even certifying
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is misplaced. The Oslo peace agreements specify that
the question of Palestinian statehood is to be negotiated between
the two sides at a later date, and Washington has no interest in
bypassing that understanding. Clinton's helicopter flight to the
new Gaza airport and attendance at the Palestinian Council meeting
will not confer sovereignty on the Palestinian authorities, and
neither Arafat nor Netanyahu should suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the threat that his government may fall in a
no-confidence vote later this month, Netanyahu may be tempted to
rally right-wing support by undercutting the Wye agreement. A
strong majority of Israelis want a negotiated peace with the
Palestinians. Netanyahu should rebuild his political strength by
aligning himself with that centrist majority.

CHICAGO MAYOR'S LESSONS FOR OTHER AMERICAN CITIES

<P>
   In a small, cluttered antechamber just off the mayor's office,
Richard M. Daley leans forward over a conference table like an
excited schoolboy, balancing on the front legs of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   He is talking about public education. Not all his sentences have
verbs. Some stream off to nowhere. He pauses occasionally to chew
on an unlit cigar. But in the process of making George Bush sound
like Cicero, Daley is actually quite clear.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Chicago's future is keeping the middle class. And the
key to keeping the middle class is to improve the schools.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, Daley announced this week that he will be
seeking a third full term as mayor of Chicago. He will probably
trounce his one declared opponent and anyone else who enters the
race. He won his previous election handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Daley operation delivered 207,000
nominating signatures to the board of election commissioners, eight
times the number required by law. The Chicago Tribune called this
display ``Schwarzenegger-esque.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chicagoans are now thinking of Daley as they used to think
of his father: mayor for life. Richard J. Daley ran Chicago with a
rod of iron for 21 years, and was considered one of the most
impressive mayors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   His eldest son has personally picked 19 of the 50 city council
members, filling vacancies created by those who have died, retired,
or (not infrequently) gone to prison.
</P>
<P>
   He has established strong ties to the business community,
precluding any serious Republican opposition and availing himself
of deep campaign pockets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has defended minority set-asides for city
contracts. His campaign manager is black; some of his top
appointments, including the chairman of his school reform board of
trustees, are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is surprising; in political shrewdness, he is
obviously his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to dismiss Daley as a skillful
vote-gatherer whose policies would not work without the magic of
the Daley name. This mayor has much to teach America's other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, if he succeeds in his bid to reform the public
schools, he will do something that no big-city mayor has ever done,
including his father.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's political success was hardly preordained. He failed the
bar exam twice before passing. As a state senator, he was named by
Chicago magazine as one of the ten worst legislators in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In his first bid for mayor in 1983, he finished third in a
three-person Democratic primary. Nonetheless, he inched his way
back until, in 1989, he finally reached City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has focused like a laser on making the city a
better place for the middle class to live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think cities should be dirty and filthy,'' he says. As
he is driven around Chicago, he makes lists: abandoned cars to be
towed away, trash piles to be moved, fences to be mended.
</P>
<P>
   His ``graffiti-blasters'' program has attracted attention as far
away as Milan. Spray paint is banned in the city; there is a
24-hour anti-graffiti hot line; city crews have the legal right to
remove graffiti from private property.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's positive passion is greenery: the city has planted
over 200,000 trees. Pavements have been widened and street lights
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cynical admit that Chicago, already an architectural
gem, is a prettier city because of Daley's green thumb and
fastidious housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he tended his beloved trees, Daley realized that he was
missing the forest. No amount of greenery could stem the flight
from a school system long considered one of the country's worst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the mayor struck a deal with the Republican-controlled
state legislature to wrest control of the schools away from the
city's semi-independent school board and its impenetrable
bureaucracy. ``I'm the only mayor that wanted the responsibility,''
Daley reflects.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. The system was chronically in debt; students
performed abysmally by national standards; striking teachers were a
ritual of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers speculated that the Republicans gave the system
to Daley in the hope that it would blow up in his face. Instead,
the gamble has paid off handsomely for him.
</P>
<P>
   His reform team has deflated the bureaucracy, sacked teachers at
the worst-performing schools, and demanded that students actually
learn things before being promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores are up. After years of fiscal crises, the budget is
balanced. The city has just negotiated a new agreement with the
teachers' union, almost a year before the old one was due to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mayor realizes where the proof of the pudding lies:
whether middle-class parents en masse will feel happy to send their
children to inner-city schools. Making sure they do is the task for
a third term.
</P>
<P>
   If Daley has the enthusiasm of a schoolboy when he talks about
his plans, friends and enemies know that he can also be the class
bully. Unprepared staff members are often on the receiving end of
his tantrums. So is anyone who stands in the way of his grand
plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the city began preparing for the 1996 Democratic National
Convention, the mayor was keen to have decorative wrought-iron
fences erected along the route most visitors would be taking, at
the property-owners' expense. When some balked, city inspectors
began to take special interest in their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a patience boiling-point of about ten degrees,'' notes
one observer. And he never forgets an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the people of Chicago seem to like their mayor, in
part because of his passion for the city.
</P>
<P>
   He says quite credibly that he has no aspirations for higher
office. His mangled syntax is refreshing; most politicians, though
more articulate, say less.
</P>
<P>
   When your Economist columnist Lexington begins a question, ``One
hundred years from now...,'' the mayor's brow furrows, like a pupil
at the blackboard who knows that a tough one may be coming. But
it's a softball: ``How would you like to be remembered?''
</P>
<P>
   He answers almost immediately: ``Education mayor. That's it.''
Of course, some of those trees may still be around as well. &QL;

GOP, DEMOCRATIC COUNSELS SEE CLINTON'S CONDUCT DIFFERENTLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican and Democratic counsels for the
House Judiciary Committee on Thursday offered starkly different
characterizations of President Clinton's conduct and its impact on
the country in closing arguments at the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Clinton's effort to conceal his extramarital
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as
criminal, Republican counsel David Schippers accused the president
of using the power of the Oval Office to weave a cover-up that
involved lying under oath and trying to influence the testimony of
his friends and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sex or private conduct,'' Schippers told the
committee of 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats. ``It is about
multiple obstructions of justice, perjury, false and misleading
statements, witness tamperings and abuses of power, all committed
or orchestrated by the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers called on the panel to recommend impeachment to the
full House, saying that to do anything less would amount to
``dishonor and abandonment of the high principles'' that Americans
rely on ``for our safety and happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't impeach ... then no House of Representatives will
ever be able to impeach again,'' the Republican counsel declared.
``The bar will be so high that only a convicted felon or a traitor
will need to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic counsel Abbe Lowell, however, implored the committee
not to be swayed by the argument that Clinton's transgressions were
as serious as those that led to President Nixon's resignation over
Watergate. Lowell said the president's conduct amounted to no more
than ``insignificant offenses'' concocted not by an ``errant
president but ... an unfaithful husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not surprising, improper or impeachable for the
president to want to hide his improper relationship,'' Lowell said,
adding that most people would think it reasonable that the
president would want to keep it ``from anyone and everyone he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling impeachment ``the equivalent of the death penalty'' for
a president, he warned that the panel could be taking the first
step in a process that might end in the ``horror'' of a Senate
trial that would disrupt the business of the country next year.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said the trial, which would necessarily dwell on details
of the sexual relationship, would further erode Congress' standing
with an American public already fed up with scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been telling us for months, and in every way
they can, they do not want to see a trial in the Senate where the
issues will be sex, and they want there to be censure and other
alternatives to impeachment as the means to demonstrate that the
president is not above the law,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   In their presentations, both counsels relied heavily on
videotaped exerpts of President Clinton's deposition last January
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, which has since been
settled. The videotape, which had not been seen publicly before,
was released by the committee Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers used it to bolster his argument that Clinton knowingly
lied under oath and to reinforce his claim the president had
engaged in a pattern of conspiracy from late 1997 through August of
this year to hide the details of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, on the other hand, used it to contend that Clinton
testified truthfully, given the  &UR; `` &LR; twisted &UR; ''  &LR; definition of
sexual relations presented to him by Jones' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Where Schippers saw ``a performance ... calculated to mislead
and deceive'' on the videotape, Lowell said he saw only the
tortured ``confusion'' of a president trying to figure out the
legalistic definition of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell played an excerpt from the Jan. 17 deposition, in which
lawyers for Jones, Clinton and state Trooper Danny Ferguson argue
over what definition of sexual relations will be adopted for the
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the trial judge strikes two of the three paragraphs from
the definition originally given to the president and says she fears
that he might not grasp the significance of all of the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew some collusion was going on to embarrass him, not
about sexual harassment but about a consensual affair,'' Lowell
said. ``So, his responses were an attempt to answer evasively. ...
We all know he could have _ should have _ acted better. But are his
responses so hard to understand that you would impeach him?''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, who offered a day-by-day, point-by-point account of
what he portrayed as a conspiracy designed to subvert the rule of
law, played his own video clips in which Clinton repeatedly
insisted that his relationship with Lewinsky was not sexual.
</P>
<P>
   In one clip, Clinton read an affidavit from Lewinsky also
denying sexual relations and then told Jones' lawyers that her
statements were ``absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority counsel also stressed that Clinton had lied when he
told Jones' lawyers that he could not recall ever being alone with
Lewinsky in or near the Oval Office when, according to Starr's
investigation, they were alone on at least 21 occasions, 11 of
which involved sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers observed sarcastically: ``Life was so much simpler
(for the president) before they found that dress, wasn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was in reference to a dress that Lewinsky kept with
DNA evidence on it belonging to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The remark angered a few members of the committee, including
Republicans who said it was an unnecessary slap at the president.
Some also criticized Schippers for beginning his presentation by
observing that ``many other allegations of possible serious
wrongdoing'' by the president are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchison, R-Ark., accused Schippers of ``overstepping
his bounds'' with the remark.
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Gregory Craig also issued a response
to the Schippers presentation, saying that it had reduced a
``solemn constitutional process ... to a level of innuendo, anger
and unfair, unsubstantiated charges.''

EMBATTLED EDS LURES CEO FROM CABLE &AMP; WIRELESS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ALLEN R. MYERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Electronic Data Systems, seeking a marquee leader able
to restore its primacy in computer services, named Richard H.
Brown, chief executive of Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, as its own chairman
and chief executive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is leaving Cable &AMP; Wireless after just 29 months,
brings a reputation as a tireless rainmaker, dealmaker and
management shuffler, credited by analysts with raising the London
company's sales, profits and share price in his short tenure there.
</P>
<P>
   To do likewise at EDS, he will have to revive a company that is
demoralized and uncertain in a rapidly changing, increasingly
competitive business.
</P>
<P>
   As of Jan. 15, he will replace Lester Alberthal, who resigned in
August under pressure from board members and major shareholders.
The company must also find a new chief financial officer and vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 51-year-old native of New Brunswick, N.J., avoided
giving EDS any immediate prescriptions. ``When I get to EDS in
January, my highest priority is going to be to meet clients, visit
with the people at EDS and understand firsthand the business I'm
in,'' he said from London in a telephone news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal and some other managers, had been criticized by
employees and customers as aloof, although technically brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   If the board's search committee, led by former Secretary of
State James Baker, reached outside the computer services industry,
it did not reach too far. Computer services are converging with
telecommunications, and Brown also has experience at Ameritech, one
of the largest of the regional Bell companies. At Cable &AMP; Wireless,
he bought MCI Worldcom's Internet and data operations.

<P>
   In 1995, the mayor struck a deal with the Republican-controlled
state legislature to wrest control of the schools away from the
city's semi-independent school board and its impenetrable
bureaucracy. ``I'm the only mayor that wanted the responsibility,''
Daley reflects.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. The system was chronically in debt; students
performed abysmally by national standards; striking teachers were a
ritual of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers speculated that the Republicans gave the system
to Daley in the hope that it would blow up in his face. Instead,
the gamble has paid off handsomely for him.
</P>
<P>
   His reform team has deflated the bureaucracy, sacked teachers at
the worst-performing schools, and demanded that students actually
learn things before being promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores are up. After years of fiscal crises, the budget is
balanced. The city has just negotiated a new agreement with the
teachers' union, almost a year before the old one was due to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mayor realizes where the proof of the pudding lies:
whether middle-class parents en masse will feel happy to send their
children to inner-city schools. Making sure they do is the task for
a third term.
</P>
<P>
   If Daley has the enthusiasm of a schoolboy when he talks about
his plans, friends and enemies know that he can also be the class
bully. Unprepared staff members are often on the receiving end of
his tantrums. So is anyone who stands in the way of his grand
plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the city began preparing for the 1996 Democratic National
Convention, the mayor was keen to have decorative wrought-iron
fences erected along the route most visitors would be taking, at
the property-owners' expense. When some balked, city inspectors
began to take special interest in their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a patience boiling-point of about ten degrees,'' notes
one observer. And he never forgets an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the people of Chicago seem to like their mayor, in
part because of his passion for the city.
</P>
<P>
   He says quite credibly that he has no aspirations for higher
office. His mangled syntax is refreshing; most politicians, though
more articulate, say less.
</P>
<P>
   When your Economist columnist Lexington begins a question, ``One
hundred years from now...,'' the mayor's brow furrows, like a pupil
at the blackboard who knows that a tough one may be coming. But
it's a softball: ``How would you like to be remembered?''
</P>
<P>
   He answers almost immediately: ``Education mayor. That's it.''
Of course, some of those trees may still be around as well. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING AND SEOUL _ Hundreds of South Korean tourists have been
making the first visits to a long-forbidden part of their country _
the northern side of the world's last Cold-War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   After being bused along roads lined with barbed wire and guarded
by soldiers, they found not much to see apart from Diamond
Mountain. Nevertheless, North Korea expects to collect $150 million
a year from the South for allowing the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans too want to visit, and they know what they
want to see: a large hole which they suspect is meant to become a
site for developing nuclear weapons. North Korea wants $300 million
to arrange that trip.
</P>
<P>
   America refuses to pay. Now an agreement by which North Korea is
supposed to freeze its nuclear program could be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Amid heightened tensions, the South Korean government is
concerned at what it sees as America's new hawkish stand. China,
one of North Korea's few remaining friends, has called for
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan prepares to duck again, amid reports that the
North Koreans are preparing to test-fire another missile (the
first, they claimed, was launching a satellite) in its direction.
</P>
<P>
   America's special envoy on Korea, William Perry, was in the
region this week. While in Seoul, the South's president, Kim Dae
Jung, told him: ``North Korea is at a crossroads. It can either
risk war through military provocations, or open up.''
</P>
<P>
   In response North Korea declared its army of 1.2 million
``determined to annihilate the U.S. imperialists, Japanese
reactionaries and South Korean puppets at one stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Since an armistice ended the Korean war in 1953, the
peninsula has been divided by a heavily fortified demilitarized
zone, four kilometers (2 miles) wide. South of it stand 670,000
South Korean troops, backed by 37,000 Americans. America has
another 40,000 servicemen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most defense analysts think North Korea, with its economy on the
brink of collapse and much of its population underfed, is incapable
of a sustained attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet incapacity does not mean it would not try. The regime has
always been unpredictable, if not crazy, its remoteness from
reality reinforced by a stifling personality cult built around the
late ``Great Leader,'' Kim Il Sung, and now extended to his son,
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation for foreign money has not made the regime any less
dangerous. Far from it: missile sales have been one way it has
raised foreign currency. It has offered to stop that trade, but
again at a price.
</P>
<P>
   The present controversy is over a 1994 deal in which North Korea
agreed to freeze its nuclear-weapons program in return for the
supply of fuel oil. This would keep it going while America, South
Korea and Japan built for it two nuclear-power plants of a type
with limited ability to produce weapons-grade material.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans now claim to have evidence that North Korea may be
breaking the agreement, by building a giant underground complex
that they believe is nuclear-related.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government reckons there is time to negotiate with
Pyongyang. Since he was elected a year ago, Kim has been pursuing a
``sunshine policy'' in an attempt to thaw out relations with the
North. The recent tourist trips are one small, but significant,
result.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has told Perry that North Korea is belligerent because it is
weak. To dispel suggestions of a rift, Kim and Perry agreed to
respond ``sternly'' to North Korean provocation, but also said that
this was not the time for Seoul to give up its policy of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Some in South Korea believe the two approaches may prove to be a
useful carrot and stick. But China was the next stop on Perry's
trip, and it has its own agenda. China backed the North during the
Korean war, but some foreign analysts think it understands far less
about the hermit kingdom than many outsiders assume.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly China is frustrated that North Korea's behavior is
giving Japan good reason to take a more prominent role in regional
security. In the longer term, China's objective is probably to keep
other powers, especially (but not only) Japan, from having too much
influence in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   To justify that, China looks to history: the Sino-Japanese war
of 1894 started in Korea, and ended in a humiliating defeat for
China. Japan also used Korea as the base for its 1937 invasion of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Perry too, however, has a domestic agenda. The 1994 accord is
considered a major foreign-policy success by President Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-dominated Congress approved funding for it
only provided he could supply written assurances that North Korea
was not violating the deal. Paying $300 million to find out about
the hole in the ground would send Congress ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has suggested payment might instead be made with
humanitarian aid, such as grain and medicine, and backed up by
normalizing diplomatic ties and the ending of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal, his officials say, should not be confined to the
suspected nuclear site, but part of a broader package negotiated
with the North to ensure more openness on its part. Otherwise, they
fear, more sinister holes will appear in the ground along with more
demands for money for the right to visit them. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: on Thursday. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton called Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., on Thursday to
thank him for his statement earlier this week opposing impeachment,
according to the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, a bitter critic of Clinton's over the past six years,
said on Tuesday that impeaching the president would be a ``grave
mistake'' for the nation and a disaster for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, using a variety of intermediaries in the
business community and among political consultants who work with
both parties, have also reached out to Republican leaders to
negotiate a quick end to the impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of detailed legal and constitutional defense of
the president before the House Judiciary Committee, the White House
is now turning to a subtle attempt to persuade Republicans that
impeaching a popular president would seriously damage the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials point to D'Amato's remarks as
representative of a substantial number of Republicans who want to
punish the president but not contravene the will of the public,
which opposes impeachment by a wide margin. D'Amato lost a
re-election bid last month after 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be a unified national party and have a country
that is unified, we have to get this behind us,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   A political adviser to the president who also has close ties to
Republicans said that he believed D'Amato's comments were carefully
timed and cleared by senior Republicans as a signal to House
Republicans to stop short of sending articles of impeachment to the
Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither D'Amato nor any of his aides returned telephone calls
seeking comment. John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, said that Lott had not spoken to D'Amato before
his remarks and that D'Amato spoke for himself, not the Senate
leadership
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for one Republican who currently favors censure
over impeachment, Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, said on Thursday
that Clinton has not yet adequately explained or apologized for his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern,
and that Tauzin's vote was still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a detailed, heart-felt apology from the president, I
think he's sealed his fate,'' said Ken Johnson, Tauzin's spokesman.
``Right now, the only person who can save the president from the
embarrassment of impeachment is the president himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was receptive Thursday to the censure resolution
proposed by House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that people who in good faith come
forward with a reasonable solution to put this matter behind us, in
a prompt way, short of impeachment, should be considered,''
Lockhart said. ``And looking at that proposal, I think it meets the
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure resolution says that Clinton violated the
trust of the public and dishonored his office, deserving the
``censure and condemnation of the American people and the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution leaves open the possibility of the indictment of
Clinton after he leaves office, but it does not require him to pay
a fine or appear personally before the House to answer the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions have been suggested by others, including
William Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, who
appeared as a witness before the Judiciary Committee on behalf of
the White House on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart would not definitively answer whether Clinton was
willing to accept a fine as part of a censure deal, saying the
question had not yet been formally raised by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the possibility of indictment after Clinton leaves
office was an ``acknowledgment of reality'' because the
Constitution does not grant a former president immunity from
criminal prosecution for acts while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not commented on the impeachment debate this week
but revealed a bit of his state of mind at an observance marking
Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned in ways large and small in the last six years
that there is within every person a scale of justice,'' the
president said, ``and that people can too easily be herded into
hatred and extremism often out of a belief that they have absolute
truth and therefore are entitled to absolute power, that they can
ignore any constitution, any laws, override any facts.''

HIGH COURT POSTPONES EXECUTION OF CANADIAN IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Canada)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court delayed the execution Thursday
night of a Canadian whose government had appealed for his life,
saying he had been denied the right to speak with consular
officials as guaranteed by international treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The stay, one of several over the last decade for the inmate,
Joseph Stanley Faulder, came 30 minutes before he was to receive a
lethal injection in the Texas death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Supreme Court said the justices needed more
time to consider Faulder's case. While Faulder has another appeal
before the Supreme Court, Texas prison officials said the stay was
granted to consider the consular issue.
</P>
<P>
   The court set no date for hearing the appeal, but Texas
officials said no execution date could be scheduled for another 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   While last-minute appeals in death penalty cases are common, it
was Faulder's standing as a Canadian citizen that brought
international attention to the case. The Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations requires that people arrested in a foreign
country be allowed to seek assistance from their country's consul.
</P>
<P>
   That courtesy was not extended to Faulder when he was arrested
in 1977 and charged with fatally beating and stabbing a wealthy
75-year-old woman in a July 1975 robbery. Texas officials said they
did not realize that Faulder, who had a Texas driver's license, was
from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 15 years after his arrest that his family, who
believed him to be dead, found out that he was alive on death row
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As his execution date neared, the Canadian government, which
outlawed the death penalty in 1976, asked that the sentence be
commuted. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked the state to
delay the execution until issues regarding Faulder's rights under
the treaty could be examined.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and human rights groups are concerned that
failure to give adequate consideration to the treaty would lead to
abuse against Americans arrested in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, spent much of the afternoon Thursday in a holding
area next to the room where he was to die after a federal appeals
panel in New Orleans struck down a stay issued on Wednesday by a
U.S. District Court judge in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   That judge, Sam Sparks, had ordered state officials to postpone
Faulder's death until a Dec. 21 hearing could be conducted to
determine whether there had been a fair clemency process. That
issue grew from an appeal raised on behalf of all death row inmates
in which lawyers argued that the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons
and Parole had failed to conduct its work in public, to provide
reasons for its decisions or to record its votes.
</P>
<P>
   A prison spokesman, Larry Fitzgerald, who told Faulder of the
stay, said the inmate was surprised but viewed the move as a
temporary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very happy man,'' said Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the appeals, Faulder has not disputed the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in an interview with the CBC last month, he was quoted
as saying: ``I don't say that I shouldn't be here. I say that death
row should not exist.''

   BONN _ Nothing underlines the German paradox better than a new
debate, even shriller than its predecessors, over the Nazi era and
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd, on the face of it, that the row has re-erupted
now, and so bitterly. After all, it is more than 50 years since
Hitler's death, eight since Germany was reunited. And for the first
time a chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has come to office with no
personal experience of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   A country more or less like any other at last? That is what
Schroder implied in his first government declaration to parliament
last month. Germany, he said, had ``the self-confidence of a nation
that has come of age, that feels neither superior nor inferior to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also very much what Martin Walser, a 71-year-old author,
claimed a few weeks earlier in a speech after receiving the
country's highest book award. But he went further, charging that,
although Germany had become a normal country, its shame over the
Holocaust was being exploited (he did not define by whom).
</P>
<P>
   Auschwitz, Walser declared before the nation's political and
social elite, should not become a ``tool of intimidation, a moral
cudgel or just a compulsory exercise.'' He for one had learned to
turn away when this part of Germany's past was drummed home ``every
day in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Walser got a big hand from most present, but notably not from
Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany's Jews: he stayed seated when
others rose to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis waited until Nov. 9, the 60th anniversary of
``Kristallnacht,'' when Hitler's thugs smashed Jewish shops and
synagogues, before replying. But he then accused the author, long
best-known as a wry critic of Germany's postwar consumer society,
of ``spiritual arson'' likely to delight and egg on neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the row has been joined by other authors and
editorial writers, politicians and historians; and it has gained so
much in venom that a worried ex-president, Richard von Weizsacker,
begged the participants to ``cool it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most cutting ripostes to Bubis came from Klaus von
Dohnanyi, a former Social Democratic mayor of Hamburg whose father
was a resistance hero killed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Would Jews really have shown more courage than most other
Germans under Hitler, he asked, if they had been spared the gas
chambers and ``only'' cripples, homosexuals and gypsies had been
massacred?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Semite,'' snapped back Bubis. He and von Dohnanyi met on
Dec. 8 and resolved some of their differences, but the general
debate rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? Partly because of the claims now being made against
German firms by lawyers, particularly in America, acting on behalf
of former slave laborers under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Germans grumble that the government has paid
compensation enough to Nazi victims already (albeit little for
slave labor). The huge sums being demanded in the wake of those
extracted earlier this year from the Swiss are, they reckon, only
partly justified at best.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Walser did not directly refer to slave laborers,
most of whom were not, in fact, Jews; but, with the claims issue
highly topical, his talk about exploiting German shame struck a
powerful chord and helps account for the force of the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to it than that, though. Walser was right when he
referred to the flood of material _ television documentaries,
books, plays _ about the Nazi era now pouring forth in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What a contrast with the drought until only about two decades
ago, when the American television serial ``Holocaust'' finally
brought the breakthrough. Plenty of old people who lived through
Hitler's Reich, whether as fans or victims, find the near nonstop
reminders of it nowadays hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   For the young, though, it is an often-fascinating
semi-historical drama for which they feel little or no guilt. It is
notable, for instance, that they are flocking to Potsdam to see the
first comprehensive show in Germany since the Second World War of
films and pictures by Leni Riefenstahl, a photographer Hitler
favored.
</P>
<P>
   Should they feel guilt? Behind the current debate lurks the
question how to keep the shame and warning of the Nazi era alive
for a generation which did not experience it.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Walser's message is that Auschwitz is a matter for
personal conscience, not oft-repeated ritual that eventually
becomes little more than lip service. Perhaps, but will that
formula do, when no survivors of the Nazi era remain?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing reveals the dilemma better than the long-running battle
over a scheme to build a memorial to victims of the Holocaust near
the Brandenburg Gate in the center of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Some do not want a memorial at all, many more do _ but think the
current plan for some 2,500 concrete pillars spreading across a
swathe of central Berlin far too intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   A decision was due before the September general election but was
shelved. Now there are hints that the scheme may be dropped in
favor of some sort of link-up with Steven Spielberg's Shoah
Foundation and its filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Stand by for more agonized debate on the past, and how to mark
it, as the government prepares to move east next summer from Bonn
to the old and new capital Berlin. &QL;

 &HT;    Supreme Court puts execution on hold
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The U.S. Supreme Court, with just 15 minutes to
spare, blocked the execution Thursday of a Canadian-born killer
whose case had triggered the latest international controversy over
how Texas puts to death its worst criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaboration, the high court put the execution on hold _
presumably for more time to review Faulder's pending appeal. Court
spokesman Ed Turner said no date for that review had been set.
</P>
<P>
   The decision means Faulder will live into early 1999, since
executions cannot be rescheduled for at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   At age 61, he would have been the oldest Texas convict ever
executed and would have been the first Canadian to be executed in
the United States since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far out. That suits me,'' prison officials quoted Faulder as
responding when they gave him the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he hoped the decision will help others down the
road,'' prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said. ``He was a very
happy man. Stan didn't have a lot of emotion. He wasn't dancing,
but he obviously was very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Five relatives of Faulder's victim who were in Huntsville to
witness the execution _ including her son and two granddaughters _
left the prison without speaking to reporters. ``I'm sorry for the
Phillips family and this is not about the Phillips family,'' Sandra
Babcock, Faulder's attorney, said. ``What they suffered was tragic.
I'm very sorry for what happened to them. That's not the issue
here. The issue here is whether Stan Faulder received a fair trial.
And he did not.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Faulder's case has stirred intense interest
from death-penalty opponents worldwide and from Canadian officials
who asked that he be spared. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright joined with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy in seeking a reprieve for Faulder and, on Wednesday, the
president of the American Bar Association joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was sentenced to death for the July, 1975, murder of
Inez Phillips, the matriarch of an East Texas oil family. Her body
was found inside her Gladewater home with her skull fractured and a
butcher knife buried 6 1/2 inches in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder has never denied his guilt, confessing at one point that
he had become enraged after finding her safe empty. But in recent
appeals, Faulder's attorneys argued that his execution would
violate an international treaty that requires that foreign citizens
jailed in the United States be allowed to contact a diplomat from
their country for help. Texas officials said he was not given that
option because he had a Colorado drivers license and had applied
for a Texas license at the time, and he never claimed Canadian
citizenship until long after he had been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest court in the land has now spoken,'' said Karen
Hughes, press secretary to Gov. George W. Bush, who had been under
pressure in recent days to stop the execution. ``The governor hopes
the courts will review and resolve this legal matter as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's last-minute intervention by the Supreme Court marked
only the latest of several legal turns in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Until midday, his execution had remained on hold. U.S. District
Judge Sam Sparks of Austin on Wednesday had blocked the executions
of both Faulder and Danny Lee Barber until lingering legal
questions about the secretive process by which Texas considers
clemency for its condemned criminals could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then
overturned Sparks' order in Faulder's case. Their reason: ``Federal
courts lack jurisdiction to stay the execution'' in civil-rights
cases such as Faulder's.
</P>
<P>
   Three other judges on the same court reached the opposite
conclusion Wednesday night, when they upheld Sparks' order in
Barber's case _ a decision that spared him from the executioner's
needle for at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's attorneys immediately asked the New Orleans-based
court for a hearing to resolve the conflict between the two
decisions. With no reply to their request, they asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to halt the execution _ a request that increasingly
has been routinely denied.
</P>
<P>
   By 2 p.m., the former auto mechanic had been escorted under
heavy guard from the Ellis prison just outside Huntsville, where
death row is located, to the ``death house'' inside an historic
downtown Huntsville prison known as ``The Walls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the people of Canada for being supportive of
me,'' Faulder told prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald as he arrived
at a holding cell just outside the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   At about 5:45 p.m., the Supreme Court blocked the execution.
Within two hours, Faulder was back in his death row cell.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day earlier, Barber, 43, had walked out of the same
red-brick bungalow that houses Texas' execution chamber to return
to his death row cell, thanks to Sparks' order and the decision by
the New Orleans court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted he got a stay, but the last couple of days have
been pretty hellish,'' Babcock said. ``I think it's absolutely
abominable that we learned that he had a stay 15 minutes before his
scheduled execution.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, state officials said they likely will seek to
dissolve the Supreme Court's order so Faulder's execution can
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks has scheduled a Dec. 21 hearing in Austin to review
whether Texas' clemency process is legally flawed, as Faulder's
attorneys insist. A separate hearing on the same issue has been
scheduled the following day in Barber's case.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office continued Thursday to be flooded with phone calls
and mail about the case. By day's end, aides estimated the governor
would have received 2,000 letters _ a volume that, while much
larger than most execution cases, is far less than the 9,000
letters received about Karla Faye Tucker's execution last February.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, a convicted Houston pickax killer who said she had
become a Christian and changed, was the first woman executed by the
state for a crime since the Civil War. Her case also spurred
international interest.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a Bush spokeswoman, said that by Thursday, the
governor had received 1,769 letters and e-mail messages _ 1,623 of
them supporting clemency for Faulder. Of the total, 915 were from
Canada and most of the rest were from outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976. Texas has executed
163 people since it started using the death penalty again 14 years
ago this month, the most of any state.

MCI REPORTEDLY PLANS TO CUT 2,000 JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, N.C., Okla.) (bl) 
By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Ever since Worldcom Inc. took over MCI Communications Corp. in
September, a rueful joke has been making the rounds at MCI's
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bernie is done, this place will look like a neutron bomb
hit it,'' one MCI employee says, referring to Worldcom chairman
Bernard Ebbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' another asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the building will be standing, but the people will be
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers' penchant for cutting jobs as a way to make his mergers
reach their aggressive financial goals is well known. But at MCI,
far fewer employees will lose their jobs as a result of the $37
billion takeover than some in the industry _ including within MCI _
had expected, and the cuts will not be concentrated in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the company, which is now known as MCI Worldcom Inc.,
intends to inform about 2,000 employees, or 2.7 percent of its
75,000-person work force, that their jobs will be eliminated,
according to executives close to the company. Some on Wall Street
had speculated that the company would eliminate as many as 3,750
jobs, or 5 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the job cuts would be concentrated in the
combined company's network operations unit and in its software
development operation. The jobs would be lost in dozens of places
but primarily in Richardson, Texas, Carey, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The joke around headquarters had emerged from the fear that
Ebbers would focus his job-cutting attention on corporate
operations like the legal department, the regulatory affairs group
and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of broad cuts at headquarters, Ebbers' team appears
to have asked that existing employees in Washington take on broad
new responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts are part of a program to cut $900 million from the
combined company's sales, general and administrative expenses next
year. It was unclear Thursday what portion of that goal the company
intends to meet by eliminating jobs, but an annual cost of $100,000
a worker for 2,000 workers would yield savings of $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Ebbers intends to cut the combined company's costs by
$2.5 billion next year. Apart from the administrative savings, most
of the cost reduction are expected to come from moving
communications traffic off of systems leased from other carriers
and onto networks owned by MCI Worldcom.

U.S., RUSSIAN SPACEWALKERS MARK ENTRANCE INTO SPACE STATION 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The U.S. and Russian crew of the shuttle Endeavour
made an emotional first entrance into the new international space
station Thursday, stopping to commemorate the occasion before
tackling a long list of move-in tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely super place. It's unbelievable,'' gushed
Endeavour commander Robert Cabana as he and Russian cosmonaut
Sergei Krikalev floated side-by-side from the shuttle into the
dimly lit American ``Unity'' module. ``Words can't express it. It's
unbelievable to be part of such a great program, bringing all these
countries together, working in space for everybody's betterment.''
</P>
<P>
   Krikalev and U.S. astronaut Nancy Curry embraced and turned lazy
somersaults in the soft pink and off-white confines of the boxy
module. With its half-dozen docking ports, Unity serves as a
structural gateway to future Russian and American modules as well
as to the European, Japanese and Canadian equipment that will be
added during a six-year construction period.
</P>
<P>
   The six astronauts made their way through about 75 feet of
previously uninhabited corridors, pausing to open a half-dozen
hatches before reaching the furthest recesses of the Russian
``Zarya'' power and propulsion module. The trek took nearly 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya was joined to Unity by the shuttle crew Sunday. Before
floating from Unity to Zarya, Cabana and Krikalev shook hands
firmly, then hugged one another before leading their colleagues
into the more confined grey-green interior of the Russian module.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how much this means to all of us,'' said Cabana,
recalling the five-year effort to work post-Cold War Russia into a
floundering effort by the United States and the other partners to
develop a new global outpost. ``We can't wait to see the outcome of
what we've started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's small,'' said a grinning Krikalev. ``We need more
modules.''
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour, with the first two of the station's module towering
eight stories above its combination airlock and docking assembly,
soared 247 miles over the Indian Ocean, just south of the Saudi
Arabian peninsula, as the astronauts made their way aboard the
station at 1:54 p.m., CST.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside Unity, the astronauts' first task literally was to
turn on the lights. Even though a spacewalk by astronauts Jerry
Ross and Jim Newman on Monday night routed electrical power from
the Russian to the U.S. module, Unity was launched with its master
interior light circuit mistakenly switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Ground control teams had hoped to warm the cold module to a
comfortable 70 degrees for its first occupants, but they overshot
their mark. With all the human activity and the activation of
electronic gear, the interior of Unity warmed to 84 degrees.
Cabana's crew snaked air ducts from Endeavour into the station
modules and installed fans for circulation. The shuttle life
support systems removed the carbon dioxide and excess humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew was to retreat from the two station modules
Friday after installing equipment and storing clothing, a laptop
computer and other gear aboard the fledgling station for its first
resident crew.
</P>
<P>
   That three-man crew, of which Krikalev will be a member, is to
take residence in early 2000. Its arrival, however, depends on
Russia's launching of the massive service module, a crew living
quarters. Its assembly has been stalled by that country's economic
problems. The module is scheduled for launching no sooner than July
1999. It, too, will be joined to the Zarya module.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most crucial of the tasks the Endeavour astronauts
were to perform before their retreat was the hookup of three large
electronics boxes and cabling to complete the installation of a
satellite communications system. Astronauts Ross and Newman began
the task during a spacewalk Wednesday night in which they attached
a pair of suit-case sized antennas to the outside of Zarya.
</P>
<P>
   The communications gear will permit NASA's mission control team
in Houston to monitor the station when it is not staffed and send
commands over a satellite network rather than through Russia's
control facility in suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Krikalev and Currie joined forces to install a new charge
controller on one of Zarya's six power storage batteries. The
controller faltered soon after the module's Nov. 20 launching. The
device automatically regulates the power dispensed by the battery
after it has been charge by the module's power-generating solar
panels.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least glamourous of the chores was the removal of 774
bolts used to secure protective panels within Zarya before its
launching, a task assigned to Endeavour pilot Rick Sturckow.
</P>
<P>
   The path traced by the astronauts into the new station Thursday
began at the base of the shuttle's docking assembly.
</P>
<P>
   With successive hatch openings, the astronauts made their way
from the shuttle into an eight-foot long, cone-shaped docking
compartment secured to Unity, then into the 18-foot long American
module and through a second eight-foot long docking cone. Then it
was into the 41-foot-long Russian module, which is segmented into a
small and a large chamber.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ When a country habitually lacks people or governments
capable of keeping essential services going, outsiders sooner or
later begin to fill the gap. One word for this is colonization. It
is early days, but something of the kind may be starting to happen
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is when extreme danger is involved. Take
Russia's old and badly managed nuclear weapons and nuclear-power
plants. Westerners are already heavily involved in keeping them
safe.
</P>
<P>
   American money _ $453 million this year _ pays for monitoring
gadgets at nuclear-weapons sites and for the conversion of
bomb-making material into a less dangerous form.
</P>
<P>
   Another $30 million goes to help scientists _ potentially just
as dangerous _ who might take their skills to North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is spending $104 million on nuclear safety,
including two new centers to train some 1,000 monitors to keep tabs
on Russia's nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries have programs of their own. Norway is trying to
salvage clapped-out nuclear submarines off the Kola Peninsula, in
northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is spending around $3.3 million on the Sosnovy Bor
nuclear-power station close to it, and is also paying for St.
Petersburg's sewage, which slurps into the Baltic, to be better
treated before it does.
</P>
<P>
   A growing legion of foreigners is involved in trying to help
Russia in other vital areas. Foreign doctors and nurses are trying,
for instance, to stem the spread of infectious diseases. Foreign
policemen have become enmeshed in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, an American philanthropist who outspends most
foreign governments in his do-gooding in Russia, supports 4,000 of
Russia's best teachers, as well as such things as book-buying by
public libraries, stipends for scientists, public health, and
retraining jobless army officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most central function of government _ law and order
_ foreigners, albeit for commercial rather than for charitable
reasons, are vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to be safe in Russia is to hire a western security
company to guard your business and yourself; and to buy western
insurance in case that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   True, the legwork is usually subcontracted to Russians,
including shadowy figures still on the state payroll. But it is the
foreign ingredient that makes such deals stick.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it lead? The Russian state is withering away. Tax
revenues, in dollar terms, mean that Russia, with 29 times as many
people, has a government budget the same size as Finland's. If the
ruble falls further (and it slipped 10 percent last week), the
comparison will be with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting hole is filled partly with sheer misery: children
huddling hungrily in unheated, lunchless schools, taught by an
unpaid teacher with tattered textbooks; epidemics of tuberculosis
and AIDS; horrible leakages of dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid helps a bit _ a few billion dollars goes a lot
further than it used to _ but is a mere blip on a vast, wretched,
dangerous landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It has become plain that Russia's financial woes could last for
many years. That is prompting a big, uncomfortable, shift in
western ideas about it. Outside involvement, whether public or
private, charitable or commercial, was supposed to be temporary, as
it has been in other post-communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia, for instance, gratefully received western aid a few
years ago, but now no longer needs it; indeed, the Baltic states
are now sending aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Few people thought in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed,
that Russia would still barely be able to feed itself seven years
later. But the outlook has changed. ``We are looking at a
dependency culture which could last a generation or more,'' worries
a senior western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are going to find this increasingly irritating.
Nordic countries, for example, are already worrying that next
winter, as in this one, they will find their sleeves being tugged
for fuel, food and medicine by local governments in impoverished
towns in Russia's desperate far north.
</P>
<P>
   The more Russia gets used to western welfare, the less incentive
it will have to replace it through its own native efforts. And as
the central government seems increasingly less worth helping
directly, outsiders are looking more and more to regional and local
bigwigs with whom to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Many patriotic Russians do not like the sound of this. It is not
only paranoid nationalists who note that many managers in private
western security firms are former soldiers and intelligence people.
</P>
<P>
   Even quite sensible Russian politicians fear that the West's
interest is to keep Russia as a place from which to extract
minerals and to sell consumer goods to, rather than helping it
become an industrial or agricultural power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary Russians do not yet seem to mind. They welcome the
prospect of prosperity and the rule of law, whoever helps to bring
it. But this creeping colonization will have costs in terms of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some historical precedents are striking. In China, for example,
foreign countries in the 19th century took over key ports and ran
them until the 1930s. When western countries ran parts of Russia
during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik revolution of
1917, the result in Murmansk, for instance, was a local ruble
backed by sterling.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of westerners coming in to help run Russian cities, or
even whole regions, still seems implausible. But already Russia's
outlying areas are running themselves with less and less say-so
from the center.
</P>
<P>
   A law on mineral concessions to foreigners is going through
Russia's Duma. Once western companies are granted rights to exploit
Russian minerals, questions of law and order, and who should
enforce them, are bound to follow.
</P>
<P>
   It is imaginable that future investment might be conditional on
customs-free zones administered by outsiders. A Swiss company, SGS,
one of a number offering services to countries that do not trust
their own officials, is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems unthinkable now may look quite pragmatic in a three
months' time,'' says Scott Blacklin, head of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Is it surprising that western taxpayers and Russian nationalists
could both feel queasy? &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: CHARITY PLAN AIDED WRONG NBA PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the organizers of a Dec. 19 exhibition game with locked-out
National Basketball Association players promised to devote some of
the proceeds to tapped-out players, mockery was inevitable.
Thursday's decision to reverse themselves was a triumph of sense
over silliness.
</P>
<P>
   It was inappropriate for the game's masterminds, the agents
David Falk and Arn Tellem, to create an event starring rich players
that would benefit other players pinched by the loss of paychecks
(two, so far) to a greater degree than it would UNICEF, the game's
designated real charity.
</P>
<P>
   That any group of players, who all earned at least $275,000 last
season, could become an ad hoc charity cited with UNICEF _ which
would get at least $100,000 _ was misguided, at best.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the proceeds that would have gone to players will go to
charities in Philadelphia, the site of the canceled NBA All-Star
Game. Organizers of the event, which will be seen on Showtime, hope
to raise $750,000 for charities, including UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players had their hearts in the right place, but it's too
bad people, especially the media, misconstrued it all,'' said
Curtis Polk, who co-founded Falk Associates Management Enterprises.
``We suggested that a fund be built because if the season is
canceled, there'd be real hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The players are suffering, whether or not they did
well with their money. Losing money hurts no matter what you
make.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the cash-strapped players considered home equity loans? If
their bank said no to a loan, didn't they know that Champion says
yes?
</P>
<P>
   The players need not plead penury. True, they will not be paid
until a season starts, but their union in the past month has sent
each player a check worth a tidy $40,000 for licensing rights. And
more money is coming: the union hasn't doled out a cent from its
$20 million strike fund.
</P>
<P>
   Falk &AMP; Company didn't get the players-as-charity idea all wrong
_ they just picked the wrong players. Maybe they should have been
helping the truly needy, the older players, the ones who never made
millions or who don't get decent pensions, the ones who need money
to afford their rent, mortgages, prescriptions or wives' funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're thinking of the guys who came up against hard
times, not guys deprived of their salary because of a lockout,''
said Joe Garagiola, president of the Baseball Assistance Team,
which provides grants to former major leaguers and Negro leaguers
and their families who face dire times.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola, the former major leaguer and broadcaster, spoke
Thursday on the telephone to a social worker who was overseeing the
care of a former major leaguer's two children. The assistance team
has been providing grants since 1994 for the boy and girl, who were
placed in foster care when their father was placed in drug
rehabilitation and their mother was imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, he's going to be able to buy his kids some
Christmas gifts,'' Garagiola said from his home in Arizona. ``But
he's really going to have to prove himself to get his kids back.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the case of Varlin Law, one of the former pitcher Vernon
Law's six kids. Varlin, 36, needed a bone marrow transplant to
treat leukemia, but his medical insurance wouldn't pay for it all.
The assistance team paid some of his huge medical expenses and
keeps helping by paying mortgage and utility costs, giving Varlin
Law, his wife and their three children some peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Varlin is recovering, Garagiola said, and Vernon will speak of
BAT's help at the organization's annual banquet on Jan. 19 in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard things I never thought I'd hear,'' Garagiola said.
``A tough third baseman told me, `I got to get out of the house.'
'' The man said that his wife was driving him crazy, that he needed
two days to himself. ``Then he began to cry. He said, `You don't
know what it's like to see your wife walking around in diapers.' ''
Garagiola paused briefly. ``Man, that really gets to you.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the assistance team will raise between $800,000 and
$900,000 and disburse about $750,000 in 108 grants, some large,
some small. About 75 percent of the organization's funding comes
through the annual dinner, but it also raised money from a softball
tournament organized by Yankee pitcher David Cone, an auction of
autographed uniforms from this year's All-Stars and golf
tournaments run by former players like Ralph Branca and Bob Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   And if Garagiola is asked for an autograph, he requests a $10
check to BAT. He said he raised about $5,000 a year that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there must be some old basketball players who need
help, not guys who just missed a paycheck,'' Garagiola said. ``It's
admirable for guys to be concerned with other guys losing
paychecks, but I wonder if they're thinking about the guys who made
it possible for them to make what they're making.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if current NBA players wanted to help the older
ones, it wasn't always easy. Sometimes it's difficult to find those
who need help, sometimes tough to persuade them to take the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same pride that makes them professionals,'' Garagiola
said, ``sometimes makes them too proud to accept charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he read from a letter written by the widow of a former
Yankee, a World Series winner: ``It's important to express the fact
that you are my family. I couldn't be blessed with a better family
than BAT.''

   MOSCOW _ When a country habitually lacks people or governments
capable of keeping essential services going, outsiders sooner or
later begin to fill the gap. One word for this is colonization. It
is early days, but something of the kind may be starting to happen
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is when extreme danger is involved. Take
Russia's old and badly managed nuclear weapons and nuclear-power
plants. Westerners are already heavily involved in keeping them
safe.
</P>
<P>
   American money _ $453 million this year _ pays for monitoring
gadgets at nuclear-weapons sites and for the conversion of
bomb-making material into a less dangerous form.
</P>
<P>
   Another $30 million goes to help scientists _ potentially just
as dangerous _ who might take their skills to North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is spending $104 million on nuclear safety,
including two new centers to train some 1,000 monitors to keep tabs
on Russia's nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries have programs of their own. Norway is trying to
salvage clapped-out nuclear submarines off the Kola Peninsula, in
northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is spending around $3.3 million on the Sosnovy Bor
nuclear-power station close to it, and is also paying for St.
Petersburg's sewage, which slurps into the Baltic, to be better
treated before it does.
</P>
<P>
   A growing legion of foreigners is involved in trying to help
Russia in other vital areas. Foreign doctors and nurses are trying,
for instance, to stem the spread of infectious diseases. Foreign
policemen have become enmeshed in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, an American philanthropist who outspends most
foreign governments in his do-gooding in Russia, supports 4,000 of
Russia's best teachers, as well as such things as book-buying by
public libraries, stipends for scientists, public health, and
retraining jobless army officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most central function of government _ law and order
_ foreigners, albeit for commercial rather than for charitable
reasons, are vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to be safe in Russia is to hire a western security
company to guard your business and yourself; and to buy western
insurance in case that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   True, the legwork is usually subcontracted to Russians,
including shadowy figures still on the state payroll. But it is the
foreign ingredient that makes such deals stick.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it lead? The Russian state is withering away. Tax
revenues, in dollar terms, mean that Russia, with 29 times as many
people, has a government budget the same size as Finland's. If the
ruble falls further (and it slipped 10 percent last week), the
comparison will be with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting hole is filled partly with sheer misery: children
huddling hungrily in unheated, lunchless schools, taught by an
unpaid teacher with tattered textbooks; epidemics of tuberculosis
and AIDS; horrible leakages of dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid helps a bit _ a few billion dollars goes a lot
further than it used to _ but is a mere blip on a vast, wretched,
dangerous landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It has become plain that Russia's financial woes could last for
many years. That is prompting a big, uncomfortable, shift in
western ideas about it. Outside involvement, whether public or
private, charitable or commercial, was supposed to be temporary, as
it has been in other post-communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia, for instance, gratefully received western aid a few
years ago, but now no longer needs it; indeed, the Baltic states
are now sending aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Few people thought in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed,
that Russia would still barely be able to feed itself seven years
later. But the outlook has changed. ``We are looking at a
dependency culture which could last a generation or more,'' worries
a senior western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are going to find this increasingly irritating.
Nordic countries, for example, are already worrying that next
winter, as in this one, they will find their sleeves being tugged
for fuel, food and medicine by local governments in impoverished
towns in Russia's desperate far north.
</P>
<P>
   The more Russia gets used to western welfare, the less incentive
it will have to replace it through its own native efforts. And as
the central government seems increasingly less worth helping
directly, outsiders are looking more and more to regional and local
bigwigs with whom to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Many patriotic Russians do not like the sound of this. It is not
only paranoid nationalists who note that many managers in private
western security firms are former soldiers and intelligence people.
</P>
<P>
   Even quite sensible Russian politicians fear that the West's
interest is to keep Russia as a place from which to extract
minerals and to sell consumer goods to, rather than helping it
become an industrial or agricultural power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary Russians do not yet seem to mind. They welcome the
prospect of prosperity and the rule of law, whoever helps to bring
it. But this creeping colonization will have costs in terms of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some historical precedents are striking. In China, for example,
foreign countries in the 19th century took over key ports and ran
them until the 1930s. When western countries ran parts of Russia
during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik revolution of
1917, the result in Murmansk, for instance, was a local ruble
backed by sterling.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of westerners coming in to help run Russian cities, or
even whole regions, still seems implausible. But already Russia's
outlying areas are running themselves with less and less say-so
from the center.
</P>
<P>
   A law on mineral concessions to foreigners is going through
Russia's Duma. Once western companies are granted rights to exploit
Russian minerals, questions of law and order, and who should
enforce them, are bound to follow.
</P>
<P>
   It is imaginable that future investment might be conditional on
customs-free zones administered by outsiders. A Swiss company, SGS,
one of a number offering services to countries that do not trust
their own officials, is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems unthinkable now may look quite pragmatic in a three
months' time,'' says Scott Blacklin, head of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Is it surprising that western taxpayers and Russian nationalists
could both feel queasy? &QL;

 &HT;    Golfer shoots teen during robbery
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A golfer at a metro Atlanta country club shot a
student in the face Thursday afternoon after the youth and two
fellow students tried to rob a foursome at gunpoint on the golf
course's 15th hole, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they suspect the teen-agers are involved in a
string of bold, daylight robberies that for months have victimized
golfers at the Hidden Hills Golf and Country Club in east DeKalb
County less than a mile from a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded student remained in critical condition Thursday
night at a local hospital that police declined to name. They would
not release his name because he is a juvenile. Detectives said they
intend to charge him and his two cohorts with attempted robbery,
kidnapping and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   All three students had been suspended from Redan High School,
but detectives could not say what prompted the disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   The golfing foursome was traveling in three golf carts on a
wooded trail between holes about 4 p.m. when they were accosted by
the robbers, said DeKalb Sgt. Ron Eunice.
</P>
<P>
   As the second cart rounded a small curve, the golfers
encountered the three robbers, at least two of them armed, who had
been lying prone on the ground. The robbers leaped up, grabbed the
cart's two occupants, and forced them face-down on the ground at
gunpoint and began rifling through their pockets, Eunice said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the third cart rounded the curve.
</P>
<P>
   When the driver, whom detectives declined to name for his own
safety, saw the robbery in progress, he pulled a gun from his golf
bag and fired, striking one of the robbers in the face, Eunice
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two other robbers ran away. But detectives said they have
``good information'' on their identities and had detained a
teen-ager for questioning Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they have not charged the golfer who fired the
shot and that, based on their preliminary investigation, they
probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for him,'' said club member Ted Marvin when he learned of
the shooting Thursday afternoon. ``This is one of my favorite
places to be. We come out here to unwind, to get away from the
world. It's a sad commentary when you have to worry out on the
course.''
</P>
<P>
   The golf course snakes through an upscale neighborhood of newer
suburban homes.
</P>
<P>
   The club has complained repeatedly about students using the golf
course as a cut-through, said DeKalb County school spokesman
Spencer Ragsdale. ``We told them over and over not to trespass on
their property,'' said Ragsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Thursday that robbers have been plaguing the
golfers for months, even on the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, police arrested a 16-year-old Redan student at the
golf course shortly after two masked robbers on the fourth tee
stole cellular phones and a pager from golfers, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, whose name remains confidential because he is a
juvenile, was charged with robbery after police saw him toss one of
the stolen telephones into the woods, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the golfers had been warned that it was becoming a
pattern,'' said club member Fred Myrer, a Gwinnett County sheriff's
deputy.

U.S. HIGH COURT PUTS CANADIAN'S EXECUTION ON HOLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday halted the execution of a
Canadian murderer, saying it wants more time to consider the claims
of the 61-year-old man who confessed to bludgeoning an elderly
woman and then burying a butcher knife in her chest.
</P>
<P>
   The stay was granted about 30 minutes before Joseph Stanley
Faulder, convicted in the 1975 murder of the Gladewater, Texas,
woman, was to be led into the death chamber at the Walls Unit in
Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald broke word of the stay to
Faulder, who was being held in a cell a short distance from the
death chamber, shortly before 6 p.m. CST
</P>
<P>
   ``Far out, that suits me,'' Faulder responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very happy man,'' Fitzgerald said. ``He again thanked
the Canadian people and the Canadian media who helped to focus
attention on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   That Faulder was notified of the stay only minutes before the
scheduled 6 p.m. execution, was ``absolutely abominable,'' said
Sandra Babcock, his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock, who was one of two people Faulder asked to witness the
execution, detailed the convoluted series of legal actions to save
her client, blasting the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for
alleged irregularities in its clemency considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted, ecstatic,'' she said. ``But half an hour ago,
I was saying goodbye to my client for the last time. He was saying
goodbye to his sister and niece, who are here. He found out about
the stay just minutes before the appointed hour of his execution.
That is cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it had appeared Wednesday that Faulder might escape his
date with the executioner based on his claims that Texas' clemency
process is unconstitutional, that issue was never raised in the
high court, said Doug Danzeiser, an assistant attorney general who
handled the case for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Danzeiser said, the Supreme Court granted the stay
while it determines if it wants to hold formal arguments on claims
that Faulder's rights had been violated under international law and
that prosecutors suppressed evidence at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Maurie Levin, an Austin attorney involved in Faulder's class
action lawsuit over Texas' clemency process, said some lawyers were
speculating that the Supreme Court may well have granted a stay
knowing the clemency issue remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Since the only issues in Faulder's case pending before the
Supreme Court involved international law and suppression of
evidence, it could halt the execution only on those issues, Levin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have it in their mind that they think they want to
look at the clemency process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Texas Gov. George W. Bush said the
governor ``hopes the courts will review and resolve this legal
matter as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has said all along that the courts are the proper
place to address the legal issues in this case,'' said Karen
Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion over what won Faulder the stay is the
fact that two different panels of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled differently Thursday on the clemency issue,
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin halted
the executions of Faulder and another killer, Danny Barber.
</P>
<P>
   Barber was sentenced to die for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise
Ingram at her home in Balch Springs, a suburb southeast of Dallas.
He also confessed to three other slayings for which he received
life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks found that since the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles
casts its votes on clemency in secrecy there is no way to determine
whether the Texas process meets due process requirements that the
Supreme Court has said must exist.
</P>
<P>
   The state appealed Sparks' rulings to the 5th Circuit. One
three-judge panel overturned the stay in Faulder's case, but
another three-judge panel refused to in Barber's case.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, who would have been the first Canadian to be executed
in the United States since 1952, had been on Texas' death row 21
years.
</P>
<P>
   His death sentence focused international opposition on Texas'
death penalty, with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy
joining U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in calling for a
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, an auto mechanic who had served time in Canada for auto
theft, never denied that he had fatally beat and stabbed
75-year-old Inez Phillips during a 1975 robbery at her Gladewater
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say that I shouldn't be here,'' he told Canadian
television reporters in November. ``I say that death row should not
exist. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Much criticism of Texas centered on the allegation that state
authorities had violated an international treaty in not allowing
Faulder to contact Canadian consular officials after he was
arrested. Texas authorities said the killer was carrying a Colorado
drivers license at the time of his arrest, and his nationality was
not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time did we prevent or prohibit him from calling the
Canadian Embassy,'' former Gregg County District Attorney Odis Hill
told The Associated Press. ``If he thought that he got such a raw
deal and that the embassy could have helped, don't you think he
would have contacted them before he sat on death row for 15
years?''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years elapsed before his family and the Canadian
government learned of his incarceration in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A new execution date cannot be set for Faulder unless the
Supreme Court lifts its stay; under state law, at least 30 days
must elapse between the lifting of a stay and the setting of a new
death date.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Supreme Court also leaves standing orders by
Sparks, the federal judge, to conduct evidentiary hearings on the
clemency procedures in Texas. Sparks set hearing dates of Dec. 21
and Dec. 22 in Faulder's and Barber's cases, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering the hearings, Sparks took a swipe at the Texas
Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for not
settling the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court bemoans the fact that neither of the state's
highest courts have ruled on the merits of Faulder's claims or
stayed the execution to give themselves time to consider the
merits,'' Sparks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's claims that Texas' clemency procedures are
constitutionally flawed are nearly identical to the claims that
attorneys for Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in
Texas since the 1800s, raised last year before she was executed.
Tucker, however, never was granted a stay on those claims.
</P>
<P>
   In his Faulder opinion, Sparks noted that at the time Tucker
raised her claims, there was no case law laying out a
constitutional right to clemency under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   After Tucker was executed, though, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
in the case of an Ohio prisoner who challenged that state's parole
procedures. In that case, Sparks noted, five justices ``agreed that
a death-row inmate has a life interest in avoiding execution
separate and independent from his life and liberty interests at
stake in his trial and sentencing, and therefore `some minimal
procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court did not specify what process would
meet minimal standards, Sparks wrote, ``it is unclear where the
Texas procedure would fall'' because the parole board does not
specify how it reaches its decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unclear how the board can document that its procedures
are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures at all,''
Sparks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Atwood, president of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty and one of Tucker's attorneys, praised the Supreme
Court's decision and the pressure Canadian capital punishment
opponents had applied in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for them, this execution would have gone forward,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's niece, Barbara Allen, 39, of Jasper, Alberta, said she
was ``ecstatic'' about the stay, then noted the word hardly
conveyed the level of emotion she felt.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had visited her uncle Thursday afternoon _ her
fourth visit with him since her arrival Saturday _ and found him
composed. ``He has had a long time to prepare for this,'' she said.
``But he was emotional, too. When we left, I said, 'See you
tomorrow,' and I will.''

   ATLANTA _ Barry Larkin will be there for the taking, if the deal
is right. So will Greg Vaughn and Fernando Vina. The Kevin Brown
sweepstakes could go straight through the roof of the Opryland
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball executives convene in Nashville today for five days of
talks as the major leagues conduct their first winter meetings
since 1992. And while there has already been plenty of action thus
far in both the trade and free agent markets, there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings begin with Brown seeking the highest bidder and
Toronto still listening for the right deal to trade five-time Cy
Young winner Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, having already signed or acquired
outfielders Brian Jordan and Otis Nixon, second baseman Bret Boone
and pitcher Mike Remlinger, are not expected to be a player in the
remaining bartering.
</P>
<P>
   But left fielder Ryan Klesko's future remains cloudy. His name
has been linked with Atlanta's discussions with the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays, who are said to be offering right-hander Esteban Yan (the
former Brave farmhand) and either outfielders Quinton McCracken or
Randy Winn.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Blue Jays had hoped to deal Clemens before the
meetings began, trade talks are now expected to drag through the
weekend. That could steal come spontaneity from the Brown auction,
which is expected to go beyond $84 million (at six years).
</P>
<P>
   A primary reason the meetings were discontinued five years ago
was the executives' distaste for how agents manipulated the
proceedings to drive up contract offers, a practice Scott Boras,
Brown's agent, is quite ready to resume. Colorado, Baltimore and
San Diego are among the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds may part with Larkin, the club captain, who is incensed
at Boone's departure and notified Cincinnati brass it can trade
him, but only to Los Angeles, San Diego, St. Louis, Texas or the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, while squeezing every dime to stay alive in the
Brown bidding, are shopping Vaughn, their top home run hitter, as
well as pitchers Joey Hamilton, Donne Wall and Dan Miceli.

 &HT;    Stopping Stecker key for Ga. Southern
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Western Illinois, which plays top-ranked Georgia
Southern in a semifinal round of the I-AA playoffs Saturday at
Paulson Stadium in Statesboro, features 1997 consensus All-America
running back Aaron Stecker on the cover of its media guide.
</P>
<P>
   The glossy presence of the 5-foot-10, 205-pound senior, who
holds 29 offensive records at the Gateway Conference school in
Macomb, Ill., should have been expected. As a junior, he rushed for
2,293 yards and 28 touchdowns on an 11-2 Leatherneck team.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, however, Stecker, who missed two games this year
because of a groin injury, will share the spotlight with a Georgia
Southern player having a remarkable season of his own. Georgia
Southern (13-0), which has posted 492 yards of offense and 43.7
points a game, will counter Stecker with redshirt freshman Adrian
Peterson, a 5-10, 207-pound combination of power and speed from
Alachua, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In setting 34 school, conference and national records this
season, Peterson rushed for 2,342 yards and 32 touchdowns. His
rushing yardage total is more than six teams in the Southern
Conference, as well as Georgia Tech (2,021) and Georgia (1,674).
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron had a great junior year for us, and even though he's
been injured, he's still our main man on offense,'' Western
Illinois coach Randy Ball said. ``He's got all of the ingredients
you want in a back: He's got speed, he can make you miss, and he
can run over people. He's a complete deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stecker was by far the most impressive I-AA back Ball had seen _
before the ninth-year head coach started to watch videotapes of
Peterson and his exploits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen enough of him,'' Ball said. ``It's amazing he's at
Georgia Southern. He could play at a lot of places in the country.
I just wish he was down there with his brother (linebacker Michael
Peterson) at Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   With Adrian Peterson working with junior quarterback Greg Hill,
Georgia Southern fought back from deficits to defeat Colgate and
Connecticut in its previous playoff games. Against UConn last
Saturday, Peterson eclipsed the 200-yard rushing mark for the sixth
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no earthly idea that he had 232 yards until I saw the
stat sheet after the game,'' Georgia Southern second-year coach
Paul Johnson said. ``I've run out of ways to describe him. I guess
we sort of take what he does for granted now. But if you had a
class of players like him, it wouldn't take long to call the roll.
There's not that many in his class.''

A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR BAFFERT _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Only one thing seemed impossible for Bob Baffert in
1997: It seemed impossible he could do even better in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But he has surpassed himself this season, with his Santa
Anita-based barn leading North America in earnings and major-race
winners, probably enough to give the 45-year-old Baffert his second
straight Eclipse Award as outstanding trainer. And he can add to
his lead this weekend at Hollywood Park when he runs Premier
Property and Prime Timber in the $450,000 Hollywood Futurity on
Saturday and Excellent Meeting in the $200,000 Hollywood Starlet on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `How could I beat last year?' '' Baffert said,
while admitting he's not the reflective type. ``This year, we beat
it, and now it's `What can we do next year?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been an altogether easy season for Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   His most talented 3-year-old, Santa Anita Derby winner Indian
Charlie, was retired after injuring himself in the Kentucky Derby.
His most talented 2-year-old, Del Mar Futurity winner Worldly
Manner, was sold out from under him. Last year's Derby and
Preakness winner, Silver Charm, was as much a handful as ever on
his way to earning $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the Derby and Preakness again this year with Real
Quiet, yet seems to remember this year's Triple Crown more for the
disappointment of losing the Belmont Stakes in a photo finish.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert himself _ glib, unpretentious, iconoclastic _ began to
wear thin for some people during the summer when he engaged in
verbal sniping with Skip Away trainer Sonny Hine and Hollywood Park
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what a year.
</P>
<P>
   His barn's earnings: $11.9 million (not counting Silver Charm's
$2.4 million for winning the Dubai World Cup) in '98, after $8.8
million in '97. Baffert leads Bill Mott by more than $2 million,
according to Daily Racing Form statistics through last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His major victories: Baffert won five Grade I races _ accounted
for by Real Quiet (two), Indian Charlie, Excellent Meeting and
Silverbulletday. That's one more than in '97. Hine also won five
Grade I's this year _ but all were by Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   His Breeders' Cup day: Baffert ran 1-2 in the Juvenile Fillies
with Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting, and second in the
Classic with Silver Charm _ his best Breeders' Cup yet.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's races, the 1 1/16-mile Futurity for 2-year-olds
and the 1 1/16-mile Starlet for 2-year-old fillies, also are Grade
I's. Baffert would be the first trainer to win both in the same
year.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has been telling people that Aaron Jones' Prime Timber
is his Real Quiet for '99. In other words, a sleeper. But there's
not much else to compare.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet didn't get good until Baffert put him in longer
races; the '97 Hollywood Futurity was only his second victory in
nine starts. But Prime Timber is 2 for 2, both races being sprints,
the latter a narrow allowance victory at 7 { furlongs on Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be ridden by Chris McCarron on Saturday while regular
jockey Gary Stevens is in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Earnhardt's Premier Property, ridden by David Flores, will
be favored in the six-horse field. He's 3 for 3, all in sprints,
and has never trailed, winning the 7-furlong Hollywood Prevue by 3{
lengths on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how the son of Out of Place will handle two
turns and the possibility he'll be challenged for the early lead _
by Norfolk Stakes winner Buck Trout and Eddie Delahoussaye and D.
Wayne Lukas-trained Tactical Cat and Laffit Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be able to get it (the distance),'' Baffert said
from his Santa Anita barn. ``He doesn't move like a dirt-bike speed
horse. He's got that long stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has already trained six 2-year-old stakes winners in
'98, including Exploit, a popular pick for the May 1 Kentucky Derby
after his victory in the Brown &AMP; Williamson last month at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the Derby winner is in my barn,'' Baffert said. ``I
just don't know which stall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Futurity will share the Saturday card with the $500,000
Hollywood Turf Cup (with Yagli and Dushyantor, second and third to
Buck's Boy in the Breeders' Cup Turf) and the $100,000 Vernon O.
Underwood Stakes for sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Baffert will be favored again in the Starlet with John
and Betty Mabee's Excellent Meeting, whose four defeats in seven
starts include two seconds to stablemate Silverbulletday and a
second to stablemate Hookedonthefeelin. Excellent Meeting won the
Del Mar Debutante and the Oak Leaf and is clearly the leader of the
local 2-year-old fillies while Silverbulletday races back east.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, with Kent Desormeaux riding, will try to come
from off the pace in what's expected to be a six-horse race.
California Cup Juvenile Fillies winner Lacquaria and Western Woman
look like the front-runners. Rayelle is the other prominent
stretch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Starlet program is the $100,000 Dahlia Handicap for
fillies and mares. &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons lost out on a winner in Glover
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New Orleans Saints defensive tackle La'Roi Glover may
not make the Pro Bowl this season because it's hard for third-year
players on mediocre teams to do. But if he doesn't make the squad,
which will be announced next Wednesday, it won't be because he's
not worthy. The 6-2, 285-pounder is fourth on his team with 57
tackles, and leads all interior linemen with 10 sacks. He also has
an interception, and has forced three fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons (11-2) play at New Orleans (6-7) Sunday, there
will be no player on the Saints' defense who could cause more
problems for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If the Saints play a lot of the ``Bear'' defense they used so
much in last week's 22-3 win over Dallas, in which the Cowboys had
a meager 8 rushing yards, Glover will line up at nose guard.
</P>
<P>
   While matching up against Atlanta center Robbie Tobeck, Glover
will try to use his outstanding speed and quickness to get in the
backfield and also open up a blitz lane for linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cowboys, he sacked Troy Aikman twice and tackled
Emmitt Smith twice for losses. He was named NFC Defensive Player of
the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who was waived after a year with the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he would try hard, had a chance to be pretty good,
but no one predicted the way La'Roi turned out,'' Saints defensive
coordinator Zaven Yaralian said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover did not dress for 13 of 16 games with the Raiders in
1996, and in training camp in '97, Oakland opted to stick with
bigger defensive tackles Russell Maryland, Chester McGlockton and
Darrell Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders personnel executive Ken Herock, who left the Falcons
eight months earlier after Dan Reeves was hired as coach, offered
to trade Glover to the Falcons, but Atlanta declined.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the Raiders would likely waive him, the Falcons put in a
waiver claim on Glover, thinking they would probably get him since
they had the No. 3 claiming spot by virtue of the NFL's third-worst
record a year earlier. But the Saints had the No. 2 claiming spot,
and took Glover.
</P>
<P>
   He started just two games last year, but has played so well this
year the Saints extended his contract by four years, giving him an
$11 million deal and bonuses such as $700,000 for 15 ``big plays''
(interceptions, forced fumbles and fumble recoveries) and 11 sacks
per season, and $1.3 million for 17 big plays and 12 sacks a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup call
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons made out quite well after not getting Glover,
signing defensive tackle Shane Dronett after he was waived by
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Dronett alternated last year with starting tackles Travis Hall
and Dan Owens, and had 40 tackles, three sacks, two blocked field
goals, and five passes batted down.
</P>
<P>
   Like Glover, he became a starter this year, and is fifth on the
team with 67 tackles, is third with 6.5 sacks (a half sack short of
a career high), has forced two fumbles, recovered one, and swatted
three passes.
</P>
<P>
   And Dronett is doing it for a relative bargain, as he is in the
first year of a two-year, $1.6 million contract that pays him a
salary of $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive end Lester Archambeau practiced Thursday for
the first time since breaking his left thumb in last Sunday's game
against the Colts. The results were pretty good. ``It worked better
today than I thought it would,'' said Archambeau, who had surgery
last Sunday to insert pins in the thumb. ``We won't know for sure
until Sunday when there are real, live bullets flying, but I was
able to use it today pretty good.'' ... Receiver Tim Dwight did not
practice, resting a hamstring. ``We're going to test it tomorrow,''
coach Dan Reeves said. ``He thinks it's just a cramp that made it
sore.'' ... For the Saints, middle linebacker Kevin Mitchell, who
suffered a partial tear of a medial collateral knee ligament
against Dallas, will not play. ... Reserve linebacker Vinson Smith
(knee) is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Bear solution?
</P>
<P>
   If the Saints do play a lot of the ``Bear'' front, the Falcons
can count on a lot of pressure up the middle, in what they refer to
as the ``A gap.'' Although quarterbacks Tony Graziani and Steve
DeBerg went with a shotgun snap several plays at St. Louis Nov. 29,
starting quarterback Chris Chandler has used the shotgun very
little since the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves doesn't favor using the shotgun on the road, especially
in domes, because it is difficult for offensive linemen to hear the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hear a lot better when he's under center. But any time
somebody is testing your A gap, you've got a better chance in the
shotgun, no doubt about it,'' Reeves said. ``(Chandler) has the
ability to go to it any time he wants. Chris likes being under
(center), but he'll go to the shotgun sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot or cold
</P>
<P>
   In 10 straight games, the Saints have given up either 31, 30, or
three points, winning the three games in which they've allowed just
a field goal (all at home), and losing the others.
</P>
<P>
   No running room
</P>
<P>
   The Saints have had problems generating a running game behind a
line that has a rookie tight end, a rookie left guard in Kyle
Turley, a second-year right guard in Chris Naeole, and a third-year
center in Tom Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans' leading rusher is Lamar Smith, who has 411 yards on
121 carries, a 3.4-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints averaged just 64.2 in nine games before last week,
when they rushed 36 times for 113 yards against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cowboys, 1997 third-round draft choice Troy Davis
started at running back, and Aaron Craver was the up-back. But
rookie Wilmont Perry, the teams' fifth-round draft choice out of
Livingstone College, ended up the team's leading rusher, with 38
yards on 12 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka waived the team's second-leading rusher, Ray Zellars (56
carries, 162 yards), earlier this week because he wasn't happy with
his blocking.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were about 6,000 tickets short of a sellout Thursday.
... Saints second-year left defensive end Jared Tomich has just 20
tackles, but he has six sacks, and has forced two fumbles. ... New
Orleans leads the NFC with 18 interceptions.

 Yellow Pages' Fingers To Quit Walking Soon   By Deborah Solomon  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
After more than 40 years, the ``Let Your Fingers Do the Walking''
campaign is about to walk off stage.
</P>
<P>
   America's Yellow Pages will get a new logo and tag line next
year as the nation's largest phone directory moves to reposition
itself as more than just a place to get phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The walking-fingers logo, which has appeared on the covers of
phone books for four decades, will be replaced with a lightbulb and
the slogan ``Get An Idea.''
</P>
<P>
   A $24 million ad campaign to introduce the new Yellow Pages will
get under way in January with comedian and ``Saturday Night Live''
alum Jon Lovitz as the pitchman. The campaign was developed by the
Martin Agency in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Pages Publishers Association, which represents the
country's largest phone directories, including Pacific Bell's, said
it is abandoning one of America's most recognized symbols because
it wants to change the directory's image.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Pages now wants to sell itself as a consumer
resource, where people can go to ``get ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the association wants people to consult the book
for ideas on painting a room or planting a garden. Instead of just
looking up the number for a gardening store, customers could use
the book to find alternatives _ such as a company that specializes
in Japanese gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising watchers were skeptical about the new campaign,
however, saying the new slogan is nowhere near as catchy or
explanatory as the walking fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walking fingers is a great campaign. Fingers are physical
and easy to remember, as opposed to getting ideas, which is so
obscure,'' said Chuck Pettis, president of Brand-Solutions, an ad
agency in Bellevue, Wash. ``I don't think people really go to the
Yellow Pages to get ideas. I think they go there to find phone
numbers. If people want ideas, they'll read a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettis said the change is risky and shows the Yellow Pages is
concerned about its market share. ``It shows they're worried
(enough) to make such a big move, and it's definitely radical,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The repositioning comes at a time when the Yellow Pages is
facing fierce competition from other resources, such as the
Internet. Several online phone directories have popped up in recent
years, including InfoSpace.com, 555-1212.com and YellowPages.com.
</P>
<P>
   As more directories appear, competition for the mighty
advertising dollar increases. Right now, the Yellow Pages is a huge
revenue generator for most phone companies, bringing in more than
$12 billion in advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Pages officials said people are consulting the directory
less frequently and the new campaign is expected to increase its
use. Consumers use the book an average of 74 times a year,
according to the publishing association.
</P>
<P>
   Agnieszka Winkler, head of Winkler Advertising, said that
although the Yellow Pages wants the new campaign to attract more
users, the idea could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, it's almost easier to get an idea
from an Internet environment than from a printed environment. Over
time, the Yellow Pages is going to become obsolete. It's an
expensive way of doing it, and half the information in there is out
of date by the time it's printed,'' Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing the Yellow Pages has going for it, she said, is
the brand loyalty it has built with the walking-fingers campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand is more than just advertising. It begins to create a
relationship with the consumer ... and creates value for the
company,'' she said. ``The slogan `Get an Idea,' within the context
of the Yellow Pages, I really don't understand. `Let your fingers
do the walking' is the perfect campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovers of the walking fingers can take heart for a little while,
at least. The transition to the new logo and slogan will be
gradual. The publishing association expects the walking fingers to
disappear from phone books in about a year.

 Aetna to Buy Prudential HealthCare  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Aetna Inc. said yesterday it would pay $1 billion in cash and debt
to acquire Prudential HealthCare, cementing its position as the
largest health insurer in the nation, and making it the
sixth-largest in California.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts hailed the deal, under which Aetna would get
an additional 6.6 million customers and end up insuring 22.4
million people, or roughly one out of 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting Prudential's members at an incredibly low
price,'' said Ira Zuckerman, an analyst with Nutmeg Securities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; According to Aetna, the purchase price would give it
Prudential's customers for about $200 each compared with the $500
to $600 it costs to acquire a customer through advertising and
marketing. The Hartford, Conn., insurer said the acquisition was
part of its plan to become a dominant force in managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   For Prudential, the deal made sense because the health unit was
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   But health insurance buyers, doctor's groups and consumer
activists expressed reservations about the deal, which is &UR;  &LR; the
latest in a series of health insurance mergers, and Aetna's third
such combination in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is worrisome because we think it could result in
less competitive rates than if we had more plans,'' said Margaret
Stanley, who negotiates health insurance rates for the California
Public Employees Retirement System.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Hack, executive director of the Alta Bates Medical Group in
Berkeley, said doctors in California have increasingly banded
together into independent practice associations to negotiate rates
with insurers. Now with mergers such as Aetna's acquisition of
Prudential HealthCare, she said, those negotiations would be even
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a health plan has a critical mass of your business you
can't walk away from them,'' said Hack, adding that Aetna and
Prudential combined would insure about 20,000 out of her group's
145,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   But Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of
Health Plans, the industry's lobby, said the proposed merger would
not have a large effect in California. Before the merger,
Prudential insured about 1 million Californians, and Aetna about
500,000. Combined, they would be the sixth-largest health insurer
behind Blue Shield of California, which has 2 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Heller, an industry critic with Santa Monica's
Consumers for Quality Care, said the more important fact is that
the merged Aetna would be a health maintenance organization, a type
of insurer that has greater power than other insurers to control
health care choices.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heller, Aetna, with 1.5 million members, would be
second only to Kaiser with 5.4 million members in the HMO business.
He said this would make Aetna an ``HMO powerhouse'' and mean ``less
choice for consumers, less leverage for doctors negotiating
contracts, and that means the downgrading of medical care.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelman countered by saying, ``There is pretty vigorous
competition between health plans in California.'' Mergers can
actually lower administrative costs, he said, ``and end up being
pro-consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost-cutting was what Aetna Chairman Richard Huber promised
yesterday, saying he expected to cut up to 2,000 jobs, or 12
percent, of Prudential HealthCare's workforce to save upwards of
$130 million during the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McDermott, executive director of the Hill Physicians
Medical Group in San Ramon, the state's largest independent
doctor's group, said he doubted the Aetna merger would have a big
impact on Northern California because neither Aetna nor Prudential
are dominant insurers here.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott said this latest merger among health plans served
as a reminder that doctors' groups need to combine with each other
to get more bargaining clout and lower their own administrative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have been reluctant to participate in strong
organizations, but doctors are going to have to consolidate,''
McDermott predicted.

 The Cisco Kids  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
For three years, Sabrina Castillo lived on the streets of San
Francisco _ doing drugs, hanging out with friends and avoiding
school.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the shy 18-year-old is learning how to build and manage
complex computer networks and dreaming of a job at one of Silicon
Valley's high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The striking transition from street kid to computer aficionada
came after Castillo was sent to a drug rehabilitation program. It
was there that she heard about Cisco Systems' Networking Academy _
a nationwide program for high school students who want to pursue
careers in technology.
</P>
<P>
   She enrolled in the academy at Sequoia High School in Redwood
City and, along with about 30 other students at the school, is
now &LR; learning about the inner workings of computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   The students at Sequoia are among the thousands that Cisco hopes
to train, certify and, perhaps, recruit as part of its nationwide
program.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company has set up academies in more than 1,000
schools across the country and also offers the program overseas.
More than 17,000 students are now enrolled in a Networking Academy,
which operate in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The program is open to any student _ there is no prerequisite or
entrance exam. It gives kids a chance at a $40,000-a-year job out
of high school. Although it's designed mainly for students who
don't plan on going to a four-year college, some students who do
plan to attend a university take the course for experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco launched the program a little more than a year ago to help
fill a high-tech worker shortage. The tech industry has been
plagued by a severe lack of skilled workers and has struggled to
fill jobs that require intense training. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed primarily for juniors and seniors in
high school, who take the courses during regular school hours as an
elective, much like wood shop or home economics.
</P>
<P>
   Students are taught at the school by a staff teacher, usually a
computer science instructor. But the curriculum is provided online
by Cisco. Tests are also administered on the computer, although
some teachers substitute their own written exams.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the two-year program, which takes 280 hours to
complete, students get a certificate that qualifies them to be
network administrators. Students can get summer internships at some
of the high-tech companies where they might want to eventually
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts kids on track to a high-paying job,'' said Keith
Fox, Cisco's vice president for worldwide corporate marketing.
``And it will give them the opportunity to learn the new life
skills that they most likely will require into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Any high school in the country can become a Networking Academy,
according to Cisco, as long as it has a dedicated instructor, can
afford the equipment and provides the space for the networking
labs.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco donates the curriculum and online support, but schools
must pay for the networking equipment, which costs about $14,000.
Schools also pay about $2,500 to have the academy's teacher trained
by Cisco. Many schools apply for grants from the state or nonprofit
agencies to cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Community colleges can also host regional networking academies
and offer the courses to high school grads.
</P>
<P>
   While the program aims to help students set a career path, the
program is by no means altruistic. By getting junior and senior
high school kids certified as network administrators, Cisco figures
it can create a well-educated, skilled workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we did the program was fundamentally to address a
worker shortage,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   That has concerned some critics, who fear the program is yet
another intrusion by private corporations into the public education
system.
</P>
<P>
   A Cisco banner hangs at the Sequoia High School Networking
Academy, and the company's logo is seen throughout the online
curriculum. Cisco also sends guest speakers and provides tours of
the company and others in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Manilov of the Center for Commercial-Free Public
Education in Oakland said the academies sound more like job-feeding
programs than job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they're using public funds to do job-feeding to
the company,'' Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
   It raises a red flag, she said, because corporations shouldn't
have control over public school curriculum. ``When a company comes
in saying `this is what we need to teach you,' it blurs the line in
a dangerous way.''
</P>
<P>
   Manilov also said the time spent in the program gives students
less exposure to other courses, such as language, math or science.
``That's a lot of time in front of the computer and it's not adding
to any other training,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the Networking Academies say the program is
helpful and that students wouldn't be able to learn these skills if
Cisco didn't provide the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, like senior Richard Porter, say they don't want
to work for Cisco, but would rather start their own businesses with
the skills they learn in the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hands-on labs and the curriculum really teaches you a lot
and it sticks with you,'' said Porter, 17. ``I didn't know anything
about this before but it's opened a lot of doors to me. Now I think
want to have my own network consulting firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Dodge, one of the two academy teachers at Sequoia, said
the program provides a great opportunity to some students who would
normally have gone on to minimum-wage jobs after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the goal is to bring kids into an environment where
they can learn to earn two to three times what they would make at
minimum wage,'' said Larry Wagner, another academy instructor.
</P>
<P>
   For Castillo, the chance to make good money and work at a Valley
company is reason enough to slave through the course, which she and
other students said is challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but I know this will help me out,'' Castillo said.
``I was on and off the streets for three years and this is
definitely different from what my life used to be like. But I've
always liked computers and now I want to get certified and go work
for a big company.''

   Aetna Inc. said Thursday that it had agreed to buy Prudential
Health Care from Prudential Insurance Co. of America for $1
billion, creating the United States' biggest managed-care company
with 22.4 million customers, including 18.4 million in
health-maintenance organizations and other managed-health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, a hard-driving health insurer known for
tight-fisted relations with doctors, would swallow Prudential, a
household name for generations. Prudential Health Care nurtured a
reputation for reliability and caring but never learned how to make
money in a tough new world of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which must be approved by federal and state
regulators, would increase Aetna's ability to negotiate on fees and
working rules with doctors and hospitals and eventually to raise
premiums for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, there were four national health-care insurance
carriers; now there are three,'' including Kaiser Permanente and
United Healthcare, said John Erb, a consultant with the Arthur J.
Gallagher consulting firm. ``I wouldn't be surprised if there are
only two by this time next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and Prudential officials said that consumers, including
500,000 Prudential members in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania
and Connecticut, would not immediately notice any change. They said
many doctors were already in both companies' networks and that
health-plan rules would not change much over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors expressed concern on Thursday. Aetna is largely
viewed as one of the most stringent managed-care companies, pushing
hard for cost reductions, disputing claims and questioning
out-of-network services.
</P>
<P>
   And some doctors might have to take patients in plans that
reimburse treatment costs at lower rates than their other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Huber, the chairman and chief executive of Aetna, said
the company would ``absolutely'' continue a policy of requiring
doctors to take part in all Aetna health plans or none. Doctors say
the all-or-nothing choice sometimes forces them to drop all Aetna
plans, disrupting care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of medical societies in a dozen states discussed the
issue this week at a meeting of the American Medical Association in
Honolulu. Louis Goodman, executive director of the Texas Medical
Association, said the state groups would urge state officials to
pressure Aetna to change the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Aetna-Prudential deal, Thomas Reardon,
president-elect of the AMA, said that doctors were concerned about
``the increasing consolidation and integration, which results in
greater and greater market power for these managed-care
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would give Aetna more negotiating weight. It would have
about 30 percent of the managed-care business in New Jersey and
Texas and would also be one of the three largest managed-care
companies in seven other states _ New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Florida, Georgia, Virginia and Ohio. It would surpass Kaiser
Permanente of California, which has 8.5 million members, as the
nation's biggest managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., said its earnings would rise
immediately after completion of the deal, which is half in cash and
half in debt, in late spring or early summer next year.
</P>
<P>
   It said the merged company would save $130 million to $150
million a year, including savings by eliminating 1,000 to 2,000
jobs over the next two years. Prudential Health Care has 16,000
employees, including 1,000 at its headquarters in Roseland, N.J.
Aetna has 32,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second big merger this year for Aetna, which is
still in the throes of integrating NYLCare, a health-care business
it bought from New York Life Insurance Co. in March for $1.05
billion. With NYLCare, Aetna is the fourth-largest managed-care
company and Prudential is fifth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Consultants and analysts said the deal posed serious financial
risks for Aetna, which will face the costs and uncertainties of
running multiple information systems, especially as companies face
the worrisome challenge of computer changeover problems in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The big danger for Aetna would be to misjudge its medical costs
and fall behind in paying doctors and hospitals, a sequence that
has caused deep trouble for Oxford Health Plans and other
managed-care companies, including Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong long-term concern that there won't be
as good operating control and financial information as if the
systems were fully integrated,'' said Mimi Willard, a Wall Street
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   But Huber said Prudential had ``made an offer we can't refuse.''
The price, calculated as less than $200 for each managed-care
member, compared with $600 a member that Aetna paid for NYLCare.
And Prudential agreed to certain financial guarantees that would
repay Aetna if the Prudential contracts made less money than
projected in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steven Shulman, president of Prudential Health Care,
increased sales drastically and cut operating losses in half, to
about $100 million this year, the asking price for the health-care
unit dropped at least $500 million in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Life, which plans to change to a shareholder-owned
company from a mutual company owned by policyholders, had long been
eager to sell the health-care unit, which has had operating losses
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna had said no before, but this time, ``they wanted very
badly to do a quick transaction,'' Huber said. The health-care unit
was ``an albatross, and they had to rid themselves of it,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ryan, chairman and chief executive of Prudential, said
the proceeds of the sale would be channeled to insurance and
financial-services units.
</P>
<P>
   Huber said that Prudential Health Care had become more
attractive after it cut costs by folding 44 service centers across
the country into just four.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, Huber told Wall Street analysts that Aetna
would make no further acquisitions for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just surprised that they stepped up to a rather
large acquisition when they had very definitely said they would
not,'' said Joyce Albers, a partner at Deerfield Management, a
health-care investment management firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers advising Prudential were Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and
Prudential Securities. Wasserstein Perella advised Aetna. Skadden
Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom was Prudential's law firm in the deal,
and Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell represented Aetna.

 &HT;    1ST UPDATE
 &HT;    EDs: Changes throughoutSensing victory, Barr savors moment
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the U.S. Capitol looming in the backdrop,
Georgia Republican Bob Barr looked directly into the television
camera like a man on the verge of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reciting the articles of impeachment against the president as if
they were the alphabet, Barr told the CNN audience that impeachment
case against President Clinton is ``strong, very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   As the House Judiciary Committee prepares for a vote on four
articles of impeachment against Clinton today or tomorrow, perhaps
no single member of Congress has lusted after his impeachment more
than Bob Barr.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Barr stood alone in his resolve to oust Clinton
from the Oval Office. He even introduced a resolution to impeach
him three months before the nation had even heard the name Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barr is on the cusp of a historic vote recommending to the
House of Representatives that the president be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   And he is hitting the media circuit at every turn to make sure
that this particular moment does not slip away.
</P>
<P>
   There he was at 7:30 a.m. Thursday morning gulping coffee and
nibbling on pancakes at the posh Carlton Hotel, telling
Washington's media elite at the Sperling Breakfast that now is the
time to get rid of Clinton. (Although he still thinks that the
investigation into campaign fund-raising abuses will yield fruit if
this one fails.)
</P>
<P>
   One hour later, Barr was back in the ornate Judiciary chambers
on Capitol Hill listening with rapt attention to the closing
arguments of the Republican and Democratic investigative counsel.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans have reserved judgment, Barr almost beams
when the ``I'' word comes up. ``All of the charges are very strong
and can be defended in terms of the facts and the Constitution,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a full day of hearings, Barr went straight to the
microphones, followed by a gaggle of reporters that routinely
swarms around him down the marble corridors of the Rayburn House
Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   And while this may be what is known as The Bob Barr moment, he
worries that the White House will take away his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel is a great deal of apprehension,'' said Barr, in
between television spots. ``An awful lot can happen in one week.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, he said, would stop at nothing to prevent the
House vote. So is he worried that he will become a target? Of
course. Is he going to do anything about it? No.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment I am waiting for is after the floor vote,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean he won't rest until he is sure there are 218
votes to remove Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Well, lunch did consist solely of a handful of Georgia pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Where exactly does Barr's palpable antipathy for the president
stem from?
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that I hate him,'' Barr said. ``I just take great
offense to what he has done to our country.''

 PG&AMP;E Earns Nickname as `Buffalo Bills of Electric Companies'  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
During the 1970s, sportswriters used to call the offensive line of
the Buffalo Bills the ``electric company`` because they ``turned on
the Juice,`` referring of course to their blocking for running back
O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   So why not turn the tables and refer to PG&AMP;E as the ``Buffalo
Bills of electric companies''?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Bills are known for blowing the big one, having
lost each of their four Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Too harsh? Maybe. But this is the big, bad power company we're
talking about here. If they can't take the heat, they should get
out of the furnace. (Or something like that.)
</P>
<P>
   Several readers contended that this column earlier this week
neglected to build a sufficient case as to why PG&AMP;E isn't a
sterling investment. So let's take a further look at the company
that shut down San Francisco for the better part of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If you subscribe to the Peter Lynch school of investing, you
should invest in companies in which you are familiar. He also
preaches that investors use horse sense and pay attention to how
companies run their businesses and treat their customers.
</P>
<P>
   So when you were sitting in the dark Tuesday groping for a
flashlight tucked in your earthquake preparation kit, were you
saying to yourself: ``Darn, that PG&AMP;E really delivers in the
clutch''?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the blackout leaves one wondering if PG&AMP;E, in
general, is a well-run company or whether it is even a good utility
company. Naturally, a single power outage (caused by PG&AMP;E) doesn't
necessarily make the company a lousy utility.
</P>
<P>
   But some other facts might support that assertion. PG&AMP;E's
electricity rates are at least 35 percent higher than the national
average, and yet it has a greater number of outages than the
national average, says Jonathan Bromson, a lawyer for the Public
Utilities Commission who's battling PG&AMP;E in its latest rate case.
</P>
<P>
   So let's see. PG&AMP;E charges higher prices, but its customers get
substandard service. (In fact, before rate reductions kicked in
this year, PG&AMP;E's rates were about 50 percent higher than the
national average.)
</P>
<P>
   This, to me, is not the making of a great company. PG&AMP;E also has
higher costs than most other power utilities. Apologists for the
company blame such costs on it being burdened with nuclear reactor
debt and being forced by regulators to use more Earth-friendly
energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   But PG&AMP;E isn't the only utility that still has to pay off the
cost of reactors, and sometimes things are just what they appear to
be, says Bromson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the high costs have to do with the fact that PG&AMP;E
isn't as efficient as other utilities across the country,'' says
Bromson, adding that PG&AMP;E operates 15 percent less efficiently than
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   As for its performance record, PG&AMP;E lags behind most of its
utility peers in the state and across the nation, says Gayatri
Schilberg, senior economist at J.B.S. Energy, a West Sacramento
consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reliability is definitely worse than the rest of the
country,'' says Schilberg, whose firm works for utility watchdog
groups and rate advocates.
</P>
<P>
   One index used to measure how long the average power outage
lasts is the Systems Average Interruption Duration Index. The SAIDI
for PG&AMP;E in 1997 was 170.6 minutes, and that includes major events
such as storms or earthquakes. That means the average outage lasted
nearly three hours. By comparison, Southern California Edison's
SAIDI figure was 69.6 minutes, and San Diego Gas &AMP; Electric's index
was 89.3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E not only has longer blackouts but more of them. According
to another index that measures the frequency of outages, the
Momentary Average Interruption Frequency Index (MAIFI), PG&AMP;E's
rating of 4.3 in 1997 was nearly three times higher than SoCal
Edison's rating of 1.5 and SDG&AMP;E's 1.4. (All of these figures
include major events.)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Mother Nature's wrath is inflicted on Northern
California more than the southern half of the state. Thus, PG&AMP;E is
likely to endure more weather-related problems. But SoCal still has
storms and earthquakes. What's more, utility companies in the
Midwest deal with tornadoes, thunderstorms and snowstorms all of
the time. And when compared to some other utilities in harsher
climates, PG&AMP;E's performance is still below average, Schilberg
says.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Tuesday's blackout that the company blames on
a four-person crew that was expanding capacity at a substation in
San Mateo. Schilberg suggests that the cause of the debacle may go
beyond just human error, saying that certain mechanisms failed to
prevent the outage from spreading throughout the entire city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some relays that should have tripped, but that is
more of a hardware problem,'' Schilberg says.
</P>
<P>
   Were there systems in place that should have limited the impact
of the human mistake? If so, did they fail?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know, but there very well could have been. So we
can't rule out that it was just human error,'' says PG&AMP;E spokesman
Tony Ledwell.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds to me like the Bills after a Super Bowl.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks, the
affluent suburban epicenter of California's atomized civic and
political culture, the sounds Thursday were the voices of Nat and
Natalie Cole, singing soothing Christmas carols on the loudspeaker,
and the solemn business of impeachment seemed even farther away
than three time zones and 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people give a damn,'' declared Joan
Harper, 71, a dedicated mall-walker on her morning constitutional
with her friends, Harriet Klein and Mary Thomas. ``It's boring. I
haven't watched it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   John Miele, 70, a retired AT&AMP;T worker catching up on some
Christmas shopping, allowed: ``It's ridiculous. I think he should
be censured. It's all a big ploy by the Republicans just getting
back at him. I don't think he did anything to be impeached for.
They keep nagging at it. It's just ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Hancock, 51, a school bus driver from Pasadena, summed
up the prevailing mood, saying: ``I'm really getting bored with it.
It just keeps rolling along. It's gotten to the point where I don't
even want to pay attention. Each lawyer is just trying to outdo the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moved inexorably toward only the third vote on
presidential impeachment in U.S. history, shoppers in the San
Fernando Valley, to a person, knew full well what was afoot. But
also to a person, they long ago decided they knew all they needed
to, and on Thursday they went on about their business _ not
uninformed, just uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   On the late local television news here, impeachment does not
even make the first 10 minutes, losing out to breathless reports
about a bout of Santa Anas, the gusty desert winds of up to 100 mph
that Raymond Chandler wrote make ``meek little wives feel the edge
of the carving knife and study the back of their husbands' necks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how little interest there is, except to those
of us who follow it professionally or personally or both,'' said
Pat Caddell, the reformed pollster who has worked for politicians
as diverse as Jimmy Carter and Jerry Brown and now lives here. ``I
think it's the weirdest disconnect that I have ever seen in
American politics between the elected and the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really does say something serious about the health of the
body politic that the American people are not more engaged in
this,'' he added. ``I think people have just had to deal with too
much information all year and they think nobody listens to them
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Patt Morrison, a local columnist for The Los Angeles Times with
a sharp eye for the wry side of Southern California life, said the
current hearings contrasted sharply with Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, there was some new revelation every day,'' she said.
``With this, we knew everything, except perhaps the nuances and
shadings, from the get-go, and so the sense that each successive
videotape will result in this tsunami of shock and horror turns out
not to be the case. We've read the ending already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it seems to be about is not substance but theater,'' Ms.
Morrison added. ``And this is L.A. We've got better theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all year long, voters and viewers have paid intense
attention to the Clinton-Lewinsky show ``only when the story line
changes,'' according to Andrew Kohut, director the Pew Center for
the People and the Press in Washington which has tracked public
attitudes about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things have remained in, let's call it the analytical or
heavy-pundit phase, the public hasn't paid a lot of attention,''
Kohut said. ``Over and over again, they've said we've made some
judgments about this. We don't like him as a person, he's made some
terrible mistakes, but it's not worth booting him out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who just
happened to be waiting for the Victoria's Secret to open so she
could do some shopping at the mall in Sherman Oaks before a morning
meeting there, confessed that she had been following the hearings,
``very, very closely on CNN.'' But she said her constituents show
no interest at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not on the radar screen locally,'' she said. ``I
think people are just watching it passed on to the next level,
hoping it won't go forward. But in these cases, you never know what
will happen once the process starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the prospect that the full House of Representatives may
well vote to approve articles of impeachment seems only another
irritant, and one the public feels powerless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me now,'' said Kermit Eller, 68, a
retired engineer, and a Republican, who was waiting for his wife to
finish an appointment at a hair salon in the mall. ``Considering
the behavior of the Republicans, they seem not to expect ever to
have another Republican president, or they wouldn't be so ready to
weaken the institution this way. It troubles me to see them
behaving in this irresponsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Carlisi, shopping with her 28-month old daughter, Sarah,
said she catches only snippets of the hearings on MSNBC, and would
also no longer be surprised at a vote to impeach, but added: ``I
think it would be pointless and a huge waste of taxpayers' money. I
think there's some very strong religious right money and pressure
behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton himself, the views were remarkably consistent _ and
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's a dog,'' said Alicia Verde, shopping in Sherman Oaks
with her two-year old daughter, Rory, ``but what he does is up to
Hillary. He'll have his karma. Hillary will take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Mrs. Clinton was in Los Angeles on Thursday,
visiting a historic synagogue in Boyle Heights and an old-time
movie palace in downtown Los Angeles as part of her national ``Save
America's Treasures'' campaign to preserve historic buildings and
sites.
</P>
<P>
   At the Farmer's Market in the Fairfax District in the middle of
Los Angeles, Amy Doering, a 27-year old post-production supervisor
at the nearby CBS Television City, said of the hearings: ``It makes
me sick to my stomach. I don't want to hear about it, and I don't
care about anyone's sex life. It's more than understood that the
general public is over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lurie, a 92-year-old retired electrical engineer said he
had been following the hearings _ ``every inch of it,'' as he put
it _ and still did not believe Clinton's actions warranted
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is his cup of tea,'' Lurie said. ``I think he's
done a pretty good job as president, and let him complete his
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Rubin, a 61-year-old photographer and designer from
Beverly Hills, said she and her friends were glued to the televised
hearings while at their gym the other night, but said, ``This
should have been resolved privately,'' and added, ``I think the
country doesn't have a say in this. I feel like the whole thing is
controlled by the committee and Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sherman Oaks, the mall-walker, Ms. Harper, doubted that the
Senate would ever vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break,'' she said. ``I bet you half the senators
have done the same thing.'' When her friends asked her about the
possibility of censure, she dismissed that, too. ``What are they
going to give him? Twenty push-ups? Like the T-shirt says, ``The
boat sank: Get over it.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nasdaq officials halted trading of Coyote Network
Systems on Thursday as they look into allegations that the
company's biggest customer could be a figment of its imagination.
</P>
<P>
   A series of articles published by TheStreet.Com, an online
investment site, said its reporters couldn't find Coyote's top
client, Crescent Communications. It even dispatched a reporter to
the company's Long Beach, Calif., address, with no success.
</P>
<P>
   When the news hit, shares of Westlake Village, Calif.-based
Coyote plunged 45 percent to $7.8125 on Wednesday. Officials at
Coyote, a telecommunications equipment and network services
company, did not return calls for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News tried to contact Crescent Communications, but
there was no listing for its phone number in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Kansas, editor in chief of TheStreet.Com, said his
reporters have tried to find Crescent since before Thanksgiving.
Coyote itself was not much help in locating the company, Kansas and
the articles contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of exhaustive work on it,'' he said. ``We stand
by our stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyote defended itself in a press release Thursday, calling the
stories ``potentially misleading.'' The company said second-quarter
revenues rose to $15.2 million from $106,000 a year ago due to
sales of equipment to Comdisco, an established telecommunications
company, which then leased it to Crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote also said its officers don't intend to short-sell the
stock, an accusation made by TheStreet.Com after examining
Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   Vik Grover, an analyst for Kaufman Bros. who found himself under
fire for his ``buy'' recommendation on Coyote just before
TheStreet.Com's articles were released, said that while he has
never spoken with any executive at Crescent, he believes it was
incorporated in Nevada, based in Long Beach and operates in Mexico
as Crescent Communications SA de CV.
</P>
<P>
   Grover said he has visited Coyote's operations, which he
described as real and valid. He characterized TheStreet.Com's
stories as ``disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ridiculous sell-off. We still remain favorable on the
stock,'' he said, although there's no guarantee the recommendation
will stay.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Coyote announced it was buying a 20 percent
ownership stake in Crescent Communications. In the second quarter,
Coyote reported a 143-fold increase in revenue from a year ago,
largely due to business related to Crescent. As a result, the
company's stock doubled to around the $14 range.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq spokesman said he is not sure how long trading will be
halted, but no shares were traded Thursday. Trades are stopped to
protect investors and markets as officials dig for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Comdisco officials did not return calls for comment. &QL;

TOILING UNDER DURESS: REFS FEEL THE PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a matter of seconds, he knew his call was
wrong. By then, however, it was too late. The team that benefited
was celebrating a tainted victory. He was standing there on the
field, every bit as deflated as the losing club.
</P>
<P>
   Consistently rated as one of the NFL's best officials, he had
seen such a mistake happen to others in the profession, felt for
them, even phoned the next day to say, ``shake it off _ keep your
head up.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was much different. This was him. And this mistake
would lead /Sports Center,/ and the Fox guys would slo-mo it from
every camera angle. Sports page headlines would be coming the next
morning, complete with pictures. And he had no answer. No defense
of his call.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the heat is part of the job. But he also knew he was
wrong. His job in the NFL is not to be wrong. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   He knew what the losing coach would probably say. He had heard
and read it for years. ``Those guys \Rthe officials\S are back home
Monday morning, working in their real jobs. Not a worry in the
world. Meanwhile, we get fired for their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He had always hated that response from a coach. Like nobody who
officiated cared or had pride. Like it was that easy to forget a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The flight home that night was the longest of his life. The
plane landed right on time, three hours after takeoff. But it felt
like three days.
</P>
<P>
   Walking in his house, he would only think about the play. Not
about family, and certainly not about the phone already ringing as
friends called to offer support.
</P>
<P>
   It still was early on a Sunday night, but he went right to bed.
He can't remember sleeping, but probably did. Fifteen hours later,
he was still in bed, blowing the coaching theory that ``these
guys'' are back at work Monday morning, not a worry in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 o'clock that afternoon when he finally climbed out of
bed to answer the phone. But only because the caller was Jerry
Seeman, director of NFL officials. His football boss.
</P>
<P>
   Seeman made him feel better. He was supportive. Seeman reminded
him about his years of excellent grades and work in the league.
``Shake it off _ keep your head up,'' the boss told him.
</P>
<P>
   He'd always considered Seeman a stand-up guy, but this phone
call was special because Seeman himself was under plenty of fire.
Every Sunday, there seems to be ``something.'' It is currently open
season on NFL zebras. Way too many mistakes, or at least what
owners, coaches and players think are mistakes. And some of those
mistakes were blatantly wrong. Like his call had been.
</P>
<P>
   He knew Seeman hears it first and hears it often. Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue is getting nervous, and rightfully so. Owners all
over the league are screaming. Tagliabue wants answers from Seeman.
</P>
<P>
   But here's Seeman, calling him at home, not to criticize, but to
tell him, ``shake it off _ keep your head up.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels better after that, but still awful about making the
mistake. By Tuesday, however, he knows it's time to try and clear
his head. Not just for his family's sake, or the return Tuesday to
his ``real job'' after a ``sick day'' absence on Monday. But on
Saturday, there will be another flight to another city, and he has
to be mentally right for that Sunday game.
</P>
<P>
   Doing your job while scared, or with doubt, invites another
mistake. Perfection is not possible, but a repeat of the previous
Sunday can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   By midweek, I was talking to this official about instant replay.
Was he in favor? ``Yes,'' he said. ``Anything the league thinks
will help the game, or us, I'm for it. I've never opposed it.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, his wrong call at the end of that game on
that Sunday would have been easily corrected by instant replay. It
fell under the category of the three situations covered by instant
replay, meaning possession, goal line and sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Personal theory _ in the NFL's last fling with instant replay,
the officiating crews and replay judges helped sabotage it with
incessive ``plays under review'' and prolonged decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's silly,'' he said. ``It didn't happen.'' OK, I will take
his word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay, however, will happen again. If not for the
playoffs in January, then by next season. Enough is enough, and
this season has had enough wrong calls that impacted the outcome of
a game. Not all wrongs can be overturned _ such as pass
interference _ but that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   The objective should be to fix what can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL official _ a good one, too _ could have had his mistake
``fixed.'' He would have benefited from replay on that one Sunday.
But these guys are human, mainly when it comes to personal regret
and hurt, which will linger for a long time.

   LONDON _ In the eight-year war that followed Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Iran in 1980, Iran suffered 750,000 casualties and
endured savage trench warfare, chemical and gas attacks, and
bombings of its cities and sacred mosques. The Iranian people not
only despise Saddam, they have the will to stand up to him.
</P>
<P>
   The key to enlisting Tehran in the fight against him is in
Washington. By encouraging those Iranians who want to modernize the
economy and moderate the society, the United States could go a long
way toward containing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Helping the Iran of today is nothing like helping the Iran
etched in the memory of many Americans during the 444-day hostage
crisis almost two decades ago. Today pragmatism, not ideology,
drives the post-Khomeini Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It is ruled by a good cop, bad cop, good-bad cop triumvirate,
consisting of President Mohammed Khatami, Supreme Leader Sayed Ali
Khamenei and the chairman of the Expediency Council, Hashemi
Rafsanjani. This alliance excludes the extremists.
</P>
<P>
   But these leaders face enormous problems.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has called Iran's economy ``sick.'' Inflation and
unemployment are rampant. Fewer than 100,000 of the more than
750,000 new jobs needed each year are created.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large enterprises are controlled by state or
para-state revolutionary foundations, or bonyads, which, despite
efforts to rein them in, remain a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation for the Deprived and War Veterans, which took
over all the assets of the shah and his family, now mismanages some
400 banking, commercial and industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Guard has increasingly become involved in
business dealings, as the prime contractor for railways, pipelines
and factories.
</P>
<P>
   The only real economic leverage that President Khatami has is
his control of oil, which accounts for three-quarters of the
country's foreign exchange but whose price has fallen through the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's major economic advantage is the strong entrepreneurial
spirit among its large merchant class. The current budget proposes
privatizing most state-controlled-enterprises, including many of
the bonyads.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders like A.N.S. Khamooshi, head of Iran's Chamber
of Commerce, will be central to privatization efforts and to
convincing voters that the pragmatists can create real economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Local elections next February and parliamentary elections in May
2000 will determine the future. The key to these elections is
Iran's young people.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the population is under age 25. Most were
not even born when the shah was driven from power, and few remember
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   A young man told me when I visited this year that he wants to go
dancing, hold hands with his girlfriend and watch movies in public.
Like teenagers everywhere, he and his friends see ``Made in the
USA'' as a status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Those who shout the ``Death to America'' slogans are wearing
Michael Jordan T-shirts. They have access to books, newspapers,
magazines and other information on the Internet. In the Middle
East, only Israel and Turkey have a greater addiction to spending
time on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should not be duped by the recent acts of extremists
who view the opening up of Iran with alarm. Desperate men take
desperate measures. The assassination of opposition leader Dariush
Forouhar and the attack by Islamic militants on a bus carrying a
group of Americans will not impede the slow movement toward the
rule of law and democracy. Only the United States can do that.
</P>
<P>
   America must recognize that changes in Iran offer new
opportunities to reduce the tensions in a region vital to its
interests.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for Washington to end its efforts to isolate and
contain Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton should reach out to Iran's conservative
spiritual leader as well as to its liberal president; he should ask
the United Nations to invite the Iranians to join in a regional
conference to discuss the future of Iraq; he should lift the trade
embargo, and Congress should repeal economic sanctions that hurt
U.S. companies and alienate America's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a large American energy company invests in Iran,
other investors are sure to follow. And the United States should
assist Iran in its efforts to control the $7 billion narcotics
trade from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   An economically strong and respected Iran would not only be good
for the Iranians, it would help contain Iraq. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT _- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer,
Wednesday heralded plans to expand its aggressive discounting
strategy across Europe by nearly quadrupling the number of
``hypermarkets'' it operates in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The retailing giant with its sprawling ``Supercenters,'' which
has transformed U.S. shopping habits at the expense of smaller Main
Street merchants, acquired 74 stores from the big German retail
group Spar Handels AG, adding to the 21-store Wertkauf GmbH chain
it acquired a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart now threatens to change Europe's shopping culture as
well, analysts said. Cutting prices on everything from clothes and
car parts to food and toys, Wal-Mart already has unleashed brutal
price wars in Germany in the 12 months since the Wertkauf
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart's strategy and unique ability to provide low prices
and service will transform the retail landscape over time in
Europe,'' Jeff Feiner, retailing analyst in New York for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Spar acquisition catapults Wal-Mart to the fourth biggest
discounter in Germany, mushrooming the number of such stores in
Germany from zero to nearly 100 in under a year, Feiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of retailing is changing, and the customer is
winning in the long-term,'' said Bob Martin, president of
Wal-Mart's international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day I hope we can serve a good deal of Europe,'' Martin
said. ``Europe is open across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Criado-Perez, senior vice president of Wal-Mart
International, said, ``We are looking for any open door that could
open in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Wal-Mart's strategy has won new customers and increased
sales, the company will change the names on both of its German
chains to Wal-Mart, starting next year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest Wal-Mart expansion, German retailers have
been forced on the defensive. German-based Metro AG, Europe's
largest retailer, last month decided to sell a third of its
businesses in a dramatic measure to help it compete with Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Because Metro is the world's second-biggest retailer behind
Wal-Mart, the latest acquisition raises the stakes in what has
become one of the most fierce corporate rivalries in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart cut prices ``across the whole assortment'' of
everything on offer at Wertkauf, said Ron Tiarks, president of
Wal-Mart's German operations. It will continue to ``drive costs out
of the business'' in its German stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   German retailers also have suffered a six-year slump, and the
price wars only add to their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   German shopkeepers, who long have enjoyed the protection of
competition barriers, now see those under threat by Wal-Mart.
Although German shopping hours are strictly regulated, Wal-Mart has
managed to extend its hours without violating regulations by
opening earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In May, it began to open its Wertkauf stores at 7 A.M. instead
of the German convention of 9 A.M., which has found ``an excellent
customer response'' and increased business, said Rom Tiarks,
president of Wal-Mart's German operations.
</P>
<P>
   German merchants already complain their costs will rise if they
are forced to hire more staff to lengthen store hours and
simultaneously add staff to compensate for Wal-Mart's emphasis on
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   And because Wal-Mart saves costs by buying in bulk, each new
acquisition adds to potential new pressure on European merchants.
</P>
<P>
   For its own European buying binge, Wal-Mart refused to specify
where it will strike next. Analysts suspect that Wal-Mart will seek
an acquisition in France, with Promodes SA mentioned as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers suggest that Wal-Mart has its eyes on other
German discounters like Aldi Einkauf GmbH and Lidl &AMP; Schwarz GmbH
along with Austrian retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic about a long-term engagement for Europe; it
is a very attractive place,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which has over 2,800 discount stores in its home
market in the United States, has been expanding internationally. It
also has stores in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
China and South Korea. &QL;

ACTION-PACKED `INSURRECTION' HAS HARD TIME OVERCOMING PLOT, JARGON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we applied old-style movie hype to ``Star Trek:
Insurrection''_ with a touch of irony _ it easily could sound like
this:
</P>
<P>
   See! Cadaverous, cranky bad guys obsessed with face lifts!
</P>
<P>
   Hear! Dialogue such as ``Reroute its command sequence through
the auxiliary processor!''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill! As good guys fight to preserve the status quo of a small
commune of boring, pacifist vegetarians!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are problems in the ``Trek'' universe.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't blame the cast of ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation,'' now in their third big-screen effort. The problems
stem from the screenplay by Michael Piller.
</P>
<P>
   Piller is co-creator of Trek's ``Voyager'' and ``Deep Space
Nine'' series, on which he served as executive producer. Here, he's
a first-time film screenwriter _ and it shows.
</P>
<P>
   As enjoyable as their interplay can be, the fine ``Next
Generation'' cast has had to grapple for years with plots laden by
stuffy idealism and tedious technical talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' is filled with both.
</P>
<P>
   Ably directed by Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Commander
William Riker, the film has ample action and enjoyable humor and
humanism. But its plot is driven by confounding jargon and rules
that Piller seems to make up as he goes along.
</P>
<P>
   The only rule he doesn't make up is ``Trek's'' most unmanageable
concept, touted since the '60s series and rarely observed
effectively: the Federation's ``prime directive.'' This means
nonintervention. You leave a planet and its denizens to their own
devices. Of course, the Federation good guys have broken the rule
many times, and in ``Insurrection'' they do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to unexplained involvement by Lt. Commander Data (Brent
Spiner), Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his Enterprise
crew uncover a conspiracy between a Federation admiral (Anthony
Zerbe) and overtly hostile space farers called the Son'a.
</P>
<P>
   The Son'a want to extract the regenerative powers of the
Edenlike Ba'ku planet at the expense of its sole inhabitants: 600
inexplicably human colonists who live in what looks like a
California spa for the rich and idle. Via their planet's powers,
these folks are virtually immortal. Most are 300 years old, yet
look 40.
</P>
<P>
   The planet also heals.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) overcomes his
blindness, and other officers feel young and frisky. But La Forge
realizes he could never enjoy seeing his first sunset if it came at
the expense of the Ba'ku folks, whose own alleged idealism seems to
preclude sharing.
</P>
<P>
   So the Enterprise defies the admiral and the age-obsessed Son'a
leader, Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), who spends half the film in
repulsive cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Picard leads the colonists in an armed retreat to mountain
caves, while Riker and the Enterprise race to tattle on the admiral
to the Federation.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, they are boldly running away, much as in
``Battlestar Galactica'' or the ``climb every mountain'' ending to
``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   They do finally fight two spiffy space battles, in which the
computer-generated hardware looks nice. But what does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   The action is driven by jargon-filled lines such as, ``They are
rotating their shield harmonics!'' _ which are difficult to figure
out.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the aging Son'a shouldn't steal this fountain of youth.
But couldn't its powers also help the Federation's ill or dying? As
earlier ``Trek'' films have taught, the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is not to think too much and just enjoy precious
moments _ as Picard himself learns to do on Ba'ku.
</P>
<P>
   If you love this series' stars, rest assured you'll have plenty
of endearing moments in which to bask.
</P>
<P>
   Riker and Lt. Commander Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) enjoy a
candle-lit bubble bath, rekindling a romance that occurred early in
``Next Generation's'' run and, with TV's typical inertia, never was
pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Data also gets many cute bits, whether singing a song from one
of Spiner's beloved Broadway shows or commenting innocently on
female officers' enhanced endowments.

<P>
   FRANKFURT _- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's biggest retailer,
Wednesday heralded plans to expand its aggressive discounting
strategy across Europe by nearly quadrupling the number of
``hypermarkets'' it operates in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The retailing giant with its sprawling ``Supercenters,'' which
has transformed U.S. shopping habits at the expense of smaller Main
Street merchants, acquired 74 stores from the big German retail
group Spar Handels AG, adding to the 21-store Wertkauf GmbH chain
it acquired a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart now threatens to change Europe's shopping culture as
well, analysts said. Cutting prices on everything from clothes and
car parts to food and toys, Wal-Mart already has unleashed brutal
price wars in Germany in the 12 months since the Wertkauf
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart's strategy and unique ability to provide low prices
and service will transform the retail landscape over time in
Europe,'' Jeff Feiner, retailing analyst in New York for Lehman
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The Spar acquisition catapults Wal-Mart to the fourth biggest
discounter in Germany, mushrooming the number of such stores in
Germany from zero to nearly 100 in under a year, Feiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of retailing is changing, and the customer is
winning in the long-term,'' said Bob Martin, president of
Wal-Mart's international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day I hope we can serve a good deal of Europe,'' Martin
said. ``Europe is open across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Criado-Perez, senior vice president of Wal-Mart
International, said, ``We are looking for any open door that could
open in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Wal-Mart's strategy has won new customers and increased
sales, the company will change the names on both of its German
chains to Wal-Mart, starting next year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest Wal-Mart expansion, German retailers have
been forced on the defensive. German-based Metro AG, Europe's
largest retailer, last month decided to sell a third of its
businesses in a dramatic measure to help it compete with Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Because Metro is the world's second-biggest retailer behind
Wal-Mart, the latest acquisition raises the stakes in what has
become one of the most fierce corporate rivalries in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart cut prices ``across the whole assortment'' of
everything on offer at Wertkauf, said Ron Tiarks, president of
Wal-Mart's German operations. It will continue to ``drive costs out
of the business'' in its German stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
   German retailers also have suffered a six-year slump, and the
price wars only add to their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   German shopkeepers, who long have enjoyed the protection of
competition barriers, now see those under threat by Wal-Mart.
Although German shopping hours are strictly regulated, Wal-Mart has
managed to extend its hours without violating regulations by
opening earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In May, it began to open its Wertkauf stores at 7 A.M. instead
of the German convention of 9 A.M., which has found ``an excellent
customer response'' and increased business, said Rom Tiarks,
president of Wal-Mart's German operations.
</P>
<P>
   German merchants already complain their costs will rise if they
are forced to hire more staff to lengthen store hours and
simultaneously add staff to compensate for Wal-Mart's emphasis on
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   And because Wal-Mart saves costs by buying in bulk, each new
acquisition adds to potential new pressure on European merchants.
</P>
<P>
   For its own European buying binge, Wal-Mart refused to specify
where it will strike next. Analysts suspect that Wal-Mart will seek
an acquisition in France, with Promodes SA mentioned as a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   German newspapers suggest that Wal-Mart has its eyes on other
German discounters like Aldi Einkauf GmbH and Lidl &AMP; Schwarz GmbH
along with Austrian retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are optimistic about a long-term engagement for Europe; it
is a very attractive place,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, which has over 2,800 discount stores in its home
market in the United States, has been expanding internationally. It
also has stores in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico,
China and South Korea. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the span of a generation, the most successful, or
top grossing, movies of the year have gone from films like
``Midnight Cowboy'' and ``The Godfather'' to ``Liar, Liar'' and
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the public taste sunk so low as to raise nary a hue and cry
about the abysmal quality of American popular culture?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has always promulgated American images and spread its
distinct view of American society throughout the world. Movies
exert the power they do because, to quote D.W. Griffith: ``The
motion picture is boundless in its scope and endless in its
possibilities. The world is its stage, and time without end its
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies intended for mass-market consumption have evolved over
the generations; post-World War II movie audiences became more
sophisticated than they had been in the past and were no longer
content with simplistic adventures, idealistic romances and
outmoded good-guys-versus-bad-guys tales.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of Auschwitz and the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki signaled the beginning of the end of the isolated idealism
of an earlier Hollywood. The war sobered Americans and gave them a
broader view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the complexity of character, the intricacy of
plot and the nuances of relationships that were ubiquitous in the
most popular and successful films 25 or 30 years ago are
extraordinarily rare in the current crop.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ``Godfather'' movies of the early 1970s were among the
top grossing films of those years. Francis Ford Coppola's first
``Godfather'' was not made for a select art-house constituency, yet
it is a brilliant study of ruthlessness and kindness, murder and
sentiment, violence and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the current entertainment climate, it is the rare movie
producer or director who regards the audience with the same respect
that Mr. Coppola and others of his ilk accorded the audiences of a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the top grossing films in the United States of the past
several years _ ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' ``Face/Off,'' ``Batman and Robin,'' ``George of
the Jungle,'' ``Independence Day'' _ there is remarkably little
impetus to think about complex issues of relationships, morality
and other existential topics.
</P>
<P>
   John Schlesinger's ``Midnight Cowboy'' was the third-highest
grossing movie of 1969 as well as that year's Academy-Award winner
for best picture and best director. It unflinchingly portrays an
aspect of the isolation and emptiness of contemporary urban life.
Yet for all the sordidness in this story of a male hustler, there
is caring and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   The darkening mood of the '60s, especially among young
Americans, and an angry, anti-establishment view may explain the
popularity of that era's thoughtful films.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional values were mocked, free expression was demanded and
youth identified with the anti-hero at odds with a social and
political system deemed corrupt and repressive. This search for
deeper meaning may have been reflected in movies that celebrated
outcasts and misfits.
</P>
<P>
   In that decade of racial upheaval, assassinations and a
counterculture of dissent, the moviegoing audience was satisfied
only by films exploring the subtleties of character, personal
choice and ethical scrutiny: ``Beckett,'' ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``The Lion
in Winter'' and ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
</P>
<P>
   In today's popular culture, a void is revealed by the endless
parade of comic-strip characters, superheroes, car chases,
explosions, witless comedies and hackneyed romances that is
currently the norm.
</P>
<P>
   America's most popular form of entertainment, which sets a
standard around the globe, has changed from an artistic medium to a
special-effects contest.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will always be made for discerning audiences who think
seriously about a film's theme, story or performance. One such film
is Atom Egoyan's ``The Sweet Hereafter'' (1997), which tells the
wrenching story of the effect on a small town of a school bus
accident that kills 14 children. Grieving parents and survivors,
and the town's secrets, are portrayed uncompromisingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite much critical praise, and Mr. Egoyan's nomination
for Academy Awards for writing and directing the film, its gross
receipts in the United States have by no means made it a huge
financial success.
</P>
<P>
   While in recent years movies such as ``Schindler's List,'' ``The
English Patient,'' ``Lone Star'' and ``Shine'' have not reached the
financial peak of, say, ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' that they
achieved the success they did may offer a glimmer of hope for those
of us who are despairing over the dumbing down of America. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ In the span of a generation, the most successful, or
top grossing, movies of the year have gone from films like
``Midnight Cowboy'' and ``The Godfather'' to ``Liar, Liar'' and
``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the public taste sunk so low as to raise nary a hue and cry
about the abysmal quality of American popular culture?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has always promulgated American images and spread its
distinct view of American society throughout the world. Movies
exert the power they do because, to quote D.W. Griffith: ``The
motion picture is boundless in its scope and endless in its
possibilities. The world is its stage, and time without end its
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies intended for mass-market consumption have evolved over
the generations; post-World War II movie audiences became more
sophisticated than they had been in the past and were no longer
content with simplistic adventures, idealistic romances and
outmoded good-guys-versus-bad-guys tales.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of Auschwitz and the bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki signaled the beginning of the end of the isolated idealism
of an earlier Hollywood. The war sobered Americans and gave them a
broader view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the complexity of character, the intricacy of
plot and the nuances of relationships that were ubiquitous in the
most popular and successful films 25 or 30 years ago are
extraordinarily rare in the current crop.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ``Godfather'' movies of the early 1970s were among the
top grossing films of those years. Francis Ford Coppola's first
``Godfather'' was not made for a select art-house constituency, yet
it is a brilliant study of ruthlessness and kindness, murder and
sentiment, violence and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the current entertainment climate, it is the rare movie
producer or director who regards the audience with the same respect
that Mr. Coppola and others of his ilk accorded the audiences of a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the top grossing films in the United States of the past
several years _ ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' ``My Best
Friend's Wedding,'' ``Face/Off,'' ``Batman and Robin,'' ``George of
the Jungle,'' ``Independence Day'' _ there is remarkably little
impetus to think about complex issues of relationships, morality
and other existential topics.
</P>
<P>
   John Schlesinger's ``Midnight Cowboy'' was the third-highest
grossing movie of 1969 as well as that year's Academy-Award winner
for best picture and best director. It unflinchingly portrays an
aspect of the isolation and emptiness of contemporary urban life.
Yet for all the sordidness in this story of a male hustler, there
is caring and pathos.
</P>
<P>
   The darkening mood of the '60s, especially among young
Americans, and an angry, anti-establishment view may explain the
popularity of that era's thoughtful films.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional values were mocked, free expression was demanded and
youth identified with the anti-hero at odds with a social and
political system deemed corrupt and repressive. This search for
deeper meaning may have been reflected in movies that celebrated
outcasts and misfits.
</P>
<P>
   In that decade of racial upheaval, assassinations and a
counterculture of dissent, the moviegoing audience was satisfied
only by films exploring the subtleties of character, personal
choice and ethical scrutiny: ``Beckett,'' ``A Man for All
Seasons,'' ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Romeo and Juliet,'' ``The Lion
in Winter'' and ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?''
</P>
<P>
   In today's popular culture, a void is revealed by the endless
parade of comic-strip characters, superheroes, car chases,
explosions, witless comedies and hackneyed romances that is
currently the norm.
</P>
<P>
   America's most popular form of entertainment, which sets a
standard around the globe, has changed from an artistic medium to a
special-effects contest.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will always be made for discerning audiences who think
seriously about a film's theme, story or performance. One such film
is Atom Egoyan's ``The Sweet Hereafter'' (1997), which tells the
wrenching story of the effect on a small town of a school bus
accident that kills 14 children. Grieving parents and survivors,
and the town's secrets, are portrayed uncompromisingly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite much critical praise, and Mr. Egoyan's nomination
for Academy Awards for writing and directing the film, its gross
receipts in the United States have by no means made it a huge
financial success.
</P>
<P>
   While in recent years movies such as ``Schindler's List,'' ``The
English Patient,'' ``Lone Star'' and ``Shine'' have not reached the
financial peak of, say, ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day,'' that they
achieved the success they did may offer a glimmer of hope for those
of us who are despairing over the dumbing down of America. &QL;

   HIROSHIMA, Japan _ When Mazda Motor Corp. appointed its first
non-Japanese president in 1996 the reaction of some Japanese was as
if the ``Black Ships'' of Commodore Matthew Perry had docked at
Hiroshima and seized control of the castle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. had just increased its stake in Mazda to 33.4
percent from 24.5 percent, and making Henry Wallace, a Scotsman
seconded to Mazda from Ford, seemed to Japanese nationalists the
beginning of the end for a proud company founded in Hiroshima in
1920.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, with a second non-Japanese from Ford as new
president, the remarkable turnaround of Japan's fifth-largest auto
maker has banished such dark thoughts in a dazzle of its
headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Giant Nissan Motor Co. posted a parent net loss of 32.5 billion
yen ($217 million) for the six months ending Sept. 30, down 71
billion yen from the same period in 1997, has sold its head office
in Tokyo's swank Ginza district, and sought public funds from the
Japan Development Bank to winch it out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda has swung into the fast lane. Net income of the parent
company for the first half was 5.5 billion yen, up 4.9 billion yen;
and on a consolidated basis for the whole Mazda group, 8.5 billion
yen, an increase of 18.2 billion yen. This was achieved in the
teeth of economic recession in most of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where auto sales are at their lowest level since 1985,
Mazda slightly increased its market share to 5.8 percent. It also
sold more vehicles in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important to Gary Hexter, a Ford executive with Mazda
since 1994 and now a senior managing director and its chief
financial officer, is that Mazda can comfortably finance its debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat here in 1994, we saw a parent company debt level
of a little over 580 billion yen, and in a relatively short period
of time, in 1998 and 1999, we saw almost 200 billion yen of bonds
maturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a scenario unfolded where we couldn't fix the business as
quickly as we hoped, if we couldn't generate cash to the level
required, if there were a change in the liquidity situation in
Japan, we would be in serious, serious trouble as a corporation,''
recalls Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``So almost the first thing we did was to focus on cash-flow
management and debt reduction. This was an emphasis that
historically did not exist at Mazda, and at many other Japanese and
Asian companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borrowing rates were low; credit was readily available; and so
people tended to have the ability to very rapidly borrow their way
into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wallace and new Mazda President James Miller, who is also
from Ford, hav occupied the limelight, insiders give most credit
for rebuilding Mazda's finances to 54-year-old Hexter, an
Australian apostle of Ford's ``bottom line'' culture.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Mazda, Hexter was based at Ford headquarters in
Detroit, and from 1991 to 1993 was instrumental in halting the cash
hemorrhage at Jaguar, the famous British luxury car maker purchased
by Ford in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hexter cautions against comparing Jaguar, ``a relatively small
operation'' which bottomed at 22,000 units a year in 1991, ``with a
company as large and complex as Mazda.'' He acknowledges, however,
that they both had ``excellent engineering'' and ``severe financial
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda also possesses the ability, ``consistent with many
Japanese companies,'' of bringing a new model from concept to
production in less time, and with ``substantially less'' financial
investment than Hexter had ``previously experienced,'' together
with a ``tremendously loyal, capable work force, supported by an
excellent union.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was unimpressed, however, by the freedom allowed Mazda's
engineers to indulge their dreams, rather than responding to what
most customers wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's long and costly love-affair with the ``revolutionary''
rotary engine in the 1970s and 1980s yielded a trove of patents,
but is now solely used in the RX-7 that sells only in small volume
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's nifty Roadster (sold as the MX-5 in Europe, and Miata in
the United States), was eulogized recently by the editor of Car
magazine as ``the world's most commendable open-top sports car,''
but as Hexter points out, ``you can't build a company on a niche
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The more conventional and less exciting 626/Capella ``global
car'' and the compact Demio, both introduced in 1996-97, are part
of a new strategy to ensure that Mazda has a ``good and strong
presence in the key segments of the market,'' says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   He traces Mazda's near-nemesis in the 1990s to an ill-conceived
``Five Sales Channel Strategy'' it launched at the start of the
asset-inflated boom of the 1980s to expand its volume worldwide,
especially in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The company expanded the number of its models to match the
multiplication of new sales channels for different types of car,
and built a new Mazda factory in Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, and in
a joint venture with Ford, a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that led to a substantial amount of capital investment,
and added significantly to Mazda's fixed costs. Mazda had seven
consecutive years of negative cash flow, and debt almost tripled,''
says Hexter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the investment went in, all the cost was added, and with
the bursting of the bubble economy in Japan, and rapid decline in
(sales) volumes, Mazda never achieved the sales to justify the
original investment.
</P>
<P>
   That was compounded by a number of products that were less than
successful, which further exacerbated the problem of declining
industry sales. The net result was that in the year ended March 31,
1994, Mazda lost about 44 billion yen as a parent company.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazda had also had structural weaknesses peculiar to large,
non-holding Japanese corporations: numerous affiliates and
subsidiaries with ``poor financial results and fairly high levels
of debt,'' and a large portfolio of shares held in other
companies. &QL;

SEAGRAM ANNOUNCES STREAMLINED MUSIC OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seagram Co. has confirmed it significantly will
reduce employment at its music operations by what's widely believed
to be about 3,000 jobs over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will start in mid-January as part of a massive
reorganization announced Thursday by Seagram as it completed its
$10.4 billion buyout of PolyGram. The combined operations, which
have 15,500 employees, will be called Universal Music Group and be
based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will job cuts but we're not commenting on how many,''
said spokesman Robert Bernstein. He also confirmed previous
statements that Seagram's restructuring has a target of generating
$300 million in annual cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at one of Universal's local labels said the
announcements contained no surprises. ``We're trying to pretend
there's nothing going on because there's nothing we can do about
it,'' said the employee, who asked to remain unnamed. ``We just
wish they'd get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves come against a backdrop of uncertainty in the music
industry, which has seen stagnant sales, lack of new blockbuster
artists and a more fractured worldwide market no longer dominated
by American and British acts. ``This past decade has been a
lackluster time for pop music in two key areas _ commercial success
and cultural impact,'' said Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the company confirmed Thursday that about 20 percent
of the combined work force will be eliminated by June. Seagram
offered few details about the restructuring, other than
reconfiguring several labels and spelling out executive
responsibilities, but the takeover undoubtedly will lead to
reductions in artist rosters, and closures of duplicative offices
and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said the music giant will be far better able to
generate profits than its four chief rivals _ EMI, Sony, Warner and
Bertelsmann. UMG Chairman Doug Morris left little doubt Thursday
that deep cuts are coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integration of these two companies presents a rare
opportunity to create an organization that is well positioned for
profitable growth,'' Morris said in a statement. ``UMG will be a
lean, flexible organization that will benefit from economies of
scale while nurturing a strong local entrepreneurial spirit in its
management team around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes announced Thursday include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Combining the Island and Mercury labels into a New York-based
operation.

   _ The formation of an East Coast label group in New York,
composed of Universal Records and Motown Records.

   _ The merger of jazz labels Verve and GRP, which will be located

</P>
<P>
   _ The creation of a West Coast group of labels, located in Los

Seagram said it expects to buy the half of Interscope it does not

   Bruce Hack, formerly chief financial officer for Universal
Studios, was named vice chairman of the music unit and will oversee
strategy, finance, manufacturing and sales. Zach Horowitz, who has
been chief operating officer, was named president and will oversee
daily operations with Morris.
</P>
<P>
   The PolyGram deal is the biggest move yet for Seagram Chief
Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family owns 32 percent
of Seagram, since buying Universal Studios in 1995. Skislock said
the strategy, which has included generating $3.3 billion by selling
off juice maker Tropicana, can work despite the current doldrums in
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to commit capital to a business is when those assets
are out of favor,'' the analyst said. ``Someone like Bronfman will
get the best value so it's very savvy. It shows he has a very
long-term commitment to this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Skislock believes that the merged company's size will give it an
advantage in the most critical area _ attracting superstars with
transcendental appeal, like Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Frank
Sinatra, the Bee Gees and Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're looking for is a creative force to emerge, like
Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in film, who connects with the
public and gives the medium direction,'' he said. ``We'll continue
to see merging and downsizing in the business until we have a true
breakout artist. In the absence of that, you have to gear your
strategy toward movie soundtracks and music videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal-based Seagram also announced Thursday it would
integrate PolyGram's film operations and 800 employees into
Universal's struggling movie business but gave no indication
whether it will cut jobs. Seagram put those assets up for sale in
May but found no buyers at its reported $1 billion asking price.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram previously agreed to sell most of PolyGram's library to
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $250 million and that deal will close at
the end of the year. &QL;

<HEADLINE>
OFFICIALS SAY TAXPAYER MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON NEW STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Elected officials Thursday for the first time
said taxpayer money would be used to construct the proposed new
stadium for the New England Patriots, but claimed they ``found''
another $400 million in revenue that had not been factored into the
project's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   While Governor John Rowland said the legislature would authorize
dipping into Connecticut's budget surplus for $100 million, the
state budget director astonished officials when he announced that
two recent analyses of the project, which produced widely divergent
conclusions, had failed to consider projected revenues from games
played in the stadium by the University of Connecticut football
team.
</P>
<P>
   Adding in revenues from UConn games means that the stadium, for
which the state will borrow up to $375 million, will pay for itself
far sooner than had been originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state will now be in the black by year five,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Ritter, after emerging from a two and a half hour
meeting with Rowland and other House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier estimates said it might take the state 30 years to break
even. Another study said the stadium was a money loser.
</P>
<P>
   Officials Thursday also confirmed that the state is asking team
owner Robert Kraft to back down on the luxury seat guarantees it
originally offered. Those lucrative guarantees would pay Kraft the
difference if he was unable to sell all of the expensive club seats
and luxury boxes in the proposed 68,000 seat stadium. Those
guarantees hold a potential liability for taxpayers of $175 million
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from the meetings Thursday the bipartisan group
of legislators said they agreed that the seat guarantees would have
to be cut somewhat and they designated Rowland as the bearer of bad
news to Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the governor to go back to the Krafts on the
guarantee,'' Ritter said. ``We only want to have one person
negotiating with him. We feel comfortable, in a bipartisan way, to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to say just how much the state would be asking
Kraft to concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantive negotiations have to be private,'' he said. ``I
think what's happening is because we're getting near the end, it's
a more reasonable thing to ask for. I will say it's a very
important issue to my caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment Thursday night.
However, individuals close to the negotiations said that while the
team expects some changes in the seat guarantees, any substantial
change could upset the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative leaders clearly wanted to talk more about the
new found money. Puzzled over why two recent analyses of the
project could produce such different results, state officials asked
Marc Ryan, the executive director of the Office of Policy and
Management, to investigate. A report issued Wednesday by the
independent Office of Fiscal Analysis found the deal could lose
$322 million while an earlier commissioned study by consultants
KPMG Peat Marwick, determined Connecticut would just about break
even over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither study factored in revenues from the UConn
football team, which will play in the facility. Right now, the
Huskies lose $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds to his legend,'' Ritter said of Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative leaders considered Thursday a hallmark day in
the stadium saga for other reasons as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because the leaders agreed on using $100 million from the budget
surplus. The state will now borrow just $250 million to pay for the
stadium and surrounding roads and infrastructure. The construction
will also support a convention center in the $1 billion Adriaen's
Landing project along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the six legislative leaders have agreed
on what we are doing internally and what we want the governor to
do,'' Ritter said. ``It's just up to the governor and Kraft to do
their bit and as far as I'm concerned we're in pretty good shape.
UConn helps tremendously. And unfortunately, PR-wise, UConn is
magical here and not having used them was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to blame KPMG Peat Marwick or other state number
crunchers for the oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Capitol observers believe the deal with team owner
Robert Kraft would pass unaltered before the General Assembly,
Rowland, who was just re-elected, clearly wants to appease
lawmakers whose support he may need over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responsibility is to the legislators and I want them to
feel comfortable with this vote,'' said Rowland, a Republican.
``We're never going to satisfy naysayers...(But) if we make some
changes to the guarantee that makes it more palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and members of the general public who spoke at
Wednesday's hearing here frequently slammed that component of the
deal as being too risky and expensive for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme at the hearing was union job guarantees for
stadium construction and operations. But Rowland said Thursday he
did not think labor clauses would be written into the legislation.

   &UR; BAD BOYS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were
excessively mischievous. The two were always getting into trouble
and their parents could be assured that if any mischief occurred in
their town their two young sons were in some way involved.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were at their wits end as to what to do about their
sons' behavior. The mother had heard that a clergyman in town had
been successful in disciplining children in the past, so she asked
her husband if he thought they should send the boys to speak with
the clergyman. The husband said, `We might as well. We need to do
something before I really lose my temper!` The clergyman agreed to
speak with the boys, but asked to see them individually.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 year old went to meet with him first. The clergyman sat
the boy down and asked him sternly, `Where is God?` The boy made no
response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner
tone, `Where is God?`
</P>
<P>
   Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the clergyman raised
his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face, `WHERE
IS GOD?`
</P>
<P>
   At that the boy bolted from the room and ran directly home,
slamming himself in the closet. His older brother followed him into
the closet and said, `What happened?`
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother replied, `We are in BIG trouble this time.
God is missing and they think we did it.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Train to Mannheim (Oldie but Goodie) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day a man took the train from Paris to Frankfurt. When he
got in he said to the ticket man:
</P>
<P>
   `Sir. I really need you to do me a favor, I have to get down
this train in Mannheim, but I'm very tired and it is for sure that
I will fall asleep. So what I want you to do is that you wake me up
in Mannheim because I have to close a business there and it is very
important for me. Here you have 100 francs for the favor. But I
warn you sometimes when people wake me up I get really violent, but
no matters what I do or say you got to get me out of this train in
Mannheim. Is that clear?`
</P>
<P>
   So the ticket man agreed and took the 100 francs. Later as the
man had said he fall asleep, and when he woke up he realized that
he was in Frankfurt. He was so mad at the ticket man that he ran
over and started yelling at the ticket man.
</P>
<P>
   `Are you STUPID or something??? I paid you 100 francs so that
you wake me up in Mannheim. And you didn't I want my money back you
$%(CT)(AT)$!`
</P>
<P>
   While the man was yelling at the ticket guy, two other guys that
were also in the train were looking at them, so one turns to the
other and says to him:
</P>
<P>
   Guy1, `Look at this guy - he is really mad!`
</P>
<P>
   Guy2, `Yeah, almost as mad as the guy they made get off the
train in
</P>
<P>
   Mannheim.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIBLE STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A minister asked a six year old boy what his favorite Bible
story was.
</P>
<P>
   `I guess the one about Noah and the ark, where they float around
on the water for 40 days and 40 nights.` replied the boy.
</P>
<P>
   `That was a good story` said the minister, `And, with all that
water, I bet they had a good time fishing, don't you think?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy thought for a moment, then replied `I don't think so
they only had two worms.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIRLS NIGHT OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   there is a bar in New York where, in the Ladies Room, there is a
very special mirror. If one stands in front of the mirror and tells
the truth, one is granted a wish. However, if one tells a lie, POOF
you are instantly swallowed up by the mirror, never to be seen
again.
</P>
<P>
   A redhead of questionable looks walks into the Ladies Room and
stands before the mirror and says, `I think I'm the most beautiful
woman in the world.` POOF The mirror swallows her.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a rather large brunette stands before the mirror and says,
`I think I think I'm the sexiest woman alive! POOF The mirror
swallows her.
</P>
<P>
   Then an absolutely gorgeous blond comes in and stands before the
mirror and says, `I think...` POOF
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOOSING THE GANDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor
with an unusual offer.
</P>
<P>
   `Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows.
When you get to me and the part where I'm to promise to 'love,
honor and obey' and 'forsaking all others, be faithful to her
forever,' I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave that part out.` He
passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the day of the wedding, and the bride and groom have
moved to that part of the ceremony where the vows are exchanged.
When it comes time for the groom's vows, the pastor looks the young
man in the eye and says:
</P>
<P>
   `Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her
every command and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of
your life and swear eternally before God and your lovely wife that
you will not ever even look at another woman, as long as you both
shall live?`
</P>
<P>
   The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice,
`Yes.`
</P>
<P>
   The groom leaned toward the pastor and hissed, `I thought we had
a deal.`
</P>
<P>
   The pastor put the $100 bill into his hand and whispered back,
`She made me a much better offer.`

   &UR; BAD BOYS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A couple had two little boys, ages 8 and 10, who were
excessively mischievous. The two were always getting into trouble
and their parents could be assured that if any mischief occurred in
their town their two young sons were in some way involved.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were at their wits end as to what to do about their
sons' behavior. The mother had heard that a clergyman in town had
been successful in disciplining children in the past, so she asked
her husband if he thought they should send the boys to speak with
the clergyman. The husband said, `We might as well. We need to do
something before I really lose my temper!` The clergyman agreed to
speak with the boys, but asked to see them individually.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 year old went to meet with him first. The clergyman sat
the boy down and asked him sternly, `Where is God?` The boy made no
response, so the clergyman repeated the question in an even sterner
tone, `Where is God?`
</P>
<P>
   Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the clergyman raised
his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face, `WHERE
IS GOD?`
</P>
<P>
   At that the boy bolted from the room and ran directly home,
slamming himself in the closet. His older brother followed him into
the closet and said, `What happened?`
</P>
<P>
   The younger brother replied, `We are in BIG trouble this time.
God is missing and they think we did it.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Train to Mannheim (Oldie but Goodie) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One day a man took the train from Paris to Frankfurt. When he
got in he said to the ticket man:
</P>
<P>
   `Sir. I really need you to do me a favor, I have to get down
this train in Mannheim, but I'm very tired and it is for sure that
I will fall asleep. So what I want you to do is that you wake me up
in Mannheim because I have to close a business there and it is very
important for me. Here you have 100 francs for the favor. But I
warn you sometimes when people wake me up I get really violent, but
no matters what I do or say you got to get me out of this train in
Mannheim. Is that clear?`
</P>
<P>
   So the ticket man agreed and took the 100 francs. Later as the
man had said he fall asleep, and when he woke up he realized that
he was in Frankfurt. He was so mad at the ticket man that he ran
over and started yelling at the ticket man.
</P>
<P>
   `Are you STUPID or something??? I paid you 100 francs so that
you wake me up in Mannheim. And you didn't I want my money back you
$%(CT)(AT)$!`
</P>
<P>
   While the man was yelling at the ticket guy, two other guys that
were also in the train were looking at them, so one turns to the
other and says to him:
</P>
<P>
   Guy1, `Look at this guy - he is really mad!`
</P>
<P>
   Guy2, `Yeah, almost as mad as the guy they made get off the
train in
</P>
<P>
   Mannheim.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIBLE STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A minister asked a six year old boy what his favorite Bible
story was.
</P>
<P>
   `I guess the one about Noah and the ark, where they float around
on the water for 40 days and 40 nights.` replied the boy.
</P>
<P>
   `That was a good story` said the minister, `And, with all that
water, I bet they had a good time fishing, don't you think?`
</P>
<P>
   The boy thought for a moment, then replied `I don't think so
they only had two worms.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIRLS NIGHT OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   there is a bar in New York where, in the Ladies Room, there is a
very special mirror. If one stands in front of the mirror and tells
the truth, one is granted a wish. However, if one tells a lie, POOF
you are instantly swallowed up by the mirror, never to be seen
again.
</P>
<P>
   A redhead of questionable looks walks into the Ladies Room and
stands before the mirror and says, `I think I'm the most beautiful
woman in the world.` POOF The mirror swallows her.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a rather large brunette stands before the mirror and says,
`I think I think I'm the sexiest woman alive! POOF The mirror
swallows her.
</P>
<P>
   Then an absolutely gorgeous blond comes in and stands before the
mirror and says, `I think...` POOF
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOOSING THE GANDER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor
with an unusual offer.
</P>
<P>
   `Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows.
When you get to me and the part where I'm to promise to 'love,
honor and obey' and 'forsaking all others, be faithful to her
forever,' I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave that part out.` He
passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the day of the wedding, and the bride and groom have
moved to that part of the ceremony where the vows are exchanged.
When it comes time for the groom's vows, the pastor looks the young
man in the eye and says:
</P>
<P>
   `Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her
every command and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of
your life and swear eternally before God and your lovely wife that
you will not ever even look at another woman, as long as you both
shall live?`
</P>
<P>
   The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice,
`Yes.`
</P>
<P>
   The groom leaned toward the pastor and hissed, `I thought we had
a deal.`
</P>
<P>
   The pastor put the $100 bill into his hand and whispered back,
`She made me a much better offer.`

OFFICIALS SAY TAXPAYER MONEY WILL BE SPENT ON NEW STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Elected officials Thursday for the first time
said taxpayer money would be used to construct the proposed new
stadium for the New England Patriots, but claimed they ``found''
another $400 million in revenue that had not been factored into the
project's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   While Governor John Rowland said the legislature would authorize
dipping into Connecticut's budget surplus for $100 million, the
state budget director astonished officials when he announced that
two recent analyses of the project, which produced widely divergent
conclusions, had failed to consider projected revenues from games
played in the stadium by the University of Connecticut football
team.
</P>
<P>
   Adding in revenues from UConn games means that the stadium, for
which the state will borrow up to $375 million, will pay for itself
far sooner than had been originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state will now be in the black by year five,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Ritter, after emerging from a two and a half hour
meeting with Rowland and other House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier estimates said it might take the state 30 years to break
even. Another study said the stadium was a money loser.
</P>
<P>
   Officials Thursday also confirmed that the state is asking team
owner Robert Kraft to back down on the luxury seat guarantees it
originally offered. Those lucrative guarantees would pay Kraft the
difference if he was unable to sell all of the expensive club seats
and luxury boxes in the proposed 68,000 seat stadium. Those
guarantees hold a potential liability for taxpayers of $175 million
over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from the meetings Thursday the bipartisan group
of legislators said they agreed that the seat guarantees would have
to be cut somewhat and they designated Rowland as the bearer of bad
news to Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the governor to go back to the Krafts on the
guarantee,'' Ritter said. ``We only want to have one person
negotiating with him. We feel comfortable, in a bipartisan way, to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to say just how much the state would be asking
Kraft to concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantive negotiations have to be private,'' he said. ``I
think what's happening is because we're getting near the end, it's
a more reasonable thing to ask for. I will say it's a very
important issue to my caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   A Patriots spokesman declined to comment Thursday night.
However, individuals close to the negotiations said that while the
team expects some changes in the seat guarantees, any substantial
change could upset the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative leaders clearly wanted to talk more about the
new found money. Puzzled over why two recent analyses of the
project could produce such different results, state officials asked
Marc Ryan, the executive director of the Office of Policy and
Management, to investigate. A report issued Wednesday by the
independent Office of Fiscal Analysis found the deal could lose
$322 million while an earlier commissioned study by consultants
KPMG Peat Marwick, determined Connecticut would just about break
even over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   However, neither study factored in revenues from the UConn
football team, which will play in the facility. Right now, the
Huskies lose $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds to his legend,'' Ritter said of Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   But legislative leaders considered Thursday a hallmark day in
the stadium saga for other reasons as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because the leaders agreed on using $100 million from the budget
surplus. The state will now borrow just $250 million to pay for the
stadium and surrounding roads and infrastructure. The construction
will also support a convention center in the $1 billion Adriaen's
Landing project along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time the six legislative leaders have agreed
on what we are doing internally and what we want the governor to
do,'' Ritter said. ``It's just up to the governor and Kraft to do
their bit and as far as I'm concerned we're in pretty good shape.
UConn helps tremendously. And unfortunately, PR-wise, UConn is
magical here and not having used them was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter declined to blame KPMG Peat Marwick or other state number
crunchers for the oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Capitol observers believe the deal with team owner
Robert Kraft would pass unaltered before the General Assembly,
Rowland, who was just re-elected, clearly wants to appease
lawmakers whose support he may need over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responsibility is to the legislators and I want them to
feel comfortable with this vote,'' said Rowland, a Republican.
``We're never going to satisfy naysayers...(But) if we make some
changes to the guarantee that makes it more palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and members of the general public who spoke at
Wednesday's hearing here frequently slammed that component of the
deal as being too risky and expensive for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Another theme at the hearing was union job guarantees for
stadium construction and operations. But Rowland said Thursday he
did not think labor clauses would be written into the legislation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House, mobilizing a campaign to stop
impeachment, has been bouyed by quiet discussions with some leading
Republicans on Capitol Hill about a deal under which President
Clinton would accept a punitive censure resolution to escape
impeachment and trial, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts have not been with the main Republicans driving the
impeachment movement, Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois and Rep. Tom
Delay of Texas, but involve other important figures who have given
the White House some hope but no certainty, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as part of the broad effort to sway undecided
Republican House moderates, presidential aides have contacted 45
potentially persuadable members of Congress in the past few days to
offer further evidence or explanation in the president's defense
and to urge them to vote against impeachment, according to White
House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself spoke to ``a handful'' of House members this
week to try to answer their concerns, a White House official said
Thursday night. The official would not provide the members' names.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House said that two undecided House
members, Rick Lazio and Michael Forbes, both of New York, are
scheduled to travel with the president to the Middle East, giving
Clinton a further opportunity to make his case. Lazio said Thursday
that he not yet decided whether to go.
</P>
<P>
   Another undecided Republican, Jon Fox of Pennsylvania, is also
scheduled to accompany the president to Israel, according to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The shape of a compromise that would save Clinton from
impeachment was fuzzy Thursday night. But advisers to the president
suggested that Republican leaders might permit a vote on a harsh
censure resolution, including a substantial fine to be paid by
Clinton, if it appeared that the impeachment bill was going to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have so far been adamant that the full House
would vote only on articles of impeachment, not on censure. Rep.
Robert Livingston, the speaker-elect, refused to say Thursday
whether he would allow a vote on censure.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said Thursday that Republican leaders were not
putting pressure on members to vote for impeachment, but that the
White House is engaged in an aggressive anti-impeachment campaign.
``The president's administration and his people have not hesitated
to lobby,'' Livingston said. ``We hear they're lobbying in all
sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thursday's greater sense of optimism among some
presidential advisers, the Clinton White House has frequently
misread the mood of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The current White House optimism contrasts with a feeling as
recent as last weekend, when Clinton and his top aides were deeply
pessimistic about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official said privately Thursday that
the White House was now engaged in wishful thinking and predicted
that the House would vote to impeach Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of danger for the president, a senior Republican
aide in Congress said that four Republicans will announce Friday
that they will vote to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In response to pleas from his advisers and fence-sitting members
of Congress, Clinton is considering a public statement on the
impeachment matter before he leaves for Jerusalem on Saturday or
shortly after his return on Tuesday. If the Judiciary Committee
approves one or more articles of impeachment, as expected, the full
House will begin debate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Thursday to thank him for
his statement earlier this week opposing impeachment, according to
the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart. D'Amato, a bitter critic
of Clinton over the past six years, said on Tuesday that impeaching
the president would be a ``grave mistake'' for the nation and a
disaster for the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary discussions with members of Congress have cheered
White House partisans, leading to at least momentary optimism that
Clinton can avoid a Senate impeachment trial on any of the four
impeachment articles charging perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're fine, today,'' said one presidential adviser,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Today,'' he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, using a variety of intermediaries in the
business community and among political consultants who work with
both parties, have also reached out to Republican leaders to
negotiate a quick end to the impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of detailed legal and constitutional defense of
the president before the House Judiciary Committee, the White House
is making a subtle attempt to persuade Republicans that impeaching
a popular president would seriously damage the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials point to D'Amato's remarks as
representative of a substantial number of Republicans who want to
punish the president but not contravene the will of the public,
which opposes impeachment by a wide margin. D'Amato lost a
re-election bid last month after 18 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be a unified national party and have a country
that is unified, we have to get this behind us,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   A political adviser to the president who also has close ties to
Republicans said that he believed D'Amato's comments were carefully
timed and cleared by senior Republicans as a signal to House
Republicans to stop short of sending articles of impeachment to the
Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Neither D'Amato nor his aides returned telephone calls seeking
comment. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, said that Lott had not spoken to D'Amato before his
remarks and that D'Amato spoke for himself, not for the Senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for one Republican who favors censure over
impeachment, Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, said that Clinton has
not yet adequately explained or apologized for his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and that Tauzin's vote was still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of a detailed, heartfelt apology from the president, I
think he's sealed his fate,'' said Ken Johnson, Tauzin's spokesman.
``Right now, the only person who can save the president from the
embarrassment of impeachment is the president himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was receptive Thursday to the censure resolution
proposed by House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes that people who in good faith come
forward with a reasonable solution to put this matter behind us, in
a prompt way, short of impeachment, should be considered,''
Lockhart said. ``And looking at that proposal, I think it meets the
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic censure resolution says that Clinton violated the
trust of the public and dishonored his office, deserving the
``censure and condemnation of the American people and the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution leaves open the possibility of the indictment of
Clinton after he leaves office, but it does not require him to pay
a fine or appear personally before the House to answer the charges
against him. Those provisions have been suggested by others,
including William Weld, the Republican former governor of
Massachusetts, who appeared as a witness before the Judiciary
Committee on behalf of the White House on Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart would not definitively answer whether Clinton was
willing to accept a fine as part of a censure deal, saying the
question had not yet been formally raised by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the possibility of indictment after Clinton leaves
office was an ``acknowledgment of reality'' because the
Constitution does not grant a former president immunity from
criminal prosecution for acts while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not commented on the impeachment debate this week
but revealed a bit of his state of mind at an observance marking
Human Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned in ways large and small in the last six years
that there is within every person a scale of justice,'' the
president said Thursday, ``and that people can too easily be herded
into hatred and extremism often out of a belief that they have
absolute truth and therefore are entitled to absolute power, that
they can ignore any Constitution, any laws, override any facts.''

SECOND HIDEAWAY ATTRIBUTED TO MAN LIVING IN SECRET 10 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A second home hidden on Nantucket Island has been
linked to underground man Thomas Johnson, and authorities said
Thursday it may be dismantled within a week.
</P>
<P>
   This home, a hand-built log cabin obscured by brush and beech
trees, is about a quarter mile from the 8-foot-deep, three-room
dwelling where Johnson says he has lived in near-secret for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin, built of hand-notched pine logs from a nearby state
forest, appears to be on property of the Wannacomet Water Co., a
town agency. Wannacomet general manager Robert Gardner said
Thursday state law prohibits residences within a 400-foot radius of
municipal wells.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said the Nantucket Board of Water Commissioners is
likely to vote to dismantle the structure when it meets Tuesday for
a monthly session. If that action is taken, he said, the home could
be leveled within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another refuge is discovered,'' Johnson said Thursday.
``They're closing in on me. They're doing their best to make things
hot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have known about the structure for more than a year,
state Environmental police Sergeant Donald La Haye said, but did
not take action because the home did not appear to be occupied.
</P>
<P>
   But when recent surveillance showed renewed activity there _ and
after Johnson's more-elaborate underground home was discovered _
authorities noticed similarities in construction and decided to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he was impressed when he first viewed the home
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty well-built log cabin with a couple of windows
and a table,'' Gardner said. A bench is placed against one wall in
the cabin, he added, along with a slate floor and a tarp roof
covered with brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get within 50 feet and not know it is there,''
Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the clock has begun ticking toward Johnson's eviction
from his underground home. The process could take more than two
months. But when the time comes to leave, Johnson said, he will not
provoke a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to make a standoff,'' Johnson said. ``I'll move
when they tell me to move. But I'll stay in here as long as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   A Nantucket deputy sheriff served Johnson with a 30-day eviction
notice Saturday at his subterranean hideaway on a Boy Scout camp.
If he does not leave within that time, the Boy Scouts are expected
to go to court to force his removal.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Johnson Jr., a Nantucket lawyer who represents the Scouts
in this matter, said the troop will allow Johnson a reasonable
amount of time to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said the Scouts' hand was forced once the home was
discovered by a deer hunter alerted by its stovepipe. Code
violations were discovered by the Nantucket health officer, who
then served the Scouts with a notice of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   Scout executive Michael Riley of the Cape and Islands Council
said Nantucket scouting officials ``are going to do what has to be
done and whatever's the right thing to do in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Riley continued, ``they're trying to show
some compassion and dignity for Tom Johnson in accordance with the
three points of the Scout code: to be courteous, friendly, and
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Johnson, who serves on the troop committee and is handling
the case for free, said the Scouts ``are looking into some way that
the home can be saved'' as a teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   However, he continued, the home ``could become an attractive
nuisance'' and pose a danger to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Thomas Johnson said local support for him has
been heartening. ``It's incredible,'' said Johnson, who created a
subterranean life on Nantucket after fleeing a prison sentence in
Italy for heroin smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The two years he spent in a Rome cell changed his life, Johnson
said, and led him to an underground existence where he could
strengthen himself morally and avoid the chafing routine he sees in
mainstream living.
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities confirmed this week that Johnson fled the
country in 1985, following 26 months in a Rome prison and one month
of subsequent house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian law enforcement official, who did not wish to be
identified, said authorities had not known if Johnson was still
alive. The prospect of extradition is not high, he said, because
the United States generally does not return one of its citizens on
such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was apprehended at the Rome airport in May 1983
while attempting to smuggle 2 kilograms of Thai heroin into Italy
via Amsterdam. The heroin had a street value of $2.6 million at the
time, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was to have been paid $10,000 for stashing the
heroin, stitched into a suitcase, in a locker at the Rome train
station. The trip was his third in Europe as a heroin courier,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other details about Johnson's past also have been confirmed,
including statements that his father was a city judge in
Binghamton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   According to Broome County historian Gerald Smith, Johnson was
one of seven children born to William H. Johnson Jr., a prominent
arts supporter, judge, and municipal official who resigned from the
Binghamton Housing Authority after he alleged there had been
political interference in tenant selection.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Johnson served as city judge from 1959 to 1962. He
also had been chairman of the Tri-Cities Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Johnson said his father died in his arms, of liver and
colon cancer, in 1981. The family fell apart after the death,
Johnson said.

FOR GIANTS' KANELL, STARTING MAY BE A SNAP AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ New York Giants quarterback Kent Graham
knows he could be replaced Sunday, but he is preparing for the
Denver Broncos as he did for each of his three previous opponents.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Graham never felt his starting job was entirely
secure anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach said that if things weren't going good, he might
make a change,'' Graham said, referring to Jim Fassel. ``That's
always true. He always has the ability to pull you out of there no
matter who you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think much has changed since last week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Fassel said he planned to give Danny Kanell, the
backup quarterback, more repetitions with the first unit during
this week's practice, and he announced that Graham would have to
play well or Kanell would be trading in his sideline baseball cap
for his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's comments were different from those he made in previous
weeks when he said that it would be hard for Graham to lose his
starting status in any one game.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, like Graham, Fassel said he did not think his
comments on the quarterback situation reflected an entirely new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd want Danny to play,'' Fassel said after practice.
``But I expect Kent to do well. That's what I'm planning on _ him
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell did get some extra practice time Thursday, but Fassel
played down that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny got more reps but I don't ever believe in getting two
guys ready for a game,'' Fassel said. ``Kent is the starting
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, for his part, seems to be trying to walk a fine line
between mutually exclusive goals. He wishes for playing time but he
wishes good things for Graham and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss playing; I miss being in there,'' Kanell said this
week. ``I'm anxious to get back on the field. But I want us to beat
the Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell acknowledged the awkwardness of the situation, and he
laughed off the notion that he should not be rooting for his
comeback to come against as strong an opponent as the undefeated
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it as opportunity,'' Kanell said. ``If
anything, if it happened, it would be a no-lose situation. We're
supposed to lose, you try to do your best, and if you beat them,
you shock everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell has been more at ease since the days just after his
demotion when he seemed quiet and a bit removed in the Giants
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel better,'' he said. ``Mentally, the time away
has let me step back and see some things differently. And
physically, my body and arm feel rested and much stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell appears to be throwing the football with more authority
in practice this week and his passes have more zip.
</P>
<P>
   But the starting job belongs to Graham, even if the handwriting
on the wall would indicate a change will be made unless the Giants
upset the Broncos, who are heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to change my thinking; I'm not playing like I
have to be looking over my shoulder,'' Graham said. ``Producing is
always a part of the job and I'm going to be positive and figure
that if I do well, things will work out well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go wrong, I know Jim Fassel pretty well and I trust
that whatever Jim did he would be doing because he thought it was
best. If he pulled me, I probably deserved to be pulled. In the
meantime, I'm going to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is unusually true about this quarterback situation.
There is little, if any, controversy over who should or should not
be playing in the locker room. Neither has won enough this year to
have divided loyalties on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the 5-8 Giants have bigger problems than their starter
at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, there are a number of players playing for their
roster spots or their starting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, they are preparing for the high-powered Bronco
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence in any of our quarterbacks,'' wide receiver
Chris Calloway said. ``We're all too busy trying to do our own job
to worry about theirs.''

EDITORIAL: THE NEW HOFFA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 11:
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa's election this week as president of the
Teamsters union is a disheartening development. Hoffa, son of Jimmy
Hoffa, must be judged on the basis of his own record and alliances,
not his father's criminal convictions and alleged mob ties. But
there is no disguising that the Hoffa victory signals a comeback
for old-line Teamster leadership that presided over the looting and
disgrace of one of America's biggest unions from the 1950s through
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, Hoffa's suggestion that it is now time to
end nine years of federal supervision of the Teamsters deserves no
serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that federal monitoring, the Teamsters are a more
democratic and honest union than they were in the time of the
senior Hoffa. The younger Hoffa insists that he is committed to
continued reform. But his leading supporters include Larry Brennan,
a Michigan Teamster who helped oversee a welfare fund from which
federal monitors say $725,000 was misappropriated, and Tom
O'Donnell, a New York Teamster accused by independent reviewers of
hiding payments to a convicted felon who worked as a Hoffa campaign
aide.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa's path to the presidency was made easier by a
political corruption scandal that brought down his predecessor, Ron
Carey, who first won election in 1991 as a reformer but later was
found to have benefited from some $700,000 in union dues illegally
funneled into his 1996 re-election campaign against Hoffa. Carey
was expelled from the union and the tainted election was rerun,
with Hoffa emerging as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years back, it seemed realistic to imagine a
revitalized labor movement again becoming an effective advocate for
working people and social causes. That prospect has now receded,
and not just because of the ethical stumbles of the Teamster reform
movement.
</P>
<P>
   From the alleged involvement of the AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer,
Rich Trumka, in the 1996 Carey campaign financing scandal to the
revelations of graft and voting fraud in New York City's biggest
municipal workers union, the behavior of prominent labor leaders
has betrayed union members and discouraged potential allies in the
wider public.

PIN PLACED IN BLEDSOE'S INJURED FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe reportedly has
undergone surgery on his broken right index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Bledsoe underwent minor surgery earlier this week at
Massachusetts General Hospital and had a pin inserted to give the
finger stability. He is expected to start Sunday in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe injured the finger on the climactic drive in a thrilling
last-minute victory over the Miami Dolphins Nov. 23. While
following through after throwing a pass, he hit his hand on a
Dolphin pass rusher, fracturing the finger in two places.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, he led the Patriots to a second
come-from-behind win over Buffalo when he hit Ben Coates with a
1-yard touchdown pass with no time remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he quarterbacked the Patriots to another vital
victory, beating the Steelers, 23-9, in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But during the third quarter, he experienced numbness in the
finger. He said after the game that some of his passes were off the
mark because he'd lost his feel for the ball. Coach Pete Carroll
was ready to send in backup Scott Zolak, but Bledsoe left the
field, had the finger placed in a longer splint and retaped, and
returned to action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wear and tear, doctors reportedly felt the best
thing to do was to insert the pin, which will stay in place for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have said Bledsoe could not do further damage to the
finger by playing.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has one fracture running under the fingernail which is
more like a bruise. The second is in the middle of the finger, not
near any joints. One doctor says the fractures are more like bone
chips. The pin reportedly will help keep the chips in place,
reducing the chances of injury that would prevent Bledsoe from
playing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As he presides over the Judiciary Committee's
Democrats, speaking in a deliberative cadence, Rep. John Conyers
Jr., the ranking minority member, projects a quiet tone and almost
uninterested demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Democrat, the only Watergate veteran on the
committee, has shouldered the task of leading the committee's
Democrats, a normally fractious group credited with never letting a
view go unexpressed. And Conyers' loose hand has meant that he
seldom reels in committee members when their monologues take them
in peculiar directions.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains an important back-room dealer for the Democrats
on the Judiciary Committee. It was Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
who took control of the Democratic response last summer and who has
remained in charge of keeping his caucus together.
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings, however, Conyers takes the lead in
suggesting strategies for minority members on the committee and his
views often carry the day, colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers' early strategy was to shift the focus from Clinton to
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, when ever possible. Even
before the Judiciary Committee's inquiry began, Conyers took up the
well-known list of charges that the prosecutor's inquiry was
tainted by leaks and ties to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement to the committee Thursday evening, Conyers
offered a plea to moderate Republicans to vote against impeachment
and again criticized Starr for delving into sexual details, calling
him the ``occasionally obsessive counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Conyers has argued that Starr abused his powers and launched
investigations into matters best left alone. He has gone so far as
to argue that Starr's decision to probe Clinton's extramarital
affair was worse than Clinton's decision to initiate it.
</P>
<P>
   The day Starr appeared before the Judiciary Committee, Conyers
was attacking Starr before the prosecutor had a chance to open his
mouth. Conyers condemned the referral as ``tawdry, salacious and
unnecessarily graphic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all that we had in the beginning, it was only Starr,''
Conyers said Thursday. ``And his excesses were pretty apparent to
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Detroit lawyer, whose district includes
impoverished parts of the city and well-to-do Grosse Pointe, made
it plain that he is not finished with Starr. He plans to turn the
committee's attention again to the independent counsel in next
year's discussion on renewing the statute that created the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The methods Starr employed will be studied with great detail
long after the impeachment process itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with some of the most partisan Republicans in Congress on
the Judiciary Committee, Conyers' task has never been seen as easy
or perhaps even possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I failed?'' Conyers said, his voice tinged ever so
slightly with sarcasm directed toward his Republican colleagues.
``Yeah, I failed to persuade any of the 21 Republicans to consider
more reasonably the fact that even if the whole narrative of Ken
Starr's was assumed to be accurate, there would be nothing that
would reach an impeachable offense.''

Flemmi murdered his girlfriend, the Boston Police are planning to

<P>
   Twenty-six-year-old Debra Davis, who lived with Flemmi in

that thought she may have known a little bit too much about his
relationship with the feds,'' said Davis' brother Victor. He said
the family immediately suspected Flemmi had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The year after his sister vanished, Victor Davis said, the FBI
interviewed his mother, Olga, on several occasions, but the case
went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the investigation, the FBI
never confronted Flemmi _ an FBI informant since 1965 _ about his
girlfriend's mysterious disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sick that a known criminal is going with a girl
and she disappears and it's never thoroughly investigated,'' Victor
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the Boston Police recently received information that
Debra Davis may have been murdered inside the now-defunct Marconi
Club, a private club in Boston's Roxbury section once operated by
Flemmi, and buried in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Peter Norton confirmed Thursday that
investigators will search the ground beneath the building for
Davis' remains, but ``there has been no determination as to when
that investigation will take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the investigation could begin as early as Friday or
some time next week.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are expected to use ground-penetrating radar to
look for signs of a body beneath the soil, then drill holes in the
concrete floor, according to sources. Cadaver-sniffing dogs would
be brought in to determine if a human scent is emanating from the
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Police Patrolman's Association, which purchased the 2
1/2-story building on Shetland Street three years ago, has agreed
to allow the search.
</P>
<P>
   The Marconi Club was operating in the basement of the building
at the time Debra Davis disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kenneth Fishman, who represents Flemmi, said his client
``vigorously denies'' that he had anything to do with Debra Davis'
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that there is going to be no evidence
discovered that will in any way implicate Mr. Flemmi in the
disappearance of Ms. Davis,'' Fishman said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's office
wouldn't comment on the Davis case, but said ``hypothetically''
investigators could expect to find bones or a mummified body if a
person was buried under a basement floor 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Albert Harper, director of the Lee Institute of Forensic
Sciences at the University of New Haven, said finding a body
beneath the ground ``is an extremely difficult proposition. There's
really no absolute way of locating it without actually doing the
digging.''
</P>
<P>
   If a body was buried beneath the Roxbury basement 17 years ago,
Harper said, the skull, jaw and teeth should all be intact. DNA
analysis from teeth could determine the identity of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Victor Davis was skeptical about the possibility that
his sister's remains will be found in Flemmi's old club because
``it's too obvious and I don't think he's that stupid.'' He also
worries that it will be a victory for Flemmi if police come up with
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis said it will be a relief if investigators find his
sister's remains because they'll finally know what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Davis had fallen in love with a Mexican businessman she
met while vacationing in Aculpulco and was planning to end her
nine-year relationship with Flemmi, according to her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, 64, has been in jail for four years while awaiting trial
on federal racketeering charges along with reputed New England Mob
Boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme and Robert DeLuca Flemmi's
longtime partner and fellow FBI informant, South Boston crime boss
James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger remains a fugitive in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a protracted pre-trial hearing over the past year
exploring the controversial relationship between Flemmi and Bulger
and the FBI, including numerous crimes the pair allegedly
committed, Debra Davis' name never surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Davis said FBI agents tape recorded at least one meeting
with his mother and took notes. Yet none of that information
surfaced in Flemmi's informant files, which were made public during
the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau spokesman Peter Ginieres declined to comment on the Debra
Davis case.
</P>
<P>
   But sources confirmed that FBI Special Agents James Crawford,
who is now retired, and Matthew Cronin &UR;  &LR; interviewed Olga Davis and
vigorously tried to solve the case _ without letting Flemmi know
that they had spoken to Debra Davis' mother.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Davis, one of 10 children, concedes that his mother was
afraid to confront Flemmi. She feared he might harm her other
children because he was already showing an interest in her younger
daughter, Victor Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Still Victor Davis said he thinks the FBI protected Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame the FBI as much as I blame him because they gave him a
ticket to rob, to steal and kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's missing and they're working with him.''

DESPISED BUILDING BECOMES AN ACQUIRED TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a great chunk of white chocolate on Columbus
Circle, the Gallery of Modern Art was too rich for sophisticated
tastes when it opened in 1964. But as the Giuliani administration
ponders its fate, more than a few New Yorkers are admitting that it
has become a guilty pleasure they would hate to give up.
</P>
<P>
   After all, lounge music and leopard-skin prints are back, so it
figures that there is renewed appreciation of a trapezium-shaped
marble structure poised on curvy Y-shaped columns, bordered by
filigree-like portholes and topped by an arcaded restaurant in
which Polynesian luau lunches were once served.
</P>
<P>
   The city-owned building at 2 Columbus Circle has been empty
since April, when its last tenant, the Department of Cultural
Affairs, moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders for the site include Donald Trump, who would construct a
12-story hotel there, and the Dahesh Museum, which would restore
the existing building. The Alexander and Louisa Calder Foundation
would reuse the galleries and reclad the facade. But City Hall may
simply decide to replace the nine-story structure with a little
park or open space.
</P>
<P>
   The question of 2 Columbus Circle has yet to be presented for
formal consideration by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, no great admirer of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said that a decision may come soon as
part of the overall reinvigoration of Columbus Circle, including
the development of the New York Coliseum site and the rerouting of
traffic in true rotary fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of the building believe that it could be an ornament to
the circle.
</P>
<P>
   They think its cascading galleries are surprisingly
sophisticated. They respect the way its concave facade observes the
geometry of Columbus Circle. They enjoy it as a memento of an
exuberant era and an eccentric builder, Huntington Hartford, heir
to the A&AMP;P supermarket fortune. Some even think the building is _
gasp _ a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been no predicting this in 1964 when the
gallery was most memorably dismissed as a ``die-cut Venetian
palazzo on lollipops'' by Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture
critic at The New York Times. Today, she allows that she gets ``a
little lift, a sense of pleasure'' walking by the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never elevate it to a work of art, but I think it has
many things in its favor,'' said Ms. Huxtable, now the architecture
critic at The Wall Street Journal. ``It's the only identifiable
object on Columbus Circle.'' She added, ``I think it should be
reused.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Robert Stern, dean of the Yale School of Architecture,
who favors landmark designation of the building. Stern said the
design, by the architect Edward Durell Stone, is ``important,
thoughtful and carefully articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   An architect who knows Columbus Circle well, David Childs of
Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill, said Stone's building ``represents a
moment in this century extremely well.'' The Skidmore firm has
designed two projects for the Coliseum site, including a complex
for both Time Warner headquarters and the Jazz at Lincoln Center
concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone could figure out a use for it, it would really be a
good thing to save,'' Childs said of 2 Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Trump is unpersuaded.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he owns the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue
_ another marble-clad, Stone-designed 1960s structure overlooking
Central Park _ Trump is contemptuous of 2 Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be the worst building in the city of New
York,'' he said. ``It was universally disliked until people learned
that it's about ready to come down. Then you have do-gooders coming
to the rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Calder Foundation is not much more enamored of the exterior.
``We don't like Ed Stone's portholes,'' said Alexander Rower,
director of the foundation and grandson of the artist Alexander
Calder. The foundation owns the largest collection of Calder's
works.
</P>
<P>
   It envisions an architectural competition for a new facade, but
would happily reuse the museum space, which cascades from the fifth
to the second floors.
</P>
<P>
   The Dahesh Museum, which specializes in European academic
painting of the 19th and early 20th centuries, appreciates the
whole structure. ``It was built as a museum,'' said the director,
David Farmer. ``It is the right size for us. And we'd love nothing
more than to preserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, an
architectural adviser to the Dahesh Museum, said, ``The Dahesh
Museum would in effect serve as the entry to a cultural corridor''
connecting Lincoln Center to the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Dahesh proposal has been welcomed by the art historian
Robert Rosenblum; the sculptor Richard Lippold; Hugh Hildesley,
executive vice president of Sotheby's; state Sen.-elect Thomas
Duane of Manhattan, and the Committee for Environmentally Sound
Development, a neighborhood group.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been endorsed by Juliet Hartford, an artist and
Wilhelmina model who is Hartford's youngest daughter. ``Everybody
in the art and fashion world loves that building,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hartford has enlisted support from Brooke Astor, Prince
Rainier of Monaco and Erivan Haub of Germany, the majority
shareholder of Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from the list is Hartford himself, now 87
years old and living in Brooklyn. His daughter said he was not well
enough to discuss the matter but would certainly be ``shocked'' if
the building were demolished.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is little else to mark Hartford's celebrated squandering
of the $100 million fortune he inherited. His ill-starred projects
in the 1950s and '60s included a cafe for Central Park, an artists'
colony, a resort in the Bahamas, an automated parking garage, a
handwriting institute and Show Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He despised what he called ``thoroughly degenerate'' abstract
art. Unlike most art critics, however, Hartford could put $7.5
million where his mouth was.
</P>
<P>
   ``My museum represents the taste of the country more than any of
them,'' he said at the time. The centerpiece was a painting
commissioned from Salvador Dali, ``The Discovery of America by
Christopher Columbus.'' (It now hangs in the Salvador Dali Museum
in St. Petersburg, Fla.)
</P>
<P>
   Stone, a co-designer of the Museum of Modern Art in 1939,
favored his patron with white Vermont marble walls, book-matched
walnut paneling, parquet and terrazzo floors, bronze fixtures,
crimson carpeting and 12-inch-wide hinged portholes arranged along
each corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building may be considered romantic _ a radical
departure, with its arches and use of rich materials,'' Stone wrote
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Critics found words other than ``romantic'' to describe the
building, as Tom Wolfe recounted in his 1981 book ``From Bauhaus to
Our House''. ``Not even such terms as `kitsch for the rich' and
`marble lollipops' convey the poisonous mental atmosphere in which
Stone now found himself. He was reduced, at length, to saying such
things as, `Every taxi driver in New York will tell you it's his
favorite building.'''
</P>
<P>
   The financially troubled gallery was taken over in 1969 by
Fairleigh Dickinson University and operated for six more years as
the New York Cultural Center. Gulf and Western Industries bought
the structure and donated it to New York City as the headquarters
for the Department of Cultural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Geldzahler, who was cultural affairs commissioner, and his
companion, Christopher Scott, directed a renovation that preserved
the open spaces and sumptuous materials.
</P>
<P>
   On accepting the building in 1980, Mayor Edward Koch said it was
a ``nice home'' for the cultural agency. But he feels no lingering
sentiment. ``It was never a cuddly building,'' Koch said this
month. ``It's an ugly building and totally unusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Columbus Circle is not an official landmark, and even the
New York Landmarks Conservancy is not sure it should be. The board
is too divided on the merits of the building to take a position.
</P>
<P>
   But that intramural conflict is almost a recommendation itself,
said the conservancy president, Peg Breen. ``Thank God there are
still buildings that generate controversy and fuel the debate about
architecture in this town,'' she said.

METS STILL WAITING ON HENDERSON 
 (JT)
</HEADLINE>
  By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets were waiting to hear from Rickey Henderson's
representatives Thursday night about their offer of a one-year deal
with an option for a second. While he waited, General Manager Steve
Phillips completed a minor trade for a 21-year-old prospect. And
Manager Bobby Valentine did not wait at all when the subject of one
of his former players, Todd Hundley, was broached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no change from yesterday,'' Phillips said about
Henderson, referring to his offer of a one-year deal with a base
salary of about $1.7 million with incentive bonuses and a vested
option that kicks in if Henderson fulfills certain provisions.
Henderson's representatives had not heard from their client about
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Phillips dealt a player he had acquired last
Friday _ Joe Randa, from Detroit for Willie Blair _ to the Kansas
City Royals. In return, the Mets received outfielder Juan LeBron,
Kansas City's first-round pick (19th over all) in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4-inch LeBron, who projects as a right fielder, hit
.251 with 17 homers and 84 runs batted in and 18 stolen bases in
low Class A ball last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that we were able to replenish our system with
this type of athlete,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   With LeBron, the highly touted Alex Escobar and Jason Tyner,
last-season's first-round pick, the Mets now have three decent
outfield prospects moving through their system.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Thursday that LeBron would probably play high
Class A ball next season and that both Escobar and Tyner might
start at Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the three will be ready to play in the majors for
the next couple of years. Hence the interest in Henderson, who
turns 40 on Christmas but who stole a major league-leading 66 bases
last season and would bat leadoff for the Mets next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for a response,'' Phillips said. ``I'm waiting for
them to call me back. The offer's on the table. But I've assumed
from the beginning that the Seattle Mariners have been in all
along, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any player, you establish a value and make an offer. If
it doesn't work out, then you go on to the next step. And we have a
more than adequate alternative within our organization. I'm not
dissatisfied at all with Jermaine Allensworth, Roger Cedeno and Jay
Payton.''
</P>
<P>
   While trade discussions were going on Thursday, and while the
waiting game was being played by Mets officials, Valentine was at a
team Christmas charity event at Shea Stadium. The manager was asked
by the MSG Network about some comments Hundley had made about the
poor nature of their relationship. The comments had been broadcast
on the Fox show ``The Last Word'' the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was asked if he was sad that he and Hundley _ who had
also made disparaging statements about his former manager in a
recent Los Angeles Times article _ just couldn't hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confused about all this stuff about us not getting
along,'' Valentine said. ``I really cared about him. Everything I
did was to try to help him. If he misunderstood, that's a problem
on his side.'' &QL;

OWNERS TO START MEETINGS AS CLEMENS SAGA WINDS ON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays' efforts to trade Roger Clemens will be
the headline event at the baseball winter meetings, which begin
Thursday in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, unwilling to meet the Blue Jays' demand of
four players, do not appear to be a major factor in the bidding for
Clemens. In fact, Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager,
currently has no plans to attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians, baseball officials said, have forwarded a
significant offer for Clemens that involves at least one marquee
player _ perhaps outfielder David Justice. But Gord Ash, the
Toronto general manager, indicated Thursday that a second team has
made an aggressive push for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The market for the five-time Cy Young Award winner has probably
not been as vigorous as the Blue Jays expected. Many teams are
unwilling to trade three or four high-quality players for Clemens,
and then renegotiate his contract and pay the 36-year-old
right-hander like a free agent. Executives have called it a double
whammy.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that the Houston Astros would offer the pitchers
Shane Reynolds, Scott Elarton and the outfielders Derek Bell and
Richard Hidalgo. Instead, they offered a much more modest package:
Bell, reliever Jay Powell and a young pitcher. And Thursday, the
Astros signed Shane Reynolds to a three-year, $21.5 million deal
that an includes an option for the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto wants Ramiro Mendoza, Orlando Hernandez and the minor
leaguers Alfonso Soriano and Homer Bush from the Yankees. The
Yankees, conversely, might be willing to surrender Andy Pettitte,
Bush and Mike Lowell, a young third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with the Texas Rangers indicated Thursday that his
team's interest in a Clemens deal has waned, after the Rangers and
the Blue Jays could not settle on a package that might have
included the outfielders Tom Goodwin and Rusty Greer. The Colorado
Rockies and the Atlanta Braves are also believed to be involved,
while the Mets and the San Diego Padres are regarded as long shots.
</P>
<P>
   Gord Ash, Toronto's general manager, said Thursday that he has
never spoken with anyone from the Baltimore Orioles, and a highly
ranked Orioles official confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
   The high volume of free-agent signings in November will
naturally curtail the trade discussions at the winter meetings. But
some big names are being talked about: Atlanta has had offers for
the slugger Ryan Klesko from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays; the San
Diego Padres seem willing to trade Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home
runs last year, as well as the reliever Randy Myers, and the Padres
are also talking trade with the Yankees about Mike Lowell; Arizona
seems intent on trading the left-hander Brian Anderson. The Dodgers
are close to dealing shortstop Jose Vizcaino to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   There will likely be free-agent signings at the winter meetings,
as well. Kevin Brown, perhaps the last marquee player available, is
being wooed by the Los Angeles Dodgers, the St. Louis Cardinals,
the Rockies and the Orioles, his salary could approach $14 million
to $15 million a year.

N.Y. REAL ESTATE MOGUL CHARGED IN MURDER PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abe Hirschfeld, the New York real estate magnate
known for quixotic forays into politics and other high-profile
misadventures, was charged Thursday with hiring a hit man to kill a
longtime business partner with whom he had a bitter feud and
survivor-takes-control agreements covering many of their
properties.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old businessman, who made headlines by offering
Paula Jones $1 million this fall to settle her sexual harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton, was accused of giving an
intermediary $75,000 in cash to pay a hired gun to kill his
73-year-old associate, Stanley Stahl, in 1996, and of supplying
photos and other information about the target in a note in his own
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, who said he
also had witnesses and tape recordings to prove the case, said
Hirschfeld promised to make a second payment of more than $75,000
after Stahl was slain. But, he said, the scheme fell apart for
murky reasons, and Stahl got wind of it, went to the authorities
and began riding around in a bulletproof limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't feel too happy if somebody paid $150,000 to have me
knocked off,'' Morgenthau said at a news conference when asked
whether Stahl's life had ever been in danger. He noted, however,
that Stahl, a partner of Hirschfeld's for decades until their
relationship soured, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not guilty _ it's all lies,'' Hirschfeld declared at a
Criminal Court arraignment in which he was ordered released on $1
million cash bail _ to which he responded by pulling out his wallet
and offering the judge the $1 million bank check that had been made
out to Paula Jones but never accepted. The court did not accept it
either, and gave Hirschfeld until Monday to pay the bail.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, speaking to reporters and television cameras outside
the Criminal Courts Building, Hirschfeld amplified on his
innocence. He charged that a former secretary, Rosemary Singer, and
a former construction supervisor of his, Joe Veltri, had proposed
killing Stahl, and had threatened to accuse him of plotting a
murder-for-hire if he did not pay them $500,000. He said he
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hired nobody to kill him,'' Hirschfeld said. ``I don't
get one penny of benefit by killing him.'' He insisted that his
partnership agreements with Stahl, canceled last February, provided
that the heirs of each would be the beneficiaries in the event that
either died; prosecutors, however, say the surviving partner would
have retained control over most of the properties.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld acknowledged having given $75,000 to Veltri in the
fall of 1996, but he called it a bonus for 20 years of loyal work.
Ms. Singer, his secretary for 32 years, and Veltri were
subsequently dismissed for reasons that were unclear Thursday.
Efforts to reach both Thursday night were unavailing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events began with a bizarre scene shortly after
midnight when Morgenthau's detectives went to Hirschfeld's home at
825 Fifth Ave. to arrest him. Morgenthau said Hirschfeld, indicted
earlier this week, had been invited to surrender voluntarily, but
had refused and had even fired his lawyer, Charles Haydon, for
suggesting that he accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirschfeld insisted that he had an agreement with the
prosecutor to surrender at 7:30 a.m., and when the detectives
showed up at his apartment he first proposed that they all stay
until morning _ he in handcuffs, if necessary _ and get a good
night's sleep. He said he offered them coffee and desert.
</P>
<P>
   When they refused, he and other witnesses said, he dropped his
pants and suggested a lewd act, called 911 to report a robbery in
progress and, after the police arrived and the confusion was
cleared up, was taken away in handcuffs. ``Oh yes,'' he said, ``I
called 911 because they wanted to take me in naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Held overnight in a detectives' squad room, Hirschfeld called
various members of the news media to protest his innocence and to
complain about his treatment at the hands of Morgenthau, who had
obtained an indictment of the developer last year on state
income-tax evasion charges, a case that is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   After what he called a night on the floor, Hirschfeld called the
media again to complain that he had not been allowed to attend a
news briefing at which Morgenthau announced his indictment and
arrest. In the afternoon, Hirschfeld went to court in a crumpled
blue suit and a gray shirt open at the neck. His sparse hair was
tousled and a light stubble flecked his round face.
</P>
<P>
   Arraigned on charges of criminal solicitation in the second
degree, which is subject to seven years in prison, Hirschfeld,
still in handcuffs, pleaded not guilty before Acting State Supreme
Court Justice Laura Drager. Assistant District Attorney Gilda
Mariani asked for $2.5 million cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   But Hirschfeld's lawyer, Theodore Kupferman, noted that his
client was free on a $1 million bond in the 123-count tax evasion
case, and that a judge in that pending case allowed Hirschfeld to
travel to Israel. ``If he wanted to flee, that was his chance,''
Kupferman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, who was born in Poland and emigrated from Israel to
America in the 1950s, and Stahl, the son of a Brooklyn butcher, had
been partners in real estate since the 1960s, and both made
millions. Stahl, a quieter man, staked everything he had in 1962 to
build a 50-story office tower at 277 Park Ave., which became the
centerpiece of a business that includes office and apartment
buildings, some jointly held with Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld made a fortune in parking lots and other real estate,
and has run largely self-financed but losing races for lieutenant
governor of New York and for Congress and Manhattan borough
president. He had a brief, turbulent reign as publisher of The New
York Post in 1993.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Court records show that many of their partnerships were
ownership agreements for particular buildings, including 405 E.
54th St., 404 E. 55th St. and 360 E. 55th St. But their
relationship began to sour around 1991, when each became suspicious
that the other was cheating.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicions led to lawsuits in which Hirschfeld demanded that
Stahl sell out or buy out Hirschfeld's interests. Stahl refused and
counter-sued. Hirschfeld charged that Stahl discriminated against
blacks in renting apartments; Stahl said the charges were brought
by ``agent provocateurs'' hired by Hirschfeld.
</P>
<P>
   There were disputes about who should have check-signing
privileges, where money should be kept, how company books should be
kept and other matters. The disputes, Hirschfeld contended, made it
impossible for him to file his tax returns. The suits were full of
invective. Stahl called Hirschfeld ``incredible.'' Hirschfeld said
Stahl was ``like Alice in Wonderland,'' and charged ``generosity
has never been Stahl's strong suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side budged and the feud reached a nadir in 1996.
Morgenthau charged that Hirschfeld then paid $75,000 as a first
installment to have Stahl killed. The cash, he said, was given by
an intermediary to ``a person in the back seat of a chauffeured
limousine parked near Hirschfeld's office building at 15 Penn
Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Morgenthau said, Hirschfeld's intermediary delivered a
second envelope bearing ``photographs of Stahl taken by a private
investigator'' and ``a note written by Hirschfeld with Stahl's
name, address, a telephone number and his car's license plate
number.''
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators said the plot went awry, before the second
installment was paid, when the intermediary was ``roughed up'' _ it
was unclear by whom or why. The intermediary then disclosed the
scheme to Stahl, who informed the authorities, and the
investigation that led to Thursday's charges was begun.

PLAYERS WON'T GET PROCEEDS FROM GAME AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besieged by a maelstrom of negative publicity, the organizers of
an exhibition game that would help to benefit financially strapped
National Basketball Association players have decided to give all
proceeds of the game instead to charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Monday to split the proceeds between UNICEF
and cash-poor players was scrapped Thursday after the game's
organizers spoke with players, promoters and officials from the
National Basketball Players Association. The profits from the game
on Dec. 19 in Atlantic City, N.J., will now be donated to UNICEF,
Save the Children and a few Philadelphia-based charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my expectation from the beginning that the money was
going to charity,'' said Arn Tellem, the agent who is promoting the
game with David Falk. ``I think it's the right thing to do. I'm not
aware of any players who need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the organizers had reversed their stance, Tellem said:
``We hadn't talked to all the players at that time. One of the
goals in the beginning was to help the players if the season was
canceled. Once we canvassed all the players and the union, we knew
the right thing to do was give the entire proceeds to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem said he hoped to raise between $1 million and $2 million
from broadcast rights and the sale of tickets. Though Polk said on
Monday that a courtside seat at Convention Hall would sell for
$1,000, he said Thursday that he was mistaken. Prices will be $25,
$50, $100, $200, $300 and up to $500. More than half of the 12,500
seats will be sold for $50 or less, a spokesman from Falk's office
said. Blocks of free tickets will also be distributed to Atlantic
City and Philadelphia youths.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout is in its fifth month, and no bargaining sessions
have been scheduled. On Tuesday the league announced the
cancellation of the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an agent, Keith Glass, said that his players would
not accept charity from the game and that he felt insulted by the
thinking of his fellow agents. ``The idea that a player making
$275,000 can't manage his money and needs the fans to bail him out
is absurd and insulting,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Curtis Polk, the president of Falk Associates
Management Enterprises and the game's chief organizer, said: ``As a
result of the league's cancellation of the All-Star Game, the
players feel that this is an All-Star Game for the fans of
Philadelphia and around the world who are being deprived of the
midseason event.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that some players needed financial assistance was
dispelled Thursday by the players association. Dan Wasserman, the
communications director of the union, said that the union has a
strike fund of between $16 million and $20 million, which has yet
to be tapped.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the lockout began, the union sent questionnaires to its
400-plus members asking if they needed financial assistance in case
the dispute dragged on. Of the 130 that replied, fewer than 10
percent said they would need help, Wasserman said. The few who
needed help were referred to banks so they could get low-interest
loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 19 exhibition, billed ``The Game on Showtime,'' will
include players from the 1992 and 1996 Olympic teams and members of
the 1994 world championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Though Michael Jordan will not participate, the roster will
include Patrick Ewing, Karl Malone, Anfernee Hardaway, Tim
Hardaway, Allan Houston, Reggie Miller, Gary Payton, Dominique
Wilkins, Vin Baker, Glen Rice, Tom Gugliotta and Mitch Richmond.
Dan Majerle and Chris Webber have also agreed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the promoters can pull off the event with eight days
left is up for debate, however. Tickets will go on sale Friday
after two delays because of seating configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Atlantic City casinos have
shown an ambivalence about the game _ another sign of problems. As
of Thursday, Ticketmaster operators were still telling callers no
information was available about the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work, but I'm optimistic,'' Tellem said.
``This is not to replace the NBA,'' he added. ``The purpose of the
game was several reasons: one, to have some basketball games being
played and to show that the players want to play and they're being
locked out by the owners; two, to do something worthwhile for
charities; and finally, to achieve a political purpose, to show the
players they can put on their own games.''

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR AGREES TO TOUGHEN PATRIOTS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In an about-face he had struggled for weeks to
avoid, Gov. John Rowland acknowledged Thursday that some terms of
his stadium deal with the New England Patriots were too generous,
and he said he would seek changes before the state legislature
takes up the proposal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who negotiated the deal in secret and then defended it
even as sports economists called it the biggest giveaway in the
National Football League, suggested Thursday that he was an
innocent bystander. ``Some of us may feel that it's a little
sweeter than we would like it to be,'' he said. ``There will be
some negotiations, and I think we'll probably make some changes
between now and Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The revisions being demanded by lawmakers could substantially
change the contract, leading to a potential clash between state
leaders and the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, who until Thursday
had been working closely together. ``My responsibility is to the
legislators, and I want them to feel comfortable in this vote,''
Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Although legislators have become increasingly vocal in their
doubts about the plan, legislative leaders still express confidence
that the package will win approval.
</P>
<P>
   The governor announced his plans for renegotiations the day
after a hearing in which legislators peppered Kraft with demands
for concessions in the agreement, particularly a passage that
provides a state guarantee for as much as $17.5 million a year if
luxury suites and seats go unsold. Kraft held his ground in front
of the television cameras on Wednesday. But state officials said
they believed he might accept modest changes that would help them
save face with their critics.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators are prodding Rowland to go after the issue that
Kraft has indicated may be the least negotiable. ``There are
substantive concerns that legislators have, and if we make some
changes in the guarantee, I think it makes it more palatable,''
Rowland said. ``Clearly, the issue has come down to the guarantee.
For the majority of the legislators, they would probably like to
see the guarantee changed slightly.'' He said he had not broached
that subject with Kraft, but said he planned to in the next 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jonathan Kraft, a Patriots vice president and
Kraft's son, said, ``The guarantees are black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft would be free to walk away from the tentative
agreement if even the slightest change were made to it.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials declined to comment on Thursday's developments.
But Jonathan Kraft and another Patriots vice president were
scheduled to resume negotiating at the Connecticut Capitol on
Friday, and the two postponed a series of satellite interviews they
had scheduled with Hartford media outlets to explain the tentative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After the Legislature's leaders met with the governor for three
hours Thursday afternoon, they said they were pleased that he
planned to contact Kraft in an effort to renegotiate the
guarantees. But the Senate president, Kevin Sullivan, said: ``That
is a very tough nut to crack.'' Later, he added, ``At this point,
I'm not optimistic, but we're crossing our fingers. It's a tough
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College who
contends that Connecticut could have made a much more modest
proposal and still landed the Patriots, said the changes proposed
by Rowland would do little to make the deal more equitable.
``Taking about 10 or 15 million dollars out of the pot is silly,''
he said. ``You could take $100 million out of the pot and still
make it a good deal for Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalist, who attended Wednesday's hearing, said Kraft's
comments had contained no information to reassure lawmakers about
the original proposal. ``I think legislators are beginning to get
the sense that they don't have to give him the sky to get him to
come,'' Zimbalist said. ``Why would anyone walk away from the
richest deal in NFL history?''
</P>
<P>
   The last straw for many legislators was a report released on
Wednesday by the General Assembly's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal
Analysis showing that the stadium could cost taxpayers as much as
$323 million over 30 years. The governor's estimate, on the other
hand, had been that the stadium would make a profit of $3 million
over that period.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Legislature's leaders took a step that they
said would greatly improve the financial outlook for the project.
They agreed to use at least $100 million of the state's expected
$350 million budget surplus as a down payment for the stadium.
``This radically changes the debt,'' Rowland said. He released
figures Thursday indicating that under this new plan, the stadium
would show a profit of $396 million over that time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most powerful legislator who has declined to sign on to the
stadium deal is the House Majority Leader, Moira Lyons, a Democrat
of Stamford. She said the use of the surplus ``makes it much more
cost-effective for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The hasty changes were intended to appease lawmakers like Rep.
Robert Farr, a Republican from West Hartford, who was so alone in
the early days of sounding the alarm about the potential risks of
the stadium that he said he felt like ``the designated driver when
everyone is saying, `Let's party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore: Farr said he discovered dozens of kindred spirits
among his colleagues at Wednesday's hearing. ``When everyone got
together and compared notes, they found there's a lot of people
with concerns about the costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the negotiations that the state hopes to continue with
Kraft through the weekend, the legislative leaders said they
remained wedded to voting on Tuesday. The House speaker, Thomas
Ritter, even indicated it was one bit of leverage the state had in
the bargaining. When asked about the difficulty of persuading Kraft
to reduce the state payments for empty seats, Ritter said, ``That's
why we have deadlines.''

HUNDREDS MOURN YALE STUDENT SLAIN NEAR CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ A bitter wind carried sobs of grief, mournful
farewells and the funereal tones of Bach through Old Campus at Yale
on Thursday, as several hundred friends and relatives of Suzanne
Jovin, the senior who was slain last Friday not far from the
university, gathered at Battell Chapel for a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven police said they have no suspects in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale lecturer who was Ms. Jovin's adviser, James Van de Velde,
told The New Haven Register on Wednesday that he had been
questioned twice by the police, but he denied that he was involved
in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an innocent person,'' Van de Velde said in Thursday's
issue of The Register. ``I hope in a week from now there will be a
story on the real killer.'' Van de Velde did not return a message
left on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Yale's vice president and secretary, Linda Koch Lorimer,
Wednesday released a statement about an article Wednesday in The
Register saying a Yale teacher was a suspect in the slaying. The
Yale statement, which cautioned that police had not named any
suspects and had not disclosed who had been interviewed, said, ``If
a member of the Yale community were, in fact, responsible for this
horrible crime, it would be appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments in Ms. Jovin's killing come on the heels of
another case that has disturbed the Yale campus, the accusations
against Antonio Lasaga, a Yale geology professor who last month was
charged with possessing child pornography retrieved from the
Internet. According to published reports, Lasaga was re-arrested
Wednesday after federal agents testified that he had been spotted
near the home of a minor who was a victim in the case, a violation
of the conditions for his release. Officials did not say how the
child was related to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the focus at Yale was not so much on the facts of Ms.
Jovin's killing, which occurred in the East Rock neighborhood,
about two miles from her home off campus. Instead, thanks to a
speaker system set up on the Old Campus green, the air was filled
with poignant remembrances of Ms. Jovin, a 21-year-old political
science major from Gottingen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I gave Suzanne the gift of her life _ it was taken
away last week by the act of a wanton and senseless individual,''
said her father, Thomas Jovin, who faltered at times through his
speech.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 students, teachers, university officials, family
members, and friends attended the hour-and-a-half memorial service
at the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners blinked away tears when a friend read a tribute from
one of the people who knew Ms. Jovin from the Yale chapter of Best
Buddies, a program she ran that pairs mentally disabled people with
students. Ms. Jovin was making pizzas with the group an hour before
she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suzanne was a sweet person and a good friend who did a lot for
me _ she always helped me feel better when I was stressed,'' said a
letter from Ms. Jovin's Best Buddy, Lee Brown, that was read by
Rebecca Rosen, a Yale senior.
</P>
<P>
   In tributes printed in Wednesday's Yale Daily News, Ms. Jovin
was remembered as an energetic, optimistic woman dedicated to
helping others. One of those tributes came from Van de Velde.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Suzanne this past September,'' he wrote, ``I was
immediately taken by her deep enthusiasm for life, her infectious
positive outlook, her insightfulness, and her commitment to
learning. She inspired me with her enthusiasm and her interest in
making a difference in the world. She is someone I will always
remember.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ After nearly six decades as the undisputed leader of
the American luxury market, Cadillac is poised to lose its crown to
Lincoln this year.
</P>
<P>
   As of Nov. 30, Lincoln, the luxury division of the Ford Motor
Co., had sold 170,265 cars and trucks in 1998. That was nearly
7,000 ahead of Cadillac, which had sales of 163,482 _ mostly cars _
in the same period. The gap grew in November, rather than narrowed,
prompting Cadillac to virtually concede the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the outcome, but we're pretty much seeing the
very distinct possibility that Lincoln will overtake us in total
vehicle sales,'' Chris Preuss, a spokesman for Cadillac, said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln has not beat Cadillac since 1939, according to figures
compiled by Automotive News, a trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's sales were down slightly through November, largely
because of United Automobile Workers strikes that led to the
shutdown of GM's North American assembly operations for up to two
months last summer. But a bigger factor in the sales race was
Lincoln's gain of 21,500 sales over the year-earlier period.
Lincoln benefited from a redesigned Town Car and especially from
its Navigator sport utility; the division will sell more than
40,000 Navigators this year. Cadillac's equivalent vehicle, the
Escalade, only recently went on sale. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In cars, Lincoln is competing with just two models (Town Car and
Continental) compared with Cadillac's four (Catera, Eldorado,
DeVille and Seville). Production of the Lincoln Mark VIII ended in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury car makers that are enjoying double-digit sales
increases are doing so largely because of sport utilities. After
introducing its M-Class utility in late 1997, Mercedes-Benz is
having a record year. Indeed, through November, Mercedes trailed
Cadillac by only about 9,000 sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for Lexus were up 57 percent, to 139,411. Lexus, a
division of Toyota, is selling a revamped full-size utility, the LX
470, and a new car-based model, the RX 300, which is already the
division's best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac sales have been steadily declining from their lofty
levels of the late '70s and mid-'80s when it sold more than 300,000
cars a year. GM used to boast that Cadillac outsold all foreign
luxury brands combined, but that is by no means the case any
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jacobs, an auto stock analyst , who monitors the luxury
market, contends that Cadillac has lost its luxury leadership
forever, because its product line is being overhauled too slowly
and its vehicles are not as well focused as Lincoln's.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs also predicted that Mercedes, which sold 154,457 cars
and sport utilities through November, will come out on top next
year and in the future. Mercedes has a 1999 sales target of 200,000
vehicles.

COMMITTEE DEBATES HOW FAR TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee began a solemn debate
Thursday night on whether President Clinton's sex scandal warrants
an official censure that would further mar his legacy or a
``political death penalty'' _ a formal charge for his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The committee lurched toward a historic final vote tomorrow
after the chief investigative counsels for both parties alternately
cast Clinton, in closing arguments, as an ``unfaithful husband''
who was ensnared by overzealous prosecutors, and a fallen leader
who betrayed the nation and may no longer be fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee formally introduced articles of impeachment
against a president for the first time since the Watergate scandal,
one member of the panel's Republican majority after another sounded
a steady drumbeat for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The opening debate reflected tones that ranged from anguish to
anger. There was Representative Elton Gallegly, a California
Republican, who said he passed ``many sleepless nights'' before
deciding to support impeachment charges. And there was
Representative Mel Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, who decried the
investigation as unjust and recalled his own days as a lawyer when
he was the target of racist epithets in a courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The four articles of impeachment charge Clinton with two counts
of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice, and one of abuse
of power. Each count stems from the president's alleged coverup of
his sexual liaisons in the White House with a former intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, based upon evidence that the president lied, obstructed
and abused power in an effort to prevent the court from
administering equal justice under law, I cast my vote in favor of
impeaching William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Representative F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican and senior
committee member. ``I do so with no joy but without apologies, just
as those on this committee who voted to impeach President Nixon 24
years ago did.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats portrayed the GOP majority, which is all but
certain to approve at least one, if not all, of the impeachment
counts, as pushing the country toward a constitutional crisis over
a sadly common human endeavor: a desperate effort to conceal an
adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats on the bitterly divided committee joined
Republicans in denouncing Clinton's misdeeds and his
``hair-splitting'' legal defenses for them. But the Democrats were
united against impeaching the president for actions arising from a
private, consensual sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls show the public overwhelming opposes
Clinton's impeachment and favors a lesser sanction such as a
congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is the appropriate response, and I hope the Republican
leadership will not allow partisanship to keep the American people
from seeing the decision they want and have a right to have made,''
said Representative Barney Frank of Newton, a senior Democrat on
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Frank noted that he and House Speaker Newt Gingrich each have
been reprimanded by the House for ethical wrongdoing. Frank's
reprimand stemmed from his relationship in the 1980s with a male
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you that having been reprimanded by this House of
Representatives, where I'm so proud to serve, was no triviality,''
Frank said. ``It is something, when people write about me, they
still write about. It is not something that is a matter of pride. I
wish I could go back and undo it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final hours before the debate opened Thursday night, the
committee's chief investigative counsels supported the escalating
effort to sway a bloc of 20 to 30 undecided lawmakers when the full
House votes next week on impeachment charges by presenting starkly
divergent views of the evidence against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Each investigator _ David P. Schippers for the Republicans and
Abbe D. Lowell for the Democrats _ dramatized his summation by
airing, for the first time publicly, portions of Clinton's
videotaped deposition in the sexual harassment lawsuit that Paula
Corbin Jones filed against him and settled last month for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their presentations, the White House special
counsel, Gregory B. Craig, renewed his appeal to the undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make just one plea to the members of the House of
Representatives on behalf of the president,'' Craig said outside
the White House. ``Before you vote to impeach and remove the
president, read the defense of the president, read the majority
counsel's brief and the minority counsel's brief, and then be
guided by your conscience and your judgment in the national
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two Massachusetts Democrats who serve with Frank on
the 37-member committee, Representatives William D. Delahunt of
Quincy and Martin T. Meehan of Lowell, blasted Clinton for the
sexual scandal but pressed for his censure rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, an architect of a Democratic censure plan the
committee will vote on after the impeachment charges, blasted what
he characterized as a one-sided, unfair inquiry into the Lewinsky
matter by the panel and the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking George Orwell, Franz Kafka and Cold War show trials in
the Soviet Union, Delahunt said, ``This has been the most partisan
impeachment inquiry since the infamous trial of President Andrew
Johnson five generations ago. It is like a runaway train.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt also cited Democratic gains in the House in the
November elections as evidence of public opposition to Clinton's
impeachment. ``The voters did not condone the president's
behavior,'' he said. ``But they knew the difference between
misdeeds that merit reproach and abuses of office that require a
constitutional coup d'etat ... a political death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The articles of impeachment charge that Clinton committed
perjury by lying under oath in both his Jones deposition and his
testimony before a federal grand jury investigating the Lewinsky
matter. The other counts stem from the alleged coverup, including
his conversations with White House aides and his friend, Vernon E.
Jordan Jr., about his relationship with Lewinsky, a job search on
her behalf, and gifts the two exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was particularly tough on Clinton. ``We have learned that
he is more reckless in his private life than we ever imagined,
maddeningly reckless for someone with so much potential and so much
to lose,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disparage Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky,'' he added. ``I disparage what he did in his testimony,
legal or not. I disparage what he said to the American people about
this matter. I disparage what he has put this country through over
the past 12 months.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan said he could not conclude that Clinton ``lacks the
capacity to govern,'' and he accused the committee of pursuing ``a
lawless path to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Schippers, a sharp-tongued Chicago prosecutor, laid out
a long, scathing narrative of allegations that Clinton engaged in
an elaborate conceit to conceal the intimate details of his
relationship with Lewinsky: 11 sexual encounters, 17 episodes of
phone sex, and 64 gifts they exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president elected to follow a pattern of selective memory,
blatant untruths, artful distortions, outright lies and half-truths
_ the blackest lie of all,'' Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Clinton of lying to so many people that ``there is no
one left to lie to.''
</P>
<P>
   Over nearly three hours, Schippers mixed venomous rhetoric with
searing sarcasm in attacking Clinton's actions. Referring to the
alleged phone sex, Schippers said, ``If what happened on these
phone calls is banter, then Buckingham Palace is a house.''
</P>
<P>
   But he enraged committee Democrats when he claimed, without
elaborating, that the Justice Department and Starr had prevented
his staff from investigating ``more incidents involving probable
direct and deliberate obstruction of justice, witness tampering,
perjury, and abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   By issuing the claim without substantiating it or allowing
Clinton's lawyers an opportunity to respond, Schippers engaged in
an ``irresponsible'' act of ``McCarthyism,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Craig said: ``We are disappointed and
saddened that the committee majority brought this solemn
constitutional process down to a level of innuendo, anger and
unfair, unsubstantiated charges.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Schippers presentation, the Judiciary Committee
released previously sealed transcripts of conversations between
Linda Tripp and her friend, Lucianne Goldberg, about how to
publicize Clinton's then-secret affair with Lewinsky. It was Tripp
whose secret recordings of Lewinsky later launched Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick,'' Goldberg told Tripp, was to disclose just enough
information to a news reporter ``to titillate the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lowell presented a methodical defense of Clinton and
appealed to the committee to not ``put the country through the
unseemly spectacle of a trial requiring Ms. Lewinsky to describe
what part of him touched what part of her.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves articles of impeachment, the constitution
requires the Senate to hold a trial, presided over by the chief
justice of the Supreme Court. Removing Clinton from office would
require 67 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell urged the Judiciary Committee to ``listen to the American
people, who are asking you to find a truly bipartisan way to avoid
the course you are about to undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the committee's debate was expected to span
more than six hours as each of the panel's 37 members delivered
10-minute opening statements.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the committee will begin amending the articles, one
by one, and could approve at least one article of perjury before
the end of the day. Although all the Republicans generally support
all four articles, several GOP members said they will not vote for
them unless changes are made in some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Representative George W. Gekas of Pennsylvania, for example, has
said he will not support the abuse of power charge unless the
committee drops an element related to Clinton invoking executive
privilege to try to prevent his lawyers for discussing their
confidential conversations with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to complete voting on the articles of
impeachment tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The lame-duck speaker, Newt Gingrich, notified all 435 House
members Thursday to prepare for the Judiciary Committee to issue a
final report on the impeachment investigation next week. The report
is expected to be circulated next Wednesday, and the House is
tentatively scheduled to debate and vote on the matter Thursday.

COMMITTEE DEBATES HOW FAR TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee began a solemn debate
Thursday night on whether President Clinton's sex scandal warrants
an official censure that would further mar his legacy or a
``political death penalty'' _ a formal charge for his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The committee lurched toward a historic final vote tomorrow
after the chief investigative counsels for both parties alternately
cast Clinton, in closing arguments, as an ``unfaithful husband''
who was ensnared by overzealous prosecutors, and a fallen leader
who betrayed the nation and may no longer be fit to govern.
</P>
<P>
   After the committee formally introduced articles of impeachment
against a president for the first time since the Watergate scandal,
one member of the panel's Republican majority after another sounded
a steady drumbeat for Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The opening debate reflected tones that ranged from anguish to
anger. There was Representative Elton Gallegly, a California
Republican, who said he passed ``many sleepless nights'' before
deciding to support impeachment charges. And there was
Representative Mel Watt, a North Carolina Democrat, who decried the
investigation as unjust and recalled his own days as a lawyer when
he was the target of racist epithets in a courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The four articles of impeachment charge Clinton with two counts
of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice, and one of abuse
of power. Each count stems from the president's alleged coverup of
his sexual liaisons in the White House with a former intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, based upon evidence that the president lied, obstructed
and abused power in an effort to prevent the court from
administering equal justice under law, I cast my vote in favor of
impeaching William Jefferson Clinton,'' said Representative F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., a Wisconsin Republican and senior
committee member. ``I do so with no joy but without apologies, just
as those on this committee who voted to impeach President Nixon 24
years ago did.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats portrayed the GOP majority, which is all but
certain to approve at least one, if not all, of the impeachment
counts, as pushing the country toward a constitutional crisis over
a sadly common human endeavor: a desperate effort to conceal an
adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats on the bitterly divided committee joined
Republicans in denouncing Clinton's misdeeds and his
``hair-splitting'' legal defenses for them. But the Democrats were
united against impeaching the president for actions arising from a
private, consensual sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls show the public overwhelming opposes
Clinton's impeachment and favors a lesser sanction such as a
congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is the appropriate response, and I hope the Republican
leadership will not allow partisanship to keep the American people
from seeing the decision they want and have a right to have made,''
said Representative Barney Frank of Newton, a senior Democrat on
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Frank noted that he and House Speaker Newt Gingrich each have
been reprimanded by the House for ethical wrongdoing. Frank's
reprimand stemmed from his relationship in the 1980s with a male
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell you that having been reprimanded by this House of
Representatives, where I'm so proud to serve, was no triviality,''
Frank said. ``It is something, when people write about me, they
still write about. It is not something that is a matter of pride. I
wish I could go back and undo it.''

SUPREME COURT STAYS EXECUTION OF CANADIAN IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder, the Canadian whose pending execution
brought international protests, won a reprieve from the U.S.
Supreme Court on Thursday night, 30 minutes before he was to be
taken to the Texas death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The stay, handed down about 5:30 p.m., ended marathon
maneuverings that had been in high gear since Wednesday morning,
when the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected Faulder's bid
for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's lawyers gained a stay of execution Wednesday afternoon
when U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin ruled that Texas
could not show that its clemency procedures safeguard the rights of
condemned inmates. But that order was reversed about midday
Thursday by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The final word came from the Supreme Court, which said it needs
more time to consider all of the issues. The high court's action
means that the execution will be delayed at least 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far out,'' Faulder said through a prison system spokesman in
Huntsville. ``That suits me.''
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents from Canada, which outlawed capital
punishment in 1976, have spent much of the past week in Austin and
Huntsville petitioning Texas leaders to reduce Faulder's
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and Raymond Chretien,
the country's ambassador to the United States, were joined by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an official request for
leniency in Faulder's case.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, 61, was condemned for the stabbing and bludgeoning
death of oil matriarch Inez Phillips during a robbery of her
Gladewater home in July 1975. Faulder was arrested two years later
when he was taken into custody on unrelated charges in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never denied his guilt, Faulder has long argued that
he was denied his right under international law to speak with a
representative of his country at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In their petition to the Supreme Court, Faulder's lawyers cited
terms of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. They argued
that Canadian authorities should have been told of the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also said Texas authorities should have informed
Faulder of his right to contact the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials said that they knew Faulder had served prison
time in Canada, but that he did not tell them he was a Canadian
citizen. And it was 15 years later when the Canadian government and
Faulder's family, who believed he was dead, realized that he was on
Texas' Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder, who would have become the oldest inmate to be executed
in Texas, drew little sympathy from state officials despite the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles,
called his petition for clemency ``weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't just come in our state and cold-blood murder
somebody,'' said Bush, a strong supporter of capital punishment.
``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their nationality,''
Bush told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty critics hammered Texas' procedures, chiefly
because the 18 members of the pardons and paroles board are not
required to meet as a body or state a reason for their decisions.
One member abstained and the others voted to reject clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, in his ruling to stay the execution, also was critical
of the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the court knows for certain is that (Faulder) filed a
petition for clemency, and the board voted against clemency,''
Sparks wrote. ``The record is void of any reason for the board's
action. The board had an opportunity to identify its process, but
merely trumpeted its ability to rule on clemency without meeting or
giving reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Maurie Levin, who is assisting in Faulder's
appeals, said, ``I'm just really glad that the questions about the
clemency procedures in this state are finally being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez defended the procedures and pointed out that the board
is exempt from state open meeting statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what these (death penalty) opponents would like to do
is to get us in an open meeting and start challenging the evidence
and hold a whole new trial,'' Rodriguez said. ``They want to say,
`OK, we lost in the first criminal procedure, let's get another
shot at this.' We don't agree with that.''

 (ATTN: Mo.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The unasked question at a party for DR. GERALD IMBER,
a plastic surgeon and author, was ``Who has and who hasn't?''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the East Side brownstone of the advertising
executive JERRY DELLA FEMINA on Wednesday included BILL BEUTEL, an
anchor on WABC-TV; the actor BEN GAZZARA; the restaurateur KENNETH
ARETSKY; LINDA FAIRSTEIN, chief of the sex-crimes prosecution unit
in the Manhattan district attorney's office; and FERN MALLIS,
executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there were plenty of practically perfect noses
and unfurrowed brows at the party. But were they Imber's handiwork?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very secretive _ you'll never know,'' said Della Femina,
speculating that 20 percent to 25 percent of the guests had had a
nip here or a tuck there.
</P>
<P>
   Imber gave up no secrets. But he did say that his latest book,
``For Men Only: Looking Your Best Through Science, Surgery and
Common Sense'' (William Morrow), proved that vanity is not just the
province of women.
</P>
<P>
   CANDACE BUSHNELL, who wrote the ``Sex and the City'' column for
The New York Observer, lingered with CLIFFORD STREIT, the
curly-haired manager of many one-time models now scribbling away as
writers. Streit said he had never been under the knife, adding,
``Based upon some of the results I've seen in this room, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment or two later, he changed his story and confessed to
having had some work done under his eyes. By Imber? He did not say.
</P>
<P>
   Like Imber, Ms. Bushnell said more men should consider having
plastic surgery. ``At one time it didn't matter how men looked _ it
only mattered how women looked,'' she said, pausing for a sip of
wine. ``How shallow do we sound?''
</P>
<P>
   Shipyard Soiree for Opera Debut
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK It was as if ``On the Waterfront'' had been transformed
for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Academy of Music took over a cavernous building at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard for its Next Wave gala on Wednesday. Instead
of shipyard workers in dirty overalls, the guests tended toward
basic black. And instead of the Andrews Sisters, the musical focus
was the experimental opera of PHILIP GLASS.
</P>
<P>
   The gala has in the past been held in places like a performance
space near the Manhattan Bridge, but the Navy Yard was a logical
choice this year, what with plans afoot to convert part of it into
a film-production complex. Among those who attended the night's
events, which marked the opening of Glass' new opera, ``Monsters of
Grace,'' were PAUL SIMON, NATALIE MERCHANT, CHUCK CLOSE and BIANCA
JAGGER.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the diners were dozens of television monitors

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Monkey Bar, a restaurant on East 54th Street in
Manhattan, accused the Monkey Bar, a St. Louis nightclub, of
monkeying around with its trademark and copying its olive-shaped
bar stools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say by no stretch of the imagination has the Monkey Bar
established a national reputation,'' said DEMPSTER HOLLAND, a
lawyer for the St. Louis owners. ``We don't compete with New York,
and they don't compete with us.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, a federal judge in St. Louis sided with PETER
GLASIER, the owner of the New York Monkey Bar, and barred the St.
Louis club from using the name. Holland said his clients were
searching for a new name.

GRAPEVINE'S ON BRINK OF SECOND STATE TITLE IN THREE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HERRIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Even one of Grapevine's most outspoken
players didn't expect to be playing for a state championship
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavens, no,'' Mustangs senior wide receiver Jason Schindler
said. ``Here we were just scratching for the playoffs. And now,
we've got to this point, it's like, well, we might as well win it
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not believing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Grapevine (10-4) can win its second state title in three seasons
with a victory against Bay City (12-1) at 1 p.m. tomorrow in the
Class 4A Division I state championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs have the fewest victories of any team to reach the
state class finals since Trinity qualified with nine victories in
1992. But they also have the opportunity to join La Marque and
Sealy as the only schools this decade to win at least two state
titles in a three-year span.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by second-half comebacks, the Mustangs have made the
unexpected possible. They have overcome a 1-2 start, won two
must-win games to end the regular season and rallied for playoff
victories the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can explain it,'' Grapevine senior linebacker
Jared Brown said. ``All of the teachers at school are saying we're
giving them heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the players or coaches. They have become accustomed to
this.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs have trailed at intermission in half their games
]this season. Grapevine is 4-3 in those games, including two
victories to end the regular season and victories against
Greenville and Plainview in the playoffs the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Against 10th-ranked Greenville in the Region II final, the
Mustangs rallied from a 21-10 halftime deficit and won, 34-31, in
three overtimes. In the state semifinals against Plainview on
Saturday _ the Mustangs' third playoff opponent with at least 10
victories _ it was more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs trailed 13-0 in the first half and 13-9 at
halftime. Grapevine took a 23-19 lead on Schindler's 42-yard
touchdown reception from Jordan Wilson with 4:25 remaining. The
defense then had to stuff Plainview with 1:08 left at Grapevine's
26-yard line to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Saturday, we're trailing at halftime and we're going up
the ramp, and I heard the kids saying we've got them right where we
want them,'' Grapevine coach Mike Sneed said. ``That's pretty
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Undersized defensive backs Stewart Records and Brad Balla are
two of the biggest reasons the season is still going. Records
(5-foot-7, 155 pounds) blocked a field-goal attempt in the second
half, then had an interception in the third overtime against
Greenville. Balla (5-8, 155) was the regular-season savior, with
three interceptions in season-ending comeback victories against
rivals Colleyville Heritage and Keller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams let up on us after kicking us around in the first
half,'' Records said. ``Teams have heard a lot about us getting
down early, but we just come back in the second half and tear them
apart. At halftime, we take care of business. No one's yelling. We
just figure out, `What does it take to win?' ''
</P>
<P>
   More times than not, they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's because we're in better shape or want it
more, but something happens,'' Grapevine junior defensive tackle
Andrew Marr said. ``The whole team just ignites, catches on fire.
No one can stop us, and everyone knows it's coming.'' /

ALEDO COACH STAYS THE COURSE AND PUMPS BEARCATS INTO POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEDO, Texas _ Steve Reid had other things on his mind besides
coaching in 1991, namely retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a search committee charged with putting a jam in the
revolving door of football coaches at Aledo, Reid wanted no part of
the job. He had served his coaching tenure in the Parker County
town decades earlier, leading Aledo to a 52-12 record from 1967-72.
</P>
<P>
   The committee tabbed Brewer assistant James Roller, who lasted
two days at Aledo after a misunderstanding with Aledo officials
over retaining assistant coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Stuard, the then-superintendent, turned to his friend,
Reid, for a favor _ a ``big'' one.
</P>
<P>
   Reid coached for one season, stipulating that Aledo find a
replacement in 1992. Two years and two coaches later, Aledo finally
found its man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, A&AMP;M Consolidated assistant Tim Buchanan became Aledo's
fifth football coach in five years. Six seasons after taking the
reins of a losing program, the energetic Buchanan has Aledo (12-1)
in its second state championship game. The Bearcats are scheduled
to face Cuero (11-3) in the Class 3A Division I championship at 5
p.m. tomorrow at the Astrodome in Houston. Aledo was a Class A
state finalist in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1987-89 tenure of coach Chuck Curtis has Aledo
seen such football madness. The past three seasons, Buchanan's
teams are 37-4-1, including runs to the 1996 state quarterfinals
and '97 semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit a downturn at the end of the '80s, and it was
terrible,'' said David Milton, a 30-year resident of Aledo and
local youth baseball coach. ``When Buchanan came, he completely
turned it around in about two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Most wondered after 1993, in which Buchanan's first team went
2-8, if anyone could reverse Aledo's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any doubts about coming that year,'' Buchanan
said. ``It was cut and dried; we weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Aledo missed the playoffs in 1994 with a 7-2-1 record, and
1995's 6-3-1 mark left Buchanan doubting himself. Needing to beat
3-6 Decatur to make the playoffs, Aledo lost, 20-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd turned the corner,'' he said. ``That team was
good enough to make the playoffs, and it was the first time I
questioned whether I would be able to get Aledo back to the
playoffs. I considered stepping aside and letting someone else
try.''
</P>
<P>
   Playoffs or not, Aledo was winning again. Fans and
administrators had sensed stability in the overall athletic program
during Buchanan's three-year stay. Participation and morale in all
sports was up, and no one was calling for the coach's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're changing coaches all the time, the state of your
team's not good,'' said local barber G.L. Lowe, who has had a son
and two grandsons play football for Aledo.] ``Some of them before
Tim just couldn't coach. The best thing he's done is put in the
weight program and getting the boys believing they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan knew anything, it was how an off-season program
worked. A&AMP;M Consolidated, in College Station, had been in four
consecutive Class 4A title games from 1989-92. The Tigers didn't
get there by sitting around after November.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a kid works for six to seven months getting pushed to
where they think they'll die if they take another step,'' Buchanan
said, ``it makes them think a lot more on Friday nights. Few quit
after going through what we put 'em through.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was one of seven A&AMP;M Consolidated assistants who
eventually became head coaches elsewhere. Now, he oversees an
athletic program that fields regional powerhouses in almost every
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Aledo programs in all sports now are built from middle school
up. Aledo school board President Steve Reid II, son of the former
coach, said Buchanan abolished an old party line of having athletes
specialize in one sport, a policy that hindered all sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Tim's biggest challenge,'' Reid II said. ``He broke
down those barriers. You know you can't have kids specializing in a
small town like Aledo. They need to learn the fundamentals of as
many sports as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jordan Porter said Buchanan and his staff have
``made athletes out of normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is on top of everything,'' Porter said. ``We trust him
to the point of doing whatever he says, knowing it'll come through
for the best, and it has.''
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, the Bearcats have come through with his first
title shot as a head coach. Mere days before kickoff, Buchanan said
it ``hasn't sunk in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing in high school football is to be playing
and coaching in December,'' he said. ``We've become like a family.
Like any family, we've had our arguments and disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger schools have contacted him, but Buchanan can't imagine
moving again, as he has six times in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've come here,'' he said, ``it's convinced me that this
is one of the best jobs in the state.''

MAN SENTENCED IN SLAYING OF TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 20-year-old man convicted of killing his former
teacher, Jonathan Levin, was sentenced Thursday to the maximum term
of 25 years to life in prison by a judge who denounced him as a
``sadistic and manipulative'' criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted killer, Corey Arthur, maintained the seemingly
remorseless posture that he had throughout the trial as he was
sentenced for second-degree murder by Judge Marcy Kahn of state
Supreme Court in Manhattan. Judge Kahn told Arthur that the torture
and killing of Levin in his Upper West Side apartment on May 30,
1997 was a ``barbaric'' act that showed a ``level of depravity few
people could comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You planned and carried out the betrayal of someone who
selflessly gave you his friendship,'' Judge Kahn said. ``You were
the one who chose Jonathan Levin as your victim. You were the one
who used your relationship with him to get into his apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   After being told his family could not speak for him, Arthur
declined to make a statement before being sentenced, and he showed
no emotion as Judge Kahn vilified him. When Levin's mother, Carol,
made a statement to the court, Arthur scribbled on a notepad with a
blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only one who knew Jon, who knew his mentor, his
teacher, his friend, would not be able to turn his back on anyone
who asked him for his help _ certainly not one of his students,''
Mrs. Levin said as another of her sons, Lee, and a daughter, Laura,
stood by her side. ``How could anyone but a dangerous, brutal and
evil person deliberately destroy the life of a person who reached
out to him, who believed in him?''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Arthur and an accomplice went to visit Levin,
the son of Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, and used a
knife to inflict torture, including three cuts across his throat,
until he gave up the code to his bank card.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, an English teacher at William Howard Taft High School in
the Bronx, was then shot, but the jury was apparently not convinced
that Arthur pulled the trigger, and declined to convict him of
first-degree murder, which could have brought him a prison sentence
of life without parole. The man suspected of being an accomplice,
Montoun Hart, is to be tried on second-degree murder charges next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kahn revealed Thursday that while Arthur was on trial, he
committed disciplinary infractions in jail, violated a court order
and defaced courtroom property. She said he had shown no remorse
for his crime, was not a good candidate for rehabilitation and was
anti-social and narcissistic.
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing that Arthur grew up in a dysfunctional family
racked by drug abuse and attempted suicide, Judge Kahn said there
was no excuse for his actions. ``As your former friend and mentor
pleaded for his life, you did nothing for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor, Eugene Hurley, called the killing the worst he had
seen in 20 years on the job. ``They were acts of barbarity
motivated by greed and self-interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur's lawyer, Anthony Ricco, portrayed his client as the
product of an impoverished, troubled world, calling him a ``legacy
of a tragedy that started a long time ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview with the CBS news program ``60 Minutes''
broadcast last Sunday, Arthur said he deeply regretted Levin's
death. He admitted being in his former teacher's apartment on the
day of the murder, but insisted he had not gone there to rob or
kill Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur has blamed others for carrying out the murder, but he has
not named them. But prosecutors say Arthur killed his teacher after
the robbery because he was the only one Levin could have later
identified to the police.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, Levin's mother praised the judge's ruling,
but she said her family would never recover. ``We will never be
healed,'' she said. ``We will never be whole.''

VARGAS HAS COME A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fernando Vargas' sleeveless shirt exposed a tattoo
around his bicep that he described as an Aztec war band. As he sat
down for an interview moments after completing 12 rounds of
sparring at his Big Bear Lake training camp, he explained its
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Aztec God of war,'' he said, pointing to a
particular part of the tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he would sacrifice his victims, he would de-bone them and
use their skin. It's part of my heritage,'' he said with a
dead-serious expression and obvious pride.
</P>
<P>
   This is Vargas' game face _ one of the many he has _ in the days
preceding the biggest night of his life. The Oxnard resident,
barely 21 and with only 14 fights behind him, faces experienced
slugger Yory Boy Campas for Campas' IBF junior middleweight
championship on Saturday in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   As strong and determined as he is, Vargas does have a profound
weakness. Just mention his 2-year-old son, Fernando Jr., and watch
him evolve instantly from that proud warrior into a loving and _ if
you hit just the right nerve _ tearful father who has devoted his
life to his boy a generation after his own father abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   That's Vargas, a confident and profoundly talented boxer who has
matured into a sensitive young man with a sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the !ital!real!off! Fernando Vargas,'' said Rolando
Arellano, his manager and close friend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vargas was a troubled kid, like many in his rough La Colonia
neighborhood of Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   He was a street fighter from as early as he can remember. A
!ital!good!off! street fighter. A week didn't go by, he said, that
he wasn't suspended from school for beating up a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many, however, he was both lucky and smart.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, he found boxing, then trainer Eduardo Garcia, an
upstanding man who served as both his teacher and principal male
role model. And, well aware of the perilous direction he was
heading, Vargas stuck with both.
</P>
<P>
   Within in a few years, he was among the best amateur fighters in
the nation. In 1994, at 16, he became the youngest national
champion in history and represented the United States in the 1996
Olympics, where he was eliminated in the second round, in large
part because of a ridiculous scoring system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than a month (at age 10), I could see he had the
qualities to be a great fighter,'' said Garcia, who also trains his
son, IBF junior lightweight champion Roberto Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas began to develop a bad-boy image just before the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   It started with comments he made about Oscar De La Hoya. In
simple terms, he resented being called the next De La Hoya because
he doesn't like the WBC welterweight champion _ whom he believes is
a phony _ and wasn't afraid to say so.
</P>
<P>
   The image was bolstered by two incidents late last year: Vargas
was arrested for reckless driving and had an out-of-the-ring run-in
with a rival fighter. His neighborhood and his appearance also
supported the perception. Most conspicuously, a tuft of blond hair
just above his forehead is becoming a trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas makes no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he was cocky but attributed his comments to youth and
his lingering dislike for De La Hoya. He was being honest. The
arrest and ill-advised fight? He makes mistakes. And his
appearance? Hey, just Fernando being Fernando, something he
promises will never change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be myself,'' he said. ``I think it's better that
way. I think people are more attracted to that than if I try to be
like De La Hoya, try to be good and dandy. That's something I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good person, don't get me wrong. I have a good heart, I
like working with kids,'' he said. ``People are going to have to
like me or not the way I am, though, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Vargas about those closest to him and it's impossible
not to like him, or at least respect him.
</P>
<P>
   He's fiercely loyal. Garcia has been with him all the way, and
Arellano, an attorney, came along three years later. They'll be
there at the end, too.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said a managerial firm offered him roughly $2 million
after the Olympics if he would agree to leave his handlers behind
and train on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He gets angry when he thinks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were asking me to do something impossible,'' he said.
``To cut my trainer, a guy who busted his (behind) in the
strawberry fields, a guy who had nothing. My trainer deserves
everything he's getting now, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Rolando has been there through thick and thin, too. He's
not just a manager, he's a friend. This is a guy who used to help
me work on my car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about two seconds to say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's there for his family. His mother now works for
him and he takes his role of big brother seriously, pushing his
siblings to succeed and admonishing them to avoid any bad elements.
He's also been known to throw a few dollars their way these days.
</P>
<P>
   However, the subject of fatherhood takes Vargas to a different
level of passion.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Javier Vargas, left Fernando and his siblings to be
raised by their mother and grandmother, as well as by a stepfather
with whom he only now is building a relationship. Even with Garcia,
he missed many lessons he might have learned from a dad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said he will never forgive his father _ and he won't make
the same mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The center of his universe is Fernando Jr., who was home in
Oxnard with Martha Lopez, the baby's mother, while the boxer
trained for nearly two months for Saturday's fight.
</P>
<P>
   As the conversation gradually shifted from his father to his
son, his emotions shifted back and forth from anger to love and
everywhere in between until he broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not like him,'' Vargas said of his father, anger
still in his voice. ``That man to me is like nobody. He's probably
in jail right now; I don't really care where he's at. He tries to
pop up every once in a while. You know, I'm not gonna have that.
He's not playing a role in my life; he's not playing a role in my
son's life.''
</P>
<P>
   His eyes started to get glassy and his voice cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts sometimes, you know,'' he said. ``But what can you
do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm bitter. I don't want (Fernando Jr.) to go through
life thinking he did something wrong and wonder why that person
isn't there. But what can you do? You gotta be a man about things.
I guess I had to learn to be a man very young in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled a weak smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with my son, all I have to do is see those big brown eyes
and everything feels much better. I just love him so much,
!ital!so!off! much. He's a part of me.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, the tears started falling and he excused himself.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions as to where Vargas finds his inspiration?
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Vargas doesn't have dreams for himself. He
does.
</P>
<P>
   He has the same routine every night before he goes to sleep. He
closes his eyes and sees himself being raised into the air with the
championship belt around his waist.
</P>
<P>
   When they put him back on the ring canvas on Saturday, be
assured that those closest to him will be clustered tightly around
him.

 &HT;    NASA returns to the Red Planet
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ NASA is going back to the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   Today's scheduled 1:45 p.m. launch of Mars Climate Orbiter, and
next month's launch of Mars Polar Lander, are the next steps in a
series of missions to study the planet and its past _ perhaps for
clues that life once existed.
</P>
<P>
   They may also be the forerunners to an ambitious manned mission
to Mars a little more than a decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   The missions follow the 1996 launches of the Mars Pathfinder,
whose rover beamed back dramatic views of Mars' surface in the
summer of 1997, and the Mars Global Surveyor, which is now circling
the planet, sending overhead pictures at unprecedented resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta II rocket will launch the Orbiter from the Cape
Canaveral Air Station, next to Kennedy Space Center. The launch was
set for today but was delayed by a problem with software that keeps
the Orbiter's batteries from overcharging and exploding.
</P>
<P>
   NASA could launch any of the next several days, with only a only
a 30 percent to 40 percent chance of a weather scrub through the
weekend, project managers told a pre-launch news briefing Wednesday
at Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Orbiter is about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle _ 5 1/2
feet by 6 1/2 feet by 7 1/2 feet high _ and weighs only 1,400
pounds, and nearly half of that is fuel. It will travel 416 million
miles and arrive at Mars in September, then move into orbit and
unfold its solar energy panels.
</P>
<P>
   Its first role: radio relay for the Mars Polar Lander, which
launches from the air station Jan. 3 and arrives in December 1999
at the northern edge of Mars' southern polar cap.
</P>
<P>
   During entry the Lander will drop two basketball-sized ``Deep
Space 2'' probes during entry; each will slam to the surface at
30,000 to 40,000 times the force of Earth's gravity, driving it
about 3 feet into Mars soil, to search for evidence of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the surface, the Lander will use a robot arm to dig up,
collect and study soil samples. It will search for ice and for
evidence of climate changes over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Lander is expected to work for about three months before
Mars' cold drains its batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in February 2000, the Orbiter will meticulously map the
face of Mars and conduct a daily survey of the planet's atmosphere
for a Martian year _ 687 Earth days. It will remain as a radio
relay for future Lander missions.
</P>
<P>
   The two Mars missions reflect a change in attitudes about life
elsewhere in the universe, said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate
administrator for space science.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and college scientists created a buzz in 1996 when they
said a meteorite that may have come from Mars contained what might
have been the fossils of ancient microbes. Their findings were
challenged by other scientists, but reopened the debate about life
on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bacterium found anywhere in the universe, even Mars, would
be a stupendous discovery,'' Weiler said Wednesday. ``Will we find
evidence bacteria existed on Mars 5 billion years ago? Perhaps.
Will we find existing life on Mars? That's a longer shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, Weiler said, once followed the ``Goldilocks''
theory: one planet was too hot, one too cold; Earth was just right.
Now, he said, life has been found in such inhospitable corners of
Earth as its polar ice caps and deepest ocean depths.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started finding life everywhere on Earth, in the most
extreme environments you could imagine,'' Weiler said. ``Life may
be a cosmic imperative _ if you have water, you have energy, if you
have organic compounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is water. Mars' deep canyons and channels are
strong evidence that water once flowed; the question is where it is
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to look for life. . .you have to follow the
water,'' Weiler said. ``That's what these two missions are all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Mars' atmosphere is so cold and thin that water quickly freezes
or evaporates but does not rain. Polar frosts are mostly condensed
carbon dioxide, which accounts for 95 percent of Mars' atmosphere.
Because there are water-ice clouds and dust storms, some staggering
in size, NASA believes the top three feet of Mars' surface may be a
well-preserved snapshot of the last 1,000 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars project will cost about $328 million, including launch
vehicles and continuing research. But only about $190 million of
that is for the two ships; at about the cost of the Mars Pathfinder
alone, it's ``two spacecraft for the price of one.'' Project
Manager John McNamee said. He said the mission's relatively low
cost is part of NASA's goal to fly cheaper and more efficient
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have not compromised the science either,'' McNamee
said. ``We will accomplish exciting science.''

EDITORIAL: FALLOUT FROM THE `NAPPY HAIR' FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over using the book ``Nappy Hair'' at a Brooklyn
elementary school has had predictably distressing effects. Now a
principal at an intermediate school in the same district has
decided against using two excellent books in the sixth grade,
apparently for fear of parental protests.
</P>
<P>
   The initial protests occurred at Public School 75 in Bushwick,
where a new teacher, Ruth Sherman, was attacked by parents because
she had read to her third-grade class a book about a young
African-American girl's appreciation of her kinky hair. The book
has been praised and recommended for classroom use by reading
experts at Columbia University's Teachers College. It was written
by Carolivia Herron, an African-American professor, to celebrate
racial diversity and pride.
</P>
<P>
   But some parents, based on photocopies of pages from the book,
instantly judged the material to be racially insensitive. At a
school meeting they screamed at Ms. Sherman, who is white, and some
even threatened her safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman, understandably frightened, requested and received a
transfer out of the district. The school administrators, though
they supported her, should have mounted a more vigorous defense
against the ridiculous racism charge. Instead the offensive
behavior of the parents went unchecked, sending a message to other
teachers that they too could be attacked for using good books that
might contain anything deemed objectionable by a handful of
hotheads.
</P>
<P>
   At Intermediate School 296, sixth-graders will not be assigned
two good books, because they might be controversial. ``The War
Comes to Willy Freeman,'' a critically acclaimed novel about blacks
in the Revolutionary War, and ``Days of Courage: The Little Rock
Story'' both contain a racial epithet in a historical context.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere around the nation, Mark Twain's ``Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn'' and Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird
Sings'' are two books routinely challenged on language and subject
matter. Efforts to keep those and other books out of students'
hands only deprive them of opportunities to learn how to deal with
racial and other sensitive matters in honest and respectful ways.

REPUBLICANS LINING UP FOR IMPEACHMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In somber, often lofty terms, members of the House
Judiciary Committee late Thursday began debate over four articles
of impeachment, the final and most dramatic steps leading to a vote
on whether to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the committee's Democrats and Republicans laid out their
now-familiar views over Clinton's alleged ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' the White House and its allies intensified efforts
to persuade lawmakers to censure, not impeach, the president for
covering-up his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With little doubt over the outcome of the Judiciary Committee's
deliberations, expected to run into the weekend, the committee
members' pitches and the White House campaign were directed toward
the next phase of the impeachment fight, the debate and vote on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are waiting for us to come to our senses
and end this political game of chicken,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., who predicted that a vote Friday by the full House
would result in the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many from the other party are willing to buck
the siren calls of the radical right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said committee members and their
congressional colleagues ``must resist the temptation'' to let the
president's misbehavior pass unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is above the law. Actions have consequences. Always
tell the truth. We should insist on these high ideals,'' Smith
said. ``That the president has fallen short of the standard doesn't
mean we should lower it.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening remarks by all 37 committee members _ 21 Republicans and
16 Democrats _ are expected to be finished shortly before noon
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The first article, one of two accusing Clinton of lying under
oath, was expected to be voted on by the end of the day. Debate on
the other perjury charge and the two others alleging obstruction of
justice and abuse of power were likely to be finished by late
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, perhaps as late as Tuesday, the committee will
consider a Democratic-sponsored alternative to impeachment, a
resolution censuring the president for making ``false statements
concerning his reprehensible conduct with a subordinate.'' The
resolution would require Clinton to acknowledge the rebuke by
signing it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sent a tersely worded
``Dear Colleague'' letter to all 435 House members advising them
they would be needed in Washington by midweek to consider the work
being completed by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the House will begin considering the first
impeachment of a president since the House voted to put Andrew
Johnson on trial in the Senate in 1868. Twenty-four years ago, the
Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against
President Richard Nixon, who resigned before the House could vote
to send his case to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a similar fate for Clinton, top presidential
aides began calling moderate Republicans and some conservative
Democrats who are considered swing votes in the impeachment fight.
Previously, the White House had used emissaries outside the
administration to quietly approach House members who could be
decisive in Clinton's effort to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   While labor unions, Democratic Party leaders and Democratic
leaders in the House were making pitches on behalf of the
president, Clinton was staying on the sidelines _ at least for now.
On Friday, he is to leave Washington on a three-day trip to the
Middle East, and among the lawmakers accompanying him are
Pennsylvania Rep. Jon Fox and New York Reps. Rick Lazio and Michael
Forbes, all Republicans who have not decided how they will vote on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue where twisting arms isn't appropriate, but
bending ears is,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri was planning
to contact the 31 Democrats who abandoned Clinton and sided with
Republicans earlier this fall to approve an open-ended impeachment
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Republican Whip Tom DeLay of Texas was
canvassing his network of deputies about movement among GOP members
and issued a public alert for them to hold fast against anything
less than an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, the No. 3 ranking Republican in the House, criticized the
Democrat's proposal to let Clinton off with a censure resolution
rebuking his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a resolution censure by Congress is going to do
the trick,'' DeLay wrote in an opinion piece for the Washington
Times. ``The idea of censure is born out of a desperate imagination
by those too timid to uphold their own sworn oath to `support and
defend` the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, a Republican on the Judiciary Committee
and an early advocate of impeaching Clinton, said the lobbying
effort is barely underway. ``We haven't seen anything yet,'' Barr
told reporters over breakfast Thursday. In the four days following
the committee's vote on impeachment, ``you'll see more pressure put
on members than any you've seen in 10 years,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A key element in the Democratic effort to head off articles of
impeachment is a harshly worded censure resolution drafted by four
Judiciary Committee members, including Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that the president was ``open to any proposal that
seeks to put this matter behind us that people in good faith bring
forward that is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the White House was being pressed by some
Democrats, at the urging of moderate Republicans, to accept an even
stronger censure resolution, one that would require the president
to pay a monetary penalty in addition to leaving him open to
criminal and civil penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted unnamed sources saying that Rep. Bob
Livingston, the Louisiana Republican in line to become House
speaker, has said privately that he is unlikely to allow a vote on
censure if the issue reaches the floor next week. In public
comments to reporters, Livingston offered no definitive comments on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two polls released Thursday show more than 60 percent
of Americans want the Judiciary Committee to vote against articles
of impeachment. One of the surveys, conducted by the Gallup
organization for CNN and USA Today, found that 55 percent of
Americans favor a censure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found two-thirds of Americans
opposed to impeachment. The same survey found that the Republican
Party has slipped to its lowest level of popularity since 1990 and
its negative rating has almost doubled from 39 percent this week
compared to 22 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican on the Judiciary Committee warned Thursday night
against paying too much attention to polls when weighing the
president's effort to hide his extramarital affair from lawyers in
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit and later from independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say that a thousand historians and a swarm of political
opinion polls and a gaggle of media programs and talk shows,
nothing, none of those things can change the vital facts in this
case,'' said Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa. ``And that is that falsehoods
were uttered in a court proceeding under oath, both in the
depositions and later in a criminal federal grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, a California Democrat on the committee,
disagreed and said House members should not ignore public
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike every other vote we cast, where conscience may play a
determinative role, regardless of public opinion, a vote for
impeachment cannot be blind to the views of those who vested power
in the president,'' Berman said. ``It would be very, very wrong to
expunge the results of an election for the President of the United
States without the overwhelming consent of the governed.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. and Canadian authorities announced Thursday
that they had broken up a sophisticated ring that smuggled Chinese
immigrants into the United States, and ultimately to New York City,
through a Mohawk Indian reservation along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the ring, made up primarily of Chinese
nationals and members of the Mohawk tribe, transported more than
3,600 Chinese immigrants across the lightly patrolled border along
the St. Lawrence River and into upstate New York during the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 47 people had been indicted for conspiracy
to smuggle aliens into the United States. Of those, 35 have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first large-scale alien smuggling operation we
have encountered on the northern border,'' Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in
announcing the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Only about a dozen of the immigrants who were smuggled in have
been taken into custody. Officials said the immigrants, primarily
young men from Fujian Province, paid as much as $47,000 for the
journey from China.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner said she had no information on what types of
companies or businesses the aliens worked in once they arrived in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The break-up of the ring comes three weeks after Attorney
General Janet Reno announced cracking the largest immigrant
smuggling ring to be dismantled in the nation _ an operation that
brought in more than 12,000 people, mainly Indians, Pakistanis,
Syrians and Afghans during the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement highlighted the extent to which the
28-square mile Indian reservation, which straddles two Canadian
provinces and one U.S. state, has become a haven for smugglers. The
foggy creeks and wooded islands featured on the Indian territory,
which is known as the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation on the U.S. side
and the Akwesasne Indian Territory in Canada, have long been used
to spirit gasoline, cigarettes, tobacco and drugs between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, more and more of the contraband has been human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geography of the Akwesasne is perfect for smuggling,''
said Thomas Maroney, the U.S. attorney for the northern district of
New York. ``It's in Canada. It's in the United States. It's in
Ontario. It's in Quebec. A look at a map shows you how easy it is
to use the place as a vehicle for smuggling. It isn't just aliens,
though that's what we're involved with here. There have been cases
of alcohol and tobacco going north and drugs going both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the
investigation into the smuggling ring began with a tip they
received 18 months ago. But the transport of illegal immigrants
across the Mohawk territory was widely known in the reservation and
surrounding territories.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Pakistani woman drowned when a smuggler's rickety
boat capsized in rough waters between Corwall Island, part of the
Indian territory in Canada, and the U.S. mainland. And residents of
the reservation say they are used to seeing Asian people traveling
across their land at all hours of the day or night, easily evading
the 40-officer tribal police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go outside and it's not uncommon to see people of a
different color going through,'' said Joyce Mitchell, a spokeswoman
for the Mohawk National Council of Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Canadian police broke a smaller immigrant smuggling
ring that was importing Chinese nationals, sending some into the
U.S. through the Mohawk reservation but keeping most of the aliens
in Canada. The tip Canadian authorities received involved
information that not all the top people in that ring had been
captured and that a similar and larger operation was still
functioning. Thursday's announcement concerned that second
syndicate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Authorities said that the ring transported immigrants through
Hong Kong and Taipei and a number of intermediate countries,
including Germany, Brazil, Morocco, France, Greenland and Cuba.
Once in Toronto or Vancouver, the aliens took advantage of Canada's
relatively liberal refugee laws and gained entry by claiming to be
fleeing persecution in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 24,852 individuals applied to Canada's Immigration
and Refugee Board for asylum. The board, a quasi-governmental body,
approved 10,042. But, officials say, it can take up to 12 months to
get a hearing on a refugee claim. In the interim there are no
restrictions on the applicant's freedom. Officials could not say
how many of those whose claims were rejected had been removed from
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, individuals who seek asylum in the United States
are incarcerated while awaiting a hearing on their claim.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian police officials said that while waiting for their
hearings the aliens who had been brought to Toronto and Vancouver
by the smuggling ring melted into the large Asian populations in
those cities. Eventually they were driven to Corwall Island,
Ontario, in the St. Lawrence River about 50 miles southwest of
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers then moved the immigrants by boat to the Mohawk
reservation in upstate New York or to a swatch of Indian territory
in Quebec on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, where they can
easily cross into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement the tribe has with the U.S. and Canadian
governments, there are no border controls between the Quebec and
New York sections of the reservation.

ABE HIRSCHFELD: A PUBLICITY HOUND LONGING FOR RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With HIRSCHFELD-INDICT) (lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abe Hirschfeld made a name for himself as a
millionaire developer with erratic behavior and questionable
publicity stunts, but even some of those who have nothing but
contempt for him said they were surprised about his indictment this
week on charges of plotting to kill his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Thursday, people who have worked with Hirschfeld
described him as shrewd but socially inept, a man with an
insatiable need for attention and respect. He has often won the
attention, they said, but not the respect, a failing that has
haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Jacob Hirschfeld, now 79, was born in Poland and got the
equivalent of a sixth-grade education. His family emigrated to
Palestine, which later became Israel, where he got his first job in
a refrigerator factory. In 1954, when he was in his 30s, he moved
to New York. Hirschfeld later became a success in the business
world, developing the city's first open-air parking lots and later
founding a chain of upscale health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was financially successful, his peers in the
real-estate business shunned him because of his unpredictable,
uncouth behavior and his eccentricity, several of them said
Thursday. The most recent example: his unsuccessful effort this
fall to settle the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton by offering her $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some associates suggest Hirschfeld's strong Yiddish accent and
frequently disheveled appearance have further damaged his efforts
to be taken seriously. Although he has made a lot of money, nobody
in the real-estate and development business holds him in high
regard, some said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a joke,'' said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent
Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord group. ``How
do you do business with a guy like that? People just don't trust
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Strasburg and others said they were suspicious of
Hirschfeld, they said it was hard to believe he would order a
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is zany, but there is a limit to his zaniness,'' said Bill
Green, a Democratic political consultant who worked on one of
Hirschfeld's failed political campaigns in the 1980s. ``I can't
believe he would seriously consider doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hirschfeld's quest for respect and admiration that drew
him to politics, a friend and former business associate said.
Starting in the 1970s, he ran unsuccessfully _ first as a Democrat,
then as a Republican, most recently as an independent _ for the
U.S. Senate, Congress, the New York City Council, lieutenant
governor, mayor of Miami Beach, Manhattan borough president and
most recently, state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld did win a two-year term as a Miami beach commissioner
in 1989, but ran into trouble when he spat at a Miami Herald
reporter in front of television cameras. He grew more unpopular
there after fighting with building inspectors about a hotel he had
bought and renovated for $20 million, and returned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Abe is still breathing, he will run for office,''
Green said. ``Otherwise no one will ever see the name `Hirschfeld'
in the paper, and he depends on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said Hirschfeld's most serious bid for respect was
his purchase of The New York Post in 1993, when the newspaper was
in bankruptcy. The staff rebelled, though, after he fired several
popular editors and promised to print his wife's poetry in the
paper. Hirschfeld sold the paper to Rupert Murdoch after just 16
days.
</P>
<P>
   His brief tenure at the Post was his shining hour, a friend and
ex-business associate said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abe's biggest disappointment in life was his failure to keep
the Post,'' said the friend, who requested anonymity because of
Hirschfeld's indictment. ``To own a newspaper would have given him
everything he sought in this town: prestige, power and influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld founded a daily paper, Open Air PM, in 1996, but it
shut down after five months.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has proposed rebuilding Yankee Stadium with a
dome on top and replacing subway tokens with Susan B. Anthony
dollars. Last year, as he was preparing to run for Manhattan
borough president, he was indicted on 123 counts of state
income-tax fraud _ the case is pending _ and then came the Paula
Jones escapade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what many people describe as his offensive antics,
Hirschfeld is a ``decent'' person who donated money to several
people wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shootings of 1993, the
friend said. ``I have always described Abe as a man with a head of
fire and a heart of gold,'' he said. ``A lot of his bad behavior
comes from his failure to get the recognition he thinks he
deserves.''

<P>
   Hirschfeld and his wife, Zipora, live in a luxury apartment
building on Fifth Avenue. His son, Elie, works for the family
real-estate business, as does at least one grandson. But his
daughter, Rachel, recently sued her father on charges that he tried
to cheat her out of millions in a family real-estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   The friend who requested anonymity said that Hirschfeld's
relationship with Stanley Stahl, the business partner whom he is
charged with plotting to kill, was indeed troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abe has always maintained that the guy was cheating him, and
the guy said the same thing about Abe,'' the friend said. ``They
were never able to get back together and make up. It was a long,
longstanding feud.''

ALBANY TO SPEED DATA ON INFANTS' H.I.V. TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state health officials are moving to
alleviate delays in letting mothers and doctors know whether
newborns have the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A state program mandates testing of all newborns for the virus,
HIV. A new regulation will require hospitals to speed up the
testing of women whose HIV status is unknown at the time of birth,
and to return the results within 48 hours in order to identify
newborns at risk for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and advocates for people with AIDS have complained that
it has taken more than a month in some cases to receive HIV test
results on newborns from the state laboratory in Albany. And a
nonprofit advocacy group, the HIV Law Project, has sued the state
over the delays. The group had asked a justice in State Supreme
Court in Manhattan to order that positive HIV test results be
returned within 72 hours, or to halt the program _ the first and
only mandatory testing program for newborns in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department said
Thursday that scientific advances, not the court case, had caused
the agency to put forward the regulation, which is to go into
effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the State Health Department found that if the
antiviral drug AZT is given to newborns with HIV antibodies within
48 hours of birth, the drug can substantially reduce the baby's
chances of becoming infected. The study also said the transmission
rate was reduced even more if the mother took AZT prenatally and
during delivery. The study was completed in February and published
last month in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa McGovern, the executive director of the law project,
said that she had been engaged in settlement talks with the state,
adding that the regulation would address a major part of the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is they should have done this as soon as they
passed the law,'' Ms. McGovern said. ``All these politicians were
taking credit for saving infants but nobody was dealing with the
fact that many mothers weren't hearing until four or five weeks
that they were HIV-positive, and some had been breast-feeding their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory program went into effect in February 1997 after a
furious battle among politicians, civil libertarians and advocates
for women and people with AIDS. Fending off criticism over the
issue of confidentiality _ since a positive test on the newborn
always means the mother is infected _ legislators had argued that
early detection of HIV could help save babies' lives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But health care professionals have said the delays in test
results have undermined efforts to provide better infant care.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers filed over the summer, Justice Sheila
Abdus-Salaam of State Supreme Court also expressed concern. The
justice said the State Health Department had offered several
reasons that results could not be provided to a mother within 72
hours of her child's birth. But she added that the state's
opposition to the law project's request for a quicker turnaround of
HIV test results ``raises more questions for this court than it
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, why can't HIV testing be performed separate and
apart from the testing for other diseases for which specimens
cannot be taken right after birth?'' court papers quoted the judge
as asking the department.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department's spokeswoman, Ms. Tarlton, said Thursday
that the new regulation would place the responsibility on hospitals
to supply test results within 48 hours in cases in which there is
no record of the mother's HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarlton said the tests would need to be conducted in
hospital-based or commercial laboratories, rather than in the state
lab.

REGENTS SEEK CHANGE IN SPECIAL-EDUCATION POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the New York state education
commissioner and the Board of Regents proposed a sweeping plan
Thursday to overhaul the state's increasingly costly and
much-criticized program for educating children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the proposal would revamp the state's
special-education programs by eliminating financial incentives that
have encouraged schools to place mildly disabled students into
separate, costlier classes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan requires the approval of the legislature, where similar
proposals have failed in the past amid lobbying by school officials
and parents of disabled students, who have long feared that changes
in the program would siphon money from it.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the plan came during a meeting Thursday in
which the state education commissioner, Richard Mills, and the
Board of Regents set their priorities for the 1999 legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the change in special-education policy, the board
and the commissioner said they intended to press lawmakers and
Governor Pataki to increase aid to public schools next year by $885
million, to $12.6 billion. The bulk of this aid, 84 percent, would
go to districts in areas with high rates of poverty that have large
numbers of students with limited proficiency in English. The
districts include most of the state's largest cities, including New
York, Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes to the method of state subsidies for
educating students with physical, emotional, learning or other
disabilities would end the practice of giving districts additional
money for each student deemed disabled and placed in a special
classroom, thus removing any financial incentive for such
placements.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of children are placed in special-education programs
each year, in part because schools receive an extra $4,000 a year
from the state for each child newly enrolled in such a program.
</P>
<P>
   The state aid had originally been intended to help school
districts provide intensive care and services for children with
severe disabilities, like blindness or mental retardation. But in
recent years, a growing number of children with mild learning or
behavioral problems have also been placed in the programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a result, special education has been attacked as a costly and
cumbersome bureaucracy that relegates too many children, most of
them black and Hispanic boys, into separate classrooms with
virtually no hope of returning to regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Regents' new proposal, which would be phased in over
seven years, each school district would receive a fixed sum of
money for special education, based on its student population and
level of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   That way, education officials reason, the program would continue
to meet the needs of the most severely disabled students, while
encouraging districts to keep students with milder disabilities in
traditional classrooms.

DUBIOUS DOZEN LEAVE THEIR MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's actually quite simple to escape the clutches
of the annual Daily News Dubious Dozen list of sports media fiends
of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 1: Don't do anything stupid that could tarnish your
career.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2: See No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not even get started on last year's 12 Angry Men and
Women. From Marv Albert's ``experimental phase'' to Frank Gifford's
bosom buddy to Gary Miller's bladder problem, it set a bad
publicity standard that those who aspire to star in the sports
media could only dream of matching.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they did worse in 1998. Judge for yourself:
</P>
<P>
   1. Jim Hill: The KCBS-Channel 2 sports anchor showed up at the
NFL meetings in Kansas City in the last week of October to cover
the event for his station.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you define ``cover?'' Hill marched in with the
delegation lobbying for Michael Ovitz's Carson stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Shapiro of the Washington Post, covering the meetings in
the proper way for his paper, thought that to be strange. So he
asked Hill about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he saw ``nothing wrong'' with helping ``my friend
Mike.'' When he returned to L.A., he did a story on the meetings,
interviewing Ovitz. Then the station made him read a disclaimer
that basically absolved him from reporting any more on the subject
_ but apparently allowing him to act independently in his support
for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro correctly wrote that Hill's ``endorsement and
promotion'' of the Ovitz bid was a ``conflict of interest and a
breach of ethics. In any reputable newsroom in America, print or
broadcast, Hill's participation as a member of Ovitz's team almost
certainly would be considered a suspendable, if not a firing
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro obviously has never covered the L.A. media.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chris Berman: Prior to ESPN's nationwide coverage of the
Angels' home opener at the new and improved Edison Field, Berman
lumbered down from his press box vantage point to host (and lead
cheers) in the pregame festivities down on the field _ all of which
was included in ESPN's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Disney owns ESPN and Disney owns the Angels. But why drag
Berman from the ``Country Bear Jamboree'' attraction and deprive
all those Disneyland customers?
</P>
<P>
   3. Ahmad Rashad: In the September issue of ``Playboy'' in a
story entitled ``The Sweet Life of Ahmad Rashad,'' the NBC
courtside microphone holder detracts readers from further enjoyment
of the publication by complaining throughout the piece that he
doesn't understand why other media folk hate him so much.
</P>
<P>
   Then his cozy relationship with Michael Jordan came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before every game, Michael and I spend about 20 minutes
together, someplace nobody can find us, just laughing and hanging
out,'' Rashad admits. ``I suppose the sports press would hate me
even more than they already do if they knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we do now.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the story, writer Craig Vetter follows Rashad into the
Bulls locker room. Rashad sneaks into a trainer's room, where
Jordan is tying his shoes. Coach Phil Jackson walks in and looks at
Vetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you with the press? This room is off limits to the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vetter leaves _ and Rashad stays _ it finally occurs to the
writer why other journalists hate Rashad, who'll have the rare
opportunity to spend Christmas at the Jordan home all day this
year.
</P>
<P>
   4. Boomer Esiason: Before his seat was warm as the newest member
of the ABC ``Monday Night Football'' team, Norman (his real name)
was enlisted to co-host the Miss America Pageant for the network
and was included in the list of TV's ``40 Most Fascinating Stars of
'98'' by ``People.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think he could have made millions from the Cincinnati
Bengals to remain as their star tackling dummy.
</P>
<P>
   5. Chris Lincoln: On live TV, ESPN's horse-racing host was put
in charge of drawing, then announcing, the post positions for the
Kentucky Derby _ a first-time ever event.
</P>
<P>
   Those two tasks apparently were too much. Until someone figured
out Lincoln's mistake, the greatest horse race in America had what
amounted to a scramble start from the snack bar on the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Go, baby, go.
</P>
<P>
   6. ESPN: In April, it hosted a town-hall meeting on race
relations in sports. President Clinton was the special guest
participant.
</P>
<P>
   During the 90-minute live show, a commercial ran for Hooters _
featuring a Clinton look-alike talking about how fun it was to come
down to the restaurant and check out the babes.
</P>
<P>
   A little foreshadowing, sure. But not a real good public
relations move for future favors from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   7. Fox: For its dedication to style-over-substance in the sport
of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Fox Sports won the Grand Clio Award _ the Oscars for TV
commercials _ for the ``Sports Would Be Better . . .'' campaign it
used to promote the NHL. It marked the first time a network sports
TV campaign won the industry's coveted award, tops among 6,000
entries.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials showed sports by juxtaposing the physical nature
of hockey with non-contact sports like billiards, bowling, golf,
etc., with the tag that their sports would be better if they were
more like hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it's the other way around. Four months later, Fox
was trying to give away its network rights to the ratings-draining
league, glowing puck and all. ABC bought it _ starting in 2000, and
leaving Fox one more season to run the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   8. Keith Olbermann: Last month, he convinced Fox he'd like
return to sports. In fact, he never left in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Although his full-time gig was now anchoring ``The Big Show'' at
MSNBC (no relation to ``The Big Show'' name he said he retired at
ESPN), Olbermann, who said sports was behind him, managed to keep a
high profile writing weekly pieces for ``Sports Illustrated,''
doing radio commentary (in June, he apologized on his SportsFan
Radio Network show for his lack of maturity when he left ESPN),
reporting on postseason baseball games for NBC and, indirectly,
having his life played out on the ABC dramedy ``Sports Night.'' He
did everything but appear as himself on HBO's ``Arli$$.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fox brought him over to try to inject life into its Fox
Sports News cable show, it started an ad campaign: ``Same Keith,
New Network,'' even though the oft-tormented Olbermann claims he's
a new man because of therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Caution: If it !ital!is the same Keith, Fox might line someone
up to replace him when he leaves for The History Channel sometime
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   9. Hannah Storm: She quite literally took a pregnant pause
during halftime of a prime-time NBA playoff game between Chicago
and Indiana to announce a ``major development in the world of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The news? NBC and Turner Sports are ``still considering'' a new
football league that would rival the NFL, but right now, ``no
details are available.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Storm (whose real name is Storen and is married to
Dan Hicks) gave birth to a 7-pound., 12-ounce girl. The name? No
details are available.
</P>
<P>
   10. Peter King: The ``Sports Illustrated'' crack pro-football
writer, in a follow-up to the NBC-Turner football story, reported
to viewers of CNN/SI that the new league will ``be a much cheaper
avenue for some advertisers who right now feel they're getting
squeezed by the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Ted Turner write that down on cue cards for you, Pete, or
was that something you just came up with yourself?
</P>
<P>
   11. Ben Wright: Suspended by CBS two years ago for sexist
remarks about the LPGA Tour, he found his way back to TV in
September doing commentaries _ called ``Quite Wright'' _ for a
syndicated show called ``Golf 2000 with Peter Jacobsen.''
</P>
<P>
   The response (from women's groups especially) wasn't all that
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Said executive producer Jason Charles: ``I'm looking for all the
publicity I can get on this show _ good, bad or indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   12. Marv Albert: Madison Square Garden rehired the convicted
female batterer to host a nightly sports news wrap-up show.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the response (from women's groups especially) wasn't all
that supportive.
</P>
<P>
   MSG head man Dave Checketts, admitting it was done in part for
ratings and publicity, asked: ``How long do we have to hold some
people out and punish them?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's a question for some of Marv's sleazy friends. &QL;

BLACK STREET PREACHERS SUE OVER DENIAL OF PERMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of street preachers who have been a loud and
boisterous presence in Times Square for years sued New York City on
Thursday, accusing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration of
trying to stifle its message.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which is known as the Black Israelites and teaches
that whites are devils and blacks are the true descendants of the
lost tribes of Israel, contended in the lawsuit that the Police
Department had revoked its permits for amplified sound while
allowing more mainstream productions.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which says its permits had been routinely approved
for the last 10 years, also accused the Police Department of a
campaign of harassment by preventing it from using the Times Square
traffic island, arresting members on trumped-up charges and
illegally taking their tables and books.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest to accuse the administration of
seeking to suppress dissent through the power of the Police
Department to grant or deny permits for rallies, protests and
marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is selective and unconstitutional and must stop
immediately,'' said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit on behalf of
the Black Israelites.
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties group has become a familiar opponent of the
mayor on First Amendment issues; last month it settled a lawsuit by
another group of protesters in which the city agreed to handle such
permits in an evenhanded way.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed Thursday contends that in revoking the permit for
the Black Israelites, the Police Department had reneged on that
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its contention that the group was singled out, the
suit also cites a comment by one of Giuliani's senior aides, Bruce
Teitelbaum, in The Jewish Week that the mayor decided to restrict
the group at Times Square because ``the people in that neighborhood
don't have to be subjected to that profane, vulgar, abusive
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the Police Department spokeswoman, said Thursday
night that the department would have no comment on the specifics of
the suit, because of the pending litigation. In the past, she has
defended the department's handling of the permit process, saying
that police officials take into account considerations of public
safety and the constitutional right to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Koeltl of U.S. District Court in Manhattan has
scheduled a hearing for Friday on the group's request to have its
sound permits immediately restored and to be allowed back in Times
Square without being harassed.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Black Israelites, Stacy Williams, said after
the suit was filed Thursday that the group had preached peacefully
in Times Square for 20 years, using amplified sound for the last
10. The group hands out leaflets and books and is not shy about
engaging pedestrians and others in debate, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit asserts that starting in the fall of 1997, the city
denied all the group's requests for sound permits in Times Square,
forcing its members to move nearby to the corner of 44th Street and
Broadway, where they continued to preach but without amplified
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages, says
that the group's members were the object of repeated harassment,
including three false arrests. Eventually, the group was forced off
the street corner entirely, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   After the city agreed to begin issuing permits early last month
to demonstrators on a uniform basis, the suit says, the Black
Israelites obtained a permit for Times Square and began preaching
there again.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 12, the suit says, police officers approached the
group's members on the Times Square traffic island and revoked
their permit, telling them that they were acting on orders from the
mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Williams said, he and other members of the group
were preaching without amplification at 44th Street and Broadway,
and the police approached again, telling the group that it was
creating a traffic hazard and ordering it to leave, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that while the group has been denied permits
and access to Times Square, other commercial and entertainment
groups have been allowed to use amplified sound there.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that the Giuliani administration had, in its
effort to clean up New York, put tourism and big business ahead of
the rights of citizens. ``We basically don't fit in,'' Williams
said.

CHALLENGER'S CAMPAIGN GATHERS ITS OWN INQUIRY TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thwarted in the effort to use police officers to
investigate claims of voter fraud, the campaign of Attorney General
Dennis Vacco on Thursday began assembling its own makeshift team of
investigators _ including workers on leave from the attorney
general's office _ to try to determine the voting eligibility of
thousands of New York City residents.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, the Republican incumbent, has been locked in a bitter
legal challenge to the unofficial results of the Nov. 3 election,
which show him trailing his Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer,
by slightly more than 26,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   A major step was taken Thursday night toward an official
acknowledgment of Spitzer as attorney general when the New York
City Board of Elections unanimously certified results that showed
the Democrat as a runaway winner in the five boroughs. The city
results showed Spitzer with a 3-to-1 lead over Vacco _ 924,459 to
307,707. The state's Board of Elections is required by law to
certify the statewide election results by next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Employees in the attorney general's office have said that
several staff members were asked to take vacation time, sick days
or personal days to assist Vacco in his investigation of the New
York City voter rolls. ``People have been told to do this out of
loyalty to Dennis Vacco,'' said one senior staff member, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The staff member added that several employees had been asked
``to report to the campaign and to do whatever they ask you to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Spargo, the lawyer for Vacco's campaign, said that the
campaign had enlisted the help of about 50 volunteers, but that he
could not confirm whether they were employees on leave from the
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said that the Vacco campaign was also ``looking into
getting more experienced people than our volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're trying to verify that the voters live where
they say they live,'' Spargo said. ``We're not going to be looking
into citizenship. But we will make phone calls and go out in the
field and try to determine who is eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other senior advisers to Vacco said that the campaign had hired
a private investigator, Richard ``Bo'' Dietl, to help with the
canvassing. Dietl is a former New York City police detective who
now runs a private detective agency, Beau Dietl and Associates, of
Maspeth, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has only days left before its representatives must
return to the state Supreme Court in Albany and substantiate their
charges of widespread voter fraud in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the city's Board of Elections came one day after
Justice Thomas Keegan of state Supreme Court signed an order
compelling the 10 commissioners to meet and certify the results,
and pass the figures on to the state. On Tuesday, the city board's
members split along party lines and failed to certify the returns
from the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, who maintains that tens of thousands of New York City
voters cast ballots illegally, filed lawsuits in state Supreme
Court asking that he be named the winner or that the court
authorize a new election.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Vacco campaign sought to invoke a seldom-used
state law providing for the police to question residents whose
eligibility is challenged. Varying interpretations of the law
resulted in the derailment of that effort, however.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers argued that only a single commissioner's
complaint was required for a police canvass. But the president of
the City Board of Elections said it was a matter for the board as a
whole to decide. Keegan also maintained that it was an electoral
matter, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declined to act without the
judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few days, Spargo said, his team of volunteers will
go through the voter rolls and the data from the credit firm, make
calls and drive through the streets of New York City to see whether
voters live at the addresses listed on their voter registration
forms. No door-to-door visits are expected, Spargo said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that 70,000 people on the voter rolls had filed
change-of-address forms indicating that they had moved to other
states, and that by the time the two campaigns appear before Keegan
in Albany on Monday, he hopes he will have established that there
were more than 26,000 illegally cast votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll be working around the clock,'' he said. ``One
of our problems is that there is a massive amount of checking that
we have to do between now and Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's campaign lawyers contend that any finding of
fraudulently registered voters casting ballots on Nov. 3 could
result only in those people being purged from the voter rolls, but
that any such finding could not legally cause the result of an
election to be voided. They added that any information based on
verifications of credit history derived by a group of volunteers
would scarcely be admissible in court.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Goldstein, Spitzer's press secretary, said that the
Democrat was utterly unworried about what the Vacco campaign
investigators might uncover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not very serious,'' Goldstein said. ``Mr. Vacco's
conduct is getting to be a daily joke, and people around the state
wake up each day asking themselves what wacky thing Dennis Vacco
will do next. His behavior is more frightening than the remake of
`Psycho.'''

 MARTIN RODBELL IS DEAD AT 73; CHEMIST AND NOBEL LAUREATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Rodbell, a biochemist who shared the 1994 Nobel Prize
in Medicine and Physiology for shedding light on the mysteries of
life's basic processes, died on Monday at the University of North
Carolina Hospitals in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 73 and lived in
Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiovascular disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell's career spanned more than four decades with the
National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md. He formally retired
in 1994 from the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C., but continued his
research.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell and Dr. Alfred G. Gilman, a pharmacologist, won the
Nobel Prize for their work on a component of the communications
system that regulates cellular activity, known as G-proteins.
Proceeding separately on parallel research projects, the two men
discovered those proteins and how they work.
</P>
<P>
   G-proteins are natural substances that help cells translate
signals emitted by the environment and from within the body into
cellular chain reactions that govern fundamental life functions.
The discoveries led to the knowledge that some types of cancer are
caused by mutated and hyperactive G-proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Rodbell found that the signal transmission, or
transduction, by which the body's cells get their directions
requires a tiny intracellular molecule called guanosine
triphosphate, or GTP. That finding had many implications for the
treatment of many diseases, from cholera to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell joined the staff of the National Institutes of Health in
1956 as a nutrition and endocrinology chemist.
</P>
<P>
   He was a native of Baltimore, graduated from Johns Hopkins
University in 1949 and received his doctorate from the University
of Washington in Seattle in 1954. After doing postdoctoral work in
chemistry at the University of Illinois, he joined the laboratory
of Christian Anfinsen, who shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in
chemistry, at the National Heart Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he transferred to North Carolina as scientific director
of the environmental health institute.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Barbara Ledermann
Rodbell; three sons, Paul, of Silver Spring, Md., Andrew, of
Bethesda, and Phillip, of Hingham, Mass.; a daughter, Suzanne
Richardson, of Cabin John, Md.; a sister, Judy Risberg of
Baltimore, and seven grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: IN V FILES, INVISIBLE, DEAD AND ALIENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dennis C. (for Can't Get Me Out of Office) Vacco has
been sprucing up his image. Until the last few weeks, Vacco was
destined to be best known as the New York attorney general who lost
Ellis Island to New Jersey. Now he may go down only as the
politician who did not get it when he heard the fat lady sing. In a
year or two, who will remember?
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has also given New Yorkers a reminder of how the crime
rate continues to fall. The police must have a good deal of time on
their hands if the state's chief law-enforcement officer thinks
that hundreds, possibly thousands, of them can be pulled off the
job to bang on doors searching for ineligible alien voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also felt that this might be a
constructive use of police manpower, until he had second thoughts.
But then the mayor has dispatched his troops on all sorts of
assignments that were not standard when New Yorkers were being
bumped off at the rate of six a day.
</P>
<P>
   The police have been told to go after jaywalkers, wayward
bicycle riders, barricade-bashing pedestrians, people driving too
fast, cars stopped in no-standing zones, smokers tossing cigarette
butts into the street, ticket scalpers, errant taxi drivers and
assorted others deemed motes in the mayoral eye. That last category
includes citizens who think they have a right to just drop by City
Hall to see local government in action.
</P>
<P>
   Do New York police officers feel that politicians are asking an
awful lot of them these days? You bet, said James Savage, first
vice president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are expected to give out an extraordinary number of
summonses _ more than ever,'' he said. ``The more they give out,
the more the city wants.'' And the more public annoyance with the
police builds, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there's a lot of resentment,'' Savage said, a view
echoed by Marie Rosen, publisher of Law Enforcement News, a
publication of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. One reason
many officers are resentful, she said, is that ``their pay is not
too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that the Ballot Box Police will not be sent out
just because Vacco and the state Republican Party have trouble
accepting the slender victory of the Democratic candidate, Eliot
Spitzer. Still, the amount of creative energy spent on discrediting
Spitzer's vote totals has been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Republicans challenged absentee ballots from
Democratic strongholds with pettifoggery like objecting to ballots
on which voters wrote down Brooklyn instead of Kings as their
county of residence. That tactic went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So the Vacco camp then protested that graveyards were opened on
Election Day (most dead people, apparently, being Democrats). That
failed, too. Now the charge is that perhaps 100,000 people, many of
them immigrants, voted illegally in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for the allegation? A private credit-checking company
has no record of those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about my mother,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``She's 87. She
doesn't have a passport. She doesn't have a driver's license. She
doesn't have a credit card. And I haven't seen her
voter-registration card in 20 years.'' All the same, her mom has
lived in the same house in Brooklyn for years, and is a legitimate
voter.
</P>
<P>
   The big mystery is why New York Republicans think this is how to
reach out to future voters among the new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vacco, he is hunkered down in his office, out of sight
and refusing to consider transition talks with the man elected to
succeed him on Jan. 1. There are important matters to discuss, and
time is short.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Vacco could explain how you go about, as he did,
replacing dozens of staff members with lawyers tied to your party's
leadership. Or how to make a top deputy of someone who failed the
bar exam seven times. Or how to set up a Web page like the one
Vacco created so the public could speak out on possible parole for
Joel Steinberg, the convicted child-killer _ a thumbs-up,
thumbs-down approach to criminal justice not used much since the
heyday of the Roman Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the two men could pass the time on pleasantries
like what they want for the holidays. Videos make nice gifts.
Here's a shopping tip for Spitzer. Judging from Vacco's recent
performance, two of his favorites are ``Night of the Living Dead''
and ``Alien Resurrection.''

WHEN LIBRARIES AREN'T FREE TO ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Vt., Texas, Mo., Ala., Ore.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY STREAM, N.Y. _ Go to the public library and borrow a
book: Most Americans give it little thought.
</P>
<P>
   But there are almost 7 million people who do not have access to
a public library, according to the American Library Association.
And although New York City has three systems that make the largest
public-library network in the nation, New York state has more
people without a library _ 1.3 million _ than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when some of those people go to a neighboring town looking
for books, they find that the sign above the door _ ``Free
Library'' _ does not apply to them. They must pay annual fees of
from $25 to $300 a year for library privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials say that these fees are wrong and they are
getting ready to take action to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Local librarians agree in principle _ free access to everyone _
but they say they can't afford to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally and philosophically, the state's position sounds fine,
but in reality, there is no free lunch, and that includes library
services,'' said Andrew Geddes, who for more than 22 years has
directed the Nassau Library System headquartered in Uniondale.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have long believed that library service is free,
especially if they come from New York City, where they can walk
into any branch and get service,'' he said. ``Most do not realize,
however, that they pay for that service through taxes collected one
way or another by the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when somebody comes in from a neighboring town that doesn't
have a library and expects free service, it comes as a shock when
they're asked to pay for it,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get the same reaction when they're asked to pay for
using a neighboring town's swimming pool,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   When Martha Jacovides moved here 30 years ago from New York
City, one of the attractions was a nearby public library. But when
she went to take out her first book, she was shocked to find that
she had to pay a special membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I lived outside the boundaries of the incorporated
village of Valley Stream, so I had to pay for library services,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At first Mrs. Jacovides paid a service fee of $30 a year. She
now pays $100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But these user fees are in violation of guidelines established
50 years ago by the State Board of Regents, which charters public
libraries, according to Janet Welch, the state librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules are going to be enforced,'' said Mrs. Welch, who
since taking over the post of state librarian 14 months ago has
made free access to local libraries a top priority. She said there
had been a growing number of complaints and the state Board of
Regents, which had long been willing to overlook the access rules,
was ``now taking an activist role in enforcing the regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the board appointed a 17-member panel four months
ago to recommend solutions to the problem that could be carried out
in the year 2000. Until then, she said, the regents will ask local
librarians to adhere to an interim set of rules to be announced by
the board on Friday. Penalties will also be discussed, and Mrs.
Welch said they could include the discontinuation of interlibrary
loan services that are now financed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although public libraries will no longer be permitted to charge
nonresident fees under the new rules, they will be permitted, for
example, to place limits on some of their costlier services, such
as heavily attended story-telling hours or the ability to borrow
current best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of libraries is exploding,'' Mrs. Welch said. ``The
Internet has made them important centers for information, so
everyone wants access, and no one should be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Although New York has the largest population without library
service, the American Library Association says that six other
states _ Indiana, Vermont, Texas, Missouri, Alabama and Oregon _
report that 5 percent to 10 percent of their populations are
unserved.
</P>
<P>
   But 27 states report no unserved areas, because statewide and
state-financed reciprocal borrowing programs, such as the Colorado
Library Card, as well as other arrangements, provide some kind of
access to library services, according to Linda Wallace, a
spokeswoman for the library association.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most of the local library districts on Long Island and elsewhere
in the state evolved more by chance than design as farming
communities became suburbs, and although chartered by the state,
they have remained fiercely independent and resistant to outside
interference.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bayville Free Library, which began in 1903 when
a 14-year-old boy started lending books from a shelf in the corner
of his grandmother's candy shop, is among the smallest on Long
Island. The 6,000 residents of the village have resisted offers to
merge with a larger library in neighboring Locust Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Welch said there were 770 public-library systems throughout
the state; she did not know how many libraries were charging access
fees. ``Since they know they are in violation of a state regulation
by doing so, it's not something they tell us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said complaints about fees had been increasing in recent
years after libraries came under pressure to install computers.
Many libraries now have Internet access for their patrons, but the
installation and maintenance has put pressure on already-squeezed
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 770 libraries have annual budgets totaling $700
million, paid for with local tax revenues, plus an additional $300
million from endowments, gifts and special funding. The state
contributes an additional $90 million a year and the federal
government $8 million, Mrs. Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the local libraries that will be hardest hit by the new
state rules will be Mrs. Jacovides' library, the Henry Waldinger
Memorial Library in Valley Stream, which draws nonresident
borrowers from neighboring Millbrook and North Valley Stream in
Nassau County and from across the border in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about 450 customers last year who paid access fees,''
said Marshal Botwinick, director of the library. He said the fees
were based on a system recommended by the Nassau Library System and
the amount of taxes paid by Valley Stream's 33,900 residents. The
library's $860,000 annual budget comes from tax revenues from
12,000 properties, most of them residential. He said revenue from
the special access fees totaled $20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't object when you tell them it's the same
amount that local residents pay to support the library,'' he said.
The fees, he said, ranged from $25 per child to $100 for an entire
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Board of Regents orders us to drop those fees, then we
will not be able to provide people from other communities with
library services,'' Botwinick said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bay Park on the South Shore, 65 families seeking library
services went next door to East Rockaway and paid fees ranging from
$100 to $170. A dispute over the fees led to a referendum in which
voters in Bay Park approved the collection of a library tax in a
three-year experiment that will begin in January 2000. The
arrangement insures them full service at the East Rockaway Public
Library, according to Ellen Rockmuller, the library director.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an excellent idea and one of a number remedies the
state will definitely consider,'' Mrs. Welch said.

CREATIVE TIME FOR MARKETERS OF CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., Wash., U.K.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under the recent tobacco settlement, cigarette manufacturers can
no longer give away lighters, clothing and other products bearing
their logos in exchange for the Camel Cash and Marlboro Miles
coupons included in cigarette packs.
</P>
<P>
   But the lists of customers who redeemed those slips could be the
first place the companies look when planning their new advertising
campaigns, providing a valuable data base for direct marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more direct marketing,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, a tobacco and beverage industry analyst for Merrill Lynch.
``One of the outgrowths of a product like Marlboro gear is a big
address book. When you have constraints on marketing, people become
enormously creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have relied heavily on direct marketing in the
United Kingdom, where cigarette advertising is more severely
restricted than in the United States. ``They've had to learn to
deal with, overseas, an environment that is far more severe than
anything the U.S. is going to see for years, if ever,'' Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also bans outdoor billboard advertisements, the
use of cartoon characters, product placement in movies and
advertisements in magazines for young readers.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies have until April 22 to take down their
signs, according to the Washington state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although opponents of smoking have applauded the ad
restrictions, the limits may benefit the big cigarette companies by
making new competition virtually unthinkable. Without a data base
of customers or an established brand image, analysts say, it will
be difficult for a new company to sell products to smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious forms of marketing are being removed from the
industry,'' said Martin Feldman, a tobacco business analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``Even in a more benign
advertising environment, how many new brands have there been in the
U.S.?''
</P>
<P>
   The four companies that dominate the industry are the Philip
Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of B.A.T.
Industries, and Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Direct marketing could also fuel sales of the big four
companies' lower-priced brands to known smokers, Feldman said after
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco raised their prices 45 cents a pack
on Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of direct mail efforts aimed at current smokers, the
states achieved the ``major intent of trying to stop marketing to
kids,'' said Fred Olson, a spokesman for the Washington state
attorney general, Christine Gregoire, who took up the negotiations
in June after an earlier $368.5 billion settlement failed in
Congress. Olson cited the bans on outdoor advertisements and
clothing bearing cigarette logos as important victories in that
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But some smoking opponents remain leery of the cigarette
marketers' resourcefulness. The companies have historically found
ways around advertising restrictions, including circumventing the
ban on television advertisements by buying attention-grabbing
billboards at widely televised sports events.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have always been creative in finding loopholes despite
restrictions they would consent to,'' said Randolph Smoak, chairman
of the American Medical Association's Board of Trustees. ``They
will continue to target young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement allows state attorneys general to file lawsuits
against companies for violating the agreements, or consent decrees,
that bar them from marketing cigarettes to under-age smokers. The
companies will also be subject to lawsuits from the states if they
fail to enforce their trademarks by allowing retailers to illegally
advertise their products.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even some lawyers for the states said the agreement's limits
might be difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the imagery effectively used in cigarette advertising is
simply too vague to ban, said Laurie Loveland, the North Dakota
solicitor general who helped draft the advertising restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically just a picture of the West,'' Ms. Loveland said
of the Phillip Morris Cos.' advertisements for the Marlboro brand.
The company spends $115.5 million annually on print advertisements
for Marlboro, analysts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately vague images that trigger brand associations have
also been successful in the United Kingdom, where advertisements
for Silk Cut cigarettes have featured nothing more than a light
blue roll of silk flapping in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Marlboro, all you have to show are the spurs with the
right colors,'' said Goldman, the Merrill Lynch analyst.

 TONY TANNER, 63, BRITISH CRITIC WHO LOVED AMERICAN BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tony Tanner, a versatile and prolific literary critic
and professor whose love for American literature inspired the first
courses on the subject at Cambridge University, died on Saturday.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, when the young Tanner returned from two years on a
Harkness fellowship at the University of California at Berkeley and
Stanford University, American literature was still considered a
young and exotic specialty, not worthy of serious study in English
academia. But Tanner returned with a passion for the subject and a
doctoral dissertation on wonder and naivete in American literature
that became the first on an American subject to be accepted by the
Cambridge English faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner's teachings on the topic helped persuade the university
to offer a master's degree in American literature, and in 1989, he
was appointed to its first chair in American literature.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Anthony Tanner was born in Richmond, Surrey, and was
educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, after spending two years of
military service in the Intelligence Corps. Upon returning to
Cambridge after his studies in the United States, he rose quickly
to become an influential member of the faculty at King's College.

<P>
   Although he was perhaps most renowned for his large body of work
on the subject of American literature, Tanner did not want to be
known purely as an Americanist, and was just as knowledgeable about
English works. Indeed, his scholarly work reflected a catholic
taste in literature that extended from Shakespeare and Byron to
Ruskin, Pope and the metaphysical poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanner was a reader of a voracity and originality unparalleled
in my experience,'' the critic Frank Kermode wrote in an
appreciation earlier this week. ``He was an ecstatic reader, and
his sheer pleasure in great writing was, to his fellow
professionals, an anachronistic delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner was known as a gracious reader, a clear, graceful writer
and such a generous teacher that some of his colleagues complained
he could be too soft on his students.
</P>
<P>
   Among his books were ``The Reign of Wonder'' (1965), a study of
the work of Henry James, Twain, Emerson and others that grew out of
his dissertation, and ``City of Words'' (1971), which dealt with
contemporary and very recent American literature. He also wrote
short books on Saul Bellow and Thomas Pynchon and published ``Henry
James and the Art of Nonfiction'' (1995), a compilation of lectures
on James as a travel writer, autobiographer and critic.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner also wrote extensively about Joseph Conrad, wrote
introductions to Penguin's Jane Austen series (the pieces were
collected in a book in 1986), and edited and wrote the
introductions to the Everyman editions of Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Venice Desired'' (1992), he wrote about Venice through the
eyes of Byron, Ruskin, James, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Proust and
Pound, and in 1979 he published ``Adultery in the Novel,''
explaining in an introduction his critical philosophy, which was to
approach the subject as if it had never been examined before. ``I
wanted to try having my own say in my own words,'' he explained,
adding that he also wanted to ``avoid continuous reference (and
deference) to other works.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nadia Fusini, a translator and
critic.

KINGS LACK SCORING PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Luc Robitaille says it is immaterial who is
lighting the red light _ as long as somebody is _ which is very
easy for him to say because he leads the Kings in goal-scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares who scores?'' Robitaille said with a laugh Thursday,
the day after the Kings recorded a rare victory by defeating the
Washington Capitals 2-1. ``We've just got to find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is it matters quite a bit, because for most of this
season, if Robitaille (13 goals) or Glen Murray (11) don't score
for the Kings, no one scores at all. And with just a little more
production, the record of the Kings (7-17-3) might be much better,
13 of their losses having come by one or two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, you have to have two lines scoring and producing,''
Murray said. ``It's a fact around the league. Look at the teams
that are winning _ Dallas, Detroit, Colorado, Phoenix. You've just
got to have that to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings don't, and the numbers don't lie. In five of 27 games
this season, Robitaille or Murray (or Robitaille and Murray) have
been the Kings' only scorers, and in four other games, the team has
been shut out. In three other games, Robitaille and Murray scored
two of the Kings' three goals; in two other games, Robitaille and
Murray scored three of the Kings' four goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six games, in which the Kings are 1-5, Robitaille
has three goals, Murray has three, Vladimir Tsyplakov and Yanic
Perreault have one each and the rest of the team has as many goals
as the entire staff of this newspaper. In fact, 13 of the 18
forwards to wear a Kings uniform in 1998-99 have less than a hat
trick for the entire (begin ital)season.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having trouble scoring goals right now,'' said Murray,
whose recent linemates have been Robitaille and Perreault (one goal
in the last 23 games). ``We need another line scoring and helping
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the Kings, who will seek their first
winning streak of the season when they play host to Vancouver at 7
p.m. Saturday, are getting little offensive production from their
defensemen, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake, who is expected to return to the lineup Saturday
after missing six weeks with a broken foot, leads Kings defensemen
with two goals, despite missing 15 of 27 games. Kings defensemen
have scored just six goals all season, and only one in the last 18
games (by rookie Mark Visheau against the New York Rangers in a 5-1
loss on Nov.19).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' said Blake, who led NHL defensemen with 23
goals last season en route to winning the Norris Trophy. ``We've
got two guys scoring _ Glen and Luc. If you watch their goals, the
majority are coming from the front of the net. Guys have to watch
that. They have to get in front of the net and crowd it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson has been saying that all season, that the
lack of traffic is a big part of the Kings' offensive impotence,
not just on the power play but also at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that worries me is that if you take away the
shorthanded goals and the power-play goals, you're looking at
(1.41) goals per game 5-on-5 and 4-on-4,'' Robinson said. ``That
was our strength last year. We talked about our power play not
being very good last year, but 5 on 5, we were scoring goals in
bunches (2.01 a game).''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Kings is that Jozef Stumpel, besieged by
injuries all year, finally appears to be healthy and in good shape.
Robinson has been playing Stumpel, his best center and the Kings'
leader with 79 points last season, with Tsyplakov and Craig
Johnson. If they can start to click, the offense finally may
achieve some badly needed balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't expect to get all the scoring from the same people
all the time,'' Robinson said. ``It's time for other people to pull
their socks up.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Winger Steve McKenna, who returned to the lineup
Wednesday only to re-injure his strained abdomen late in the game,
is listed as week-to-week, though trainer Pete Demers said it did
not appear he was injured as severely as the first time. McKenna
missed a month with his initial injury.... With McKenna sidelined,
Robinson said he is considering moving the 6-foot-6, 222-pound
Visheau to right wing to capitalize on his size and toughness along
the boards.

 By ALISON MITCHELL with LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee began debating four
articles of impeachment Thursday night after Republican and
Democratic lawyers made their final arguments over President
Clinton's fate, marshaling videotapes, the words of the nation's
founders and competing views of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As the committee began pushing to finish its impeachment inquiry
this weekend, Speaker Newt Gingrich instructed the lame-duck 105th
Congress to be ready to return next week. He set next Thursday as
the day that the House could begin considering the impeachment of
Clinton. It would be only the second time in the nation's history
that the House has been called on to take such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous atmosphere that had so often pervaded the
committee's hearings gave way to grim solemnity as the 37-member
panel planned to vote on Friday and Saturday on whether to charge
the president with two counts of perjury and with obstruction of
justice and abuse of power. Republicans say it is certain the
committee will recommend Clinton's removal from office. The only
question is how many charges it will approve.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wisc., opened the debate
Thursday night by calling for impeachment. ``I do so with no joy,
but without apology,'' he said. ``What is on trial here is the
truth and the rule of law.'' Republican after Republican followed
his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the committee's ranking
Democrat, who also sat on the panel in the Watergate scandal,
warned Republicans that they were ``trying to overturn the result
of two elections.'' Democrats pleaded for censure as the best way
of ending the yearlong scandal that has engulfed the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the committee room, a fierce struggle was under way for
the hearts and minds of the two dozen or so undecided Republicans
who could swing the impeachment vote one way or another in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, most of the day was devoted to the summations of
the committee's senior lawyers, with the Republican counsel going
beyond the case to question the president's character, and the
counsel for the Democrats imploring the committee to consider how
the nation would react to what could be a months-long Senate trial
with Monica Lewinsky on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, both lawyers showed the nation excerpts from
Clinton's videotaped deposition in the Paula Jones case, testimony
that has been central to the impeachment case before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   David Schippers, the Republicans' chief investigative counsel,
said: ``Today, I come to the point that, frankly, I prayed I would
never reach. It is my sorrowful duty now to accuse William
Jefferson Clinton of obstruction of justice, false and deliberately
misleading statements under oath, witness-tampering, abuse of power
and false statements to and obstruction of the Congress of the
United States in the course of this very impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' lofty tone changed as he went beyond discussing
impeachable offenses to describe Clinton in scathing terms as a
deeply flawed man unfit for office. The Republican counsel referred
to ``cover stories'' and Clinton's ``crafty mind'' and his ``lame
and obviously contrived'' testimony. And he charged that there were
``allegations of possible serious wrongdoing'' and of ``probable''
crimes that he could not disclose because of ongoing criminal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats, said he was not
defending the president but the sanctity of the Constitution, as he
argued that the case against Clinton did not justify his removal
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``From listening to our constitutional scholars, we learned that
impeachment is like the wall protecting the fort around the
separation of powers,'' Lowell said. ``The crack you put in the
wall today becomes the gash tomorrow, which ultimately leads to the
wall crumbling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell also spoke of a ``constitutional quagmire'' over ``the
definition of sex,'' and said impeachment was not used ``when
President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, nor when
President Roosevelt misled the public about United States
involvement in the lend-lease program, nor when President Reagan
misled the country and Congress about involvement with
Iran-contra.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the White House sharply protested Schippers'
presentation. ``We are disappointed and saddened that the committee
majority brought this solemn constitutional process down to a level
of innuendo, anger and unfair, unsubstantiated charges,'' said
Gregory Craig, special counsel to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats on the committee, Reps. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts and Zoe Lofgren of California, angrily compared
Schippers' intimations of secret crimes to McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., Thursday signaled that he would allow a censure vote in the
committee but could postpone it until next Tuesday. He made clear
that he opposed censure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who are trying to put forward a censure measure in
place of impeachment, were looking at toughening their own
proposals to demand a financial payment from the president in an
effort to draw more Republicans to their side. But it was still not
clear whether Republican leaders would allow the full House to vote
on a censure measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting to see what the Judiciary Committee reports,''
said Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., the incoming speaker, as he
sidestepped the question. ``And I'll deal with the procedure
according to what they report. I've not yet found out what they
anticipate.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the nation saw videotaped excerpts of
Clinton's deposition in the sexual harassment case of Paula Corbin
Jones, as both lawyers used different parts of the same tape to
present their contrasting views.
</P>
<P>
   Telling the committee to ``listen to the president's deceptions
for yourself,'' Schippers played on large television screens
several clips in which Clinton said he could not recall being alone
with Ms. Lewinsky in the Oval office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was so much simpler before they found that dress, wasn't
it?'' Schippers asked, referring to the blue dress that contained
evidence of Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The tape also showed Clinton watching intently _ staring off
screen _ as his lawyer, Robert Bennett, read aloud Ms. Lewinsky's
affidavit saying she had not had a ``sexual relationship'' with
Clinton. ``That's absolutely true,'' the president had affirmed.
Bennett later notified the judge in the Jones case that Ms.
Lewinsky had retracted her affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   On the same television screen, Lowell displayed a different
segment of the tape, showing Clinton first studying a written
definition of sexual relations given him by the lawyers for Ms.
Jones and then listening as those lawyers, his lawyer and Judge
Susan Webber Wright of the U.S. District Court in Little Rock,
Ark., squabbled over the legal description of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding prescient, Bennett complained that ``this is going to
lead to confusion'' and argued that a deposition is not supposed to
be ``a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of perjury against the president stem from his
denial of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Lawyers for Clinton
have argued that he was not lying because he believed that sexual
relations meant intercourse, not other kinds of sex. Time and time
again, Schippers pointed to Clinton's pattern of answers that the
lawyer called a ``gratuitous insult to your intelligence and common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Schippers and Lowell did more than just argue the facts.
Faced with public opposition to impeachment, Schippers, a former
prosecutor, tried to raise fundamental questions about Clinton's
character, suggesting several times that he was not fit to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Ms. Lewinsky, then a 22-year-old White House
intern, had never spoken to Clinton before their first intimate
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime on Nov. 15, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky made an improper
gesture to the president,'' he said. ``What did he do in response?
Did the president immediately confront her or report her to her
supervisors, as you would expect? Did he make it clear that such
conduct would not be tolerated in the White House? No. That would
have been an appropriate reaction, but it's not the one the
president chose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the president of the United States invited this
unknown young intern into a private area off the Oval Office, where
he kissed her,'' Schippers said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point he contended that the ``president's illegal
actions constitute an attack upon and utter disregard for the truth
and for the rule of law.'' And he said Clinton had an ``arrogant
disdain'' for fellow citizens like Ms. Jones and for the other
branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lowell, himself a defense lawyer, tried to force
the committee to think about the prospect of a long Senate trial
featuring the entire cast of characters of the scandal, from Ms.
Lewinsky to her former friend and co-worker, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, using tapes and videotapes, showed how an aggressive
criminal defense lawyer might rebut the case against the president
in a trial. He attacked Ms. Lewinsky's credibility by playing a
tape of her conversation with Ms. Tripp on the telephone in which
she said she had learned how to lie and deceive throughout her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the issues of the president's conduct in this case so
grave,'' Lowell asked, ``that you would doom the country to
additional months of this ordeal and government paralysis _ on the
slimmest of votes on the House floor and no likely conviction in
the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to begin voting on four separate
articles of impeachment on Friday. They charge Clinton with perjury
in testimony before a grand jury, perjury in the Jones lawsuit,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the Republicans on the committee, who have
a 21-16 edge over the Democrats, have solid support for perjury and
obstruction of justice charges. But Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., said
he was still undecided on abuse of power, based on the president's
claims of legal privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are expected to vigorously debate the articles but are
not expected to try to amend them because they do not want to water
them down and make them more palatable to Republican moderates.
``We have no interest in improving what we regard as a fatally
flawed proposal,'' said Julian Epstein, the committee's Democratic
counsel.

McNOWN'S VISION GOES FAR BEYOND PLAYING FIELD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody talks about Cade McNown's telescopic
vision, his ability to see a receiver streaking open in the end
zone even as he himself is squirming to escape the clutches of some
300-pound lineman with halitosis.
</P>
<P>
   How the senior left-hander managed to find Brian Poli-Dixon on
that game-tying 7-yard touchdown pass at Miami as he was falling
out of bounds we'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, McNown sees so far it's staggering. His range of
view extends beyond the back goal line, past the Heisman Trophy
race, farther on than the NFL and well into middle age.
</P>
<P>
   His Bruins aren't going to win a national championship. It's
doubtful he'll lug home the Heisman on Saturday despite breaking
school records for career passing yards and total offense and
setting a single-game record in the loss to the Hurricanes by
throwing for 513 yards and five scores.
</P>
<P>
   It matters not that McNown probably lost his grip on the Heisman
the moment Texas running back Ricky Williams eclipsed Tony
Dorsett's national career rushing mark. The true measure of
McNown's success is that he has such a firm grasp of reality.
</P>
<P>
   He showed us that before he completed the first of his 23
touchdown passes this season. The week of the Bruins' game against
Williams' Longhorns, some nearsighted soul asked McNown if winning
the Heisman wasn't overrated, given that the only Bruin to win
college football's most coveted prize, quarterback Gary Beban,
ended up ``a failure'' in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   McNown shifted uncomfortably in his seat and we swear we heard
his hackles snap to attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' McNown said with a smirk, ``if you consider being in
charge of one of the largest commercial real estate companies a
failure. . .''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, McNown had delivered a strike. So what if Beban's NFL
career was history after two seasons? McNown was astute enough to
discern the seamless manner in which Beban quickly checked off to
another career option when his primary one was covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make insane remarks like you're not a success
(unless you have a long NFL career) are losers,'' McNown reiterated
the other day. ``That's people just trying to find something wrong
with someone who's been a success. You see that all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown's getting a dose of it now. We've heard the so-called
experts say he doesn't have a strong enough arm to succeed in the
NFL and that he's too slow. Yeah, right, and Doug Flutie's too
short.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, people picked apart the 1983 Heisman
runner-up, a left-handed quarterback like McNown who finished
behind Nebraska running back Mike Rozier in the balloting and then
bolted for the L.A. entry in the U.S. Football League. Seems to us
Steve Young has gone on to do pretty well for himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 Beban and linebacker Don Manning became the first Bruins
to be named consensus All-Americans in the same season. As so often
is the case on tight-knit teams, they would continue adding chains
to their link long after their college days were over.
</P>
<P>
   When Beban parted company with the Washington Redskins, he
sought out Manning, who was working for the C.B. Richard Ellis Co.
From that connection sprang a second career that has taken Beban
all the way to first string on C.B. Richard Ellis Co.'s management
team.
</P>
<P>
   In his role as the senior executive managing director of the
global corporate advisory group, Beban, 52, assists multinational
companies with commercial properties worldwide. Some 30 years after
he took his last snap, he continues to build relationships and draw
on his leadership skills and make quick reads on situations, just
not on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   For four years McNown has carried a football team on his
shoulders. The skills and strength he has picked up in the process
will serve him well regardless of what the Heisman voters and pro
scouts make of them.
</P>
<P>
   Beban, a three-year starter at UCLA during an era when freshmen
were ineligible, knew the writers who vote for the Heisman Trophy
and the scouts who report to NFL teams would be circling around
McNown this year like flies to fresh meat.
</P>
<P>
   So before the season began, Beban sat down and wrote McNown a
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspected he'd be involved with a season that had some
components of what I went through (in 1967),'' Beban said. ``I just
passed along some thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, 21, was blown away by the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered,'' he said. ``It meant a lot that a guy like
him would take the time to impart some type of wisdom and explain
his point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   All this time McNown has been meaning to express his
appreciation to Beban. On Saturday he'll finally get the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Beban has arranged to see the player before the awards ceremony
at the Downtown Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Some time during their conversation Beban plans to tell McNown
the same thing he told a reporter earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Namely that he knows his successor when he sees him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade McNown is the best quarterback that ever played at
UCLA,'' Beban said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from him, who are we to argue? &QL;
