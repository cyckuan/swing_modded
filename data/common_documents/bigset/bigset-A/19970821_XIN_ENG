<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Trade Dips in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's foreign trade volume
dipped about 1 percent in June to 33.7 billion U.S. dollars,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports dropped by 1.1 percent in June to 17.5 billion
dollars, after a 0.8 percent gain in May.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drop is the result of a decline in exports of
automotive products and machinery, which fell by 5.8 percent and
2.1 percent respectively, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Only the export of energy products posted a gain, climbing 3.0
percent, as the export of crude petroleum, natural gas and
electricity all went up.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports declined by 1 percent to 16.2 billion
dollars, following a hike in April and little change in May.
</P>
<P>
Most of the decline resulted from lower imports of machinery
and equipment, which dropped by 3.8 percent, and industrial goods,
which sank by 3.0 percent. Canada's import of these products had
been climbing steadily over the last year.
</P>
<P>
In June, Canada reaped a trade surplus of 1.3 billion dollars,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, the country's trade surplus
was at 9.7 billion dollars, compared with a record 15.5 billion
dollars for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the decline can be attributed to strong import growth
in business investment related goods and low growth in automotive
and energy products," the agency said.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumer Confidence at 10-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- UK's consumer confidence has
risen to its highest level in more than a decade, threatening a
rerun of the late-1980s boom, according to the European
Commission's monthly consumer survey.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence has risen steadily since the Labor came
to power in May and now equals the highest-ever level recorded in
June 1987, this month's survey suggests. August is normally a time
of relatively depressed economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The confidence has received a further boost from large windfall
payouts over the course of the last month or two. The latest
estimates suggest that consumers will receive windfall payouts
totaling about 56 billion US dollars by year-end.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the City expect that consumers' expenditure will
grow by about 4.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are showing uncanny parallels with their behaviors
during the "Lawson boom", said Ben Sanderson, an economist at
Nottingham Trent University.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of consumers believing now is a good time to
make big purchases rose to 40 percent in August, up a third over
the last three months. Only half as many think big purchases
should be postponed.
</P>
<P>
However, with base rates having risen by 1 percent since the
election, observers here believe that it will prevent a full-scale
overheating of overall consumer activity.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Progress in Georgia-Abkhazia Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the
"encouraging" progress being made by Georgia and Abkhazians in
their peace talks, in which both sides have agreed not to resort
to force in solving their dispute over the status of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
"If it appears that a number of questions, in particular that
of the status of Abkhazia, remains in suspense, the two parties
are engaged not to resort to force in whatever forms," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He praised the "political courage" shown by Georgian President
Edouard Shevardnadze in engaging in the dialogue with the
Abkhazians to end the five-year-old war in which thousands were
killed and 250,000 made homeless.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba signed
last Thursday a declaration of peace in Tbilisi, capital of
Georgia, under the mediation of Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said that the declaration "unblocks" the way
toward real reconciliation between Georgians and Abkhazians and
for the future return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
However, it failed to mention either the status of Abkhazia or
the destiny of an estimated 270,000 Georgian refugees who have
fled Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia declared independence in August 1990 after the
breaking out of ethnic violence between Georgians and Abkhazians.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has rejected the claim for independence by Abkhazians
and only agrees to grant the territory enlarged autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Extends Sympathy to People in Typhoon-stricken Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun, who
is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China, today extended his concern and
sympathy to people in the typhoon-stricken areas in east China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was on an inspection tour out of Beijing. He called
authorities in the area several times yesterday for updates on the
damage that occurred during the strong typhoon which swept over
six provinces and a municipality in east China on Monday.
</P>
<P>
As head of China's national anti-flood and drought control
headquarters, Jiang urged local people to work hard and
self-reliantly and required departments concerned to repair the
damaged facilities and to help people get their lives back in
order after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
A strong typhoon, accompanied with thunderstorms and tidal
waves, hit east China's Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Anhui, Shandong
provinces and Shanghai in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the timely warning about the typhoon, nicknamed
Winnie, the damage was greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
After the typhoon, rain fell in north China, easing the drought
in the region.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Falls Sharply in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
decreased sharply to 8.16 billion U.S. dollars in June, the lowest
level in three months, according to an official report from the
Department of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit came down as the U.S. exports climbed to an
all-time high and imports dropped for the first time in eight
months.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the overall deficit shrank by 14.5
percent to 8.16 billion. It was the lowest figure since March and
compared to a trade gap of 9.54 billion dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Mexico, which had climbed to record
levels, narrowed 29 percent to 1.2 billion dollars in June as
American exports hit an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. department's report, the deficit with
China was up 14.5 percent to 4.3 billion dollars, reflecting big
increases in imports of Chinese clothing, shoes and toys.
</P>
<P>
The trade gap with Japan rose by 11.6 percent to 4.1 billion
dollars in June as imports of Japanese office machines and cars
rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
Overall, U.S. exports of goods and services edged up 0.9
percent to a record high of 78.4 billion dollars. Imports, which
had set seven straight monthly records, dipped a slight 0.7
percent to 86.6 billion dollars. It was the first decline since
last October.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign oil imports declined by 4.5 percent in
June to 5.8 billion dollars. The volume of oil imports was down
slightly while the average price per barrel of crude oil was up
slightly to 17.07 dollars as against 17 dollars in May.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the better-than-expected performance in June, the
U.S. trade deficit for the first half of this year is running at
an annual rate of 111.1 billion dollars, placing the country on
track for its worst trade performance since 1988.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs Funds to Fight Locusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The capacity by the
International Red-Locust Control Organization for Central and
Southern Africa (IRLCO-CSA) to fight the looming locust plague
has been impaired by low stocks of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Zambia News Agency today quoted IRLCO-CSA Scientific Official
John Bahana as saying in northern Zambia on Tuesday that there is
a real danger of an invasion of locusts in the region and the
member countries of the organization should pay their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Bahana said the organization is prepared to fight the invasion
but needs funds to procure pesticides.
</P>
<P>
While aircraft for the task are available, stocks of
pesticides for daily operations can only last one month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem faced by the organization is failure by the
member countries to pay their contributions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bahana said operations have been carried out in Malawi and
Botswana recently and a team is currently in Tanzania carrying
out a similar task after winds from an outbreak area blew the
pests to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The swarms could have easily entered Zambia if it blew the
locusts southwards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The member countries of the organization are Tanzania, Kenya,
Uganda, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and
Botswana.

<HEADLINE> More Contraceptives to be Provided in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The government is making
efforts to operate clinics at villages and provide contraceptives
as more as possible to check the growing population, Nepali Health
Minister Radha Krishna Mainali said today.
</P>
<P>
The target has been set to reduce the fertility rate to four
percent from 4.6 percent by 2000 in accordance with the national
health policy, Mainali said when answering queries at the Upper
House.
</P>
<P>
The population of Nepal, which stands at 21 million, is now
growing at an alarming rate of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said those using contraceptives now number 295,000 and 35
percent of the newly married couples are using them, reported the
official RSS news agency.
</P>
<P>
Though the availability of doctors is only 60 percent in the
country, the policy to send doctors to posts outside the Kathmandu
Valley will be pursued seriously, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of doctors and facilities, dozens of patients have
died of gastroenteritis, cholera, diarrhea, measles, rabies and
snake bites throughout the country, especially in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Banks Lose $12m to Swindler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A man masquerading as a
reputable businessman owning more than 20 firms has fled Kenya
after defrauding seven Kenyan commercial banks of over 800
million Shillings (some 12 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Asian-origin man, identified as Satish Naker, stole the
money between January and July by kiting checks between the banks
and by obtaining loans through his companies that he has left
unpaid, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Naker is said to own Naker Printers and Packaging of Thika,
among other companies.
</P>
<P>
He used his charm to convince the banks to pay him large sums
in advance against the strength of checks from other banks.
</P>
<P>
"The affected banks relaxed their conditions because they
trusted him... and he appeared wealthy," said a banking source.
</P>
<P>
However, another banking source said Naker was not working
alone and there might be some insiders who helped in the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
Three senior officials from Standard Chartered Bank, the
hardest hit, had been arrested by Tuesday when a series of theft
charges were filed against Naker in a Nairobi court.
</P>
<P>
But as soon as the massive fraud came to light, Naker went
underground and is likely to be on the run in an Asian country,
according to a source from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
So far the investigation is continuing and the Interpol is
expected to be requested for assistance to have Naker tracked
down and extradited back to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Naker's victims also include Barclays Bank, First National
Finance Bank, Guardian Bank, Euro Bank, Guilders International
Bank and the Trust Bank, all based in Nairobi or the nearby Thika
town.
</P>
<P>
Most of the banks reportedly have a serious liquidity crisis,
prompting CBK's intervention.
</P>
<P>
The CBK source said his bank is holding discussions with the
affected banks so as to ensure that adequate financial measures
are being made to cover their losses and protect depositors.
</P>
<P>
Kiting is the act of issuing checks against companies said to
be owned by one person or group when they know they have no
money. They then wait for the clearance of one check and bring
more, posing the impression of having a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
Naker's case came only several months after a business tycoon
identified only as Shah defrauded more than 14 banks and several
major corporations of two billion Shillings (some 36 million
Dollars then) before fleeing this east African country.

<HEADLINE> "Distance Education" Popular in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- "Distance education", a new way
to offer people higher education outside universities, are
getting very popular in Zimbabwe, an official said today.
</P>
<P>
Program coordinator Stanley Tichaponda said they have received
more than 6,000 applicants since July, and that most of the
applicants show a great interest in the recently introduced
degrees in English, communication and agriculture, and a diploma
in classroom text and discourse.
</P>
<P>
"The response has been overwhelming and we do not even know
how we are going to respond to the applicants," he said.
</P>
<P>
The concept of distance learning was introduced in 1993 after
the government realized that there was great demand for higher
education which the country's limited number of universities
could not satisfy.
</P>
<P>
The applicants, Tichaponda said, were from various sectors
including journalists, teachers and customs and excise officials
and school leavers.
</P>
<P>
Although it was initially agreed that all applicants would be
accommodated, he said, the overwhelming response could result in
the college being forced to limit its intake.
</P>
<P>
The courses of distance education will start next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bloody Violence Continues Shaking Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Week-long bloody violence
around Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city and key Indian Ocean
port, has so far claimed 39 lives and dozens of injured. This has
deeply shaken the country facing a general election this year.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, no one knows actually the identity of the armed
killers, whose number can only be vaguely estimated to range from
200 to 500, needless to say their motives.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police have arrested nearly 200 people over the killing
on the coast, including more than 30 ex-servicemen and an alleged
key activist with the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU)
party, a local report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The self-styled Chairman of Coast Youth for KANU, Omar
Masumbuko, was reportedly arrested at Mombasa this morning and
he now is being questioned by the police.
</P>
<P>
KANU Secretary-General J. Kamotho denied strongly Tuesday any
involvement of KANU in the orgy of bloodshed, while calling on
the law enforcement agencies to "do everything possible to
restore peace and transquility in the area."
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting efforts by Kenyan police and paramilitary
troops to restore peace, the terror has even spread to the
tourist resort Malindi, 120 kilometers north of Mombasa, where
two people were killed and 375 curio stalls burned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Mombasa, four people died in bloodshed early Tuesday and
two churches were burnt to ashes on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
No tourists have been hurt but foreigners have been told by
their governments to avoid trouble spots and the United States
has warned its citizens against going to the Kenyan coast.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of foreign tourists have reportedly
canceled their booking in hotels in Mombasa and Malindi due to
the violence, said local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Seven police officers and eight civilians including five
attackers were killed at Likoni, south of Mombasa last Wednesday,
sparking a new wave of disturbance in Kenya which has experienced
several rounds of unrest since May.

<HEADLINE> Intra-COMESA Trade Shoots Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Intra-Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) trade had grown from 9.59 billion
Zimbabwe Dollars in 1985 to 27.6 billion in 1994, acting
Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said today.
</P>
<P>
Currently one U.S. Dollar equals to 11.5 Zimbabwe Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference Mwencha said this had been a
result of a tariff reduction coupled with the removal of
non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
"This translates into an average annual trade growth rate of
11.1 percent, compared with an average annual trade growth of 6.5
percent between COMESA and non-COMESA countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Zimbabwe, he said, intra-COMESA trade currently stood at
4.4 Billion Zimbabwe Dollars while Zimbabwean exports accounted
for 32 percent of total intra-COMESA imports.
</P>
<P>
COMESA was poised to establish a Free Trade Area (FTA) by the
year 2000 given the fact that Zimbabwe, Comoros, Sudan and Uganda
had reduced their tariff rates by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, Kenya, Malawi and Mauritius had reduced their tariff
rates by 70 percent, and would be effecting the 80 percent
reduction rate in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, Rwanda and Zambia had reduced their tariff rates by
60 percent, while Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland had not reduced
tariffs because they still enjoyed derogation and, subject to
agreement, expected to implement the COMESA tariffs after the
expiry of the derogation.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 would see the COMESA single market, with a
combined gross domestic product of 1.38 trillion Zimbabwe Dollars
and a total population of 320 million.

<HEADLINE> Russian Trader Does Well out of Arms Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Rosvooruzheniye, Russia's state
arms trading company, may earn more than 10 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of the year, the company's director-general Alexander
Kotelkin said at a press conference in the town of Zhukovsky
outside Moscow, where the MAKS-97 air show is being held.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax quoted Kotelkin as saying that the package of
orders amounted to 7 billion U.S. dollars as of August 1, while
his company had already received 3,000 orders.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is planning to sign contracts worth 3-3.5
billion U.S. dollars before the end of the year. Contracts on
ships and naval equipment supplies worth 2.8 billion U.S. dollars
are expected to be signed within the next two months, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the high-ranking official, China is the second
largest buyer, after India, of Russia's aircraft. It has bought 50
Su-27SK fighters from Russia since 1992.
</P>
<P>
China has also paid Russia 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to buy a
license to manufacture 200 SU-27SK fighters within 15 years without
the right to re-export them, Kotelkin said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that China is now considering purchasing 55 more
SU-27SK fighters from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kotelkin also called a contract with Malaysia to sell it 18
MiG-29 planes worth 560 million U.S. dollars as a "breakthrough of
Russian weapons and military equipment to Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
Six SU-27 fighters worth 180 million U.S. dollars have been
sold to Vietnam which plans to buy 24 more planes to a total amount
of about 800 million U.S. dollars, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Kotelkin stressed that the Philippines and Thailand have also
shown keen interest in buying Russian MiG-29s.
</P>
<P>
It was said Rosvooruzheniye is trying to establish contacts
with Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian government has announced its decision
to buy 12 SU-30K fighters and eight MI-17-1B helicopters.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, in 1994-1996, Russia sold Colombia and
Peru 10 MI-17 helicopters and eight MI-24 helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Two Aid Workers Killed in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Somali aid workers were
shot dead in the Southern port of Kismayu, 500 km south of
Mogadishu today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports obtained through the VHF radios in the
town, the Somali aid workers were serving the International Aid
Agency, World Concern, which is one of the few agencies opening
in the town.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that one of the victims is Saa'id Omar who
has been a nurse in the outdoor clinic of the agency, while the
other is his nephew, Abdi Shukri, serving as a security man.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen have attacked the two while they were doing their
routine business.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack is reported to be a retaliatory
action by the Majerten clansmen following the killing of three of
their men in a car looting attempt by Marehan militiamen outside
Kismayu last week.
</P>
<P>
Both victims belong to the Marehan clan whose militiamen were
ousted from the town during the height of the fighting in and
around it little more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Omar and his nephew were among few individuals who
remained in Kismayu despite the dislodging of their clansmen to
continue their jobs for World Concern.
</P>
<P>
This killing today might jeopardize a low-level reconciliatory
meeting between the elders of the two clans in the region.
</P>
<P>
It may also threaten the operations of the international
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The town has been quiet since late June even though there has
been no official cease-fire and agreements between the two clans
who bitterly misunderstood over the control of the key
installations of the town, the air and seaport.
</P>
<P>
Kismayu is controlled by the son-in-law of Somalia's late
dictator, General Mohamed Said Hirsi Morgan who only two weeks
ago returned.
</P>
<P>
Morgan who himself belongs to the Majertem clan has been
abroad during the fighting with the Marehan clansmen who are now
allied with South Mogadishu faction leader, Hussein Mohamed
Aidid.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blames Turkish Cypriot Side for Talks' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia has blamed the Turkish
Cypriot side for the failure of the second round of direct talks
between the two communities on the island, Cyprus News Agency
(CNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for the failure in the international peace
efforts "weighs on the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot
community," CNA quoted a spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry
as saying in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the Turkish Cypriot side should also
be blamed for blocking a successful conclusion to the second round
of direct talks which took place last week in Glion, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
He described the stance of the Turkish Cypriot community's
leadership in Glion as "clearly obstructionist."
</P>
<P>
He said that the threats made by the Turkish side at the talks
to partially integrate the Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus to
Turkey if the European Union starts accession negotiations with
Cyprus early next year are "undoubtedly contrary to the U.N.'s and
the Security Council's stated positions."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry official pointed out that these
kinds of threats are contrary to the 1977-1979 High Level
agreements reached between the two communities.
</P>
<P>
They are also contrary to the U.N. General Assembly resolutions
which repeatedly call on all nations to respect the island's
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman welcomed the readiness expressed by both
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to continue their meeting in Nicosia to discuss
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had two meetings last month in Nicosia,
following the first round of direct talks held in Troutbeck,
near New York on July 9-12.
</P>
<P>
The meetings ended with an agreement on humanitarian issues
including solving the long-standing issue of missing persons
during the event of Turkish military intervention in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since the 1974 Turkish military
intervention in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Great Wall Helps Cement Friendship between Youths of China, Japan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Developing the Sino-Japanese
friendly relationship of the 21st century is just like walking
uphill on the Great Wall, Japanese trade union leader Yasuo
Enomoto said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are climbing to a greater height with each step and seeing
young people following in our footsteps," he said.
</P>
<P>
Enomoto, vice-president of the All-Japan Prefectural and
Municipal Workers Union, is one of the 300-plus Japanese trade
union members among 600 guests attending a celebration to mark the
25th anniversary of the normalization of relations between China
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The event was held today at the Badaling section of the Great
Wall north of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, at the age of 26, Enomoto visited the Great
Wall as a member of a Japanese youth delegation to China.
</P>
<P>
"We had to overcome enormous obstacles to come to China,
because Japan and China had not normalized relations with each
other at that time," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Now, numerous Japanese young people of the age I was at the
time scale the Great Wall. The current friendly relationship
between the two countries was painstakingly won. So it should be
treasured," he said.
</P>
<P>
For many Japanese and Chinese people, the Great Wall is a
special place where they can go to reflect on the past.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall witnessed the first battles of the War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression in the 1930s. Four decades
later, it greeted the footsteps of Kakuei Tanaka, the late
Japanese Prime Minister who worked with the later Chinese leader
Mao Zedong to realize the normalization of bilateral relations in
1972. In the past 25 years, many noted personalities from Japan,
such as Emperor Akihito, visited the Great Wall.

<P>
Twenty-five-year-old Kyoko Katashiba said today her first trip
to China has left her a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Wall is so great. It is an embodiment of the Chinese
culture. It is like a tie of friendship that closely joins the
youths of the two countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
Touching the weathered wall, high school teacher Hiromi
Yamashita said he will tell his students the truth about what
happened between Japan and China in the past in order to make them
always remember the history.
</P>
<P>
"For many young Japanese, knowing about the Great Wall is the
starting point of knowing China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't send our children to the battlegrounds any more,"
said Yishii Ryoichi, president of the Teachers Trade Union of
Hyogo-ken of Japan.
</P>
<P>
This was his 16th visit to the Great Wall. When he was a
primary school student at the end of the war, his school building
was bombed. Now in his 60s, he believes such tragedy should never
happen again.
</P>
<P>
Ryoichi has led the trade union to compile a textbook for
Japanese school children to gain an accurate understanding of
Japan's aggression against China in history.
</P>
<P>
Though 71-year-old Japanese professor Akio Sugiyama was walking
some distance behind the young climbers, he said he still hopes
"the young people will pass me. They are younger and they should
do better than us."
</P>
<P>
Seeing the young people racing to the top of a hill, Daisaku
Kohchiyama, vice-president of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation, said the younger generation should take the
responsibility to further nurture the good-neighborly relationship
between Japan and China, which was forged by the older generations.
</P>
<P>
To bring up young people to be able to carry on the Japan-China
friendship is at the top of the agenda of trade unions of both
sides, Kohchiyama said. Large-scale exchanges between young people
will strongly push forward bilateral ties with an eye to the 21st
century.

journey. He grasped the hand of the Japanese young man who arrived
second and they congratulated each other.
</P>
<P>
Both said they regard the climbing of this "amazing" ancient
site as a good opportunity to deepen understanding, further
friendship and strengthen mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the willingness to work together for a
harmonious future where the two neighboring peoples live in peace.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Wall, Erido Godo exchanged addresses with
the Chinese young people.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make concrete efforts for the friendship
between the Japanese and Chinese youth," the young woman from
north Japan's Hokkaido said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese youth need to know more about China's culture,
history and present situation, she said, adding that she would
share the friendliness of the Chinese youth with her family and
friends.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Approves President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament dominated by
the conservatives approved today all of the 22-ministers proposed
by liberal President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The vote in favor of Khatami's cabinet showed the power and
influence that the 54-year-old president has gained from the 62
million populated nation since his inauguration on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Kharrazi became the foreign minister, Ali Shamkhani the
defense minister, and Hossein Namazi the economic minister.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has an average age o 46.7 and it is well-educated
six PhDs, three of them U.S.-educated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier parliamentary sources had predicted that five of
Khatami's ministers, namely ministers of education, interior,
culture, housing and urban development would not receive the
required vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the vote of confidence signaled the
beginning of a honeymoon between the leftist-dominated cabinet and
the rightist-dominated Parliament known as Islamic Consultative
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani,
a liberal who has vowed to transform the ministry, received the
lowest votes of confidence today as only 144 out of 266 members
of parliament voted in his favor.
</P>
<P>
In order to secure vote of confidence for all his proposed
ministers, Khatami made two speeches Tuesday morning and this
afternoon, defending his proposed cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
He said that his nominees were "effective administrators" and
none of them went against the views of Khamenei, Iran's supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated his pledge to the nation: "I will keep my
election promises: Respect for the law and the rule of the law,
freedom of expression, a public voice in national affairs, and
national independence."
</P>
<P>
In a move warmly welcomed by the public this week, every
proposed minister outlined in detail the programs he will
implement in office, and biographies were released to newspapers
all over Iran.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Warring Sides of Congo Republic to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- France today called on the two
warring sides of the Congo Republic to stop fighting, as combat
intensified between the troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba
and the Cobra militiamen supporting former president General Denis
Sassou Nguesso.
</P>
<P>
"There is an absolute emergency for a stop of the combat,"
said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Brazzaville said that forces supporting Lissouba
have carried a major victory by capturing several districts of in
the central and northern parts of the capital from the militiamen
supporting Sassou Nguesso early this week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also called on the two warring sides to "re-take
their discussions to lead to as quickly as possible an accord
allowing the deployment of a peace-keeping force by the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has confirmed
that the forces of Lissouba have also captured Ouesso, the largest
city in the northern part of Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
France, which has scrapped its traditional interventionist
policy toward Africa, is keeping a distance from the war in Congo
Republic, although it has key strategic interests in the oil
resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
The mediation offered by Gabonese President Omar Bongo and
United Nations envoy Mohamed Sahnoun has so far failed to bring
about any results, while President Laurent-Desire Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of Congo has offered to intervene in the
conflict.

<HEADLINE> German Finance Minister Denies to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has rejected the speculations that he may give up his post after
the general elections in September next year, his aides said
today.
</P>
<P>
Waigel had never said how long he would remain as finance
minister, said a spokeswoman of the Finance Ministry on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Waigel is fulfilling his mandate. What will happen afterwards
depends on what the voters decide," the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Waigel's party, the Christian Social Union
(CSU), today also said that Waigel had not set the election day as
deadline for his minister term. "It does not make sense to
speculate about it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The speculations about Waigel's quit was sparked by himself
during an interview with the German Bayerische Rundfunk radio on
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Nine or ten years as finance minister are enough....This is
more than could have been expected from me. I've done my duty and
I'm still doing it. But then it will be enough," Waigel was quoted
as saying in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, 58, has been finance minister in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's center-right government since April 1989. He has come under
sharp criticism recently for his hardline management of the
government budget and the proposed tax reform as Germany is
struggling to reduce record high unemployment and to make the
grade to join the planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also triggered off controversies recently for his
suggestion of a cabinet reshuffle before the general election next
year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Waigel's unexpected remarks at Tuesday's
interview, Rudolf Scharping, parliamentary leader of the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), said that it was a
"recognition of defeat" by Waigel.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and another opposition party, the Greens, also called
for early election in order to end a government "drama".

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Junta Clamps Curfew in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The military Junta in Sierra
Leone has ordered a curfew from 10:00 P.M. till 6:00 A.M. in an
attempt to improve the security situation in the capital
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The state radio, which announced the curfew Tuesday night, also
said the military government would take a number of touch
measures to crack down on possible trouble makers, with the
possibility of offenders to be shot on site.
</P>
<P>
The offenders include those who are caught harassing people
going about their businesses. The use of family personnel by
civilians wishing to settle personal scores is also prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, civilians caught in security fatigues will be dealt
with according to law, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
A public relations officer of the Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC), the current highest governing body in Sierra
Leone, was quoted as saying that the curfew was imposed to bring
back facility to the business community and allow people to go
about their routine.
</P>
<P>
a source in the defense ministry confirmed that the new orders
are meant to stop the activities of people who have been causing
discomfort to civilians and opposing AFRC functionaries.
</P>
<P>
The tough moves were announced in the wake of a banned "March
for Democracy" called by the National Union of Sierra Leone
students to protest the May 25 coup in which the military seized
power.
</P>
<P>
A student was killed and 35 others were arrested by heavily
armed security forces during Monday's demonstration.

The curfew, the first since a similar brief restriction

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges U.S. to Address Comprehensive Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today urged the U.S. to address the larger political
aspects of the Mideast peace process rather than be confined to
the Israeli security concern.
</P>
<P>
"Time is now ripe for resuming the political issues of the
peace march," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
If U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross stated that he
succeeded in resuming Palestinian-Israeli security coordination,
"the coming step is to address the political aspect of the problem
namely the implementation of the Oslo agreements in order to
maintain the peace march," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Washington's ideas should include halting the
"unilateral measures" such as the settlement activities,
implementing the signed agreements regarding the redeployment of
troops from occupied territories and the immediate resumption of
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross' latest tour to the region to restart the peace talks
early this month was focused on Israel's security concerns, also
in preparation for a mission to the region by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in September.
</P>
<P>
Albright, in a speech launching the new U.S. initiative on
August 12, said her mission would focus on the thorny political
issues of the peace process, including the Jewish settlement
question and the final status of the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted the Palestinian National Authority root out
the extremists and arrest some 200 wanted Islamic activists as a
condition for resuming the peace process and lifting sanctions
imposed on Palestinian areas after the July 30 Jerusalem bombings
which killed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA in its part insisted that full security cooperation
can only resume when Israeli lifts the sanctions and implements
signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister also condemned the Israeli attacks in the
southern Lebanese port city of Saida on Monday, that killed nine
civilians and wounded 43 others, in the bloodiest attacks since
the end of a major Israeli offensive in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon and its southern part in particular are threatened to
be occupied by Israel," Moussa warned, reiterating Egypt's
denunciation of the Israeli presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 Israeli troops, supported by its ally South
Lebanese Army (SLA), have held a border occupation in a
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon since 1985, in
defiance of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army spokesman denied Israeli troops were behind the
attacks, which violated an April 1996 cease-fire accord that bans
combatants from targeting civilians or launching attacks from
civilian areas. The SLA was reportedly responsible for the
Monday attacks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Losses 12 Million Tons of Harvested Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia has been losing grain
harvest with losses caused by fractured grain estimated at 12
million tons, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Agriculture Ministry said one of the reasons for
grain losses is the shortage of agricultural machinery. At least
136,000 combine harvesters are needed to complete harvesting
campaign on time and with minimal losses.
</P>
<P>
However, many of the combine harvesters available today are
overused, and insufficient financing of rural areas causes
problems both in overhaul of agricultural machinery and the
shortage of new combine harvesters with only 3,000 new pieces of
agricultural machinery bought this year.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that in many areas which have no oil
processing enterprises agricultural machinery stands idle because
of the absence of gasoline and diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun,
several rail oil tanks which were prepared to be exported had to
be returned to Russia. But it is not immediately clear whether
this fuel has actually reached rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign entrepreneurs seek to take advantage
of this situation as well.
</P>
<P>
Turkish businessmen offer their own combine harvesters and
fuel. The main rice-cultivating area in the Kuban region,
Krasnoarmeisky, ordered 40 combine harvesters to be provided by
Turkish businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In Siberia heavy rains and strong winds which swept the
territory of the Sverdlovsk region in August. Grain has been
actually harvested on 3,000 out of 597,000 hectares because there
are only 22 combine harvesters provided with a stem-raising
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Last year, five million tons of grain were left unharvested
because of a spell of cold weather.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Rejects Expansion of War in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy today rejected a hawkish idea to expand aggression in south
Lebanon, according to a report of the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Levy explained that it was not the time
for everyone to raise the ideas that could only mean continuing
the flare-up.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who was regarded as a dove in the hardline Likud-led
coalition, was apparently referring to an idea raised by his
cabinet colleague Science Minister Michael Eitan to expand the
Israeli self-styled "Security Zone", which covers about 1,000
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Eitan argued that a wider "Security Zone" would distance
Hezbollah and its Katyusha rockets from the Israeli border. The
"Security Zone" was set up in January 1985.
</P>
<P>
Levy declared that the current government's policy is not to
push the war beyond the "Security Zone." He added that Israel does
not want a further deterioration, but is doing everything possible
to calm down the situation in the north.
</P>
<P>
Levy's stand was nodded by unidentified defense sources, said
the report. They argued that an exlargement of the war would not
prevent Katyushas from reaching Israel, as they know that the
Lebanese guerrilla group would obtain new Katyushas with a greater
range of 40 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
To expand the "Security Zone" would lead to a confrontation
with Syria, and U.S. and international condemnation, said the
defense sources.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 Katyushas were reportedly fired by Hezbollah
Tuesday. Some 45 landed inside Israel, most in open
fields. However, despite the heavy attack, injuries and damage
were light.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
attack, saying that it was in response to the shelling by the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army of Sidon Monday, which killed at
least six civilians and wounded 35 others.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Breakdowns Hamper Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The delays of the peace process
in Angola will hamper the program to settle the 500,000 war
refugees scheduled to finish by the end of the year, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Alboino Malungo, Minister for Assistance and Social
Reinsertion made the remark when meeting with Joao Medina, the
visiting Cape Verde Minister for Health, Labor and Social
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Malungo said that the continuous break-downs of the peace
process in Angola have given rise to distrust among the different
factions in the country, and thus make the planned settlement of
500,000 refugees difficult to materialize.
</P>
<P>
He said only about 250,000 refugees have been resettled so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 million refugees are in very bad conditions and the
refugee camps are often attacked and robbed by criminals, he
said, adding that many of the refugees have fled their camps.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Minister Medina said that Cape Verde and Angola
enjoy traditional ties of friendly cooperation and shall further
strengthen their relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries, facing different problems,
should help each other and learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Verde minister had come here for a week-long visit.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Refuses to Arrest Former Rwandese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government
has said it cannot yet arrest a former Rawandese minister Andre
Rwamakuba who is wanted back home to answer charges of the 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Broadcasting Association today quoted a
Namibian official statement as saying that Rwamakuba is a free
man who is entitled to work in Namibia until the United Nations
International War Tribunal on Rwanda requests his arrest.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Rwamakuba is protected under Namibian
constitution, which states a person is innocent until found
guilty by a court of law.
</P>
<P>
Rwamakuba was arrested by the Namibian authorities in 1995.
But he was later released on the instruction of the international
tribunal on Rwanda due to lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese government officially approached Namibian
President Sam Nujoma's administration on Monday to have the
former minister extradited.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese government accused Rwamakuba of helping to incite
the 1994 ethnic violence which led to the death of at least one
million people, mostly the Tutsi minority by the Hutu majority.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Namibia reportedly have agreed during talks in
Windhoek to hand over Rwamakuba to the international tribunal if
it asks for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Rwanda have no extradition treaty between them.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Leader Confirms Having Sent Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Israel's opposition
Labor Party Ehud Barak today confirmed here that he had sent a
letter to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad via an Arab Israeli
parliament deputy who visited Damascus last week, reported Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine,
Barak said that he asked Assad to "do all he can so that the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations can resume in the interests of the two
peoples," according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said in the letter that "an exchange of messages is
better than an exchange of threats" between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Israeli Labor deputy Saleh Tarif, who made a visit to
Syria last week, said that Barak had told Assad that Syria can
make peace with Israel if the Labor Party returns to power,
because the latter will observe the commitments made by former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Barak was on a "half-private visit" in France, during which
he had a meeting with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting with Barak, the French Socialist Party
officials expressed their worry over the "continuous degradation
of the situation in the Middle East," said AFP.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Barak said that he thinks an eventual withdrawal
of Israeli troops from Golan Heights depends on "the depth,
quality and nature" of peace to be realized between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu places the
unilateral security considerations of Israel above any withdrawal
of Israeli troops from Golan Heights.

JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Archives, which were
brought to South Africa after Namibian independence in 1990, are
to be returned to Namibia, South African Arts and Culture
Minister Lionel Mtshali said today.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet had approved the return of the
archives relating to Namibia, Mtshali said.
</P>
<P>
The archives to be returned deal with the security management
system developed for the then South West Africa by the South
African government.
</P>
<P>
Some of the records are of a routine and administrative
nature, while others deal with South African cabinet memoranda,
proceedings of the Cabinet Committee on Constitutional Reform,
South African internal politics and security, and South African
international relations, Mtshali said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from professional considerations of archival integrity,
the motivations of confidentiality was no longer a valid
justification for keeping the records in South Africa, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Urges UN to Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has urged the U.N. Security Council to take action if the
Turkish side continues to be intransigent on Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a cabinet meeting today, Clerides said "no
progress on the Cyprus issue can be achieved if the Security
Council does not decide its stance, should Turkish intransigence
continue."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that both Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash and Ankara are intransigent in their positions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that the U.S. and Britain refrained
from blaming the Turkish side for the deadlock in the Cyprus
peace talks, the president said that both countries "want the
negotiating process to continue and avoid anything that may
create a problem."
</P>
<P>
However, Clerides called on the U.S. and Britain to "call a
spade a spade" and present a true picture of what has happened
during the past two rounds of U.N.-led talks.
</P>
<P>
"They are being misled if they believe they can bring Denktash
back to the negotiating table by avoiding to present a clear
picture," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
The second round of direct talks between Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides which were held in Glion, Switzerland, ended in
deadlock last Friday, because Denktash insisted the European Union
(EU) postpone or reverse its decision to begin accession talks
with Cyprus scheduled in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader accused the EU of "throwing a
bombshell" in the Cyprus peace process and threatened that he
would not attend any further talks if the EU report "Agenda 2000"
is ratified in December.
</P>
<P>
The report reaffirmed an EU Council decision in March 1995, to
begin membership talks with Cyprus six months after the conclusion
of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges EU to Reconsider Its Cyprus Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today urged the European
Union (EU) to reconsider its accession talks with the Cypriot
government, stressing that it has an important bearing on the
settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli reiterated that Turkey's stance
on the Cyprus problem has remained unchanged, adding that it
is the EU itself should reconsider its Cyprus policy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the second round of Cyprus peace talks which
ended in Switzerland last weekend, Atacanli quoted Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash as saying that no process would be made
unless the EU dropped its plan of membership negotiations with
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations-sponsored talks collapsed as Denktash and
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides failed to make any concessions
on some key issues.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has planned to start accession talks
with Cyprus early next year, triggering strong opposition from
both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"In such an environment, there is no reason to wait for any
other concrete development," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Turkey itself, which has made efforts for years for full EU
membership, was greatly angered by a European Commission report
which includes Cyprus into the ranks of prospective candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
eastern Mediterranean island in the wake of an abortive coup
seeking for union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Both Greece and Turkey station thousands of troops on the
divided island to respectively protect Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N and international community have been trying for
decades to reunited this divided nation through peaceful
dialogues, but no tangible results have been achieved so far.

<HEADLINE> Iran Has New Liberal Cultural Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ataollah Mohajerani, the most
outspoken liberal member of the proposed cabinet of Iran's
President Mohammad Khatami, won vote of confidence from a
conservative-dominated Parliament today.
</P>
<P>
The Khatami-proposed minister of culture and Islamic guidance
received 144 votes from 266 members of the Parliament, who
listened for 16 hours to arguments by liberals and conservatives
for and against Khatami's choice for the custodian of Iran's
cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (MCIG) is one of
the most sensitive and important department which has been long
directly controlled by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Now, this ministry has turned from hardliners' hands to hands
of the liberal camp headed by moderate ex-president Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani, who addressed the parliament for 48 minutes,
defended his liberal viewpoints and his record in Iranian
journalism which includes writing articles in liberal daily
Ettela'at in defense of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to completely transform MCIG if elected and attacked
the conservative policies of the former MCIG minister Mostafa
Mirsalim.
</P>
<P>
"I am opposed to almost all of the prevalent methods in MCIG
and present managers will have to adjust themselves (if I am
elected)," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his concluding remark to the Parliament, Khatami fully
backed Mohajerani, calling him one of the "greatest assets" of the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Khatami asserted that the liberal views of his proposed MCIG
minister were exactly what people voted for when they chose him
Iran's president on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president himself served as the MCIG minister
between 1980 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ataollah Mohajerani was born in 1954 in Arak, some 288
kilometers south of the capital city of Tehran. He received PhD
from Teacher's Training University in Tehran and is well-versed in
English, Arabic and Urdu.
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1985, he served as Iran's Cultural Attache to
Pakistan. Between 1985 and 1989, he served as Deputy Premier for
Parliamentary and Legal Affairs. From 1989 up to now he has been
Vice-President for Parliamentary and Legal Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is married to a feminist journalist Jamileh
Kadivar who ran for Parliament from her hometown of Shiraz in
1995 but failed to get elected.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Raid Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes today raided at
least three areas in Lebanon in a bid to warn the Lebanese
government to curb Hezbollah's military activity againist Israel,
the Lebanese Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli warplanes blasted a Hezbollah's training base in
the east sector of Lebanon's eastern Bekka Valley at 10:30 am
(7:30 GMT), injuring two children.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, Israeli fighter jets fired air-to-surface
missiles at the village of Toufahtr near Saida, about 40
kilometers south of the capital city of Beirut. The missiles
landed at a garden near an outpost of Lebanese army without
causing any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops launched the third air raid at 11:30 am (8:30
GMT), destroying an electric pole in the Huroup area near Saida,
cutting off the electric supply for several villages nearby.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli army said that the Lebanese
government should take measures to curb the military activities of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, especially the firing of Katyusha
rockets at Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese media said that the Israeli air raid today was
apparently a reaction to the Katyusha rockets fired by Hezbollah
Tuesday at northern Israeli panhandle of Galilee, causing two
injuries and some damage.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah's attack was a response to the shelling by the
South Lebanese Army, Israeli militia ally, on Lebanese port city
of Saida which killed nine people and wounded 43 others on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> US Asks Syria to Exert Influence on Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has asked Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara to try to rein in Lebanon-based Hezbollah guerrillas, and
Shara has promised Syria would do its best to stop the violence
escalating, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"She made clear to him the importance of maximum restraint
being used by all the parties in the field. We have discussed
these matters with the Syrians and Lebanese in the past and regard
them as the right parties to try to influence Hezbollah,"
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
During pre-dawn hours Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai awakened Albright and delivered the stark message,
saying "in no uncertain terms" that Israel would retaliate
"massively" if Hezbollah guerrillas launched another barrage of
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Israel was prepared to launch a bombing campaign
throughout Lebanon and possibly Syria if the Katyusha rocket
attacks continued.
</P>
<P>
Albright immediately telephoned Syrian Foreign Minister Shara,
asking Damascus to intervene in the mushrooming crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, "We understood from that conversation that the
Syrian government was going to do all they could to ensure that
the April 1996 understanding was lived up to and a cycle of
violence was not escalated."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding banned attacks on civilians but
did not exclude Hezbollah attacking Israeli forces and their
Lebanese allies inside Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
Today, Israel's air force launched its biggest attack into
Lebanon for 16 months in retaliation for a Hezbollah rocket attack
on the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the right forum for stopping the violence was an
international monitoring group of Lebanese, Israeli, Syrian, U.S.
and French officials.
</P>
<P>
The group is expected to meet in Naqura on the Israeli-Lebanese
border later today to discuss complaints from both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up after an Israeli offensive in south
Lebanon killed 200 people, mostly civilians, in 1996. It examines
alleged attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this cycle of violence will not be extended. The
parties did restate that they would uphold the 1996 understanding
and that is what we are going to be talking about (in Naqura),"
Rubin said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan strongly urged all parties involved in the northwest of
Cambodia to end their hostilities and desist from all actions that
would cause a further deterioration of the situation, a UN
spokesman said here today.
</P>

Brandt Juan Carlos, associate spokesman for the

Annan expressed his sympathy for the plight of some 20,000
Cambodians who had been driven from their homes by the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Most People in China's Tibet to Shake Off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Tibetan
Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries Tenzin
said today that an overwhelming majority of the people in China's
autonomous region of Tibet will get rid of poverty and live a
better-off life by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tenzin, also director of the Chinese Tibetan Song and Dance
Ensemble, was speaking at an informal discussion on Tibet in the
Swiss capital of Bern. Present at the discussion were Chinese
Ambassador to Switzerland Zhou Zizhong, Swiss government
officials, Swiss parliament members, and those interested in
Tibet. The ensemble is in Switzerland to attend the week-long
International Rencounter of Folklore, which began Tuesday in
Fribourg.
</P>
<P>
Tenzin stressed that Tibet has been an integral part of the
Chinese territory since the 12th century. "Under the 46-year rule
of the People's Republic of China, especially since China started
in 1979 to implement the open-door policy architected by its late
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, Tibet, like other provinces in China,
has made a lot of progress and achievements in developing economy,
improving people's living standard, and protecting Tibet's
traditional culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the full development in Tibet, the central
government has provided it with a series of preferential policies
in politics, economy, education and so on," Tenzin said. "Since
the end of 1994, the central government and local governments of
other parts of China have supported Tibet in 62 projects with a
total investment of more than 3.67 billion yuan (about 440 million
U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
In such a pace, Tenzin said, most people in the Tibet
autonomous region will shake off poverty and enjoy a more
comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping freedom of religious beliefs is the consistent policy
of the Chinese government, and normal religious activities are
protected by law," Tenzin told those at the discussion. There are
more than 1,700 temples in Tibet and more than 40,000 monks and
nuns staying in the temples, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Tibetan culture is part of the splendid culture in the
whole of China," he said. "To respect, inherit and develop it is
always the policy being carried out by the central government. All
languages within China are equal, and Tibetan has been widely
taught and better developed."
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned hard facts, Tenzin said, are strong enough
to reveal the true nature of the rumors about Tibet spread by
certain Western politicians and media, who have been plotting to
separate Tibet from China for centuries.

LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- All three major stock markets in
Europe continued to recover from recent market jitters and closed
higher today, inspired by Wall Street's resilience and the

</P>
<P>
On the London market, British shares extended Tuesday's rebound

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Urges to Give Play to Local Advantages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Chinese official
recently urged local officials in northeast China's Jilin Province
to abide by the rules of the market economy and give scope to local
advantages in a bid to accelerate the growth of the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, who is also member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), made the remark during his visit to major industrial
enterprises and research institutes in Jilin.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to have in mind overall economic
situation and the part that their local economy plays in the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"A socialist market-oriented economy has to compete. The
competition, however, should be beneficial for the sustained,
sound and speedy development of China's national economy," he
said, adding that more should be done to exploit local advantages
during the process of local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zou praised the efforts of the local government to
boost agricultural development in this leading grain production
province.
</P>
<P>
After an inspection of the First Auto Works Corporation and
Jilin Chemical Industrial Corporation, Zou charged these two
largest industrial enterprises to improve their marketing and
sales so as to put their most sought-after products onto the
market.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ministers Defend Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Three major cabinet ministers of
Bangladeshi government today jointly defended the price hike of
petroleum products, saying it would not affect the common people.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference, Commerce and Industries Minister
Tofail Ahmed explained that the farmers and lower income urban
groups would not be affected because the prices of the two vital
products, diesel and kerosene, were raised by only 0.25 taka per
liter.
</P>
<P>
The government Monday refixed the prices of all petroleum
products, among which each liter of petrol price rose sharply to
21 taka from 13.70 taka while diesel and kerosene from 12.70 taka
to 12.95 taka, in a bid to keep pace with the international
market.
</P>
<P>
This move, however, triggered sharp reactions among different
political parties and transport circles. The main opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had threatened a countrywide
strike on August 24 if the fuel price hike was not withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Tofail Ahmed called upon the opposition not to politicize the
issue but to realize that the international market price of
petroleum, which the country imports with cash money, has
increased abnormally over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Muhammad Nooruddin Khan in the press conference
also termed the government decision as "timely and correct" in
view of international market price of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Khan said the international price of petroleum shot up to 33
U.S. dollars per barrel in January this year. But the government
did not raise the price at that time on the consideration that it
might hit hard the people.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it wait to see the price fall in the world market and
increased the local fuel price when the international price is
roughly 24 dollars per barrel now, he added.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria told the press conference that
due to the price hike in the international market, the country had
to bear the burden of 4.5 billion taka (about 101 million dollars)
as revenue loss in the fuel sector every year.
</P>
<P>
He said all past governments had made profit by selling
petroleum products but the present government, taking power in
June last year, is refraining from doing so, because it cares for
the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
However, it was also not desirable that the government would
give subsidies to car owners ignoring the interests of the vast
majority of the people, he argued.

<HEADLINE> German Company Announces Plan to Sell Russian Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A German company said today that it
expects to sign a contract in a few weeks with the Russian
government on selling the uranium from dismantled Russian nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
Nukem, a unit of Germany's RWE group, will market the uranium
through its United States unit, Nukem Inc., based in Connecticut,
in partnership with Cameco of Canada and Cogema of France.
</P>
<P>
Cameco and Cogema will each sell 45 percent of a total of
150,000 tons of the surplus nuclear material, and Nukem plans to
obtain the remaining 10 percent and market it over the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said from Nukem's headquarters at Alzenau, east
of Frankfurt, that the three companies had already signed a
memorandum of agreement with Moscow on the issue, and a final
contract was expected to be ready for signature in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian nuclear warheads are being dismantled under a 1993
treaty between the United States and Russia. The uranium and
plutonium in them are too valuable to dump and can be converted
into fuel rods for nuclear power plants.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Warned of Ozone Depletion Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Meteorologists warned people
today to avoid direct sunlight and possible injury from solar
radiation following reports of ozone depletion Wednesday for the
fourth time this month and the sixth time this year.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people, patients suffering from respiratory problems
and children should not exercise in the open air between high noon
and early night, local television quoted meteorologists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's readings at two of the country's 22 measuring
stations showed ozone concentration less than 180 micrograms per
cubic meter of air, well below the 360 micrograms set as a
benchmark for alarm.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has instructed its member states to inform
their populace whenever ozone depletion occurs. The two previous
readings of low ozone concentration this year were taken on July
12 and June 4.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists explained that the frequency of ozone depletion
in this country has been declining compared to figures posted a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
As many as 32 below-benchmark concentrations were reported in
1995 and 20 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer in the atmosphere absorbs solar ultraviolet
radiation, protecting lives on earth from harmful solar radiation
of wavelengths less than 290 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
Waste gases such as automobile exhaust emissions bear the brunt
of the blame for ozone depletion.

<HEADLINE> Rising Oil Output Keeps Prices in Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's oil prices will be
kept in check as a result of the rising oil output, according to a
report of the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
Although demand for oil has been climbing, the price may be
kept in control for at least a year as a swell of new production
moves into global markets from the North Sea, South America and
Iraq, the paper quoted analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that at least an extra 1.3 million barrels a day
are slated to start flowing during the next six months from
sources outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), which itself has been slowly increasing output, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
It reported that production projects are being undertaken by
major oil companies -- 249,000 barrels daily from the North Sea,
290,000 barrels a day from Columbia and at least 750,000 barrels
daily from Iraq, as it again starts to pump oil under the auspices
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Australia and Kazakstan will gush out 100,000
barrels daily. Other oil-producing nations also will set up their
pumping.
</P>
<P>
Some exports predicted that crude oil prices could decline to
17 U.S. dollars or 18 U.S. dollars a barrel in coming months.
</P>
<P>
But the oil increase has no immediate impact on the U.S.
consumers. Motorists have seen gasoline prices at the pump even
jump significantly. Analysts commented that a robust economy has
driven more Americans onto the road this summer.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) says world
oil production this year, excluding OPEC numbers, will hit 44.7
million barrels a day, 1.17 million barrels more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the agency estimates, at least another two million
barrels of oil will be moving into the market daily. And IEA
officials do expect that OPEC members will also increase their
output.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Keen to Deepen Friendship with China: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagbandy said here today his country would make efforts to develop
a Mongolian-Chinese friendship oriented toward the coming 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy made the remark during a meeting with visiting Chinese
Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
The president praised the smooth development of cooperation in
recent years between the two countries in the fields of politics,
trade and economy as well as culture.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China is Mongolia's good neighbor, the president
said to develop friendly cooperation with China would be one of
the firm and steadfast priorities of Mongolia's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here Tuesday for a four-day official visit,
congratulated Bagbandy on being elected Mongolia's new president
in June. He also conveyed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China upholds the independent foreign policy of peace
based on self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Since Mongolia is an important neighbor of China, developing
Sino-Mongolian friendly relations will not only be in the basic
interest of the two peoples, but also be conducive to the peace
and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
Qian vowed to continue developing the good-neighborliness and
cooperation between China and its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Bagbandy said Qian's visit, which has promoted mutual
understanding, broadened consensus and strengthened bilateral
cooperation, is of great importance to the further development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Radnasumberlyn Gonchigdorzh, chairman of the
Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, held talks with Qian on
communication between the two countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Qian said contact between the two legislatures is an important
part of state-to-state relations. He hoped China's National
People's Congress and Mongolia's Great Hural continue to cooperate
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Gonchigdorzh hoped the two countries' legislative bodies and
personnel could further strengthen cooperation and exchange
experience.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese People Should Live in Harmony: Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The people of China and Japan
should inherit and carry forward the cause of Sino-Japanese
friendship forged by the older generations, so that they can live
in permanent accord, Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the visiting governor of Japan's Yamagata
Prefecture, Kazuo Takahashi, he said the friendship between the
Chinese and Japanese people has a long history, but a certain
period of history should not be forgotten in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure a long-lasting friendship between Chinese
and Japanese people, it will be extremely important for the
younger generations to recognize the significance of a friendly
and cooperative Sino-Japanese relationship, and make due
contributions to its growth," Rong stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rong also congratulated the fruitful
exchanges and cooperation between Yamagata and China's northernmost
Heilongjiang Province since they forged the bond of sisterly ties.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi said this was the 14th goodwill visit of his
prefecture, and also the most significant one as this year marks
the 25th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi also said Yamagata will continue to organize visits
of this type to further the understanding and friendship between
the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the successful cooperation in education, culture,
and sports with the Chinese sister province over the past five
years, Takahashi expressed his hope that exchanges and cooperation
with China will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
The 141-member delegation, which arrived here Wednesday at the
invitation of the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation, are expected to travel to cities in Northwest and
Northeast China.

<P>
BONN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Viag group said today its
first-half pre-tax profits surged 28 percent to 1.5 billion marks
(808 million U.S. dollars), and expected an "appreciable" rise in
profits this year despite start-up losses in its telecoms
business.

The Munich-based diversified industrial conglomerate reported a
12 percent growth in sales during the period, which reached 23.8
billion marks (12.8 billion dollars).
</P>

Viag's main businesses are electricity generation, chemicals,
packaging and freight.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Confirms Waigel's Plan to Quit after Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
said he was aware of Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to quit
after the general elections in September next year.
</P>
<P>
"I respect his position and understand his decision, especially
since I know he is not tired of serving in office," Kohl said in a
statement released in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview on Tuesday evening, Waigel stunned
political observers by saying he would leave his office should
Kohl's center-right coalition win next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, who has served as finance minister in Kohl's
center-right government since April 1989, said he was not tired of
holding the office.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with German ARD television network, Waigel said
he would do his best to fulfil his tasks, including negotiating
the planned tax reform and managing budget.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Waigel's party, the Christian Social Union,
today said that Waigel had not set the election day as deadline
for his minister term.
</P>
<P>
Waigel, 58, has come under sharp criticism recently for his
hardline management of the government budget and the proposed tax
reform, since Germany is struggling to reduce record high
unemployment and to make the grade in order to join the planned
single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Waigel also triggered controversies recently for his suggestion
of a cabinet reshuffle before the general election next year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Waigel's unexpected remarks in Tuesday's
interview, Rudolf Scharping, parliamentary leader of the main
opposition Social Democratic Party, said it was the "recognition
of defeat" by Waigel.

PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has sold six
military transport aircraft to Algeria at a price estimated to be
worth several hundred million U.S. dollars, the Arabic daily Al
Hayet reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Clinton administration has confirmed the
deal but refused to reveal the exact cost of the planes or their
types and characteristics, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The planes, produced by the U.S. Gulfstream company, will be

"information programs in French," it said.
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream estimated the cost of the planes at from 28 to 38
million dollars each.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the planes can engage in wars, supervise
frontiers, carry out reconnaissance missions against potential
enemies, and communicate for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government is currently engaged in an all-out war
against Islamic militants who have tried to topple it for six
years.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Qingdao Beer Group Co. Ltd.,
China's most famous beer brewery, today signed an agreement with
the Qingdao Branch of Bank of China for a one billion yuan (120
million US dollars) loan.
</P>
<P>
The group today received the first 300 million yuan (36 million
US dollars) from the deal.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Guirong, chairman of board of the group, the
company in recent years tried various means to tap the capital
market. It went public in the bourses of Shanghai and Hong Kong in
1993, took over a beer factory in east China's Jiangsu Province in
1994, and grabbed the controlling shares of a brewery in Xi'an of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new loan will enable the company to further develop an
economy of scale, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li revealed that the group was preparing for the takeover of
several beer enterprises in Shandong province, its own province.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM on Role of ASEAN, China in Promoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today ASEAN and China have key roles to play
in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is therefore looking forward to the participation by
President Jiang Zemin at the ASEAN Informal Summit in December
1997," Mahathir said at the banquet he hosted in honor of visiting
Chinese Premier Li Peng who arrived here earlier today for a
four-day official visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am especially appreciative of the support expressed
by China for ASEAN's proposal for the East Asian Nations to engage
in purposeful exchange of views on matters affecting the peace,
stability and economic growth of the region."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his confidence that before long the proposal
will become a reality, opening a new page in the history of
cooperation among East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the active participation
of China in the ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development Cooperation (AMBDC)
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that with China's support, AMBDC would be able to
achieve its aims and objectives of bringing development and
progress towards the region.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bilateral relations, Mahathir first congratulated
China on the recent successful and peaceful resumption of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and expressed his belief that
Malaysia-Hong Kong relations would contribute significantly to the
overall relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the growing diplomatic and political relations
are moving in tandem with the rapidly developing bilateral
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "Malaysia is confident that given China's
excellent economic performance, our bilateral trade and economic
cooperation will expand further."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia hopes that as China continues to liberalize its trade
regime, opportunities will be further available for Malaysia to
increase its exports, particularly of manufactured and
semi-manufactured goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is also gratifying that Malaysia-China relations have
broadened to include cooperation in education," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia continues to be impressed by the tremendous
economic achievements of China, consistent with its economic
reforms and opening-up policies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "In fulfilling the national aspirations of the
people of China for development, the government of China is also
making a singular contribution towards peace, stability and
prosperity in the rest of the region."

<HEADLINE> Scholar: Dalai Lama's Political Position Granted by Central Government (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He went on to say that the political-religious system was set
up after the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties confirmed the
establishment of the sects of Sakyapa, Phagdru Kagyupa and Gelugpa
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The system was under the jurisdiction of the central
government, and could not be manipulated by one sect alone. It
affirmed the existence of the three regimes of the sects, and also
affirmed the absolute leadership of the central government over
Tibet's local governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chang pointed out that in the first half of this century,
although the system was under the sole direct control of the Dalai
Lama, the international community agreed that Tibet was a
political entity under Chinese sovereignty instead of an
independent country.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the title of the Dalai Lama remained
unchanged. "If the Dalai Lama were called Gyatso Lama, he would be
worth nothing," Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after 1840, Tibet along with the rest of China had
become the chief target of aggressive foreign powers and it was
gradually falling into a semi-colonial state.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have no regard for the historical background of
China and blatantly distort historical facts in an attempt to
split Tibet from China," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> SDP Urges Exclusion of Taiwan from New Defense Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Social Democratic Party
(SDP) reiterated its position today that the Taiwan Straits be
excluded from areas subject to the proposed new Japan-U.S. defense
guidelines, said a report of the Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
The SDP, one of the two allies of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), made the statement at a meeting of policy-makers from
the tripartite ruling camp, which includes the LDP, led by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, the SDP, and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed to hammer out a common view on the new
guidelines by Friday, but a senior SDP official said it would be
difficult to meet the deadline because of differences between the
SDP and the LDP over the definition of "areas surrounding Japan,"
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of how to define the areas surrounding Japan has been
in the spotlight since Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama
said in a Sunday TV talk show that the new defense guidelines
would cover emergencies in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Kajiyama's remarks triggered strong criticism from China as
they signaled an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines are intended to replace the 1978
Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines, paving the way for
Japan to provide a broad range of logistic and noncombatant
support to the U.S. military in case of emergencies "in areas
surrounding Japan."

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Queen's Counsel (QC) George
Carman made his final submissions today in the High Court of
Singapore on the fourth day of the defamation suit brought by
ruling People's Action Party (PAP) leaders against opposition
Workers' Party chief J.B. Jeyaretnam.
</P>
<P>
According to a Singapore television report, Mr. Carman, hired
by Mr. Jeyaretnam, maintained that an ordinary person would not
have concluded that Mr. Jeyaretnam was guilty of defamation by his
remarks at an election rally last January.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, are suing Mr. Jeyaretnam for telling
a Workers' Party election campaign rally on January 1 this year
that his team-mate in the Cheng San Group Representation
Constituency, lawyer Tang Liang Hong, had just placed before him
two reports the latter made to the police against the Prime
Minister and his team.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders claimed the words Jeyaretnam used implied that
they had conspired to commit criminal defamation against Mr. Tang
by labeling him an anti-Christian, anti-English educated Chinese
chauvinist.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Carman said today that the remarks were not capable of
bearing the meaning which the Prime Minister's lawyers put on them
- that he is guilty of criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Carman also said that Mr. Goh's claim was an orchestrated
one and Mr. Jeyaretnam had not inflicted any damage on the PAP
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He added that both Mr. Goh and the senior minister had
themselves inflicted the damage when they released the contents of
the police report to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Carman submitted that although the meaning of the remarks
as intended by the public was irrelevant, the court must take into
account their context. In this case, he said, it was political in
nature at an election rally.
</P>
<P>
In the heat of battle between parties, Mr. Carman said such
statements could be taken with a pinch of salt.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Jeyaretnam's statement, said his lawyer, was also one
without embellishment or comment. He was reporting a true fact and
this, Mr. Carman said, cannot give rise to defamation.
</P>
<P>
Turning to damages, Mr. Carman submitted that the issue should
never arise in this case. However, he added that the prime
minister had already been fully vindicated and compensated over
his libel suit against Mr. Tang.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The remains of one of the best-
preserved Iron Age houses ever discovered has been found in
Britain, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The house, located at Old Scatness, in north-eastern Britain,
has a corbelled stone roof and is believed to date from around the
time of Christ, Alan Braby, who found the house, said.
</P>
<P>
The entire structure of the house, which includes the roof, is
complete. Archaeologist Val Turner said the discovery is seen as
the most significant since "Jarlshof," a multi-layered
archaeological site just a mile from Old Scatness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Iron Age building, with yellow clay still
plastered on the walls, and a wheelhouse with the remains of an
iron pot containing the bones of an uneaten fish, has also been
found.

<HEADLINE> Four EU States Use Unleaded Fuels for All Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Austria, Denmark, Finland and
Sweden are the only four European Union member states where all
cars used only clean, unleaded fuel in 1996, a Eurostat report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The four countries also used unleaded fuels for all their cars
in the preceding year as well.
</P>
<P>
Spain is the EU member where unleaded fuels were used least.
Just a little more than a third of the country's cars used the
cleaner fuels, the most recent Eurostat report said.
</P>
<P>
It said consumption of unleaded fuel by cars in Greece,
Portugal and Italy is also below the 50 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
More and more people are being encouraged to use unleaded fuel
in the European Union where the population is becoming
increasingly sensitive about the environment.
</P>
<P>
All 15 member states of the union registered increases to
various extent of consumption of cleaner fuels in the past year
compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The union, as a whole, saw an increase of five percentage
points to around 72 percent of consumption in unleaded fuels by
cars.

<HEADLINE> Japan Maps Out Administrative Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Administrative Reform
Council today agreed on a blueprint to trim the current 22
ministries and agencies into a cabinet office and 12 ministries,
the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after four days of intensive
discussions by a 15-member panel that was headed by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the current Prime Minister's Office and the
Management and Coordination Agency will be combined into a cabinet
office, which is expected to deal with such things as
macro-economics, science and technology, gender equality and
disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
Six new ministries will be set up by reorganizing the current
agencies and ministries, including a general affairs ministry, a
national land development ministry and others. The Justice and
Foreign Ministries will remain.
</P>
<P>
The panel members continue to disagree on whether the Defense
Agency should be turned into a ministry, though they have agreed
to carry the differing opinions in a report scheduled for
completion by September 3.
</P>
<P>
Upon its release, the report will be examined by the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and its two allies, the Social Democratic
Party and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Reform Council was initiated last November.

HELSINKI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari today met the visiting Chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), General Fu Quanyou, and
paid tribute to the great achievements China has made in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Finland and China, though oceans apart,
maintain good relations. He said the direct talks between heads
of the two nations in recent years have effectively promoted
all-round development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari also said that Finland is glad to see that China, a
country with a population of 1.2 billion, has succeeded in
achieving rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who is also a member of China's Central Military
Commission, thanked Ahtisaari for his compliments, and said that
China is experiencing political stability, national unity,
economic development and a higher standard of living for all its
people these years.
</P>
<P>
Fu mentioned the two major events in China's political life
this year: China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, and the upcoming 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China. The Congress will prepare new
guidelines for China's future development that will have
undoubtedly a profound influence on the country.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Finnish relations, Fu said the two countries share the
view of maintaining world peace, stability and development. The
exchange of visits by the leaders of the two countries will also

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Public
Security on Wednesday issued a notice requiring police departments
nationwide to further step up the crackdown on prostitution and
pornographic activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, more police operations should be
planned to clean up a few places of prostitution, including
Karaoke bars, dance halls, sauna and massage parlors, and roadside
stores.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, big efforts should also be made to improve the
supervision of the migrant workers. Houses should never be allowed
to rent for prostitution activities and, otherwise their owners
should be brought to justice in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
Lawbreakers should be punished according to the relevant laws
and regulations, said the notice, which also stressed that anyone
involved in the procurement or solicitation of prostitutes faces
still heavier punishment.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a series of anti-prostitution campaigns
since early this year and the efforts so far have paid off.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has allocated 5,000 acres of land to build an ultra modern
science complex near Langi Jabe, about 50 kilometers off Arusha
in northern Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Breast Screening To Reduce Deaths In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A national breast screening
program is being spread out in Australia which was believed to
reduce breast cancer deaths by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Since the program got going in 1991, we have seen a small
reduction in mortality, we estimate the downturn is in the order
of four to five percent, but it is going to be five to ten years
before we start to see the real impact of the program," Bruce
Armstrong, director of the Cancer Council's information center in
New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the first national breast cancer screening
conference held here today, Armstrong said, it is generally
accepted that you will see a 30 percent drop, if you get a better
than 70 percent participation rate in screening in the 50 to 74
year age group.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jill Cockburn told the conference that the program was on
track, with 61 percent of the target age group having being
screened by Breast Screen Australia or elsewhere in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Among women aged 40 to 49 years, who are not targeted but can
get a free screen, 23 percent had a screening mammogram in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
"These figures are very reassuring and I think we can now do
some more targeted recruiting to attract that group of women who
don't believe themselves to be at risk," Cockburn said.
</P>
<P>
Breast Screen Australia has performed two million screens
during the past six years finding cancer less than one percent of
women.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer claims 2500 lives every year in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Romanian Environmental Protection Heads Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Top environmental protection
officials from China and Romania held a two-hour meeting here
today to discuss the work that is being done in the field by their
countries, both separately and together.
</P>
<P>
Director of China's National Environmental Protection Agency
(Nepa) Xie Zhenhua and Romanian Minister of Water Resources,
Forests and Environmental Protection H. E. Oltean also conferred
on global environmental cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Xie briefed the Romanian guest on the measures China has taken
and the progress it has made in environmental protection. He said
that China has launched a large-scale battle against pollution,
and it will increase funding, strengthen the legal system, and
rigorously enforce environmental laws and regulations during the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Xie expressed his hope that Oltean's visit will increase the
understanding between the two sides, and advance the two
countries' cooperation in environmental protection to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China and Romania face similar pollution problems as
their economies grow, and so have a good foundation and future for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Oltean expressed great interest in China's environmental
protection work and spoke highly of China's efforts to fight
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Romania is willing to cooperate with China, he said, adding
that his visit is aimed to give a push to the two countries' joint
involvement in environmental protection work.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides reached consensus on many
global environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to sign an agreement with Romania on
environmental cooperation. To date, China has had agreements of
this kind with more than 20 countries.

<HEADLINE> Scholar: Dalai Lama's Political Position Granted by Central Government (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The fact that the Dalai Lama's
political status was granted by the central government is proof
that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, an established Chinese
scholar has claimed.
</P>
<P>
Chang Fengxun, a senior research fellow from the prestigious
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said here today that the two
issues of the Tibetan political-religious system and the status of
the Dalai Lama in Tibet have not only evolved from regional and
ethnic factors, but also are closely tied with the history of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, in the second half of this century, some people
offered different explanations about these situations, and some
people even associate them with sovereignty and human
rights. These explanations are not in accordance with historical
facts," Chang said in a report at the ongoing Beijing Seminar on
Tibetan Studies.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 foreign and Chinese scholars are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, the Dalai Lama was originally one of the
many successors of incarnate lamas of the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan
Buddhism. He was neither the "hierarch" of all the sects of
Tibetan Buddhism, nor the "leader" of Tibet's political-religious
system.
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama did not have any connection with Tibet's
political-religious system until 1653, when the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) gave the title of Dalai Lama to Lozang Gyatso, the
fifth successor of the Gelugpa, Chang noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the Dalai Lama's political position was
granted by the central government," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> UN, ECOWAS to Resolve on S. Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council said it will work in concert with the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to compel the military
junta in Sierra Leone to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The council will consult ECOWAS leaders who are scheduled to
meet next week to work out a common strategy, according to the
council President John Weston after the 15-member body met with
the UN scribe's special representative for Sierra Leone Berhann
Dinka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Weston's words came after ECOWAS Chairman General Sani
Abacha's visit to Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea to canvass for common
position among the sub-regional body towards resolving the crisis
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who is Nigeria's head of state, reportedly said during
his trip on Monday that a military option was inevitable since
the junta had remained intransigent to pressures by the
international community to reinstate the ousted civilian
government of the country.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the key objective of the Security Council now
is to ensure that it is speaking and acting with the same voice
as ECOWAS ministers, Weston said, quoted by a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Weston noted, they would be insisting on UN's
earlier objection to the junta's decision to remain in power.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make clear once again our condemnation of the
violence in the country and our insistence that there should be
freedom of movement and access for humanitarian agencies," he
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to be close in consultation with the ECOWAS
group of foreign ministers over the next few days so as to ensure
that any decision we take will be with the full knowledge of what
the ECOWAS group themselves have decided," said the council
president.
</P>
<P>
Whatever measures the council then adopts will reinforce its
efforts as well as that of ECOWAS, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the coup took place in Sierra Leone on May 25, the
council has issued three statements, condemning the coup and
urging the junta to hand over power to the toppled government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Attitude Determines Nigeria's Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has said its continued
membership of the commonwealth will depend on how the 52-member
organization redresses the perceived wrong done to the country
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, a major criterion for
determining whether Nigeria would remain within the fold is "the
overall perception of whether the association is not being
derailed from the original goals and objectives", local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to members of the country's long-term planning body,
Vision 2010 Committee, on Wednesday in th capital Abuja, Ikimi
urged the planning body to take a "serious look at the
commonwealth-Nigeria diplomatic impasse on the basis of what is
in our best national interest".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended its membership from the Commonwealth at
the Auckland summit in New Zealand in 1995, prompted by the
execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) was set up at
the summit to deal with Nigeria's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG, which has visited and talked with Nigeria, is
expected to reconvene in September this year to take a stand on
Nigeria ahead of the Commonwealth summit in Edinburgh, Scotland
in October.
</P>
<P>
It is reported earlier that Nigeria is considering to quit the
Commonwealth in case the organization decides to discharge
Nigeria at the end of its two-year ultimatum for the country to
democratize.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Ikimi said despite the problems Nigeria was
facing with the Commonwealth, it had to open another front with
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Admitting that "relations between Nigeria and the EU have
dropped to a very low ebb," Ikimi pointed out that the problems
lied in the EU decision "to meddle in our internal affairs".
</P>
<P>
Since the EU has clamped sanctions in areas of renewal of visa
and arms embargo, it is impossible to make contacts at the
highest level between the EU and Nigeria, the foreign minister
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Angola Not to Join Multi-national Force on Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
decided not to join a multi-national intervention force aimed at
solving the crisis in Congo Brazzaville, the Angolan News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said
neither of the warring sides in Congo (B) has contacted Angola
over the issue of joining the multi-national force, so the
government has excluded the possibility of joining it.
</P>
<P>
The idea of forming the multi-national intervention force was
put forward by Laurent Kabila, President of Democratic Congo in
Kinshasa last week when he met for talks with Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the multi-national troops will be
formed by military forces from eastern and central African
countries, which include Angola, Chad, Rwanda, Burundi, the
Central African Republic, Congo (K) and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
While denying the possibility of joining the multi-national
force, the communique said the Angolan government fully supports
the effort of mediation over the Congo (B) conflict initiated by
Gabonese President El Hadj Omar Bongo and hopes a political
agreement on reconciliation would be reached between the warring
sides.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Brazzaville in early June between forces
loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and the militia of former
President Sassou Nguesso, killing over 3,000 people and
displacing many more.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Dos Santos expressed his support to the
peace initiative mapped out by Omar Bongo, when he met with the
visiting envoy of the Gabonese president at the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With US Senators in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today told
two visiting US senators that China is ready to work alongside the
US to create a long-term, stable bilateral relationship for the
21st century on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the pledge during a meeting with John McCain,
chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee of
the US Senate, and Senator Phil Gramm.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two countries share many mutual interests
and have great potentials of cooperation for maintaining world and
regional peace, and promoting global economic prosperity, all of
which has laid a foundation for the steady development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China values the Sino-US relations very much, the Chinese
leader said. Since the beginning of the year, he added, the two
countries have moved progressively forward in their relationship,
and there have been more exchanges in various fields and their
economic and trade cooperation has grown steadily.
</P>
<P>
Many US congressmen have visited China to date, Jiang said, and
the two countries now have many good opportunities for further
improvement of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
McCain said that Jiang's upcoming state visit to the US is of
historical significance, and that the American people will welcome
him.
</P>
<P>
And Americans understand how important the positive and stable
US-China relations are, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gramm called China's rapid economic growth a "miracle", and
said that during the trip, he saw for himself the Chinese people
are living a happy life as a result of the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Both McCain and Gramm pointed out that maintaining the friendly
and cooperative connection between the US and China in the next
century is of profound significance for the people of the two
countries and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Mei Zhaorong, president of the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and Li Zhaoxing,
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng: Sino-Malaysian Friendly Ties to Enjoy New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng today expressed his confidence that the friendly relations
and cooperation between China and Malaysia will experience new and
greater development.
</P>
<P>
"Our two peoples have enjoyed a long history of friendship with
each other and have steadily expanded cooperation in various
fields," Li said at a grand banquet tonight hosted in his honor by
his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries, which share identical or similar views
on many international issues, have been in close consultation and
cooperation with each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier praised Malaysia for its active part it has
taken in regional and international affairs, saying "it has upheld
justice in international affairs in defiance of might and worked
for the common development of third world countries, for which we
wish to express our appreciation and admiration."
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here earlier today for a four-day friendly
official visit to Malaysia, believed his official talks with
Mahathir tomorrow will be of "great importance to continuous
development of our bilateral relations".
</P>
<P>
The two sides will have an extensive and in-depth exchange of
views on bilateral relations and on regional and international
issues of mutual interest, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the world situation, Li said the world today is
moving towards multipolarity, which is conducive to the noble
cause of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the increasing important role that the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is playing in
regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China and ASEAN are engaged in fruitful, all-round cooperation
with each other," Li said, pledging that China "would like to make
further efforts together with ASEAN countries to develop a
21st-century-oriented friendly and good-neighborly relationship."

Present at tonight's banquet were Li's wife Zhu Lin and senior
Chinese officials who are accompanying Li on the ongoing visit.

<HEADLINE> Universiade: Beginning of Success of World Class Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The last three editions of
World University Games in Sheffield, Buffalo and Fukuoka have proved
to be the beginning of success of many world-class athletes.
</P>
<P>
Derrick Adkins of the United States, who won the 400-meter
hurdles at the 1991 Sheeffield and 1993 Buffalo Universiades, took
the gold medal of the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. The
silver medalist at the Olympics is Samuel Matete of Zambia, Adkins'
rival at the Buffalo Universiade.
</P>
<P>
The two hurdlers also finished 1-2 at the 1995 Goteborg
Athletics World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Pole Vaulter Jean Galfione of France finished only third at
Buffalo. But three years later, he cleared 5.92 meters to set a new
Olympic record and won the gold medal at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Sun Fuming of China has the similiar story as Galfione. Having
finished third at Fukuoka Universiade, she took the open class title
of women's judo at the Atlanta Olympics one year later.
</P>
<P>
There are many other athletes who benefitted from their
Universiade experiences and surged to stardom. They are Canadian
rower Derek Porter, Belorussian gymnast Vitaly Scherbo, Chinese
swimmer Le Jingyi, Italian Olympic fencing champion Alessandro
Puccini, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
This time at Sicily, some 6,000 athletes again gathered up to
compete at World Universiade. Three years later at Sydney, many of
them will surely compete at the 2000 Olympic Games and some will
even step onto the podium.

<HEADLINE> Floods Kill 15, Displace Thousands in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people have been killed
and more than 120,000 others are still seeking refugee in
makeshift centers in the flood-stricken northern Philippines, the
country's disaster authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said in an
update report that six more deaths were confirmed today in
flood-hit areas, bringing the flood death toll to 15.
</P>
<P>
More than 35,000 families or 127,000 people continued to live
in evacuation centers after being driven out of their homes by the
massive flooding, which hit the country's northern part during the
past two days, the council said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed by flood
waters which were triggered by continuous torrential monsoon
rains.
</P>
<P>
The council put agriculture, livestock and infrastructure
losses at an estimated 6 million pesos (200,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila or the national capital area, most evacuees
have returned to their respective houses as flood waters had
already receded.
</P>
<P>
But in its nearby provinces such as Pampanga and Bataan, tens
of thousands of residents are continuing their combat against
flood waters after some river dykes were breached.
</P>
<P>
The departments of social and welfare and health provided today
a total of 2.2 million pesos for medical supplies and other
emergency services to the evacuees and other victims.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of Luzon Island were cloudy today with only
occasional thundershowers after the tail of super typhoon Winnie
ceased to affect the country, according to the National Weather
Bureau. Winnie was blamed for intensifying the usually moderate
southwest monsoon rains.
</P>
<P>
Less rains are expected to fall in Luzon in the next few days
as a new typhoon Luming has already spared the country and is now
roaring northwestward to China, the bureau forecast.

SEOUL, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition leaders
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil agreed today to field a single
presidential candidate by the end of next month to represent the

<P>
The agreement came at a meeting of negotiators from Kim

</P>
<P>
In today's negotiations, the two opposition parties also agreed
to iron out their differences over rewriting the Constitution in
favor of a parliamentary government system by the end of next
month.
</P>
<P>
However, the scheduled meeting between the two Kims on August
26 was postponed to early September, said a ULD official.

LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- This August may break all records
and become the hottest in Britain's history, the British
Meteorological Office said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the possibility of weekend storms, analysts believe

enough period of time to eclipse previous years. Britain had 15
consecutive days above 26.7 degrees Celsius in 1995 and this
record was reached again on Wednesday.

Temperatures in England and Wales in the first half of August
were more than Three degrees Celsius higher than average. In the
southeast, the figure was about five degrees higher.
</P>
<P>
The lowest recorded temperature in London this month has been
14.6 degrees Celsius, but Met Office figures show that the
temperature has climbed to as high as 31.3 degrees Celsius on a
number of occasions this month.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the mean temperature here was 19.2 degrees Celsius.
This, too, is expected to be surpassed this year.

<HEADLINE> DHAKA to Revise Export Target at 5 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export target for the
current fiscal year (1997-98) is likely to be re-fixed at five
billion U.S. dollars, 0.12 billion less than the original target,
official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
In view of some problems relating to garment and frozen foods
to the European market, the Commerce Ministry would favor an
export target not more than five billion dollars, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an export target of 5.12 billion dollars was
contemplated for the current fiscal year. However, some exporters
sounded a caution against the "unrealistic" target. They said
failure to reach a set target not only damages country's image
abroad but also puts the government in an embarrassing situation
at home.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed export target for the current fiscal year,
earnings from ready made garment (RMG) and knitwear are to cover
about 70 percent, frozen food 6 percent and leather 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Given a disturbed situation for the knitwear products and
frozen foods in the western market due to the restriction by
European Union, export market analysts have cast doubt as to
whether it would be wise or prudent to set the targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the shipment of very poor quality and
short-measured leather has also hit some European importers, there
was a meticulous thought on fixing export targets for these items
in the prevailing situation, they said.
</P>
<P>
The export target for 1996-97 fiscal year was fixed at 4.38
billion dollars and the achievement was 4.41 billion dollars.
Among which, the export earnings of the RMG and the knitwear
sector accounted over 66 percent.

MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Presidential Economic
Adviser Emilio Osmena officially resigned from his post today to
concentrate on his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a letter of resignation sent to President Fidel Ramos on
Monday, Osmena said: "To quell the ever boisterous opposition and
to blot out doubts that I am using my office to pursue my
presidential ambition, I am submitting this letter of
resignation."
</P>
<P>
He urged other presidential aspirants in the ruling Lakas-NUCD
and other political parties to also relinquish their posts before
the campaign starts.
</P>
<P>
Presidential aspirants in the ruling party have been under
constant fire from the opposition camp for taking advantage of
their present positions to promote their presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The former governor of the central province of Cebu earlier
also resigned as Executive Vice-president of the Lakas-NUCD to
ensure a "level playing field" among the party's presidential
aspirants.
</P>
<P>
Osmena, chairman of the presidential Committee on Flagship
Programs and Projects before submitting his letter of resignation,
was the brains behind the economic boom of Cebu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq accused the United States
of seeking to find pretexts continuously to defame Iraq and
maintain the seven-year embargo on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made by Iraqi Foreign Minister Said Assahaf
in a message to the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, Iraqi News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The message came in response to a recent letter sent to the U.S.
Congress by the U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Clinton said that Iraq sought to get Zirconium
moulds from the U.S. in violation of the economic competency law
in emergency cases and the UN-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Assahaf deemed the letter as part of the U.S. design to delude
the international public opinion and defame Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mass media including New York Times said on June 9
this year that three U.S. agents disguised as employees of the
Iraqi Foreign Ministry were arrested on charges of illegally
smuggling the Zarkonium substance.
</P>
<P>
Assahaf denied any relationship between Iraq and
the alleged operation, stressing that the affair is mere pretext
and the heroes are U.S. government officials disguising as Iraqi
Foreign Ministry personnel.

<P>
MACAO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) will hold a specialized meeting next week to discuss
the transfer of archives in Macao, JLG officials announced here

Today's meeting was the first formal one between the two chiefs
 after Han assumed office early this month, succeeding Guo Jiading
 as the third chief of the Chinese side of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side has insisted that a special working panel be

described today's meeting as "friendly and smooth", saying that he
 hopes consensus would be reached on certain questions soon.

legal cooperation, Macao renewal of member status of some
international conventions, contracts whose term run beyond 1999 in
 Macao, and air agreements Macao has signed with foreign countries
 and regions.

<HEADLINE> China To Issue Additional 40 Billion Yuan of Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China plans to issue an
additional 40 billion yuan (about 4.82 billion US dollars) in
certificate bonds beginning on September 1, the Ministry of
Finance announced today in a circular.
</P>
<P>
The new issue will be in three-year bonds with an annual coupon
rate of 9.18 percent, the ministry said.

It will increase the nation's three-year certificate bonds
volume to 163 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bonds cannot be listed or traded at the stock market, the

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of
China, the Construction Bank of China, the Bank of China, the
Communications Bank of China -- or from treasury-bond operations
affiliated with the financial departments.

With the new issue, the offering of the earlier batch of
three-year certificate bonds will not end until December 31,
rather than October 20 as was previously scheduled.

China has issued two groups of bonds this year. Between January
22 and February 17, it issued 20 billion yuan of two-year
government bonds.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Progress Becomes Focus of World Attention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has gone through
an important period of both opportunities and challenges since the
14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily pointed today to
the remarkable economic achievements China has scored since the
14th CPC National Congress held five years ago, saying that the
country has attained its goal of sustained, speedy, and healthy
economic growth as local governments have carried out the central
policy of accelerating the development of a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
It quoted economists as saying that the country's current
macro-economic situation is very sound, with high growth and low
inflation, and that it has a sound foundation for achieving its
long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a series of measures to reinforce and improve
its macro-economic controls that have gradually alleviated or
eliminated some obstacles to economic progress.
</P>
<P>
In those five years China had a "soft-landing" with an annual
growth of 11.6 percent and a noticeable decline in the inflation
rate, from 25.2 percent in October 1992 to 1.8 percent in the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
It has reached its goal of quadrupling 1980's GDP by the year
2000 five years ahead of schedule. And while strengthening
macro-economic controls, the central government has placed greater
emphasis on economic growth tied to the market and to developing
agriculture, infrastructure, and basic industries.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Chinese government has had a
moderately tight monetary policy, successfully bringing down the
amount of currency in circulation from 152.7 billion yuan in 1993
to 91.7 billion yuan in 1996, while the growth of capital
investment in the country has dropped from 58.6 percent in 1992 to
18.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, both the central and local governments have during
that period increased investment in agriculture and have
encouraged farmers engaged in grain production with a reasonable
pricing policy that has, in turn, helped curb inflation.

<P>
The market has played a bigger role in China's economy, and the
price of goods, which used to be set by the state, are now mostly
decided by supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Every kind of market from the stock market to the labor market
has emerged in that time and they are gradually being
standardized. Laws governing market activities have been passed,
forming a legal system for socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
A series of reforms have helped improve macro-economic
controls, such as the separation of central and local revenues and
taxation, the issuing of state bonds instead of the government's
overdrawing from banks to cover deficits, and the convertibility
of Chinese currency under current accounts.
</P>
<P>
The reforms have led to co-ordination and co-operation between
planning, banking, and financial sectors, and a multi-layered
situation has appeared since the 14th CPC National Congress. Open
areas have moved from coastal regions to inland provinces, and
more industries, including trade and banking sectors, have been
opened up to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the country has made effective use of
both domestic and international markets, and resources and
funds. In 1996, imports and exports totaled 289.9 billion US
dollars, a 124.4-billion-US-dollar increase over 1992, with a
yearly growth of 15 percent, and in the same year, it had 42.35
billion US dollars in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the country's foreign exchange
reserves reached 126 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The standard of living has improved in the five years, along
with social development and social stability. From 1992 to 1996,
per-capita income rose from 1,826 yuan to 4,400 yuan for urban
residents and from 784 yuan to 1,900 yuan for rural people. And,
the nation's poverty-elimination program that began in 1993 has
helped more than 22 million people to get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In those five years, China has added over seven million jobs,
and has added re-employment programs nationwide to help the
jobless and those who have been laid off. In the first half of
this year, some five million people joined job training programs
and 2.45 million unemployed have been given jobs. A minimum-wage
system has also been adopted in 156 major cities to ensure a
certain level of life for even the lowest-income families.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Warns of Corruption Crisis in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has warned his countrymen not to
under-estimate the dangers of deep-rooted corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many people do not understand the depth of the crisis, Mbeki
told parliament in Cape Town on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa needs to discuss the crisis at greater
length to let people to have a better understanding of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He was asked to comment on a recent report by the German-based
non-governmental organisation, Transparency International, in
which South Africa ranked 33rd out of 52 countries in a clean
government poll.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki demanded caution in interpreting the findings of the
poll, saying it did not imply that one country was more corrupt
than another.
</P>
<P>
In a separate nation-wide poll released Wednesday, more than
70 percent of the people asked said they believed there was
corruption among state employees.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the first step was to recognise that the democratic
South Africa had inherited a corrupt society.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the National Party spokesman Theo
Alant said Wednesday that the government should make the war
against corruption a national priority.
</P>
<P>
African Christian Democratic Party leader Kenneth Meshoe said
it was correct to put the blame on the government, which was "too
soft on corruption", just as it was too soft on crime.

<HEADLINE> Building Industry Growing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's building industry has
had average annual growth of 30.6 percent over the past five
years, coming in fourth as a contributor to the country's GDP,
after agriculture, industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The sector had 828.22 billion yuan in output last year, about
half of which came from state enterprises, nearly three times that
of 1992, according to a recent State Statistics Bureau (SSB)
report.
</P>
<P>
A total of 600 million sq.m. of building was completed last
year, including 320 million sq.m. of residential space, providing
housing for some seven million urban families.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the building industry had more than 41,300
businesses with over 21 million workers, with state and collective
businesses still the overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
Private enterprises began to edge in last year, with 535
businesses and more than 80,000 employees. Overseas-backed
businesses added 805 with some 170,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The building sector also tried its luck abroad. It now does
business with 180 countries and regions. Last year, it had more
than 24,000 contracts worth 10 billion US dollars, up 56 percent
from 1992, and did two and half times the amount of business of
1992.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Corporation, the Guangdong
Daya Nuclear Power Plant, and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway tested
the industry's design and construction capability, a reversal of
the past when China's building industry was not able to handle
major, sophisticated projects.
</P>
<P>
Market competition has been introduced into the sector to
improve project quality and efficiency, and as a result, there is
more fair play in public bidding.
</P>
<P>
The increasing reforms have also helped productivity in the
industry, which last year was 2.6 times that of 1992, with an
annual average rise of 26.8 percent, the SSB reports.

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expressed here today
its regrets over statements recently made by Indian officials who
insisted "Jammu Kashmir is an integral part of India and Kashmir
is non-negotiable".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news conference here, a Foreign Office
spokesman said, "these statements are regrettably, entirely
untenable in terms law, justice, historical commitments and
specially in view of the clear agreement reached between India and
Pakistan in June 1997 placing Jammu and Kashmir on the Agenda of
the Foreign Secretary level talks between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"Jammu and Kashmir is universally recognized as a disputed
territory, the future of which is to be decided through a fair and
impartial plebiscite conducted under the UN auspices," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan and India are currently conducting a
dialogue at the level of Foreign Secretaries in order to address
all outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The agreed agenda includes, among others, the issues of Jammu
and Kashmir and peace and security in the region which would be
addressed through the integrated mechanism established at the
Second Round of Foreign Secretary level talks (in June)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that "Pakistan is looking forward to
comprehensive and meaningful discussions on all outstanding issues
with India".
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that India, during the talks, would
reciprocate the sincerity of purpose with which Pakistan initiated
the resumption of dialogue with India," he said.

<HEADLINE> International Anti-Smoking Conference To Open in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- An international anti-smoking
conference is scheduled for August 24-28 in the Chinese capital,
home to 320 million smokers and a giant tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
The 10th World Conference on Tobacco or Health will not only be
an important forum for the world's anti-smoking organizations, but
will also provide much-needed backup for China's decade-long
smoking-control efforts, according to one of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
"It is very meaningful that, for the first time, a developing
country is hosting such a conference," said Han Changlin, deputy
secretary-general of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
"Even more important is that China's anti-smoking forces will
learn a lot from their overseas counterparts and get help with
their campaigns," he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference, themed "Tobacco: The Growing Epidemic," has
attracted about 2,000 delegates from China and 103 other countries
and regions. That number will increase in the next several days,
Han said.
</P>
<P>
He said the five-day conference has the support of the Chinese
government. President Jiang Zemin was invited to be an honorary
member of the conference. Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, China's top
legislator, will serve as president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on the tobacco industry's expansion into
developing countries, smoking control, new methods to help quit
smoking, passive smoking, as well as tobacco's effects on women
and young people.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of symposiums and discussions, as well as an exhibition,
will be held at the Beijing International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's cigarette output reached a record 1.7
trillion, while the proportion of smokers among the people older
than 15 increased to a new high of 37.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
"China will have two million people who die from
smoking-related illnesses annually by the year 2025, if preventive
measures are not taken immediately," China's Minister of Health
Chen Minzhang warned recently.
</P>
<P>
China's smoking-control drive was launched in 1979, mainly
targeting teenagers and students, physicians, teachers, and
government employees.
</P>
<P>
As of July, a total of 72 major cities have banned smoking in
public places.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Areas Join Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The economic and technological
development areas, pioneers of China's reform and opening to the
outside world, have their own page on the Internet effective today.
</P>
<P>
The "Window for Development Areas in China" page will offer
Chinese and foreign investors information concerning China's
investment environment, policies and other pertinent information.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Office for Special Economic Zones and the
China Information Association issued an April announcement on
plans to create the page. "Window for Development Areas in China"
(Internet address: http://www.sezo.gov.cn) will be offered through
the China Economic Information Net (CeiNet) which is linked to
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The page will offer information on a selected group of highly
efficient and rapidly developing areas with favorable investment
environments.
</P>
<P>
The 48 areas appearing on the page will include 32 state-level
and 12 provincial-level development areas. The page currently
offers information in both Chinese and English, with plans calling
for the addition of Japanese in the near future. All information
will be updated on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
The State Council approved the first group of economic and
technological development areas in selected coastal cities at the
end of 1984, and 11 years ago today Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
wrote "Development areas are full of promise."
</P>
<P>
Development areas have not only recorded the nation's most
rapid development over the past 13 years, but have also attracted
the largest volume of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
China's development areas attracted overseas investments
totalling 13.2 billion US dollars between 1992-1996.
</P>
<P>
The development areas are facing new challenges resulting from
reduced state preferential policies, and are now expected to take
advantage of favorable structures created since their
establishment.
</P>
<P>
The new Internet page is expected to provide a favorable
investment environment needed for the further development of these
areas.

research related to the society and culture of the Tibetan ethnic
group which inhabits the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, an area known as
the "roof of the world."
</P>
<P>
Tibetan studies also cover the ethnic group's written and
spoken language, and other human studies areas such as history,
philosophy, religion, literature, arts and folklore; social
sciences areas such as politics and economics; and Tibetan
medicine, astronomy, geography, architecture and natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan studies have also attracted a number scholars from
countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Oceania.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, the central government has
encouraged research of Tibetan culture, and has allocated
substantial funding to establish research institutions and train
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Bibliography on Tibetan Studies in China lists 1,497 types
of books published in China between 1949-1992. According to recent
estimates, nearly 1,000 kinds of books on Tibetan studies have
been published over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars have played an active role in expanding
academic exchanges with their counterparts abroad and have
translated many important works by foreign specialists.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies follows
international seminars on Tibetan studies held in Beijing and
Lhasa in 1986 and 1991 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Re-export Slightly Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The re-export accounted for 86
 percent of the value of Hong Kong's total export in the first
half of this year, compared with 85 percent recorded in the same
period of last year, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the Census and
Statistics Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region's government, the re-export also accounted for 40 percent
of Hong Kong's total value of external trade in the first six
months of 1997, the same as the year-ago level.
</P>
<P>
China's inland areas remained the largest partner for Hong
Kong's re-export trade. As a source, re-export originating in
China's inland areas accounted for 57 percent of Hong Kong's
re-export value during January-June, while as a destination, the
inland areas' share was 36 percent, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
Much of the re-export trade involving China's inland areas is
related to outward processing, as raw materials and
semi-manufactured goods are exported to these areas for processing
 while the final products are subsequently returned to Hong Kong
and re-exported to overseas markets, the statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Other main re-export partners of Hong Kong in the first half of
 the year included the United States, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea,
Germany and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Achieves Results in Population Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The increasing investment in
population control has sharply cut the average number of children
per woman in Vietnam, the Vietnam News Agency quoted a recent
study as saying.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by a group of Vietnamese experts with
overseas technical assistance, shows that the Vietnamese
government has increased funds for family planning activities from
47 billion Vietnamese Dong in 1979 to 262 billion Vietnamese Dong
this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the average number of children per woman in
Vietnam has dropped from 4.6 in 1979 to 2.69 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The study concludes that "for every Vietnamese Dong spent on
population and family planning at the national level, the
government will save 7.6 Vietnamese dong in other social services
by 2010."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been striving to reduce the population growth rate
to 1.5-1.6 percent, with an aim to keep the population at 81
million by 2000 and to attain the goal of putting the two-child
family model in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the population of Vietnam stood at 76 million with a
growth rate of 1.88 percent.

<P>
TIRANA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
has appealed to the Italian government to put off its mass
repatriation of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came after an announcement by Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi two days earlier that Italy will repatriate all of
the 150,000 Albanian refugees by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to the refugees released Wednesday, the
president hoped that the Italian government and parliament could
understand that any repatriation at this moment would cause
serious problems to the Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Italian government could find a more convenient
time and human way to repatriate those refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian refugees had fled to avoid violence in the country
triggered by the failure of a fraudulent savings scheme earlier
this year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Ground Water Levels Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ground water levels in China's
capital have picked up for the first time in 40 years after a
"recharging underground river water" project.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale project began in September of 1995 and has
brought water levels in the western and southern parts of Beijing
along the Yongding River up more than four meters.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation departments use movable rubber dams or river
gates to raise water levels in some rivers.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 million cu.m. of surface water has gone
underground along the Yongding and Chaobai rivers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has a population of more than 12 million, but per
capita water resources were only 400 square meters, a 25th of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
Experts here predict that, over the next 20 years, Beijing's
water supplies are expected to go down as per capita consumption
doubles.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has seen three water crises since the founding of new
China in 1949, and the excessive extraction of ground water has
caused the water table to drop from two meters deep in the 1950s
to some 15 meters in many areas.

<HEADLINE> Aftermath Of East China Typhoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua)-- People in parts of Zhejiang
province who were hit by flooding for three days because of
typhoon Winnie were evacuated to safer ground, and they have
started rebuilding their homes.
</P>
<P>
People in the city of Taizhou began repairing a 300-kilometer
sea wall yesterday morning. The same is true for five sea walls in
Wenling City, where the typhoon slammed into Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has asked local governments to help
the hardest hit, and to resume industrial and agricultural
production in disaster areas as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, visited Taizhou,
which was the hardest hit, to talk to local people yesterday. The
Zhejiang Military Region has also sent troops to help the people
of Sanmen, Ninghai and Luqiao.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say the typhoon was the most violent to hit
China in a decade. It flooded 10.97 million mu (730,000 hectares)
of farmland and 24 cities and towns in Zhejiang and resulted in
direct losses of 20 billion yuan (about 2.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In spite of the heavy losses, local departments are trying to
provide enough rice and non-staple foods to typhoon-hit areas, and
health departments have sent medical teams and medicines.
</P>
<P>
Officials say most power and communications had been restored,
and the airports in Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo and Luqiao were
operating yesterday.

MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today approved a 12.5 million U.S. dollar loan to the Kyrgyz
Republic to help it establish a rural credit union network.
</P>
<P>
The Rural Financial Institutions project, which represents a
move away from the traditional approach of providing rural credit
through financial institution, will help establish 280 credit
unions across the country's six regions.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is due for completion by September 2004, is
expected to cost a total of 22.1 million U.S. dollars, the ADB
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan is interest-free, carries a service charge of 1
percent per annum and is repayable over 40 years, including a

<HEADLINE> Regional Life Insurance Meeting To be Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 life insurance
 practitioners from the Asia-Pacific region will share their
experience in insurance business at a four-day conference which is
 to open in Hong Kong tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
There will be about 70 keynote speeches, workshops and
exhibitions during the fourth Asia Pacific Life Insurance Congress
 (APLIC), the theme of which is "The New Horizon".
</P>
<P>
Some 50 renowned insurance professionals from around the world
will deliver speeches at the Congress to share their experience
and skills among the participants.
</P>
<P>
Tony Mak, chairman of the APLIC, told a news briefing here
today that Hong Kong being chosen as the host of Asia's largest
life insurance congress this year "signifies international
confidence in Hong Kong's insurance industry after the handover."
Preparations for the insurance gala started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance industry has great potential in the Asia-Pacific
 market, he said. Only 40 to 50 percent of Hong Kong's whole
population are life insurance policy holders -- a ratio much lower
 than that of the developed market in the U.S. and Europe, and the
 current total premium income of life insurance account for a
small proportion of the GDP in the region.
</P>
<P>
With the aging of population, the protection of the elderly has
 become a worldwide concern. Mak said that when more and more
people become aware of the need for life insurance, the industry
will brace for promising prospects.
</P>
<P>
This year's Congress is hosted by the Life Underwriters
Association of Hong Kong, which has 22,000 registered insurance
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Held every two years in different cities in the Asia-Pacific
Region, the APLIC held its first three congresses in Singapore,
Malaysia and Australia. The next APLIC will be held in the
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
stronger against the U.S. dollar today despite falling prey to
profit-taking which knocked it back off its intraday highs.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar traded between 74.43 and 74.69 U.S. cents
before closing at 74.44.
</P>
<P>
Overnight players bought in the currency in New York as
sentiment grew that the Reserve Bank of Australia will not cut
interest rates again in the near term, IBJ's senior foreign
exchange manager Shane Spurway said.
</P>
<P>
"There may still be one more rate cut at the end of the year,
it is just a matter of waiting for the data to come through," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the local session was quiet with prices trading in
a narrow range for much of the day, but the short end managed to
lift up off its intraday price lows toward the close.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar was at 87.79 from
87.74 against the Japanese yen, and was at 1.3814 from 1.3712
against the German mark.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Higher Growth Rate for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite successive bankruptcies of
the country's conglomerates, including the Kia Group, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast a high economic
growth rate of 6.5 percent for South Korea this year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP-based IMF figure, released today, is much higher than
the 5.7 percent the international economic body predicted in May.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that a series of insolvencies of conglomerates
such as Hanbo and Kia would not seriously affect the nation's
total production and exports capability.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, South Korea's exports and investment would
revive and thus raise the economic growth rate, the IMF added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also estimated a stable 4.5 percent in consumer prices
and 20 billion U.S. dollars in current account deficit this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea said Wednesday that the nation's
GDP growth rate reached 5.9 percent in the first half this year,
predicting that the nation's GDP growth rate would reach about 7
percent, far exceeding its earlier forecast of 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dengfeng Endeavors to Become Fine Tourist City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Tourists who visit China's
famous Shaolin Temple may be surprised to find that Dengfeng, in
Henan province, where it's located, is a clean and beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
This was not the case just a few years ago, when the city gave
people the impression of being dirty and dishevelled.
</P>
<P>
Dengfeng remained a poor mountain city until the Shaolin Temple
became known to the world in film made in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists visit the temple and the Shaolin style of
martial arts every year, bringing a tremendous amount of money to
the backward city, and at the same time raising new questions for
the local government about how to turn the city into a modern
tourist center that meets tourist needs.
</P>
<P>
The government has built new tourist attractions, but has
decided to beautify the city as well, and has already spent 200
million yuan (24 million US dollars) on 10 key clean-up, road
improvement, lighting, and pollution control projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, 19 major roads have been built, 850 roads asphalted,
more than 300 flower beds built along streets, over 40,000 trees
planted, and 150,000 sq.m. of lawn planted. And, two garden-parks
have been added.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce pollution, the city has also built a sewage
treatment plant with a daily capacity of 5000 tons, and 10 garbage
disposal stations and a non-toxic garbage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has also opened six scenic areas and is
offering several tourist routes that feature martial arts,
religion, geology, archeology, astronomy, and mountain climbing.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Areas Experimenting With State Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal areas have been
experimenting with state-owned capital reforms by bringing them in
line with the market, "People's Daily" reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The reforms cover the fields of acquisitions, reorganization,
coalitions, stock transfers, and selling shares on the domestic or
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
State-owned property and assets used to be fixed for a long
time under the planned economy, with available assets not being
very efficient, resulting in large losses to the state.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen City in south China's Guangdong Province, which has
been a front runner in reforms, reported net state-owned assets of
26.6 billion yuan in 1996, a rise of 16 billion yuan from 1992.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, at the eastern end of the Yangtze River economic
belt, has helped stronger state-owned enterprises with better
capital operations.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Jiangsu Province, officials decided that 1997
was the year for adjusting the industrial structure, and capital
operations are an important means of doing this.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu's neighbor, also developed a program
this year to help breathe life into 10 billion yuan worth of
assets through acquisitions, bankruptcies, and auctions, and to
raise 12 billion yuan through the stock market.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 large enterprises in Shanghai now have brighter
prospects because of transferred business rights.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipality in north China has increased efforts to
attract more overseas funds, and last year used 3.9 billion
U.S. dollars worth of overseas investment, putting it second in
China in use of such funds.
</P>
<P>
Coastal areas have done some valuable experimental work in
establishing better management of state-owned assets by separating
authority, management, and supervision.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Industry Records Historic Breakthroughs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China has recorded monumental
progress in developing its power industry, with both the current
installed generating capacity of 236 million kw and annual
electricity output of 1.0794 trillion kwh ranking second in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Historic breakthroughs in power generation, modes of
investment, operating mechanisms and management systems have
effectively promoted the establishment of a complete and
relatively modern power industry, according to Minister of
Electric Power Shi Dazhen.
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview with Xinhua, the minister noted that
China's power sector has maintained an annual growth rate of
between 8-9 percent for five consecutive years. He noted new
medium- to large-sized generating units with capacity exceeding 10
million kw have been put into operation on annual basis over the
past nine years.
</P>
<P>
All urban areas and most rural areas are now linked to major
national power grids. China has developed 11 major national power
grids with a total installed capacity of 200 million kw, or 92.1
percent of the national total
</P>
<P>
Some 12 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
directly under the central government have met targets for
supplying electricity to every village under their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for 95 percent of the country's total rural
population to have access to electricity by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Shi said noted that the Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power
plants have been put into operation, and that the country has
diversified its sources of electricity. He added that hydropower
stations with installed generating capacities of four million kw
each have entered operations on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Large-sized generating plants with generating capacities of
over 200,000 kw each form the backbone of the country's power
grids, and account for more than 40 percent of the nation's total
installed power generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
The nation's five major inter-provincial power grids and 24
provincial power grids have installed state-of-the-art computer
control systems.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has succeeded in establishing a
multi-channel fund collections system for power construction.
</P>
<P>
China has attracted foreign investment of over 13 billion US
dollars for power development, and plans to expand fund-raising
channels by adopting various means, including bonds, shares and
loans.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited establishment of the China State Power Corporation as
signal that the nation's power industry has introduced
comprehensive reform to transform traditional operating
mechanisms and management systems.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Assured of British Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's expected aid from
Britain worth some 3.4 billion Shillings (about 56 million U.S.
Dollars) for 1998 will not be affected by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF)'s key loan suspension, British High
Commissioner Jeffrey James has said.
</P>
<P>
British High Commissioner to Kenya, Jeffrey James, assured
that Britain will continue its bilateral aid programs for Kenya,
noting these programs are largely geared towards poverty
alleviation, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"While the IMF has got its own criteria for giving or cutting
aid, the long-standing bilateral relations between Kenya and
Britain will not be jeopardized by the IMF's decision," James was
quoted as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also urged donor agencies and countries to channel more aid
through the private sector in Kenya to enhance their capacity and
make them pro-active.
</P>
<P>
Despite recent violence which seemed to have created some fear
about the suitability of Kenya as a good investment place, the
country's business climate remains very resilient, James added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British commissioner lauded the Kenyan
government for promoting and supporting small-scale sized
enterprises, saying it fostered the country's economic
development, especially in private sectors.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Manufacturing Sector Posts Poor Showing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' manufacturing
sector failed to sustain its recovery in June as its value and
volume indices both fell considerably compared with the year-ago
levels, the National Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, the Value of Production Index (VPI) in
key manufacturing enterprises fell by 5.3 percent to 433.8 in June
while the Volume of Production Index (VoPI) in the sector dropped
by 5.1 percent to 147.2, according to figures released by the
office.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office conducts a survey of key enterprises in
manufacturing monthly in order to provide flash indicators on the
performance of the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The VoPI, derived from the VPI and producers' price index with
1992 as a base year, is a measure of manufacturing output adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which usually contributes more than
22 percent to the country's gross national product (GNP),
performed poorly during the first quarter. But it recovered
significantly in April with its volume index gained a 9.3-percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
On a month-on-month comparison, the VPI slightly increased by
0.6 percent compared with May while the VoPI rose 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, decreases in value of production were
observed in 10 out of 16 major sub-sectors, including petroleum
products, food manufacturing, textile and transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
Among the gainers were electrical machinery, non-metallic
mineral products and beverage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, double-digit annual decreases in volume were
registered in seven sub-sectors, including petroleum refineries,
textile, wearing apparel and paper and paper products.
</P>
<P>
Among the volume decliners were electrical machinery,
non-metallic mineral products, beverage and food manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foilers Aim at Domination of Universiade Fencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Foilers from world fencing
powerhouse Italy are aiming at the domination of fencing tournament of
the 19th World University Games which begins here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The tournament will begin with the men's individual foil. The
Italians field a strong team in the event, including 24-year-old
Gabriele Magni, substitute at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the
recently held world championships in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Italians will face the challenges from the strong opponents
from Russia, Hungary and Cuba. China, which also send their best
foilers to the Universiade, is also capable of making some upsets.
</P>
<P>
In the women's foil, defending champion and Olympic champion
Valentina Vezzali is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
But it will not be easy for Vezzali to win the title at Sicily
Universiade because of the quality of the participants. Among her
opponents are Olympic chamipion Laura Badea of Romania and foilers
from France and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a difficult tournament to win," said the 27-year-old
Badea, "there are many strong opponents. Among them are the
Hungarians, the French and the Italians."
</P>
<P>
Badea finished a disappointing fifth at Fukuoka Universiade two
years ago. But two years later at Sicily, she is now one of the
best female foilers in the world.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Government Accuses UN and Alliance-led Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb government
issued a statement here today accusing the Multinational
Stablization Force (SFOR) and the International Police Task Force
(IPTF) for their forcible occupation of the police headquarters in
Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the SFOR and IPTF occupied with force the
building of the police headquarters and the three police stations
in the city of Banja Luka. They did so in the name of the Interior
Ministry of the Serb Republic, the Yugoslavia Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Three-hundred-and-fifty British and Czech soldiers, 50 armored
vehicles and several helicopters participated in the action.
</P>
<P>
The action took place following Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic's meeting with the International High Representative to
Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, and the United States envoy, Robert
Gelbard.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the SFOR and IPTF launched the action on the
requirement of Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
It could possibly lead to the split of the Serb Republic into
two powers, said Momcilo Krajisnik, member of the Presidency of
Bosnia. He thought that this anti-constitutional act of Plavsic's
might result in an anarchic state for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic got into serious disputes over important issues
with the parliament of the Serb Republic and the government in
early July.
</P>
<P>
She declared parliament dissolved on July 3. On July 7,
the government challenged her in the constitutional court, which
declared, on August 15, the president's decision unconstitutional
and, therefore, invalid.
</P>
<P>
With the conflicts of the two disputed sides turning white-hot,
the U.S.-led Western countries overtly indicated their support for
Plavsic.

<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac Wednesday took advantage of the first
government cabinet session after the summer vacation to climb to the
crenel: He expressed deep reserves over the government's draft law
on employment for the youth, which calls for the creation of 350,000
jobs by the state.
</P>
<P>
-- The 300,000 Tziganes in the Czech Republic, subjected to
violence and racism after the fall of the Berlin Wall, are seeking
to emigrate to Canada to start a new life. Seventy percent of the
Tziganes in the country are jobless, and some regions in northern
Bohemia and Moravia have turned into real ghettos and pockets of
misery ignored by the government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Three weeks after the last bombing attack by Hamas in
Jerusalem, Yasser Arafat rallied on Wednesday with the Palestinian
Islamic movements at a ``conference of national unity'' during which
Islamic militants called for armed actions against Israel, while
Arafat called for the adoption of a unified position by Palestinians
``to face up to the challenges of this dangerous period.''
</P>
<P>
-- The number of tax-payers for family wealth tax -- the ISF --
in France has dropped to 174,726 in 1996, 1,200 fewer than 1995, and
the ISF income last year amounted to 8.92 billion francs (1.78
billion U.S. dollars), less than the 9.07 billion francs (1.81
billion U.S. dollars) expected by the government, according to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance. One of the reasons behind this
could be the transfer of properties by wealthy French families to
foreign countries.

CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Cabinet has approved a transportation
agreement with Russia in an effort to promote cooperation between
the two countries in this field.
</P>
<P>
The decision was published on the Wednesday edition of the
Official Gazette, according to the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will cooperate closely
on transportation regulations, facilities and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by representatives of the two sides in
the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on June 18 when the fourth
meeting of the Turco-Russian Joint Transportation Committee was
held.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Government offices in Abu Dhabi Emirate of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been urged to cut spending for
1998 to trim a persistent budget deficit, the UAE's Wam news
agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi finance department has sent letters to the local
ministries in the wealthy emirate to ask them to submit their
draft budgets before September 25, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
"All departments are urged to make significant reductions in
their expenditure for 1998," said the letter published by Wam.
</P>
<P>
"Spending should be evaluated according to real needs of
each department, taking into consideration lower spending for
unnecessary requirements," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a surge in oil earnings in 1996, the deficit in
the UAE's overall budget was as high as some 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Tunisia has so far exported 20,745 tonnes of olive oil

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Local media praised
Chinese football team after they became the first team to advance
into the quarter-finals of the 19th World University Games.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the Chinese eleven beat Nigeria 2-1 for
their second straight victory in group D. They trounced Czech
Republic 4-0 in their first outing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two victories gave the Chinese team six points and ensured them
a place in the quarter-finals after the United States were forced to a
2-2 draw by Czech Republic in the other group D match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local media were surprised to see that it was the Chinese team
but not the Italian team to enter the quarter-finals first. But they
gave the right response immediately by praising the Chinese players as
"talented" and "promising".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, the same one which took part in the World Youth
Championships in Malaysia in May, are not in their full strength as
four players have been called to the Chinese national team while three
more players didn't come to the Universiade due to injury.

<HEADLINE> 7,700 Precious Tibetan Books Now in US Congress Library: US Librarian Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Susan Meinheit, librarian at the
U.S. Library of Congress, noted today that the facility houses a
collection of some 7,700 precious Tibetan books, most of which
were brought to the country by western diplomats and explorers.
</P>
<P>
"The collection includes more than 300 rare volumes and
original copies," according to Meinheit, who presented a detailed
paper and report to the library's Tibetan collection to the 1997
Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies which opened yesterday in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
She said: "the library also has more than 300 xylographic and
hand-written manuscripts."
</P>
<P>
She noted that William Rockwill, U.S. envoy to China in 1905,
presented the library with 65 volumes of original Tibetan books,
including a rare edition of "Changtiao Shu" (plate book) wrapped
in yellow silk.
</P>
<P>
A handwritten note from Rockwill indicates that the book was a
gift from the 13th Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Changtiao Shu", a unique type of Tibetan book wrapped in fine
silk, consists of unbound xylographic pages in wooden covers.
</P>
<P>
Meinheit noted that two Americans -- Dr. Berthold Laufer
(1874-1934) and explorer Joseph Rock (1884-1962) -- were also
major contributors to the library. Laufer sold to the library the
Chien-lung Palace Edition of the Mahayana Sutra which was printed
in rare red ink.
</P>
<P>
Scholars with the Beijing Library note that a large number of
ancient Tibetan books can be found in numerous foreign countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
For example, a unique volume of the ancient Tibetan Medical
Dictionary, the oldest and most detailed publication of its kind,
is housed in London's Museum of Great Britain. Chinese scholars
must visit the museum to read, microfilm or copy the original.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Library, China's largest library, currently houses
a collection of 3,500 volumes of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, and
1,500 Tibetan studies books published since 1949.

JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African cabinet
ministers Wednesday approved plans to get tough on fishing
vessels poaching in remote waters near Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the presidential office today said the
cabinet meeting studied a report stating that poaching within
South Africa's economic zone around the Prince Edward Islands is
likely to cut fish numbers severely.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet approved a joint operation plan to enforce the

<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Environmental Affairs said the
plan is for the navy and air force to begin air and surface

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expands Cuts in Customs Duties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has ordered reduction of
import duties on certain goods, the second in a month, as part of
its program to liberalize trade.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reduce the prices and improve the standard of
living of the Egyptian people, President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday
issued a decree to change the state's tariffs and customs
regulations to provide further customs reductions, the Egyptian
Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The customs reduction covered medicine, baby milk formula,
computer sets, software and programs, printing paper, certain
sorts of ready-made clothes, gold items, and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is one of a series of customs reduction measures
started in September 1996," said Finance Minister Mohi Eddin
el-Gharieb.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to further reduce customs on the long
run to cope with the ongoing Egyptian trade liberalization
measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, the Egyptian government ordered tariffs cut by five
percentage points for most consumer goods, such as televisions,
washing machines, gas oven, refrigerators and other home
appliances, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The reductions are part of an economic liberalization program
approved with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and came in
the wake of an IMF executive board meeting in Washington on July
16 that reviewed an internal second quarterly report on the
Egyptian government's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
But the decision did not mean that the government would lift
its protection for national industry, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Rather, "the reductions take into consideration the national
industry by providing an acceptable and suitable amount of
protection," he added.

<HEADLINE> Papua New Guinea Has High Incidence of HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) was on
the verge of an AIDS epidemic that could be as serious as in some
African countries such as Uganda with young women the main risk
group, PNG health authorities and the WHO representative here
warned today.
</P>
<P>
PNG now has the third highest per capita incidence of HIV
infection in the Pacific Rim region, the country's Health Minister
Ludger Mond said today while announcing plans to develop a
national HIV/AIDS strategy.
</P>
<P>
There are 745 reported cases of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus), the virus that causes AIDS, in PNG. However, Mond said
this was only likely to be the "tip of the iceberg" with the real
figure estimated at 10,000, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
PNG's population stood at 4.074 million in 1995, according to
official estimates.
</P>
<P>
Of the reported cases, 629 are in the Port Moresby district
where better health services allow for the detection of the virus.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization's PNG Representative Dr. Paul
Chen said that immediate action through education programs was
needed to arrest the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence here is higher than Australia, higher than
Fiji, higher than New Caledonia and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And from that point of view, and the rapidity of the increase
... it shows that we are right in the midst of an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
"And if we don't do something fast we could end up like
Uganda... you would have seen the villages abandoned, people are
dying, a whole generation missing," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The highest HIV infection rate is among women aged 17 to 35,
according to Health Department statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of those under 26 with the infection were
women, according to the department's Deputy Secretary, Timothy
Pyakalyia.
</P>
<P>
Pyakalyia blamed the high rate of infection of young women on
the social disadvantages they face in PNG and their exploitation
by older men who were carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
"In developing countries younger females are basically being
exploited by older males who are financially secure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chen said that an education program was the main priority
of the strategy as he released an AIDS/HIV booklet which also
takes into account cultural aspects peculiar to PNG.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Public discontent with
South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) is growing,
according to a survey released Wednesday by the Human Science
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted in February this year shows that 73
percent of all South Africans suspect the civil sevice is
corrupt, while 64 pecent think the government headed by President
Nelson Mandela is wasting taxpayers' money, local daily Sowetan
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Only one third of those questioned were satisfied with the
country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a total of 2,197 South Africans above
the age of 18 were polled in February.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that although the ANC government is losing
support, Mandela is enjoying more popularity. Sixty-one percent
feel Mandela is doing a good job, compared to 60 percent as
showed in a survey in February last year.
</P>
<P>
But satisfaction with the way in which the country was being
governed had dropped from 53 to 43 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction with provincial governments had also taken a
negative turn, with only four of the country's nine provinces
receiving a nod of approval from more than 50 percent from their
voters.

KAMPALA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- About to 50 to 70 percent of
Ugandans are infected with tuberculosis disease, reported the
local daily "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bukenya, Uganda's Mukono district leprosy and
tubercykisis control supervisor, was quoted as saying that TB is
a chronic and infectious disease caused by a mycrobacterum
tuberculosis. About 10 percent of them develop the disease.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement Tuesday at a TB control seminar held
in Mukono, about 30 km east of Kampala, the capital.
</P>
<P>
This percentage may be multiplied by 2 to 4 due to HIV
infection, because 66 out of every 1000 TB cases are HIV
positive.
</P>
<P>
Eight million people world-wide aged between 15 and 54 years
develop TB every year, and 2 to 3 million people die of
the disease annually, Bukenya noted.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Overseas Education Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese higher-learning
institutions are encouraged to co-operate with foreign
counterparts in science and technology to boost China's
economy in the 21st century, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities in China will make more efforts to
train more talented personnel for the country's economic sector,
Zhou Yuan ping, vice-minister of the State Education Commission
(SEC) said during an international symposium on inter-university
cooperation and exchange that opened in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, the first of its kind in China, attracted more
than 200 foreign participants from 100 universities in 17
countries and regions, including the United States, Canada,
Australia, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to well-known universities in inland areas such as
Beijing and Qinghua universities, officials from the University of
Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Baptist University also
participated.
</P>
<P>
Subjects during the three-day symposium included education
globalization; multilateral and cross-regional exchanges;
co-operation between universities and enterprises; and university
co-operation between eastern and western countries.
</P>
<P>
China has sent an average of 2,000 students abroad each year to
study in 103 countries and regions, and it receives more than
1,000 students each year from 150 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The State stepped up the reform of higher learning in the early
1990s, focusing on encouraging both government and non-government
organizations to run schools, restructuring colleges and
universities across the country, and improving curricula and
teaching programs.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Virtually Qualify for World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombia virtually assured
themselves of a place in the World Cup finals in France with a 3-0
victory over Bolivia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After the day's qualifiers, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador revived
their chances of entering the finasl with previous wins.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Paraguay look set to join Colombia, but the race
for the last of South America's qualifying places in next year's
World Cup was thrown wide open by Uruguay's 1-0 win over Chile.
</P>
<P>
The gap between fourth-placed Chile and eighth-placed Uruguay
was reduced to two points as three teams in the lower half of the
table scored important wins.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Uruguay, Peru cruised to a 3-0 win away to
minnows Venezuela while Ecuador came from behind for a 2-1 win
over Paraguay, who could have gone top of the single South
American group if they had won in Quito.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, who had the night off, still top the table with 25
points, followed by Colombia with 24 and Paraguay with 23. Chile
and Peru have 19, Ecuador 18, Bolivia and Uruguay 17 and hapless
Venezuela just three.
</P>
<P>
Each team has three games left, apart from Colombia, Ecuador
and Venezuela, who have only two.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Colombia are both one victory away from France
and as Colombia's next game is at home to Venezuela, they look set
to clinch their place in September.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay still have home games against Bolivia, who have only
taken one away point, and Venezuela and so should also secure the
four points they need fairly comfortably.
</P>
<P>
Chile play their last three matches at home, where they have a
100 percent record, but their next fixture is against Argentina, a
team against whom they tend to suffer from an inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvians have two home games left but their match in Chile
in October is likely to prove crucial. Uruguay's next game is
away to Peru, before they travel to Buenos Aires to face
arch-rivals Argentina in October. Bolivia's remaining fixtures
are all tough away games and their chances look minimal.

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Leaders to Discuss Developments in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A summit of countries in
the Great Lakes region of Africa is expected to open in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha next week to discuss developments in
Burundi, according to an government official.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted the official (no name is
available) as saying on Wednesday that delegates to the meeting
are expected to arrive in Arusha on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, former Tanzanian President and facilitator in
the Burundi Peace Talks who will chair the forthcoming summit,
recently expressed his support to the continuation of economic
sanctions against Burundi, saying the regime of Major Pierre
Buyoya has not yet satisfied conditions for lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere made his remarks in Kinshasa during his recent trip to
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
He said that he supports the decision by the Great Lakes
foreign ministers' meeting in Kampala, Uganda earlier this week
to maintain the embargo on Burundi until the Buyoya regime makes
substantial progress for restoration of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in July last year to protest
Buyoya's overthrow of the elected government. The embargo is
observed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda,
Zimbabwe and the Democratic Congo.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Lift of Iraqi Pilgrim Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's foreign ministry
officially has expressed its welcome to Iraq's unilateral decision
to lift pilgrim travel ban on Iranians, a press report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Ali Asghar Khaji, foreign ministry
adviser and director general of the Persian Gulf affairs in a
meeting with Iraqi Charge d'affaires Salah al-Samarmad here
Wednesday, the English daily Iran News reported.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted the Iranian official as saying that the
Iranian administration was pleased at Iraq's lifting of a ban on
Iranian pilgrims visiting holy shrines within Iraq's borders.
</P>
<P>
He said that permission was a positive step toward solving
differences between the two nations, and it could help broaden
ties between Tehran and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"Tehran was ready to exchange delegations with Baghdad to work
out details of the pilgrimage," he added.
</P>
<P>
On August 18, Iraq informed Iran of its unilateral decision to
allow Iranians to visit Islam's shrines for the first time since
the 1980-88 war between the two Muslim neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the lifting of the travel ban began in 1990
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban is to be lifted on September 4, the date on
which Iraq marks the start of their 1980-88 conflict. But Iran says
the war started on September 22 when Baghdad launched an invasion
against Iranian southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's unilateral decision to lift travel ban would create a
good atmosphere for the two side to go in for rapprochement.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympic Organisers

committee," Coles said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Coles added there were about 10 South Pacific island nations
with Olympic committees, such as the Solomon Islands, Nauru, Papua
New Guinea, Fiji, the Cook Islands, Tonga and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal would be put to the heads of state at next
month's South Pacific Forum in the Cook Islands.

<HEADLINE> Expressway to Deng Xiaoping's Hometown Being Built </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guang'an, Sichuan Province, August 21 (Xinhua) -- When he left
his hometown in a mountainous part of southwestern China for study
in France 79 years ago, 14-year-old Deng Xiaoping rowed a small
wooden boat for four days to get to Chongqing, the nearest major
city, because there was no road.
</P>
<P>
Deng never went back to Paifang Village, Xiexing Town, Guang'an
County, where he was born on August 22, 1904, but now a 110-km
expressway from Guang'an to Chongqing, which is now China's
largest city, is finally being built.
</P>
<P>
"With the completion of the expressway, we won't have to walk
that dusty dirt road or ride that slow-moving boat," says
60-year-old Dan Wenquan, a farmer in Paifang who is one of
Deng's cousins, who is sitting in a farm house with pictures of
Deng Xiaoping on the walls of most of the rooms. "In order to get
to Chongqing, we used to follow dusty trails for eight or nine
days. It was very difficult for us to travel outside."
</P>
<P>
"It was not until 1958 that a dirt road was built between
Guang'an and Chongqing," he notes, "Before then rowing a wooden
boat was our major means of transportation."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a cement highway was built between Guang'an
and neighbouring counties, so, "We ride the bus or motorcycles
today," Dan says, pointing to the motorcycle in his house.
</P>
<P>
"But it still fell far short to meet the economic development
needs," adds Deng Jian, commissioner of Guang'an Prefecture,
"Transportation is still a handicap for the region's economic
development."
</P>
<P>
Guang'an's industrial output per capita is only one fifth of
China's average and the local people's purchasing power is only a
third of the national average, according to Deng. So Guang'an's
prosperity depends on the highway.
</P>
<P>
It will mean that it takes only an hour to reach Chongqing from
Guang'an on the expressway. Work on the expressway began in 1995
and it is set to open to traffic by the year 2000. It will cost
about one billion yuan (about 83 million US dollars), with the
central government allocating 420 million yuan and the local
governments raising the rest.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping is deeply loved by the people in his hometown
and the people throughout China," Deng Jian says, "And the highway
will be the best memorial to him."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Government Accuses UN and Alliance-led Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb government
issued a statement today accusing the Multinational Stablization
Force (SFOR) and the International Police Task Force (IPTF) for
their forcible occupation of the building of the police
headquarters in the city of Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the SFOR and IPTF occupied with force the
building of the police headquarters and the three police stations
in the city of Banja Luka. They did so in the name of the Interior
Ministry of the Serb Republic, the Yugoslavia Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Three-hundred-and-fifty British and Czech soldiers, 50 armored
vehicles and several helicopters participated in the action.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the action took place following Bosnian Serb
President Biljana Plavsic's meeting with the International High
Representative to Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, and the United States
envoy, Robert Gelbard.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the SFOR and IPTF launched the action on the
requirement of Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
It could possibly lead to the split of the Serb Republic into
two powers, said Momcilo Krajisnik, member of the Presidency of
Bosnia. He thought that this anti-constitutional act of Plavsic's
might result in an anarchic state for the nation.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic got into serious disputes over important issues
with the parliament of the Serb Republic and the government in
early July.
</P>
<P>
She declared parliament dissolved on July 3. On July 7,
the government challenged her in the constitutional court, which
declared, on August 15, the president's decision unconstitutional
and, therefore, invalid.
</P>
<P>
With the conflicts of the two disputed sides turning white-hot,
the U.S.-led Western countries overtly indicated their support for
Plavsic.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Users Out Against Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The users of Chittagong port are
contemplating legal action against the Chittagong Feeder Trade
Committee (CFTC) for imposing an "illegal" congestion surcharge at
Bangladesh's premier sea port, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If possible, we'll go for legal action," said Ahmed Chowdhury,
leader of the Bangladeshi delegation which negotiated with the
CFTC in Singapore early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based CFTC imposed congestion surcharge for a
month from August 16 following its unsuccessful talks with the
port users. The surcharge was fixed at the rate of 150 U.S.
dollars for a 20-foot container and 300 dollars for a 40-foot
container per day.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said as per the code of conduct of the UN convention
on shipping, the CFTC could not explain valid reasons or account
for the surcharge before the users.
</P>
<P>
"It is contrary to the international shipping convention.
Therefore, imposition of any such surcharge by the CFTC is totally
illogical and illegal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong port officials admitted that there was congestion at
the port in early July following heavy rains and a five-day
partial work stoppage by the workers but the situation has become
almost normal for regular handling of cargo vessels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chowdhury appealed to all to keep the Chittagong
port out of the purview of all kinds of political or other
programs for the sake of the country's economy. He also asked the
government to improve the port facilities and curb labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based feeder operators had imposed congestion
surcharge off and on from 1992 as a result of shortage of
container handling equipment and space in container yards and
unusual strikes.
</P>
<P>
The CFTC's latest congestion surcharge was imposed in September
1995 and was lifted on July 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador Win at World Cup South American Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador both kept
their slim chances for the World Cup finals alive with respective
victories in South American qualifiers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador came from behind to shock high-flying Paraguay 2-1 and
Peru hammered hapless Venezuela 3-0.
</P>
<P>
However, Chile, looking to finish third in the nine-team South
American group, went down to Uruguay 1-0.
</P>
<P>
The Chileans succumbed in Montevideo to a first-half goal from
Marcelo Otero of Italy's Vicenza and had Roland Fuentes sent off
on the hour.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's Paolo Montero also took an early bath near the end,
while teammate and Chelsea star Gustavo Poyet was one of five
players booked in a stormy encounter played before a 38,000 crowd.
</P>
<P>
In a hard-fought clash in Quito, Richard Baez scored after only
five minutes for Paraguay, second in the table behind Argentina
and despite their defeat still set to qualify as one of the best
four sides in the group.
</P>
<P>
Baez fired home in the visitors' first attack after a mistake
by keeper Francisco Cevallos as Paraguay began to entertain
thoughts of going top of the table with the Argentinians not
playing.
</P>
<P>
The goal stunned the 20,000 crowd at the Olimpico Atahualpa
stadium, already furious at the recent home defeat by Colombia and
an embarrassing draw with tailenders Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
But the Ecuadoreans stormed back after the break and Alex
Aguinaga headed the equaliser on 54 minutes from a cross by
impressive substitute Jose Gavica before Ariel Graziani settled
matters with the winner 13 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, looking to make the final stages of a World Cup for
the first time, now have 18 points from their 14 matches, one less
than Chile and Peru, who both have a match in hand.
</P>
<P>
Peru's triumph in Venezuela, who have yet to win a single game
in 14 attempts, lifted them to fifth in the table behind the
Chileans on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Marengo scored the Peruvians' opener on 13 minutes,
naturalised Brazilian Julinho hit the second after 56 minutes and
Flavio Maestri added a third in the closing stages.
</P>
<P>
Colombia were hosting Bolivia in a match which kicked off at
0200 GMT Thursday, looking to leapfrog Paraguay into second place
with three points.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia themselves retain an outside chance of qualifying and a
win in Colombia would put them fourth above Chile, who next host
leaders Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Aims To Improve Environment Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Environmental quality in China's
capital remains stable despite steady growth in the city's economy
and industry, according to a government report.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion contained in the report released by the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau yesterday on the
capital city's environmental situation last year, the China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken to control industrial pollution at source,
increase the use of clean fuel and reinforce controls on smoke and
dust emissions have resulted in a 36 percent decrease in dust and
dirt in urban and suburban areas compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
Apart from dirt and dust, other air pollutant indices did not
change very much from those in 1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 78 monitored rivers and 17 monitored reservoirs in
Beijing, 49.9 percent and 48.9 percent respectively have been kept
clean, which is basically unchanged from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yixin, director of the Environmental Protection Bureau,
noted that there are still a number of problems related to the
city's environment.
</P>
<P>
He said air pollution in the city generally remains serious,
especially during winter when large amounts of coal and charcoal
are burnt for heating.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase in the number of automobiles means that
pollution from car exhausts is getting worse on major roads and at
intersections.
</P>
<P>
Some river sections have been polluted by untreated sewage
discharges, and noise is still one of the main nuisances in
people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing still has much to do to improve its environment
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Government has decided that a total of 224
industrial pollution sources under Beijing's jurisdiction should
complete pollution control work by the end of this year, followed
by 138 sources in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The objective set for Beijing is to achieve 60 percent
treatment rates for urban sewage and non-toxic waste by 2000,
according to Zhao.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Growth Rate May Fall Below Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The industrial growth of India
is likely to be less than the targeted 12 percent in the fiscal
year of 1997-98 (April-March), the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Punjab-Haryana-Delhi Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, the assessment is based on a slowdown in
demand for manufactured goods, consumer products and capital goods
and the shortages in the infrastructure sector.
</P>
<P>
Industry has been "indifferent" to government policies aimed at
boosting industrial growth owing to the political uncertainty in
the country, the chamber noted.
</P>
<P>
The lack of infrastructural growth is evident in the enlarged
gap between demand and supply in the power sector which has
amounted to 26.9 billion kilowatt-hours, it said.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said in its report that the non-availability of
adequate finances is also a major constraint on the industrial
growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Commander-in-Chief of
Defense Forces Gustav Hagglund today met with Fu Quanyou, chief of
the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA),
and both sides agreed to strengthen exchanges and cooperation
between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Fu, who is also member of the Chinese
Central Military Commission, briefed Finnish officials and
officers on China's foreign policy, domestic situation, national
defense policy and the PLA.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people love and cherish peace, and China
will unswervingly stick to an independent peace-oriented foreign
policy, and will be committed to safeguarding world peace and
promoting common development.
</P>
<P>
On China's national defense policy, Fu pointed out that China
pursues a military strategic policy of active self-defense, and
opposes hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet in honor of the Chinese general, Hagglund said
that Finland is willing to establish and maintain a long-term
friendly and cooperative relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that China and Finland have no conflict of interests,
and developing and consolidating the stable, long-term friendly
cooperative relations between the two countries and the two armies
conform with the two people's interests and are beneficial to
world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Fu arrived here earlier today for a five-day official visit,
after visiting the United States where he met with U.S. government
and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Fu is expected to hold talks with President
Martti Ahtisaari, Defense Minister Anneli Taina and Hagglund. He
will also visit the three services of the Finnish army.

<TEXT>

NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral has said that the nation should mobilize itself
against illiteracy and the principle of "each one teach one"
initiated by Mahatma Gandhi should be revived country-wide, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Literacy holds the key to social change and progress, but the
facts and figures relating to illiteracy in the country do not
make us proud during the golden jubilee of our independence,"
Gujral said at a meeting held here Wednesday to review literacy
and adult education activities.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed serious concern about the lack of
progress in literacy among women, particularly among the
girl-children.
</P>
<P>
He said among the various difficulties in implementing literacy
and educational programs was slackening of the voluntary efforts.
</P>
<P>
The government would provide the maximum thrust to literacy
programs but the actual implementation has to be done through
voluntary efforts, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Adjusts Investment Policy to Attract     More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Wednesday
introduced a new investment plan, apparently relaxing its old
location-concentrated investment policy to attract more investment
and foreign exchange that the country eagerly needs to tide over
its current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan introduced by the Chavalit government,
location will no longer be the determining factor for investment
projects which could enjoy privileges offered by Thailand's Board
of Investment (BOI).
</P>
<P>
The government this time will focus its support on those
projects which could generate foreign exchange, create
considerable job opportunities, produce substitutes for import
goods and have a low import content.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently is undergoing an ordeal as the country sees
the depreciation of the baht, drop of foreign exchange reserves,
rising unemployment, threat of higher inflation, and the tortured
finance sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, the baht has depreciated by 25 percent after the
government floated the currency on July 2; the country's foreign
reserves have dropped below 33.2 billion U.S. dollars; the number
of employees laid off nationwide reached 7,600 during the first
seven months of this year, exceeding the figure recorded
throughout last year.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector in the country also suffered a torture of
liquidity and the government so far has suspended operations of 58
finance firms of the country's total 91.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has to turn to the International Monetary Fund and
other governments and international institutions for aid to help
prop up its foreign reserves and bail out its ailing finance
sector.
</P>
<P>
The change in the investment policy is in fact part of the Thai
government's efforts to draw foreign capital inflow to reinforce
the country's foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been following a policy of encouraging investment
in the provinces since 1972 to build local economies and improve
the living standards of people in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the BOI used a zoning system which divided the
country's 76 provinces (including Bangkok) into three investment
zones.
</P>
<P>
Investment in zone one, which covers Bangkok and its
surrounding provinces of Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Pathum Thani,
Nonthaburi and Nakhon Pathom, received no privileges from the
government.
</P>
<P>
Investment in zone two, which comprised provinces immediately
outside zone one - Samut Songkhram, Ratchaburi, Kanchanaburi,
Suphanburi, Angthong, Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Nakhon Nayok,
Chachoengsao and Chonburi - was granted limited privileges.
</P>
<P>
Investment in zone three which consisted of the remaining
provinces enjoyed support by the government with the full range of
privileges.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the old policy seemed to have some weaknesses as investors
were reluctant to go to the provinces with poor infrastructural
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had drawn huge sums of foreign investment during the
boom years, but a large part of this foreign capital flew into
non-productive sectors and caused a bubble economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The foreign capital began to flow out of the country in recent
years as the bubble burst, building up pressure on the country's
currency.
</P>
<P>
BOI Secretary-General Staporn Kavitanond stressed that the
principle of promoting investment in the rural areas still
remained the government's priority and the new policy would be
implemented on a short-term basis.
</P>
<P>
The new policy will be implemented as soon as possible to help
the country to get rid of the current economic grips, he noted.

<HEADLINE> More Protests Against Fuel Price Hike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's nationwide protest
against the price hike of petroleum products continued today amid
violence, rallies and spontaneous strike.
</P>
<P>
The government Monday refixed the prices of all petroleum
products, among which the petrol price rose sharply to 21 taka
(about 0.47 U.S. dollars) from 13.70 taka (about 0.31 dollars), in
a bid to keep pace with the international market.
</P>
<P>
This move, however, triggered sharp reactions among different
political parties and transport circles. The main opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which had threatened a
countrywide strike on August 24, launched its four-day agitation
program today.
</P>
<P>
The BNP is scheduled to hold protest rallies and bring out
processions in all counties, district and divisional headquarters
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the drivers of autorickshaw (motor tricycle), a
major transport means in Bangladesh, continued their strike today
in the capital Dhaka in protest against the price hike.
</P>
<P>
In southwestern Khulna district, the fuel distributors, truck
owners and workers have called a three-day token strike from
today.
</P>
<P>
In northern Rajshahi, about 1,000 autorickshaw drivers
Wednesday staged a demonstration in front of the city corporation
office. The mayor of Rajshahi city, who joined them, asked the
government to bring down the increased prices of petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
In the second-largest city Chittagong, the Petroleum Dealers
Association has asked the government to withdraw the increased
price by August 24.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ruling Awami (people's) League Presidium
at a meeting Wednesday night resolved that price increase of
petroleum products was "inevitable" for keeping it at par with the
price in world market.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that the country could no longer bear the
burden of 4.5 billion taka (about 101 million dollars) as revenue
loss in the fuel sector every year.

<HEADLINE> FBI Investigating Abuse of Missouri Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) said today that it was moving ahead with a
full-scale investigation of the abuse of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the alleged abuse has been broadcast nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Don Clark, the FBI agent in charge, said the agency made the
decision after talking to the district attorney of Brazoria
County, in southeast Texas, and viewing parts of the 30-minute
videotape broadcast Tuesday, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The tape shows guards kicking inmates in the groin, prodding
them with stun guns and allowing dogs to bite them. It also shows
guards dragging an inmate with a broken ankle by his arm.
</P>
<P>
The tape was reportedly made for training purposes by a
sheriff's deputy on September 18, 1996. One copy was obtained last
week by The Brazosport Facts newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Missouri state officials terminated a six million U.S. dollar
contract to house 415 inmates at the Brazoria County Detention
Center in Angleton, about 40 miles (60 kilometers) south of
Houston, after the videotape was showed.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the FBI, which is investigating whether prisoners'
civil rights were violated, would submit findings to the U.S.
attorney's office in Houston and the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Charles Wagner, chief deputy at the jail, denied that there was
brutality in the jail.
</P>
<P>
He said he told the guards: "Well, you have a training film
that shows what not to do."
</P>
<P>
"There's not any real brutality," he told The Brazosport Facts
newspaper.

Thurmer made the remarks at a mass rally to mark the country's

<P>
Faced with a historic choice, he said, Hungary would lose her
independence won not long before if she joins the NATO.

NATO needs Hungarian territory and military bases, he said,
while the country has even to cut her educational and medical
funds to meet the military need.
</P>
<P>
Thurmer added that the Hungarian leaders are misleading and
deceiving the masses, and appealed to all Hungarians to boycott
NATO membership by all means.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining neutrality is Hungary's only way out, the least
costly choice, Thurmer added.

Hungary is expected to become NATO's new member in April,

WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year loan of about 219 million
U.S. dollars to Cameroun to support its economic program.
</P>
<P>
The loan would help fund a 1997-2000 program designed to
achieve a real annual GDP growth of at least 5 percent, an average
annual inflation of 2 percent, and a 2 percent ratio of current
account deficit against GDP.
</P>
<P>
The loan carries a yearly interest rate of 0.5 percent and is
repayable over 10 years, with a 5.5-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The fund, under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), would contribute to the country's drive to obtain the
medium-term goal of putting the economy on a sustainable growth
path.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun joined the IMF in July 1963. The EASF is a
concessional IMF facility to assist member countries in their
economic reforms to achieve balance of payment and boost growth.

<HEADLINE> hke082112 - Myanmar Minister Calls for Boosting Marine Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Commerce Minister Tun Kyi
has called for boosting marine production and increasing the
number of fishing vessels which carry daily a large amount of fish
and prawns to Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with officials of the sector here Wednesday, Commerce
Minister Tun Kyi said the aim of the move is to increase supply
for domestic consumption and boost export for earning substantial
foreign exchange, The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged the marine sector to provide fishing
gear, distribute sufficient supply of prawn larvae, introduce
advanced production methods, reclaim more land for fish and prawn
breeding.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has permitted local private
entrepreneurs to operate some leasable fisheries.
</P>
<P>
It has also given permission to private organizations to import
off-shore fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment in livestock breeding and fishery
sector had reached 269.54 million U.S. dollars in 17 permitted
projects by the end of July this year, according to the latest
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies investing in Myanmar's fishery sector have
reportedly come from Thailand, China, Japan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar exploited about 590,000 tons of marine products
annually in the past few years out of the maximum sustainable
yield which is estimated at about 1.05 million tons per year.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water fish and marine fish production of the country
registered an annual growth rate of 8.9 and 39.5 percent
respectively in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending March.
</P>
<P>
The total export of livestock and fishery sector in the same
fiscal year amounted to 726 million kyats (121 million U.S.
dollars according to official exchange rate) with fish and prawn
as major export items.

way for the second stage of reform in the Bulgarian armed forces,
a switch to a professional army due to be completed in the coming
years, said Ananiev. An updated strategy for the development of
the Bulgarian army envisaged the formation of professional-only
units, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stage-by-stage transition to a professional army was
necessitated by the population drop and the ever decreasing number
of conscripts, said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The enlisted must meet requirements formulated in the Armed
Forces Act and requirements of the vacant military positions.
Under the law, only Bulgarian citizens under 35 years old who have
gone through general conscription and have no criminal record
qualify for enlistment. Contracts will be for three years, with a
possibility of extensions.
</P>
<P>
The Army, the Air Force and the Navy are each expected have 24
to 25 positions for volunteers. Forty-seven of the new enlisted
will serve in a newly-established Zone Headquarters that will
bring together the Sofia City, District and Regional Draft
Registration Offices.
</P>
<P>
The experiment, initially scheduled for February 1996 when the
Defense and Armed Forces Act was enforced, was delayed by money
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The professional soldiers will get a monthly salary of 127,910
leva (about 304.50 U.S. dollars) in the Army, 131,410 leva (3l3
dollars) in the Air Force and 193,430 leva (460 dollars) in the
Navy. Estimates by the General Staff show that a conscript costs
slightly more than that in upkeep.
</P>
<P>
Ananiev said that if the 1998 armed forces budget allocated
funds for recruiting professional soldiers, the General Staff
would be ready to utilize them immediately.
</P>
<P>
There are plans for reinstating a marine battalion and
positions in it would be available for the enlisted. Professional
soldiers would also be appointed to a Bulgarian-Turkish battalion
of blue helmets that was under preparation, Ananiev added.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 32,000 employees of
local car and parts industry are expected to be laid off by the
end of the year, according to the Automotive and Parts Association
of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Most Japanese manufacturers, with the exception of Honda, have
decided to cut productivity by 50 percent to reduce costs, Ninnart
Chaiteerapinyo, president of the association was quoted by today's
local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The industry employs about a quarter of a million people in
production, marketing, distribution and support.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, car firms and dealers have laid off
some 2,500 employees.
</P>
<P>
Car sales have dropped dramatically in the wake of the baht
depreciation on July 2. It is expected that total car sales
(including pick-up) will shrink by 40 percent to 360,000 units
this year from 589,000 units last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, 248,185 cars were sold
domestically and 14,000 exported. Domestic sales have declined
14.5 percent against the same period in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Toxic Residues to be Incinerated in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- About 200 tons of DDT and
heptachlorine toxic residues will be shipped Thursday to the
Ekokem company, Finland, for incineration, sources from the
Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua signed recently a contract with the company on the
shipment and destruction of the chemical wastes.
</P>
<P>
DDT and heptachlorine, banned worldwide for decades, were used
in Nicaragua until 1990 to kill malaria, yellow fever and dengue
mosquitos and for plague control on cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
Those toxic wastes can cause mortal diseases such as cancer and
damage fetus in pregnant women and fertility in men.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Latin American countries do not have suitable
equipment to destroy them and thus have to do it in Finland at the
cost of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Ekokem company has treated toxic residues in Riihimaki,
Finland, since 1984, and is currently handling around 80,000 tons
yearly.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) said today that it will join the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) in guaranteeing a short-term
bridging facility to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The guarantee is the first utilization of the one billion U.S.
dollars facility to the Bank of Thailand previously approved by
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release circulated here, the BIS has
agreed to provide a short-term bridging facility to the Bank of
Thailand in support of the country's "economic adjustments"
pending the drawdown of part of the International Monetary Fund
facility now being arranged.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the BIS, the HKMA has agreed to join the
central banks or monetary authorities of the G-10 countries and
other Asian and European economies in guaranteeing the bridging
facility by the BIS," the release said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the participation of Hong Kong, which is a
leading financial center in Asia and full member of the BIS, is a
reflection of Hong Kong's commitment to financial stability in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Exports from State-Owned Companies Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Exports from China's State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) posted a substantial rise in the first half of
this year while imports were down.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics indicate that exports by SOEs during that
period soared 25.2 percent from a year ago to 45.67 billion US
dollars while imports stood at 27.11 billion, down 5.6 percent on
a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The solid increases in exports by SOEs since the beginning of
this year are partly because SOEs have adapted themselves to state
policy adjustments, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As the state reduced its rebate rates, exports by SOEs plunged
during the first half of 1996. They started to bottom out later
last year when the state sped up its work to pay back the rebates
and most SOEs gradually adapted themselves to the new policy by
deepening their internal reforms, it said.
</P>
<P>
The negative growth in imports by SOEs mainly stemmed from
sluggish domestic demand, unsatisfactory economic returns of some
SOEs and their shortage of working capital.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics also suggested that general trade retained
its dominant position in SOEs foreign trade in the period. General
exports jumped 31.5 percent to 29.57 billion US dollars and
imports declined 14.1 percent to 13.3 billion dollars, making up
64.7 percent and 49.1 percent of SOEs' exports and imports in the
period, respectively.

<HEADLINE> International Officials Discuss Bosnian Serb Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- International officials today
held talks on the future of Bosnia, especially the Serb crisis, in
the Russian embassy in Vienna, the Austria Presse Agentur (APA)
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All participants believed that the situation in Bosnia's Serb
Republic is "grave", according to the U.S. embassy in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The international community should fully support the force in
the Serb Republic that stands for the implementation of the Dayton
peace accords, which ended the three-and-a-half year civil war in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Top international official in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp,
representatives of the Contact Group and U.S. special envoy to
Bosnia, Robert Gelbard, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, composed of representatives from the United
States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, monitors the
implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
The talks will continue Thursday within the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, APA said.
</P>
<P>
A crisis among the Bosnian Serb leadership began in early July.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Biljana Plavsic dissolved the parliament on July
3, but the decision was strongly opposed by parliament and the
Serb government believed to be actually controlled by former
president Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled last week that Plavsic's
decision was unconstitutional and invalid. Plavsic rejected the
verdict of the court.
</P>
<P>
Among the wrangling of the Serb leadership, western countries
led by the United States voiced support for Plavsic and are trying
to force Karadzic out of the political arena and bring him to
trials before the International Criminal Tribunal for former
Yugoslavia in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who led Serbs in the Bosnian war, has been indicted
by the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, British and Czech troops of the
NATO-led multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR) today surrounded
four police stations and one police academy in Banja Luka, a
northern Bosnian town, to help Plavsic boost her authority in the
town.
</P>
<P>
Police chiefs loyal to Karadzic were removed from their posts
and truckloads of weapons were found, SFOR said.

NEW YORK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows that some of the
brightest high school students in the United States support death
penalty on criminals as a way to check growing domestic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The finding is part of a recent opinion poll conducted among a
group of top high school students in 46 states, the activity's
sponsor Panasonic Consumer Electronics Company said today in
Secaucus, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 65 percent of the respondents said
that the death penalty on convicts like Timothy Mcveigh who was
found guilty for the Oklahoma City bombing should be imposed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 62 percent of the people in the poll saw the
incidence of domestic terrorism on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Regarding advertising, three fourths of the respondents felt
that flashy ads would influence minors by encouraging them to buy

Advertisements that promote other questionable behavior to
teenagers, such as drinking, should be banned, half of the people
surveyed said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Trade Deficit Declines in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's trade deficit
declined by 27.3 percent to 173.75 billion baht (6.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first half of this year as compared with the same
period of last year, according to official figures issued by the
Business Economics Department of the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the deficit was attributed to an export rise of 3.6
percent to 724.06 billion baht (28.3 billion dollars) in the
period, and an import volume drop of 4.3 percent to 897.81 billion
baht (35.1 billion dollars), today's local press quoted Karun
Kittisataporn, director-general of the department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Karun said that improved export figures for the first half
reflected the real abilities of exporters since the baht had not
weakened until after the July 2 floating.
</P>
<P>
Karun said Thailand had been able to increase exports to
several key markets in the first half. Exports to the United
States were up 10.1 percent, to Malaysia up 42.9 percent, to Hong
Kong up 7.4 percent, and to China up 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, exports to Japan were down 2.6 percent, to Singapore down

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Breast Milk Bank Serves Mothers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The "Children Food and Breast Milk
Bank" Center in Bulgaria provides free breast milk to nursing
mothers unable to breast feed.
</P>
<P>
The center is in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria. Its Breast Milk
Bank was built in June, 1989 in response to a decision by the
Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Director of the center, Tania Vasileva, said today that in
addition to providing free human milk to hospitals and "homes for
mothers and babies", the bank also provided free milk to sick
nursing mothers not able to breast feed.
</P>
<P>
Those willing to buy breast milk can get a liter from the bank
for only 1,239 Lev (about 67 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The costs of the bank are subsidized by the Sofia municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
"Milk contributors" voluntarily provide milk and get some
payment. Staff members from the bank also make house calls to
collect milk.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian women normally dislike nursing their babies with
others' milk, and are very concerned about the quality of the milk
provided by the bank, Vasileva said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure quality, the bank has a laboratory which checks for
microorganism in the milk.
</P>
<P>
At present the bank receives 268 liters of breast milk every
month from 21 donors.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Greece, Bulgaria is the only country which boasts
such a bank on the Balkan Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Bounces Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of
rupiah strengthened Wednesday, rising by 100 points against the
U.S. dollar while the stock market gained ground to break a
six-day losing streak following Bank Indonesia's move to raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,845/2,875 against the American
greenback, dropped to 2,865/2,875 at midday but the currency
strengthened in the afternoon to close at 2,765/2,775, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the central bank raised its one-week certificates
rates from 10.5 percent to 20 percent, two-week rates from 11
percent to 22 percent, one month rates from 11.625 percent to 30
percent and three month rates from 11.5 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jakarta Stock Exchange also performed well
Wednesday, with the composite index increasing 0.45 percent to
close at 593.17 points -- the first rise since August 12.
</P>
<P>
Stock brokers ascribed the increase to a small measure of
confidence because of gains in the rupiah, but cautioned that the
sentiment was still overriding.
</P>
<P>
The value of the rupiah has been declining since the middle of
July. It dropped sharply against the dollar after the central bank
scrapped its intervention band last Thursday. The rupiah dipped to
a new low of 3,010 rupiah to the dollar on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Stops Lending to Boost Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
already suspended its overnight lending facility to banks
indefinitely as part of its bid to support the
speculation-battered local currency peso, the local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Central Bank Treasury Director Eileen
Bautista as saying the closure of the bank's lending window
starting Wednesday has effectively reduced the ability of the
banks to "play with the foreign exchange rate."
</P>
<P>
"The unavailability of the peso means less play on the dollar,"
she explained. "Banks will be cautious to take dollars since they
will have to give up their local currencies."
</P>
<P>
Banks were caught off-guard by the Central Bank's decision to
close its lending window, a crucial source of overnight funds for
banks covering reserve deficiencies, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The move was interpreted by some economic observers as a
prelude to increase the liquidity reserve requirement which had
already been hiked from a mere 2 percent to 5 percent on August
14.
</P>
<P>
By refusing to lend to banks, the Central Bank seeks to prevent
the infusion of additional peso liquidity into the system. Lending
to banks, observers say, is tantamount to releasing fresh money
supply into the system.
</P>
<P>
At the domestic currency market, the peso tumbled to 30.24
pesos to one dollar in intra-day trading Monday, the lowest since
its de facto devaluation starting July 11. The peso-dollar rate
appreciated slightly to an average of 30.03 pesos to one dollar
Wednesday. There was no trading Tuesday because of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is reportedly standing firm on its decision to
keep itself from the currency market and let the foreign exchange
rate be determined by market forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania became the first European
team to qualify for the World Cup finals when they beat Macedonia
4-2 in Bucharest on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's 0-0 home draw with Lithuania meant that the
Romanians, quarter-finalists in 1994, cannot be caught in group
eight after winning all seven qualifiers to date.
</P>
<P>
Two goals by Viorel Moldovan and one each for Constatin Galca
and Ilie Dumitrescu rewarded Romania the honor as the first
European qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Three times winners Germany looked on course for an
embarrassment against Northern Ireland in Belfast when Michael
Hughes scored in the 59th minute for the home team. Substitute
Oliver Bierhoff played the Savior by scoring a hat-trick in six
minutes to earn a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Germany stay second, two points behind Ukraine in group nine
with two games in hand. Ukraine needed a goal three minutes from
time by Serhiy Rebrov to beat Albania while third placed Portugal
play Armenia later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Group one provided the night's surprise when Bosnia beat
Denmark 3-0 to blow the group wide open.
</P>
<P>
The Danes still head the standings by three points but still
have to play their main challengers Greece and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
A second half hat-trick from veteran striker Anton Polster gave
Austria a 3-0 win against Estonia in group four and Sweden kept
close by caming from behind to win 2-1 in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Scotland still lead the group with 17 points with Austria
second on 16 and Sweden third on 15.
</P>
<P>
Turkey kept alive their slim chances in group seven by beating
Wales 6-4 in a remarkable game in Istanbul where striker Hakan
Sukur scored four goals.
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory Turkey are still unlikely to qualify as the
Netherlands and Belgium are five points clear with the top three
each having two games left.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's Lyuboslav Penev hit the only goal of the game after
69 minutes in Sofia to take his country to the top of group five.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria now have 15 points, one ahead of Russia. They have
been guaranteed the top two places in the group, with top spot yet
to be contested.
</P>
<P>
Iceland collected their first win of the campaign with a 4-0
victory over point-less Liechtenstein in group eight.

NEW YORK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. company Unique
Mobility Inc. has set a target of seizing 10 percent of the
U.S. bicycle market by introducing an electric-powered model.
</P>
<P>
The new model, due to be on market next June, would make up a
tenth of the current yearly sales of 10 million bikes in the
United States, or one million bikes, Lee Iacocca, the company's
biggest shareholder, told the company's annual shareholders'
meeting in Golden, Colorado, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iacocca, former chairman of the automobile giant Chrysler, said
an "electric revolution" is starting with bicycles and would
spread to the car industry, according to his 50-year experience in
the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about one million Americans have bicycles
and a growing number of people bike to work.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Plant Computer System Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a new
nuclear power plant computer system, which will be exported to
Pakistan, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Distributed Control System, manufactured by the Beijing
Holysys Automation Co. Ltd., which is under the Sixth Research
Institute of the Ministry of the Electronics Industry, will serve
Chashma's 300 megawatt (MW) nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference yesterday, Wang Changli, general
manager of the company, said the computer system has been checked
and accepted by the departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that we can export such a large-scale
hi-tech product to other countries," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that after three years' effort, the computer system
has been brought up to advanced international standards in its
performance, function and reliability, based on co-operation
between the company and the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research
and Design Academy.
</P>
<P>
The company has also signed a contract with the Qinshan Nuclear
Power Plant to provide a computer control system for the plant's
second-phase project, which includes the installation of two 600
MW nuclear generators.
</P>
<P>
"The second-phase project needs high-quality and advanced
products and we believe our people currently have the ability to
produce advanced computer systems," said Zhang Huazhu, deputy
manager of the China Nuclear Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
In other words, China can provide its own control system for
some State-level key projects instead of relying on products from
other countries, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China used a French computer control system in
its Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and the first-phase project of
the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Sixth Research Institute has developed two
kinds of distributed control system, which have become competitive
in the Chinese market against other world-renowned systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000
Colombian dock workers have begun a four-day strike in the
Buenaventura seaport, demanding freight and fuel price cuts, the
strike organizers said today.
</P>
<P>
The strike, called by the Colombian Association of Teamsters
(ACC), is in protest against middlemen's high freight charges and
the 8 percent rise on fuel prices decreed last week by the Mines
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 trucks loaded with import and export goods
blocked the city, 300 kilometers southwest of the capital,
freezing cargo flow at the Pacific port and causing about one
million U.S. dollars loss, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
But ACC President Javier Suarez said the strike has not
affected ship-loading and about 1,000 trucks carry an average of
30,000 tons of goods to and from the port every day.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region is
home to some 1,700 of China's over 3,000 Tibetan Buddhist
monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The over 130,000 monks and nuns, including 34,000 in Tibet, and
some 1,800 Living Buddhas have met the needs of Tibetan believers,
according to Cao Ziqiang, vice-president of the Advanced
Buddhism College of Tibetan Language Family.
</P>
<P>
The number of monasteries fell sharply during the chaotic
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), a period in which respect for a
person's right to religion was nonexistent in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, extensive government support since the 1980s has led
to the restoration, rebuilding and reopening of large numbers of
temples. The development of Tibetan Buddhism has entered a golden
historical stage, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that central and local departments have sponsored and
established Tibetan Buddhism education in order to ensure the
continued prosperity of the religion. The relatively large-scale
education system makes used of both old and new approaches.
</P>
<P>
The traditional monastic system was introduced 1,200 years ago
and was the primary form of Tibetan Buddhist education prior to
the mid-20th century. According to Cao, this particular form of
education continues to flourish with various monasteries offering
over 600 sutra studies classes to over 10,000 student monks.
</P>
<P>
A modern education system has also formed around the Advanced
Buddhism College of the Tibetan Language Family. The college is
responsible for training senior teachers, researchers, monastic
management personnel and international Buddhist activists.
</P>
<P>
Cao added that older academic studies areas, such as
calendaring and Sabdavidya, or the science of words and their
meanings, are being appropriately protected in the face of
challenges arising during the modern era.

<P>
A high-tech refinery, to be launched by the Cuban government

<P>
This is to generate more foreign currency for the country,
Cuban Vice Minister for sugar industry Francisco Rodriguez was
quoted as explaining.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Irregular businesses have
increased sharply in Costa Rica since 1990, the Economy Ministry
and the Chamber of Industry said.
</P>
<P>
Irregular firms -- which are those that do not fulfill legal
requirements to operate -- rose from 4,223 in 1990 to 6,329 in
1996, a 50 percent increase, the Economy Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In Contrast, regular companies increased slightly, from 4,463
to 4,835 in the same period, an eight percent rise.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 85 percent of newly-created companies since 1990 have
been irregular businesses, a result thought to have been brought
about by the country's economic crisis, and the numerous
requirements demanded when establishing a company.
</P>
<P>
The economy in Costa Rica has shrunk in the past two years, but
a slow growth is expected in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The irregular economy has been fueled by mass layoffs because
of recent economic reform.

<P>
ISTANBUL, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Hakan Sukur scored four goals
to help Turkey beat Wales 6-4 in a World Cup European Zone group
seven qualifier here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Wales, playing only for their pride against a Turkish team who
needed a win to maintain an outside chance of qualifying, were 2-0
down after seven minutes but stayed calm.
</P>
<P>
They came back with goals in the 18th from Nathan Blake and
22nd from Robbie Savage and then took the lead from the home side
in the 34th when Ryan Giggs sent a beautifully weighted cross into
the box for Dean Saunders to score.
</P>
<P>
Sukur, who had opened the scoring in the fifth minute,
equalised just before half-time, slotting past Ceri Hughes
outstretched foot for 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Wales again took the lead in the 52nd minute through Andy

<HEADLINE> Petrochemical Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
highest administrative body, has approved a proposed merger
between the Yihua Group Corp., Yangzi Petrochemical Corp., Jinling
Petrochemical Corp. and Nanjing Chemical Industrial Group.
</P>
<P>
According to today's"China Daily, a senior official with the
China National Textile Council said that the merger will help
stabilize the domestic chemical fiber market and help Yizheng, a
major chemical fiber producer in China, obtain a stable supply of
raw materials.
</P>
<P>
After merging, the group will become a conglomerate with total
assets reaching 50 billion yuan (about six billion US
dollars). Yizheng is one of the world's biggest polyester
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China's chemical fiber industry will
construct 20 large production bases of chemical fibers and raw
materials in the coming years and Yizheng is one of them.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the redundant construction of the four companies,
which are all located within 30 kilometers from Nanjing, capital
of Jiangsu Province, affected the utilization of resources and
weakened their own competitiveness. Experts said the four
companies should be suppliers of raw materials for each other.
</P>
<P>
Sources said a special company under the State Economic and
Trade Commission is expected to be established later this year to
become the holding company of the merged companies.

The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Inherited breast cancer is much rarer than previously
thought, with Australian research suggesting only five percent of
cancers in women under 40 are caused by one of the known breast
cancer genes, rather than the 30 percent scientists quoted
previously.
</P>
<P>
-- Economic cycles in East Asian countries appear to be
replacing those in the United States as the driving forces behind
short-term fluctuations in Australia's growth, leaving local
exporters vulnerable to the vagaries of the tiger economies.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Aborigines in Australia signed an agreement yesterday which
for the first time guarantees a company the right to explore and
mine the entire northeast Kimberley region in Western Australia.
The deal gives a diamond miner the right to explore the vast area
and to develop open-cut mines without further talks with
traditional owners or reference to native titles laws if the land
is claimed by aborigines.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australian troops may be deployed in Bougainville in
neighboring Papua New Guinea as part of a United Nations-sponsored
peace mission to the war-ravaged Pacific island, according to a
secret contingency plan made by the Australian Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>

ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nine days after his
disappearance, Larry Gonzales, a U.S. airman stationed at the

<HEADLINE> Greece Dismisses Turkish Official's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece today dismissed the
statements made by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit,
saying that such statements ran completely contrary to the letter
and spirit of the joint communique signed between the two
countries in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
In statements to a Turkish daily newspaper Tuesday, Ecevit
expressed displeasure with the European Union (EU) for supposedly
"excluding" Ankara and accepting Cyprus for membership. He also
rejected as "ridiculous" the possibility of Turkey having recourse
to the international court at the Hague over its territorial
claims on the Greek islets of Imia.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today criticized
Ecevit's statements as "lacking seriousness and responsibility,"
warning that Ankara's such policy left no room for an improvement
of Greek-Turkish ties, nor for progress in the neighboring
country's relations with the EU.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cyprus problem, Reppas said that if the statements
reflected official Turkish policy, then they made any continuation
of talks to resolve the Cyprus problem "meaningless."
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has planned to start accession talks
with Cyprus early next year, triggering strong opposition from
both Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which itself has made efforts
for years for full EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey today called on the EU to reconsider its accession talks
with the Cypriot government, stressing that it has an important
bearing on the settlement of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern part of the
island in the wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Italy Score First Victory in Universiade Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CATANIA, Sicily, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Italy scored their
first goal and their first victory at the football tournament of the
19th World University Games at Palermo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team, who were forced to a goalless draw by their
Brazilian counterparts on Monday, played a nervous game in the first
half against Iran.
</P>
<P>
They could not find the way of breaking the tight defence of
their Iranian opponents while their goal-keeper was also seldom
tested in the first half.
</P>
<P>
After the tedious first half, the Italian team quickened their pace
and launched more counter-attacks against the Iranian team. But their
team work were not good enough to have the attacks well organized.
</P>
<P>
The angry Italian coach Ahmad Khodadkashi was very much
disappointed when the he saw the score was still deadlocked at 0-0 at
the 65th minute. "We are playing against a strong team and I think
the match will probably end at 0-0." Khodadhashi said when he was
interviewed by local TV station.
</P>
<P>
But only seven minutes later, the Italian team launched a quick
counter-attack. With only two crosses, Luca Ulivi completed the
mission as he beat the desperate Iranian goalie Sasan Naimyzaghiani.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian team then went all out to offence and forced the
Italian team back to defence. But the Italian goalie made some
brave saves to keep the 1-0 lead to the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
In the other group A match, Brazil beat Britain 3-2 to top the
group with more goals scored.
</P>
<P>
It was the British team which scored first. But the Brazilian
team soon levelled the score at 1-1 and surged ahead to take the
lead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Though Britain levelled the score again in the second half, the
Brazilian refused to give up and finally got the winner.
</P>
<P>
Group B also had two matches on Wednesday with Morocco beat
Japan 1-0 and Ireland drew with Ukraine 0-0.
</P>
<P>
South Korea beat South Africa 1-0 while the other match of group C
between the Netherlands and Uruguay ended at 4-0 with the Dutch
turned to be the winners.
</P>
<P>
In group D, China scored their second consecutive victory by
beating Nigeria 2-1. The victory put China atop the group with six
points and ensured their qualification to the second round.
</P>
<P>
The United States were forced to a 2-2 draw by Czech Republic
and placed second with four points. On Monday, the American beat
Nigeria 4-0 in their first group match.
</P>
<P>
China will take on the United States while Nigeria will play
Czech Republic on Friday.
