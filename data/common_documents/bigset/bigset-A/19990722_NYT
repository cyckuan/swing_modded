HARDAWAY DEAL UNLIKELY FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Jerry West talked to Penny Hardaway. And that's
probably as far as the Lakers' relationship with the Orlando Magic
guard will go.
</P>
<P>
   West, the team's executive vice president, admits he spoke with
Hardaway last week, with Hardaway expressing a desire to play for
the Lakers. West wouldn't say whether the Lakers would try to
obtain the free agent in a sign-and-trade deal with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the team indicated there is less than a
50-50 chance of the Lakers trading for Hardaway. The Magic has not
offered to make any deal with the Lakers, and new Orlando coach Doc
Rivers said he wants to keep Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to try to move Anfernee Hardaway? No,'' Rivers
said on Jim Rome's nationally syndicated talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, a four-time All-Star, opted out of his Magic contract
and became a free agent July 1. He is seeking $9 million for the
first year of a new contract, and only a handful of teams can offer
that much _ Toronto, Chicago and the Clippers have salary-cap room,
while Orlando is allowed to exceed the cap under the NBA's ``Larry
Bird'' rule.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, Hardaway and the Magic can orchestrate a
sign-and-trade agreement with another team. Phoenix and Portland
are among the primary suitors under that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers to obtain Hardaway, they would probably have to
deal sharpshooter Glen Rice, a price they are not willing to pay.
Rice is among the league's premier shooters, and without him the
Lakers would once again lack a consistent perimeter threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would like to find a way to obtain Hardaway without
giving up Rice. But aside from untouchables Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant, they have no other players with significant trade
value. The most they can offer Hardaway in a free-agent deal is $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel, according to sources, said the Magic has
been asking for Bryant to be included in any trade package for
Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   NBA teams are negotiating with free agents, but no signings or
trades can be consummated until Aug. 1.

METS DEFEAT EXPOS, 7-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Rick Reed had a somewhat shaky outing once again, but
one thing was clear after the New York Mets' 7-3 victory on
Wednesday night over the Montreal Expos at Olympic Stadium. The
Mets are just two games behind the first-place Atlanta Braves for
the first time since June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly vulnerable Braves lost their fifth straight game on
Wednesday night as Greg Maddux and Company were shut out, 2-0, by
the Florida Marlins in Miami. In the last week, the Braves have
watched their lead in the National League East shrink by three
games as the Mets have won five of seven games, all on the road,
since the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are 28-13 since June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura paced a 12-hit offense on
Wednesday night by belting consecutive home runs in the first
inning to give Reed a three-run lead. Rickey Henderson scored from
first on Edgardo Alfonzo's second double of the evening for a
seventh-inning insurance run to pass Willie Mays and take sole
possession of fifth place on the career runs-scored list (2,063).
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who doubled in a run, allowed just two earned runs in six
innings to run his record to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy with my performance for the most part,'' Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   But problems still remain.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has not lost since June 4. But he has not looked like the
pitcher who won 16 games a year ago, and 13 the year before. Reed
has been inconsistent all season. From start to start. And from
inning to inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``His windup and his delivery, for me, are off a half a beat,''
Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``We know he's going to give us a
real competitive effort of major league quality every time out. But
we are looking for those quality innings and those darts in and out
at the knees. And so is he. He's thrown them. He's just not
repeating them very well. But he'll be O.K.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Reed allowed 10 hits, including consecutive
home runs in the sixth inning, the 16th and 17th homers he has
surrendered in 106 innings pitched this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they weren't bad pitches,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran right-hander, Reed was hoping he could build off the
final inning of his previous start. That was last Friday at Tampa
Bay, in the sixth inning of a 9-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   That was when the Mets' pitching coach, Dave Wallace, noticed
that Reed wasn't driving through with his legs enough, which,
Wallace felt, might be one reason Reed had been leaving the ball up
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Wallace said, it worked. And Reed was hoping to carry
that into Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The results, however, were mixed, as Reed's season has been. The
33-year-old pitcher had the Expos hitting ground balls for most of
the first five innings. But the Expos recorded at least one hit off
Reed in each of the six innings he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad I was able to get ground balls,'' Reed said.
``Although I know most of them found holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos' lone run through five innings should probably not
have scored. But after Jose Vidro singled to right with one out in
the first, Ventura, the third baseman, let a short hop off the bat
of Rondell White play him. And when it scooted under the usually
sure-handed Ventura's glove for an error, Reed had runners on first
and third with one out instead of an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero followed with a rocket off the mound that went
into center field. And the 3-0 lead the Mets had given Reed on
Piazza's two-run homer, his 20th of the season, and Ventura's 17th
of the year on the right-hander Dan Smith's very next pitch, was
3-1 on an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Reed, the next batter, Brad Fullmer, lined a shot
straight at Ventura, who threw to second for an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some shoddy base running in the second, the Mets
expanded their lead to 4-1 when Reed _ who slightly tore a calf
muscle here in his second start of the season by legging out a
double _ trotted out a run-scoring double to chase Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And when John Olerud doubled home Alfonzo (whose hitting streak
is at 11 games) in the top of the fifth, Reed led by 5-1, and
appeared to have the game in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed, who was in trouble all night, allowed homers on
consecutive pitches to White (his 11th) and Guerrero (his 20th),
followed by Fullmer's double to right.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed retired the side to limit the damage. And, after just
77 pitches, Valentine decided that that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was wondering how we were going to rest him more,''
Valentine said of Reed, who tired in the final month last season.
``And he rested himself.''

BOEING MACHINISTS BACK UNION'S CALL FOR STRIKE, IF NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Machinists on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to grant
their union the power to call a strike if Boeing's contract offer
falls short.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight percent of the roughly 19,000 union workers voting
in Seattle's Kingdome and locations in Kansas and Oregon endorsed
the move Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say they hope to avoid a strike. The Machinists'
contract expires Sept. 2. Still, the union used the vote to send
Boeing executives a message: Limit the subcontracting of work or it
will recommend its members walk off the production lines and onto
the picket lines later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If job security is not in that contract, than we will
strike,'' said Bob Thayer, general vice president at the
International Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Improving job security at the aerospace giant is the union's
No.1 priority as it crafts a new contract for 49,000 machinists
with Boeing this summer. For example, there is interest in
establishing a minimum level of employment at Boeing in the future,
according to Bill Johnson, the head of District Lodge 751. Union
officials, however, declined to discuss details of their
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The union also wants to beef up language from the 1995 contract
that requires the company to consult the union on certain
subcontracting matters. Officials charge that Boeing has failed to
fully honor the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The union promised a strike if Boeing fails to address issues
tied to pensions, health care and the company's suggestion to
institute a seven-day work week.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, meanwhile, is negotiating with its largest union while
in the midst of retooling its operations to become more
competitive. The multinational corporation is trying to walk a fine
line between satisfying its work force and the demands of Wall
Street investors, who are clamoring for a leaner company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing remains committed to negotiating an agreement that
balances the interests of all parties,'' said Peter Conte, a
spokesman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have said the talks got off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism is based on more than a year of preliminary
discussions that laid the groundwork for formal negotiations this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing and union officials say the talks are progressing,
Johnson indicated the company has become a little less open since
last week, when it reported healthy earnings in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are OK,'' Johnson said, referring to the contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, union negotiators said they're cautiously optimistic they
can avoid a strike this year. They also feel they have some
powerful bargaining chips: Boeing's commitment to deliver a record
620 airplanes this year and the company's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can afford a strike,'' said Johnson, who
represents 36,000 workers around Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators still have time to settle their differences.
Members aren't expected to vote on a proposed contract until Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   Machinists are particularly concerned about the latest round of
negotiations because they began after Boeing announced plans to
eliminate as many as 53,000 jobs by the end of 2000. That pledge
provided additional fuel to the union's drive to secure greater job
protection and motivated workers to hang banners that read ``We'll
Walk for Job Security'' from the Kingdome's balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a mortgage and bills to pay, that's over your
head every day,'' said Terry Mooney, who has worked at Boeing for
three years, referring to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the day was dedicated to a show of unity, there were
some voices of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eastland said that after 25 years at Boeing, he doesn't
trust either party in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they weren't telling us the truth and Boeing isn't
telling us the truth,'' said Eastland, who works in facility
storage at Boeing's East Marginal Way facility in Seattle, as he
stood outside the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   However, Eastland added he has no choice but to rely on the
union to settle the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now, union leaders will return to the bargaining table armed
with the right to call a strike later in the year. The two sides
will talk until Aug. 15, then they will move to a hotel to begin
round-the-clock negotiations. If the union calls a strike, the
members still must ratify the move.
</P>
<P>
   The process is expected to culminate when the Machinists vote on
a contract proposal from the company on Sept. 1. The company needs
to secure the support of a simple majority to approve the contract,
while 66 and two-thirds percent of the voting members must approve
a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Machinists Wednesday pledged to fight for all their demands. But
a Rolling Stones song played during the rally may come closer to
the final position of the union and the company: ``You Can't Always
Get What You Want.''

STUTE BROTHERS SHARE SPECIAL BOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD -- Joe DiMaggio has nothing on thoroughbred trainer
Mel Stute.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Clipper had a 56-game hitting streak in 1941, but
Stute enjoyed a record streak of his own at Hollywood Park -- once
winning races on eight consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Stute might have to give an assist to his temperamental
older brother, Warren, who at one time fired owners quicker than
Secretariat ran the 1973 Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mel Stute's victories during that record run could have
come with a horse Warren trained only days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren used to have the reputation of really being tough,
firing everybody and that kind of stuff,'' Mel Stute said on the
eve of today's opening card at Del Mar. ``He'd fire his owners and
I would get 'em. He was very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was working for him, had one horse of my own, and
one of his owners called me and said, 'Tell Warren not to turn my
horses out. I'll have another trainer by 4 o'clock.' Warren had
told him, 'I want your horses out of my barn by 4 o'clock today or
I'm going to turn 'em loose.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fellow who gets along with him very well is (owner)
Clement Hirsch, and Clement says it's because he's hard of hearing.
He just turns off the hearing aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Stute is quick to rush to his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation, probably at one time it was true,'' he said.
``But my excuse for being like that is I'm still here. I let out my
emotions, and I don't let an owner grind on my stomach. I think
owners can really put pressure on you. If you keep it inside and
let it grind you up, well, you might jump off the bridge or have a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still here, and I'm 77.''
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Warren Stute and his younger brother, Mel, are
furlongs apart in personality. Mel is easy-going, very likable.
Warren, in his younger days, had the reputation of being more
cantankerous than some of his more hyper horses.
</P>
<P>
   They don't subscribe to the same training methods or a similar
lifestyle, but after a reporter spent an hour with the Stute
brothers in a cafeteria along the backside at Hollywood Park, it
was evident that the two share a special bond. Warren is Mel's
greatest fan, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of aggravates me that a lot of these big owners, they
go here and they go there, and they overlook a guy like Mel,'' said
Warren Stute, an Arcadia resident. ``He's honest, he's here every
day and the statistics will prove that he's outstanding. And he
does it with cheap horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that trainers that win the Kentucky Derby, people
try to give them horses because they think they're special, and
they're not. There are a lot of trainers that are just as good as
the people who win the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Mel's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Warren is the greatest trainer we've ever
had,'' said the 71-year-old Mel Stute, who lives with his wife of
49 years, Annabelle, in Glendora. ``I mean, he won stakes races
when nobody knew who Charlie Whittingham was. The only thing I
think that ruined him was always his temper.''
</P>
<P>
   One trait the Stutes share is their ability to successfully
train race horses, which can be traced back to when both worked for
Yorky McLeod at Santa Anita. Warren, who took out his trainer's
license in 1940, was an exercise rider. Mel worked as a groom at
the same time and became a trainer in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who has been married to hiw wife, Trudy, for 39 years,
has been coming to Del Mar for more than 50 years. Mel is closing
in on the half-century mark. They've both enjoyed memorable
victories at the seaside oval.
</P>
<P>
   Tonga won the inaugural Del Mar Debutante for Warren Stute in
1951. Mel fondly recalls winning the 1975 Del Mar Futurity with
Telly's Pop, owned by actor Telly Savalas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a show when Telly and that crew arrived,'' Mel Stute
said. `When we ran him, Telly used to call it `fun time.' There
wasn't a whole lot of pressure. He enjoyed it, and it was a big
thing when he won it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stutes have had their share of talented horses.
</P>
<P>
   Warren says Figonero, who won the Hollywood Gold Cup in 1969,
was the best horse he trained. He also sent out Magical Maiden for
a third-place finish in the 1992 Breeders' Cup Distaff on six days'
rest, and saddled Great Circle to win the 1951 Santa Anita Maturity
(now the Strub Stakes) -- the first hundred-grander for both Stute
and winning jockey Bill Shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoemaker is in a class by himself,` Warren Stute said. ``He
was amazing. I was a long time in admitting it. He rode for a year
or two before I realized that he really was a great jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stute may be best known for training Snow Chief, winner of
the 1986 Preakness Stakes. He's also won a pair of Breeders' Cup
races -- the Juvenile Fillies with Brave Raj in 1986 at Santa Anita
and the Sprint in 1987 at Hollywood Park with Very Subtle.
</P>
<P>
   But Mel says that while Snow Chief was the most versatile horse
he's trained, Aurelius II was the best. And he has a soft spot in
his heart for a cheap claimer named Scully's Square.
</P>
<P>
   One year, in the mid-50s, Scully's Square ran 52 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I had a car payment, rent due or something, I'd
enter him,'' Mel recalled. ``He didn't win very many, but he'd run
second or third and help me pay my rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the year my son, Gary, was born. I'd written a bad
check that morning to get him out of the hospital, and I ran
Scully's Square that afternoon. He finished second at Santa Anita
in a $20,000 claimer and I had enough money to make my check good.
I had a special feeling for that horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers say retirement is not in their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has been a major part of Warren's life for more
than 60 years. He doesn't have other interests like Mel, who is a
regular at Glendora High School boys basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey Jacobsen... I've followed that kid every game,'' Mel
Stute said. ``I'm going to try to get tickets to Stanford this year
because he went up there to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched Tracy Murray, Cameron Murray. I go to every game,
especially basketball. They call me a Glendora nut.''
</P>
<P>
   A nut and a hothead. Whatever the label, the Stute brothers have
left an undeniable mark on the Southern California racing circuit.

GALAXY LIKES ITS POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Nearly two-thirds of its remaining schedule is
against Western Conference rivals, but Galaxy players are feeling
good about their position as the second half of the season begins
Sunday against Kansas City at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (10-7, 24 points) has won five of its last six
games, including a 5-2 victory over New England before the MLS
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (12-4, 32 points) leads the conference, followed by
Chicago (10-7, 28 points) and Dallas (10-9, 28 points). The Galaxy
lingers in fourth, but eight of its remaining 15 games are against
that trio, including three matches with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   This next week is pivotal. Following Sunday's match, the Galaxy
faces Colorado (Wednesday, July 28) and Chicago (Saturday, July 31)
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The team will play all three without Cobi Jones and Robin
Fraser, as both will be competing with the U.S. National team in
the Confederations Cup in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge week,'' defender Greg Vanney said. ``It's a
week where we can pick up points and keep Kansas City (in fifth)
nice and far behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing players, but so is Colorado and Chicago. It's
not the first time we've faced this. And we have plenty of guys
ready to step in and fill their shoes. That's the strength of this
team. We have a lot of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserves Clint Mathis, Daniel Hernandez and Joe Franchino were
all starters at the beginning of the season. They were relegated to
the bench when Sigi Schmid replaced Octavio Zambrano, but all three
will play key roles this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to bring those three along but things occurred
and all three wound up going back to the bench,'' assistant coach
Ralph Perez said. ``But a credit to all three of them because they
have responded in a professional way and worked harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now with players out, we need them to step up in big
situations. That's why you keep working hard, because the
opportunities will be there again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its MLS schedule, the Galaxy is participating in
the U.S. Open Cup. On Tuesday, Los Angeles rallied to beat the
A-League's San Diego Flash, 3-2, to reach the quarterfinals, where
they likely will face D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy also has a friendly scheduled against Chivas de
Guadalajara on Aug. 4 at the Rose Bowl, and hopes to secure a berth
in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, to be held in the renovated
40,000-seat Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas in late September.
</P>
<P>
   United and the Chicago Fire are among two of the teams that
qualified for the eight-team Las Vegas tournament. The Galaxy can
qualify by defeating Necaxa of the Mexican first division in a
match scheduled later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can gain a lot from these Cup games,'' Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid said. ``In Tuesday's win, we showed tremendous character by
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we want to win the MLS championship, we're going to be
in situations where you have to win or else there is no tomorrow.
That is what's good about these games. They test your depth and
mental abilities. From that standpoint, it's a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Champions Cup has added significance this year. The winner
will advance to the inaugural World Club Championship, set for Jan.
5-14. There, the CONCACAF representative will face some of the most

VOTERS IN KANSAS COUNTY OPPOSE CLOUD-SEEDING PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) As cloud-seeding pilots fly around the thunderstorms
of Kansas, winds of opposition have broken out on earth.
</P>
<P>
   After months of debate, voters in a special advisory election in
Rawlins County overwhelmingly turned thumbs down on weather
modification, County Clerk Meredith Hrnchir said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The election by itself won't bring about change, but the results
signal new contentiousness and may lead to a slowdown in cloud
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to get a message that people don't want it,'' said
Gordon Hawkins of Atwood, one of the local farmers critical of
attempts to change weather. ``They didn't want to listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the $840,000 Western Kansas Weather Modification
Program, which seeks to diminish hail and enhance rain in parts or
all of 22 western Kansas counties.
</P>
<P>
   The program covers a small section of Rawlins County, a rural
area on the Nebraska border north of Colby, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   All county voters were allowed to participate in the mail-in
election this month. Asked whether modification of the weather
should be allowed in or over the county, 252 said yes and 903 said
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a lot of fear mongering,'' said Curtis D. Smith of
Lakin, Kan., the weather program manager. ``I don't know how it's
going to all play out.''
</P>
<P>
   If additional counties reject cloud seeding, he said, the future
of the program could be endangered. State tax funds help pay the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The election results are advisory, meaning they don't carry the
force of law. Nevertheless, Rawlins County Commission Chairman
Charles Unger said county leaders would attempt to stop cloud
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty overwhelming against,'' said Unger, whose farm
is outside the program area.
</P>
<P>
   Unger is no fan of cloud seeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it has that much merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been under way since 1975 in parts of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers say it significantly reduces hail, thus preventing
damage to valuable wheat and corn fields. One study by the state
found that crop damage from hail fell 27 percent in some of the
area the program covers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say they believe cloud seeding deters rain their area
badly needs. They also say they didn't have enough voice in setting
up the program.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Citizens for Natural Weather has been demanding
the right to vote on weather modification.
</P>
<P>
   Around the United States, efforts to change the weather have
operated for decades. Scientists are divided about their worth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism comes from northwest Kansas, where seeding
has occurred for three years. In southwest Kansas, the program is
far older and enjoys more support.
</P>
<P>
   While the argument unfolds, the program maintains a fleet of
nine airplanes, ready to take off and attack severe thunderstorms
at any hour of the day or night. The planes seed storms by flying
beside them or above them.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict changes, however.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Bossert, manager of Ground Water Management District No. 4
in Colby, said he expected that Rawlins County would be out of the
program next year. At least one other county is considering an
election, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His district set up the program in northwest Kansas, and he said
early data indicated a 40 percent cutback in hail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question whether the public really had adequate
information,'' Bossert said. ``It has become an emotional issue
above everything else.''

SURVEY FINDS NUMBER OF AT-RISK TEEN GAMBLERS IN STATE IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA _ Ann Tolliver didn't pay it any mind when her
13-year-old son played poker with his friends, losing a buck here
and a buck there. She began to worry a few years later when he
returned from a summer job in Alaska with just a fraction of the
money he should have earned.
</P>
<P>
   By the time her son was 21, Tolliver said, he was losing
thousands of dollars playing cards. He not only went through the
$30,000 a year he earned as a black jack dealer at a mini-casino,
but borrowed money from friends and family that he never paid back.
</P>
<P>
   He even stole $40 from his 10-year-old sister's dinosaur bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like it (gambling) took my son,'' said Tolliver,
of Spanaway, declining to name her son or the mini-casino where he
worked. ``Here was a kid, a happy guy, and he could have done
anything he wanted to do, and now he was always quiet, always
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried he would take his life,'' she said. ``I worried he
would rob someone and end up in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver's son, now recovering, is one of the thousands of
compulsive gamblers who developed problems early in life. As many
as 6,000 Washington teenagers have serious gambling problems, and
38,000 more are at risk of developing them, according to a recent
survey conducted for the state Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   These estimates represent a 14 percent increase in the number of
problem and at-risk teen gamblers since 1993, the last time the
survey was done. The 1993 survey, based on a poll of adolescents
aged 13 to 17, estimated that as many as 4,700 teens had serious
problems and 33,700 were at-risk.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers attributed the increase of teen gamblers to growth
in the state's population over the past six years. As a percentage
of the population, the rate of problem gambling remained at about 1
percent of all teens, while the percent of at-risk gamblers fell
from about 9 percent in 1993 to 7.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey contained good and bad news about teen
gambling, it comes at a time of growing concern about the spread of
gambling in the state. With gambling outlets proliferating, and
advertising increasing, some worry that more young people will
develop gambling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teen gambling will be among the topics explored in a series of
hearings by the state Senate Committee on Commerce, Trade and
Housing and Financial Institutions that begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we don't want to encourage problem gambling,'' said
Sen. Margarita Prentice, the Seattle Democrat who chairs the panel.
``The real question is what is the appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gambling centers on issues of economic benefits
in jobs, taxes and spin-off activity created by gambling as a
tradeoff against the effect of problem gambling on individuals,
families and communities. Earlier this month, the Lottery
Commission released a study that showed the percentage of adult
problem gamblers had remained about the same over the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of teens, conducted earlier this year, showed that 78
percent of Washington teens have gambled at some time, and 68
percent have gambled in the past year. Teens represent up to 18
percent of all problem gamblers, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Those who develop severe gambling problems start at an average
age of 10, compared with about 12 for non-problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   _Those with gambling problems are more likely to have problems
with drugs, alcohol and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   _Teens most likely to develop problems earn $50 a week or more,
live in a two-parent family, and have parents who gamble.
</P>
<P>
   _Problem gambling is highest among teens who bet on arcade or
video games, and among those who purchase Lottery scratch tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is illegal for minors to play the Lottery, 6 percent
of Washington 13-year-olds and 21 percent of 17-year-olds have
purchased Lottery tickets in the past year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Hutchinson, a Lottery spokeswoman, said the agency is
embarking on a program to educate lottery outlets about their
responsibilities, including selling only to adults. She said,
however, that complaints about selling to minors are few; there
were three in 1998, none this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that the Lottery, which spends about $6.5
million in advertising, does not use cartoon characters or other
gimmicks to appeal to children. She said the survey, paid for by
the Lottery, is among the many steps the agency has taken to
address compulsive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Vito Chiechi, a spokesman for the Recreational Gambling
Association, which represents mini-casino owners, said that
industry does not target children in its advertising. He said the
industry is taking steps to prevent under-age gambling, including
possibly adopting a voluntary age limit of 21.
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver, however, warned that gambling addiction can come from
seemingly innocent practices, such as friendly bets on sports. Her
son, 22, recently quit his mini-casino job, moved back home and is
working in construction.
</P>
<P>
   But she still worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never goes away,'' she said. ``It's out there, lotto
tickets, pull tabs. People don't realize what it does. They get
tunnel vision. When they're not gambling, they're thinking of
gambling.''

MUSEUM LETS VISITORS PEER INTO PRISON LIFE

<P>
   LANSING, Kan. _ About 50 years ago, Lansing prisoners welded
together scraps of metal into shotguns that could help them settle
scores or aid their escape attempts.
</P>
<P>
   These pieces of cobbled-together contraband are on display at
the Lansing Historical Museum, which opened this month. It marks
the first time that the 132-year history of the Lansing
Correctional Facility, formerly known as the Kansas State
Penitentiary, has come together in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really amazes me is that we have such a long, rich
history and no one has researched it,'' said Jim Barkley, a
correctional facility parole officer who plans to write about the
prison as part of his master's thesis.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, a former railroad depot, is on correctional facility
grounds at Kansas 7 and Kansas Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the museum's artifacts illustrate how work has played a
major role at the prison since it opened. The items and
prisoner-made products on display include ``Welcome to Kansas''
signs, detergent and an office chair.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, hard, manual labor was the way of life.
Photographs show inmates with dirty faces after mining for coal or
making bricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a fun place to live or work,'' Barkley said. ``The
mines of Lansing were infamous nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which also focuses on the history of the city and
the railroad, still is a work in progress. Photocopies showing
prison life are on display until the Kansas State Historical
Society sends the actual pictures, said Kathy Edmonds, the museum's
director of acquisitions. Also, display cases were not completed
when the museum opened, so some artifacts aren't out for people to
see.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the museum was born 10 years ago when an Atchison,
Topeka &AMP; Santa Fe Railroad depot was earmarked for demolition. A
group of Lansing residents who wanted to save the depot joined
forces and formed the Lansing Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Leavenworth Northern and Southern Railway built the depot in
1887, and the Santa Fe Railroad later purchased it and used it as a
passenger depot until 1967. It was used as storage space in ensuing
years. Fertilizer and rain had damaged the floor, and it needed a
new roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in bad shape,'' Edmonds said. ``The floor was like a
sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the society has been host for dinners and sold
recipe books, old milk bottles and art work so it could move the
depot and restore it as a museum. The society raised almost
$100,000, most of it in small donations, said Ada Young, the
society's treasurer. Large donations included $10,000 from Lansing
and $25,000 from Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners and Hallmark employees worked on the restoration after
the depot was moved to the Lansing Correctional Facility in 1992.
The depot has regained its original colors: On the outside, its
walls are painted, burnt orange with dark green trim, and on the
inside displays are set against sage walls.
</P>
<P>
   A museum section devoted to Lansing history features Dean
Herzog, who broke the national high school record for high jumping
in 1974. A telegraph machine and a ticket counter are on display in
the railroad sections.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits will rotate. In the future, the museum would like to
acquire the penitentiary's gallows, where 43 inmates were hanged
for execution. The gallows are being stored in Topeka, Barkley
said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday; 1 p.m. to 4
p.m. Sunday; and by appointment during the week. Admission is free.
For more information, call (913) 351-1887.

 Airline says it lost money in its second quarter  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trans World Airlines said Wednesday that it
lost money in its second quarter, citing a threatened strike by its
Machinists union that scared away business passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, TWA's flight attendants said they ratified the
airline's latest contract offer. The flight attendants are one of
three TWA employee groups represented by the Machinists union that
have been voting in the past month on the contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A union official said voting results for all three groups could
be released as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended June 30, TWA had operating income of
$18.37 million. But charges related to the early retirement of debt
led to a net loss of $6.21 million, or 18 cents a share. That
compares with net earnings of $19.49 million, or 31 cents a share,
for the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis-based carrier's second-quarter revenue dropped to
$865.99 million, compared with $883.54 million during the same time
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The results were below Wall Street's expectations of a loss of
12 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call
Corp. Shares in TWA closed Wednesday at 4 11/16, down 1/16, on the
American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Compton, TWA's president and chief executive officer, said
the airline lost business travelers during the second quarter as
TWA and the Machinists union entered a 30-day countdown that could
have led to a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-yield business traveler did not want to take a chance
(that TWA would be struck) and left us,'' Compton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative contract agreement was reached with all three
employee groups of the Machinists union last month. Final voting on
the contract by union members will conclude this week.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the flight attendants, the other employee groups voting
on a new contract are passenger service employees and mechanics and
related workers. About 16,000 TWA employees belong to the
Machinists, including more than 2,300 members in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement was criticized by some TWA workers. They
said the 18-month length of the agreement was too short, wages did
not reach industry standards, and pension benefits had not improved
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Compton said Wednesday that TWA anticipated its union employees
would approve the new contracts, which in turn would help the
carrier recapture lost business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're optimistic we're going to have a positive result
associated with that progress'' in labor relations, Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   However, airline industry analysts say TWA's problems go beyond
its recent troubles with its union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the labor negotiations have affected TWA's high-yield
customers,'' said Bill DiBenedetto, associate editor for Commercial
Aviation Report. ``But that problem has been systemic, too. TWA
always has had an imbalance between their mix of leisure and
business travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   TWA's cash position increased to $288.6 million on June 30 from
$252.4 million at the end of last year. However, DiBenedetto said
that continued to leave little margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems TWA is moving in the right direction, but it's slow
and they encounter many setbacks,'' he said. ``This (turnaround) is
going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton emphasized TWA's recent highlights, including continuing
to have the best on-time performance in the industry and receiving
a customer satisfaction award from J.D. Power &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hurdles, as there always are,'' he said. ``But
there's reason for optimism as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of 1999, TWA's net loss was $27.77 million,
or 60 cents a share, on $1.63 billion in sales. That compares with
a loss of $36.03 million, or 82 cents a share, on $1.65 billion in
revenue for the first half of 1998.

   WEEKEND-HOUSES (Amagansett, N.Y.) _ ``Weekend Utopia: The Modern
Beach House on Eastern Long Island, 1960-1973,'' an exhibit at the
Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, is a catalogue of a maligned
period of architectural experimentation and a window into the light
heart of 1960s weekend style. The houses on display, by architects
such as Peter Blake, Andrew Geller, Charles Gwathmey, Norman Jaffe
and Julian and Barbara Neski, are examples of that interesting
mid-century moment when American architecture had shaken the dogmas
of modernism, but had not yet calcified into postmodern pastiche.

and bunk beds, before real-estate prices skyrocketed, before the
traffic became unbearable, before setbacks or environmental
consciousness _ when houses could still be designed to burrow into
the side of a dune or hover over wetlands. By Alastair Gordon.

who all act as if they know her intimately. Not only that, many of
them seem to think she knows them really well, too. At book
signings, fans proffer their brand-new copies of the volume and ask
the first-time author to inscribe them: ``To my best friend.'' ``In
those cases,'' she says dryly ``I always write, `I feel so close to

greatest modernist houses in England, a country in which domestic
modernism was mostly a wan affair. Inside the restrained red brick

restored platinum-blond Art Deco interior. The palace offers a rare
insight into what was avant-garde in the 1930s and is a tribute to
an idiosyncratic and modernist couple, Virginia and Stephen
Courtauld, philanthropists whose wealth was based on rayon. By June
Ducas.

COALITION URGES HOLLYWOOD TO LIMIT VIOLENCE IN ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blasting America's ``toxic'' pop culture as a
threat to children, a coalition of political, religious and media
leaders Wednesday challenged Hollywood to voluntarily restrict
violence and sexual content in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The group _ including entertainers, senators and former
Presidents Ford and Carter _ called on the entertainment industry
to set new standards for television, film, music and video games.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, the group charged that the
violent and degrading media images that constantly bombard children
have a direct link to youth crime.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Allen, creator of ``The Tonight Show'' and one of 56
people who signed the joint statement, said the entertainment
industry should adopt its own code of conduct soon or risk
government censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are familiar with history, we know that when outrages
reach an extreme point, people demand censorship,'' he said. ``If,
God forbid, that happens, I can give you a list of people who will
be to blame, and it won't be the censors.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the group's statement calls for each medium to set and
adhere to limits for violent and sexual material. It also demands
an overall reduction in the amount of entertainment violence, a
revival of television's ``family hour'' and an end to the practice
of aiming adult-oriented entertainment at kids.
</P>
<P>
   To add pressure to the appeal, the coalition asked parents to
write, fax or e-mail media executives and advertisers. Those
interested can also add their signatures to the joint statement
online at www.media-appeal.org.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal drew a tepid response from some entertainment
executives Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything should be held to a standard, but who decides?''
said Chris Thompson, executive producer of ``Action,'' an edgy new
comedy that debuts on Fox Broadcasting in September. ``Do we allow
politicians, religious figures, viewers _ I mean, who decides
what's acceptable? We're trying to make a comedy. Our biggest
standard is what's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out that they already have standards. The
National Association of Broadcasters has a voluntary statement of
principles that was adopted in 1991. A former, stricter code was
struck down by a California court in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a statement of principles in effect that deals with
many of these issues (brought up in the editorial),'' said
association spokesman Dennis Wharton. He said that short of some
type of government enforcement, this is all the group can do.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software
Association, rejected the notion that video games could lead to
real violence. Academic research, he said, has yet to demonstrate a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say if you look at what's out there, not only is it not
proven, there's absolutely no evidence of any link,'' Lowenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the call for new, tougher standards resonates with many
parents, frustrated by the inescapable reach of risque or violent
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deborah Heisley of Tarzana rarely lets her children
watch television on week nights, her 10-year-old daughter recently
caught an episode of the young-adult sitcom ``Friends'' at a
friend's house. Heisley has also had a hard time finding
non-violent video games for her 7-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get racing games, and you think they're nonviolent, but
then they have missiles in the game and they blow each other up,''
she said. ``It's everywhere the children turn. Sex and violence are
so pervasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen criticized such programs as ``Sex and the City,'' ``Jerry
Springer'' and Thompson's upcoming series, ``Action,'' for
pandering to the audience's worst impulses. Other shows, he said,
have no problem entertaining without vulgar content.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who know how to do this right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, getting the entertainment industry to agree to new
standards may prove difficult. Allen and others acknowledged that
even the best network programmers are judged on ratings, not on the
quality of their shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present climate, which stresses the rights of
individuals and corporations to do whatever they think is best for
their own interests, this appeal has an uphill climb to make,''
said the Right Rev. Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Episcopal
Diocese of Los Angeles and one of several religious leaders who
signed the joint statement. ``Essentially it is an appeal to share
a greater responsibility for the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are all of the people who signed the statement pushing for
the exact same goals.
</P>
<P>
   The only media executive to sign the joint statement _ Vic
Faraci, senior vice president of Warner Bros. Records _ said he was
concerned about violent imagery on television, not necessarily in
music. Television, he said, is far more accessible to small,
impressionable kids than are movies, records or radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young, young children migrate to television sets, and that's
where they spend a lot of their time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he would try to convince fellow Warner Bros.
executives in the company's television wing to adopt and follow new
standards, Faraci said that was the public's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a missionary in this regard,'' he said. ``I've made
my feelings known.''

FOOD INSPECTORS FIND HEALTH VIOLATIONS AT NEW BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ King County food safety inspectors on Monday found
serious health violations that had the potential to spread
foodborne illness at numerous concession stands and kiosks at
Safeco Field, the Seattle Mariners new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No known illnesses were associated with any of the violations,
most of which were immediately corrected. But the findings by
health officials raise the specter of 1996 when the Kingdome's food
service came under fire for repeated health violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a chronic problem,'' said Dr. Alonzo Plough, director
of the health department for Seattle and King County, referring to
the Kingdome. ``This is a start-up problem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, food safety experts fanned out across Safeco
stadium to assure that food handling and preparation practices at
concession stands and booths met regulations intended to protect
against the spread of foodborne illnesses such as Salmonella,
hepatitis A and E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors cited 24 booths or stands for the most serious
``red critical'' violations _ meaning they had to be immediately
corrected because they posed a threat of foodborne illness. Safeco
Field has 55 concession stands and 38 free-standing kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them were resolved on site that day,'' Plough noted.
Some of the serious violations included undercooked meat and other
foods, potential cross-contamination between raw and cooked meats
and debris in ice used for drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very concerned,'' said Rebecca Hale, spokeswoman
for the Mariners. ``Public safety and health must come first. ...
We are going to be working with Volume Services America and the
health department to make sure that all of these problems are
corrected immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume Services America Inc., based in Spartanburg, S.C., is the
food concessionaire for Safeco Field and responsible for all food
services at the stadium, including food prepared by those who
sub-contract booths or kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to meet and exceed all standards,'' said Elaine
Richner, spokeswoman for Volume Services. Richner said her company
hadn't yet seen the health department's food inspection reports and
will comment further once they have the information.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer obtained the reports through a
public records disclosure request to the health department.
</P>
<P>
   Richner said Volume Services already has started working with
public health officials to resolve the food safety concerns and has
also agreed to hire an on-site food sanitation expert to oversee
the entire stadium's food operation.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what New York-based Ogden Entertainment
Services did in 1996 at the Kingdome after coming under criticism
for recurring food service violations. Ogden announced last month
that it plans to acquire Volume Services but, at this point, it
still operates independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did this with Ogden, that was the first time the
stadium had a full-time person dedicated to food sanitation,'' said
Plough. ``It's a good idea for such a large food service. ... But I
don't think it's standard industry practice yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the health department reported 158 ``red critical''
violations over a three-year period at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Kingdome violations included employee reports of hot
dog buns being picked free of mold before sales, a woman coughing
and sneezing over food, a plastic scoop used interchangeably for
garbage and ice, and a man with dirt-encrusted hands packing boxes
with popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   But what finally brought the matter to public and King County
Council attention was not so much the violations as the fact that
vendors were not taking action to correct many of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (food safety) problems at Safeco sound like the same kind
of problems,'' said Janet Anderberg, food safety specialist with
the state Department of Health who consulted on the Kingdome food
service problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new facility so it's not surprising they're having some
problems,'' Anderberg said. ``But it only becomes alarming when we
find these things and they aren't corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, the Mariners' spokeswoman, said that every effort will be
made to assure food safety, and that Safeco Field's more elaborate
menu puts it at greater risk for health violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying a new level of food service for the fans,'' Hale
said. ``Everything has to be up to par. ... I believe we have to
exceed those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Plough agreed, noting that foods that require more preparation
will also create more opportunities for contamination or other
safety concerns. He noted, however, that by far the greatest number
of violations and most likely health hazards continues to result
from improper or inadequate hand-washing by food workers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the citations at Safeco Field were for
inadequate hand-washing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Greenman, food inspection coordinator for the health
department, said the 1996 Kingdome episode helped improve the
county's food safety program without making it more punitive in
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings down the wall between us sanitarians and people in
the food service industry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Greenman said, those cited with red critical
violations were helped in correcting the violation on site. They'll
be re-inspected, she said, and if the problems persist fines can be
imposed. But an educational component is always part of the
inspection process, Greenman said.

CHINA SAID TO PREPARE BAN ON SECT AS PROTESTS GO ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs for new top and for updating throughout; story is now
an added starter on The New York Times front page.) (sw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Ratcheting up its campaign against an amorphous but
fast-growing spiritual movement, the Chinese government is expected
to announce on Thursday a nationwide ban against the movement,
Buddhist Law, according to reports in three Hong Kong newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The papers said President Jiang Zemin had decided to impose the
ban at an emergency meeting of the Politburo on Monday. The
independent daily Sing Tao quoted the government directive as
saying the group had ``engaged in superstition and disrupted public
order, thereby damaging social stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The government began a crackdown on Monday, rounding up more
than 100 prominent members of the sect in 14 cities, according to
members of the group and a Hong Kong-based human rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted protests in Beijing and several other cities as
thousands of followers vented their anger against the government's
actions, several members said.
</P>
<P>
   As they did once before, in April, members of the group, known
in Chinese as Falun Gong, are taking their grievances to the
doorstep of the Communist Party. Early Thursday and on Wednesday,
members tried to mass in front of the leaders' compound in central
Beijing, a member said. The police quickly herded them into buses
and took them away.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the police could be seen shooing a small
crowd of people away from the sidewalk facing the ceremonial
entrance to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound that houses President
Jiang Zemin and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It was a silent vigil near the compound on April 25 by 10,000
followers protesting harrassment and demanding official recognition
that catapulted the group from obscurity to the top of the agenda
for nervous party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong had managed to mount the biggest illegal rally in
Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen democracy movement, without any
warning to the authorities, suggesting formidable powers of
mobilization. Furthermore, the group says it has 100 million
members around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That number is impossible to verify, particularly in a group
that claims no formal organization aside from an allegiance to the
teachings of its founder, Li Hongzhi, who relies heavily on the
Internet to communicate messages to his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk in northeastern China who is
now based in the United States, started Falun Gong in 1992 as a
fusion of the ancient Chinese practice of qigong _ the channeling
of vital energies through breathing exercises _ with elements of
Buddhism and Taoism.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members insist they are interested only in physical
and moral uplift and eschew politics. But if Falun Gong's rapid
response to the crackdown is any indication, the Chinese
authorities may have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds ranging from a few dozen to several thousand demonstrated
Wednesday in 30 cities across China, including Shanghai, Tianjin,
Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Those rallies came despite a blanket of silence about the
detentions in the official Chinese news media. The police declined
to comment on the detentions and protests.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is only one of several quasi-religious movements that
have emerged in China since Deng Xiaoping began reforming the
economy in 1979 and social controls were relaxed. With its mixture
of martial arts and mysticism, it bears enough resemblance to the
popular movements that wreaked havoc in the final decades of the
last imperial dynasty to make the Communist authorities
apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   As China enters a period of fresh social and economic upheaval,
with faltering state enterprises laying off millions of workers and
rural incomes stalling, Beijing may have concluded that Falun Gong
is too much of a threat.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, hundreds of Falun Gong members began gathering at
dawn in the tree-lined streets near Zhongnanhai. Before a crowd
could coalesce, the police hustled them on to buses and removed
them quickly, said Wang Xiaoyan, the wife of one of the detained
leaders, Ji Liewu.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to tell the government that there's no reason to
arrest students of Falun Gong,'' said Ms. Wang, who spoke to
several participants by telephone. ``As people got near
Zhongnanhai, the police were ready. They forced them to leave, to
get on buses to take them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wang said Wednesday that more than 1,000 Falun Gong members
were being held in a football stadium outside Beijing. The Hong
Kong rights group said people were also being held at two stadiums
and other locations. From there, the group said, people were being
sent back to their homes in the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong spokeswoman for Falun Gong described a similar
sequence of events in Guangzhou, in the south. Roughly 2,000
demonstrators congregated in front of a government building early
Wednesday morning, she said. The police forced most onto buses and
they were taken to an unknown destination.
</P>
<P>
   In central Beijing on Thursday morning, the fear of unrest hung
heavy in the torpid air. Hundreds of riot police and soldiers
maintained their positions around Zhongnanhai. Water-cannon trucks
were parked in courtyards across the street from the compound,
while riot shields were lined up in gleaming rows.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the police closed a main thoroughfare on the
western edge of the compound, causing traffic jams that paralyzed
much of downtown. On Thursday, pedestrians and bicyclists were
allowed back, but cars were still blocked. On the streets nearby,
scores of people squatted on the sidewalk, watching the scene
curiously. One or two appeared to be meditating, but it was unclear
whether they were acolytes of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the government is so wary of this group is that its
members blend seamlessly into ordinary society. Unlike the
flag-waving, slogan-shouting students of 1989, Falun Gong followers
tend to be middle-aged people _ a large percentage female, and many
retired _ who make the most unlikely of rebels.

DODGERS UNVEIL LUXURY BOXES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And you thought the beer was expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers unveiled the first of 30 planned luxury boxes before
Wednesday night's game, complete with gourmet food and
indoor/outdoor seating. The price tag runs from $370,000-$390,000
for one season. Fifteen have already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury suites, which accommodate between 14 and 20 people,
can also be purchased in a half package for around $185,000.
Included are parking passes and tickets to all events at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Among the perks for luxury suites is getting to take batting
practice (begin ital)with(end ital) the players before the game.
Dodgers dignitaries such as Tom Lasorda and front-office executives
will be available to entertain clients in the suites during the
season. Lasorda is one of baseball's great story tellers, but don't
ask him about letting Tom Niedenfuer pitch to the Cardinals' Jack
Clark in the 1985 playoffs (it does not have a happy ending).
</P>
<P>
   The luxury suites are proof that the Dodgers have gone away from
plans for tearing down the existing Dodger Stadium and building a
new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never say never, but for the foreseeable future our focus is
here,'' Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Fox owns 40 percent of the new Staples Center, the
Dodgers will be closely monitoring ticket sales in the new arena.
While new stadiums in Cleveland and Baltimore brought unprecedented
attendance, there is concern that the Dodgers attendance (41,000)
will not be bumped by improving the facility. The NHL Kings and NBA
Clippers drew poorly in their former buildings and the Lakers were
not an automatic sellout last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken a lot to (Kings president) Tim Lieweke about
that very issue,'' Graziano said. ``Initially, attendance will be
up because of the new building, but after that you have to win to
keep fans coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenues, however, will increase considerably with the luxury
suites. The Dodgers claim they have lost money the last four
seasons and have been searching for new ways to generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the club has not been approached by an advertiser
about purchasing the naming rights for Dodger Stadium. Ballparks
such as Candlestick Park have been renamed 3Com Park and Jack
Murphy Stadium in San Diego was renamed Qualcomm. Such deals have
generated up to $160 million for teams.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing the air: Graziano held a meeting for the entire staff
at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday in an attempt to reaffirm his
position as head of the club's operation. Responding to published
reports that Rick Welts, the former NBA marketing whiz who has
taken over as the head of Fox Sports, is the de facto president of
the Dodgers, Graziano said he wanted to quell fears within the rank
and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday was a tough day around here,'' Graziano said. ``There
were a lot of long faces in in the offices and it was important to
clear the air. It sounded like I was out and that is not true.
Having Rick here helps with the day-to-day communication. (Fox
heads) Chase (Carey) and Peter (Chernin) are handling a million
things at once. This makes that easier.... It will take a while for
everything to settle down. I will take the arrows for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold to start: Right-hander Jamie Arnold, who took a no-hitter
into the sixth inning during his only other start this season (May
5 at Montreal), will start the second game of today's day-night
doubleheader against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a middle reliever all season, started for six years in
the Atlanta organization. He never made the major-league roster so
he never had contact with the Braves' vaunted starting staff of
Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to a start, but believe me, I'm just happy
to be here,'' said Arnold, who also has made 24 relief appearances.
``Everyone here has been so great. Mike Maddux came up to me and
said, `If you start tomorrow, I want you to come down to the
bullpen tonight so we can talk about the hitters.' They're all like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold was given a five-game suspension for his part in the July
11 on-field brawl with the Seattle Mariners. He was not ejected
from the game, but replays show him repeatedly hitting Mariners
reliever Damaso Marte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just responding to what I saw,'' said Arnold, who is
appealing. ``In no way did I start anything. I wanted to protect a
teammate.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
OVER a two-week period this fall, the best golfers in the world
will play eight rounds of golf, four of them in Houston and four
more in the south of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For their trouble, they will divvy up $10 million _ $5 million
at Champions Golf Club and an additional $5 million at Valderrama,
the recent Ryder Cup course that is hosting the new World Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackie Burke founded Champions in the mid-1950s, Burke and
his contemporaries, the stud players of their day, did not earn
that much in their entire careers combined.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was a different time into which Champions was born.
Everything was smaller then, from the size of the paychecks to the
physical size of the guys cashing them. Regarding the former, Burke
doesn't pay much attention to all the extra commas and zeros. He
remains the ultimate of purists, saying it's the golf, stupid, not
the money; that every player is an amateur at heart once he or she
addresses the little dimpled ball.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter, well, that's among the reasons Burke
delights in bringing the most elite PGA Tourists back to his
exclusive track in our northwest suburb _ once every four years in
the future _ for the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like to see how the architecture is holding up,''
Burke explains.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't lay out Champions with titanium in mind. The only Big
Bertha he knew back then probably tended bar over on Jackrabbit
Road, which is what they used to call FM 1960, now a seven-lane
concrete expanse of strip shopping centers and billboards that
leads, somewhat incongruously, to Jackie's throwback oasis of pure,
unadulterated golf.
</P>
<P>
   Champions is a fortysomething course that has far more in common
with those built during the last century than the ones to be
developed in the coming one. There are no tricks, gimmicks or
gadgets to be found on Burke's piney acreage hard by Cypress Creek.
It's not particularly fan-friendly, unless you're a fan who values
tradition over optimum sight lines and fanny comfort.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody who really knows golf knows Champions is a great
place to watch golf because it's a great place to play golf. Hal
Sutton, the Tour Championship's 1998 winner, dropped by Wednesday
to tell us he could hardly wait to return with his sticks the final
week of October, when the top 30 on the money list will convene for
the final official North American tour event of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need every club you've got out there,'' Sutton said.
``It's an honest test of your abilities. I don't know of anybody
who doesn't like to play Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke has not made, and will not make, any changes to his
beloved course to accommodate golf's relentless _ reckless? _
technological advances, although he jokes about digging up the
parking lot and the neighborhood across the street to add length to
compensate for the high-tech clubs and hardbody golfers.
</P>
<P>
   It rankled him to see the British Open fairways at Carnoustie
narrowed to the point that drivers became superfluous, to be pulled
from the bag only at one's peril.
</P>
<P>
   Look what happened to runaway 54-hole leader Jean Van de Velde,
the famously flopping Frenchman, when he stubbornly tried to deploy
his driver coming down the stretch on Sunday. Van de Velde's
stupidity allowed Paul Lawrie to erase Jackie's record for staging
the greatest comeback in a major, the eight shots Burke made up at
the 1956 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see anyone hitting 2-irons off the tees at our
place,'' Burke said. ``That's not how golf was meant to be
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie is such a stickler for golf as it was meant to be played
that he no longer considers new club members who have handicaps in
excess of 15. Champions doesn't need the cash anymore, nor does it
require the exposure or prestige that having the Tour Championship
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Although he contends, ``You don't become a real golf club until
you're 100 years old,'' he fully recognizes what a jewel he has.
And he wants his sport to share it with him on a quadrennial basis.
</P>
<P>
   Burke would never ask his membership to swallow the
inconvenience of an annual tournament again, but he does warn them
that he remains doggedly intent on bringing an encore U.S. Open to
Champions in his lifetime. This summer marks the 30th anniversary
of the Open's only previous visit to the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   If they can play it at Pinehurst
</P>
<P>
   ``With the racetrack (Sam Houston Race Park) and the mall
(Willowbrook) for parking,'' Burke said, ``and the Houston Golf
Association to coordinate everything, we could do it easily. It's
something I definitely want to see happen. I haven't given up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will he. People told Jackie he was nuts to build Champions
way out in the middle of nowhere. It appears they were wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a day of frantic arm-twisting and
deal-making, Republican leaders in the House took a big step toward
salvaging their cherished tax-cutting bill early on Thursday,
winning a critical procedural vote rewriting the legislation to
quell a revolt by party moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for passage of the $792 billion tax cut improved
substantially after Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and other
senior Republicans pressured, cajoled and finally made a deal with
about a dozen moderates who said the tax cut was too big and left
too little money for debt reduction and domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of as few as five of the moderates could still
leave the Republicans short of the votes needed to pass the bill,
given their thin majority in the House and the nearly united
opposition of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill disproportionately benefits the wealthy
and would do nothing to address the more pressing problem of
assuring the long-term viability of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   After stalling throughout Wednesday, the House leadership
brought the bill to the floor for the procedural vote, a test on
the rules governing the debate, around midnight. It cleared that
hurdle by a vote of 219 to 208, as two Republicans voted with the
Democrats. A vote on final passage of the bill is scheduled for
later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The procedural vote came after the two sides spent hours meeting
in a conference room just off the House floor cobbling together a
compromise. Under the agreement, the central element of the House
tax-cutting package _ a 10 percent reduction in personal income tax
rates _ would be made contingent on the government reducing the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cut under consideration in the House would be the
largest since 1981. Many Republicans have been calling for another
big tax cut for years, and have stepped up their demands as the
government has moved from deficit to surplus.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday, President Clinton repeated
his threat to veto either the House or the Senate version, saying
they would endanger the nation's long-term prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly $1 trillion in projected surpluses up for grabs in
the next decade, Republican leaders say allocating nearly all of it
to a tax cut would help limit the growth in federal spending and
provide a potent campaign issue in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we say to the American people, `We're sorry we
overcharged you,''' said Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, kicking off
the debate on the floor on Wednesday night. ``So we're going to
give back some of your hard-earned tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But just passing the bill in the House became a high-stakes
drama on Wednesday. On the line was not just the fate of the bill,
but the ability of Hastert and his lieutenants to hold together
their razor-thin and fractious majority.
</P>
<P>
   The gridlock in the House came as a $778 billion tax cut package
with different features from the House version won bipartisan
approval from the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two centrist Democrats, Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, joined all 11 Republicans in voting in favor of
the bill, which would provide somewhat more tax relief to the
middle class than the House bill. The other seven Democrats on the
committee voted against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to limit any tax cut to around $300 billion and
focus its benefits on low and middle income people. The House plan
in particular, Clinton said, risked a return of federal budget
deficits, fails to leave enough money for debt reduction and would
require deep cuts in education, health and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must decide whether to invest the surplus to strengthen
America over the long term or to squander it for the short term,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indirectly encouraged the Republican moderates in the
House, saying he would work with both parties to find a compromise
that provides for a smaller tax cut once Congress and the
administration settle on a plan to shore up the two entitlement
programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare. Both
programs will face increasing financial pressure as the baby-boom
generation ages and retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will work with any member of either party willing to put
first things first,'' Clinton said at the news conference at the
White House. ``We can have a tax cut and do the right thing for the
long term in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise plan under consideration in the House on
Wednesday night was complicated, but spoke to the main concern of
many of the Republican moderates _that the party was not doing
enough to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt held by the public _ the portion that is most
economically important _ is about $3.6 trillion, and is the legacy
of years of budget deficits in which the government had to borrow
money by selling Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   This year Washington will pay interest on those bonds of about
$229 billion, or about 14 percent of the total federal budget. The
total federal debt, including money owed by the government to
Social Security, is $5.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable confusion about details of the plan
agreed to by the moderates. In general, it would require the
nation's total debt or interest payments on the debt to decline for
the proposed reductions in income-tax rates to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for each of the personal income tax brackets _
which start at 15 percent and rise to 39.6 percent _ to be reduced
by 10 percent each over the next decade in five steps. In 2009, the
15 percent bracket would be to 13.5 percent and the 39.6 percent
bracket would be 36.2 percent. The provision, the largest in the
bill, would cost the Treasury $375 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise would allow the first of the five phased-in
reductions to take effect as planned in 2001, but to delay further
reductions in the rates if the debt had not declined. The money
that would then be saved by not enacting the tax cut would go to
debt reduction instead under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a deal,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who
was among the moderates holding out for changes in the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everything, but it surely makes it more realistic in
terms of relating the across-the-board tax cuts to the surplus,''
Ms. Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the reduction in income tax rates, the House bill
includes a reduction in the top capital gains tax rate to 15
percent from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, would also repeal the inheritance tax
on large estates, create deductions for health insurance costs and
reduce the so-called marriage penalty, which forces many two-income
couples to pay more in taxes than if they were single.

RED SOX RUN INTO TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Red Sox needed another bat for the stretch
drive last summer, general manager Dan Duquette recycled Mike
Stanley, whose veteran presence and clutch hitting helped carry the
Sox to the wild card in his second go-round with the club.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as another trading deadline looms and the team's hold
on another wild-card berth is slipping, Stanley was among the Sox
batters most in need of a pick-me-up from somebody, anybody, on a
night they managed to turn a hit-and-run single into a
morale-killing double play.
</P>
<P>
   A slump that is stretching into six weeks continued for Stanley,
who also was charged with a critical error in the seventh inning of
Wednesday night's 6-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles and All-Star
pitcher Mike Mussina before 33,690 on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   With Toronto winning its fifth in a row, the Sox lead the Blue
Jays by just a game in the American League East and in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are a few spots that definitely would help us
out,'' said pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who came into the seventh with
a 1-0 lead and a four-hit, no-walk shutout but went home with his
second straight loss, as the Red Sox failed yet again to win
back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Dan. I'm sure he'll do whatever he can to help the team,
but just because you need something doesn't mean it's available. I
think our biggest thing lately is we've got guys aching and
paining, from the guy coaching first base with a broken hand (Dave
Jauss) to our players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we're not at the end of the season. We've got a long
way to go. Things can turn around at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who has two hits in his last 23 at-bats and is now
batting just .209 (27 for 129) in 41 games since June 3, was unable
to scoop a low throw that reached him on a short hop from shortstop
Nomar Garciaparra, who already had made one error and probably
should have been charged with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to pick it,'' Stanley said. ``The ball was in the
dirt, and I just didn't come up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   That error, which allowed Jeff Conine to reach safely, proved
the undoing of Saberhagen (6-4).
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken followed with a base hit, and after Saberhagen turned
Jeff Reboulet's popped-up bunt into a force play at third, Charles
Johnson, the Orioles' No. 9 hitter, blooped an opposite-field
single to right to score Conine. ``A fastball up and in,''
Saberhagen said. ``A good pitch. Well-placed (hit).''
</P>
<P>
   Rheal Cormier replaced Saberhagen, and Brady Anderson delivered
a sacrifice fly, scoring Reboulet with the run that broke a 1-1
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid pitcher,'' Saberhagen said with a sardonic smile,
``pitching on days we don't score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, making their first visit to Boston with the season
more than half over, then scored four runs in the eighth on five
straight hits, four off setup man Derek Lowe, including a two-run
double by Conine, and the last a two-run single by Ripken off Rich
Garces.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, meanwhile, gave up a first-inning run on a walk and
Reggie Jefferson's RBI double, then cruised to his 13th win, a
total exceeded only by Pedro Martinez in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina retired 11 straight batters from the time slumping Troy
O'Leary (.210 this month, 13 for 62, 6 RBIs) grounded into a double
play with runners on first and third in the first until Jason
Varitek's single with one out in the fifth. With Varitek on the
move, Darren Lewis followed with a hard-hit ground ball that second
baseman Reboulet smothered, but with no play on Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he whirled and threw to second, while Varitek, halfway
to third, unaccountably stopped. Varitek wore himself out trying to
stay alive in a prolonged rundown, but his efforts backfired when
third baseman Ripken threw to second, where Will Clark, the first
baseman, tagged out Lewis. Eventually Varitek was tagged out, too,
as Mussina got in the act, taking a throw from Clark, then flipping
to Reboulet, who applied the tag.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scoring at home, the play went single Lewis, 4-6-5-3
to retire Lewis, and 3-1-4 to retire Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, maybe we're just trying to do a little too much,'' manager
Jimy Williams said. ``That's all. Certainly aggressive. Maybe the
big part of the game, and the big part of the play, was Reboulet
pouncing on that ball and throwing to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thought the runner rounded second too far, and he
thought right. If (Varitek) continued to third, he probably would
have made it. I don't think you wear Tek out, but he stayed in that
hotbox a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox put two runners on base again in the sixth, when Jose
Offerman drew his second walk and Jefferson singled with two out,
but Garciaparra lined out to left to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were not heard from again until Garciaparra's two-out
single in the ninth off reliever Mike Timlin. O'Leary followed with
another hit, bringing up Stanley a final time. But Stanley bounced
Timlin's first pitch on one hop to Reboulet, who had moved from
second to third, ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's hit meant he avoided going three straight games
without a hit for the first time since his rookie season. But he is
just 4 for 26 since returning from his groin injury, and also was
charged with an error in the third on a bad-hop special.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, Stanley was batting .307 and had driven in 30 runs in
the team's first 45 games. Since then, he has 15 RBIs in 41 games,
and more strikeouts (37) than hits (27), including two whiffs
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Rice talked to me and is watching the films,'' Stanley
said. ``I don't want to watch the film. Hell, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you look for answers, the more you get yourself
crazy. You just try to clear your head when you leave here and
start over again the next day. If you sit there and break it down,
you'll go crazy.''

AJAX COPING WITH NEW EUROPEAN SOCCER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Daniel ``Dani'' da Cruz Carvalho was born in
Portugal in the 1970s, when more political dissidents than soccer
players were leaving the country. But the situation in Europe has
changed greatly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Borders have fallen, dictators are pretty much out, currencies
are being united. And soccer players are following a free agent
trail of riches.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 19, Dani had found his way from Sporting
Clube de Portugal to West Ham United in England to Ajax, the
Amsterdam club that had won its fourth European championship the
previous season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dani is a major part of Ajax as it moves into a phase of
reinventing itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy of Ajax is still to go with young players,''
Dani said Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night before Ajax defeated the Revolution,
2-1, in an exhibition before 18,573 at Foxboro Stadium. ``It's
better that way, because if you bring in older players, they are
already set in their habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajax is among the most famous and traditional clubs in the
world. It has always attracted the best young players in Holland,
such as Johan Cruyff, son of the club's maintenance man, who went
on to become the most dynamic player in Europe in the 1970s. Ajax
still brings in the country's best players to its tryout camps, but
it is expanding horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Though tradition is a hallmark of Ajax, the club has had to
react to changes caused by the European Court of Justice's Bosman
Ruling. Ajax used to profit from developing young players, who were
usually loyal to the club and also bound by contract to remain with
the team. In recent years, though, other teams have raided Ajax's
young players and are no longer required to provide compensation.
</P>
<P>
   This led to instability, which caused Ajax to tumble to sixth
place, 23 points behind champion Feyenoord, in the Dutch Honor
Division last season. This was a dramatic failure for a team still
loaded with stars. Management quickly moved to restructure. Only
goalkeeper Fred Grim, a perennial reserve, remains from the 1995
championship team.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998-99 season, twins Frank and Ron De Boer, symbols
of the Ajax development system, began negotiating with Barcelona,
which already had taken Louis van Gaal, coach of the '95 Ajax team.
Barcelona signed four players from Ajax, including the twins. So
much for loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much better this year,'' Dani said. ``Sure, we had very
good players last year. But we changed coaches during the season
and the essential players, the key players, were not at their best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only been together for 2 1/2 weeks this year, but we've
shown we have better organization in the team, more stability,
friendship among the players. We have all the ingredients to make a
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ajax has tapped into the world market for Brazilians, Danes,
Georgians, Greeks, and Portuguese. Now, Ajax is expanding its
search to Africa, where it has started partnerships in Cape Town
and Accra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small country and we have never been able to count on
having the money of Italy or Spain,'' team manager David Endt said.
``So we have always had to be resourceful. The kids will continue
to come to us, but we do not have enough of them in Holland, so we
have to develop other resources.''

   Ajax, on a US tour that continues with the Gotham Cup at Giants
Stadium Friday, displayed an effective mix of veterans such as
Brian Laudrup and Richard Witschge and youngsters such as
18-year-old left wing Kevin Bobson against the Revolution.

<P>
   Nikos Machlas, who led the league in scoring with 34 goals for
Vitesse Arnhem, scored off passes from Laudrup and Richard Knooper
in the 10th minute. Jamar Beasley tied the score with his first
Revolution goal in the 56th minute, then Shota Arveladze headed in
the deciding score 10 minutes later.

   Ghanaian defender Joseph Addo performed well in his first
90-minute stint since May. The Revolution have one foreign slot and
will make a decision on Addo by Friday . . . El Salvador national
team striker Elias Montes attended the game and plans to train with
the Boston Bulldogs.

MILLER FIGURES ORIOLES STILL HAVE A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Like most of us, Orioles manager Ray Miller enjoys
talking about the good old days. Good times when Brooks and Frank
Robinson were household names. Exciting times when a fiesty little
man named Earl Weaver stood 10 feet tall and helped make Memorial
Stadium a regular Field of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Miller can recall watching from afar in 1971 as a minor league
hopeful in Rochester, N.Y. He never made it to the Show as a player
but in 1978, Miller came out of the Orioles farm system as a
pitching coach. He had eight good years in Baltimore _ five under
Weaver's wing _ and picked up two World Series rings. From there he
managed two years with the Minnesota Twins and followed with 10
years as pitching coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Now he's back
in Baltimore as manager _ and waiting for those good times to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter came in and said to me, `I could tell you what Earl
Weaver would have done with this club,' '' Miller said when asked
to compare his team with the Orioles of the 1970s. ``I told him
don't tell me what Earl would have done. Weaver never had a
four-year middle reliever making $4 million or a six-year right
fielder making $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl went away for a year and the salaries doubled. He came
back and said to me one day at home plate, `What happened? What has
happened to the game?' I could ask the same question, but I won't.
I told the club at the All-Star break if we could pick up one game
a week, we'd be in good shape. We play Boston and New York at the
end. Something could happen. But we have to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Ray Miller is no Earl Weaver. But after a sorry
start, his club is finally playing like the one that should be at
or near the top of the American League East based on pure talent.
With Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 6-1 victory over the Red Sox at Fenway Park
and a loss by Tampa Bay Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Baltimore was able to
escape the AL East cellar for the first time since June 30. The
Orioles are still 15 1/2 games behind the Yankees and 10 1/2 games
behind the Sox in the wild-card race, but Miller says there still
is time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we capable?'' he said. ``Yes. But we have to play good and
Boston has got to come back and Toronto has to cool off. There are
a lot of clubs ahead of us and we have to take care of our own
business. Our club has played reasonably well for quite awhile. But
the bullpen has had problems. Hopefully, they'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's victory was the pitching of Mike
Mussina (13-4), who long has been one of baseball's most consistent
pitchers. He allowed one run on four hits in eight innings to win
his fourth straight start. Baltimore has won seven of its last nine
games and merits watching the next month or so. Few clubs can match
the Orioles' talent.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem the worst is behind them. The bullpen has 20 blown
saves in 34 chances, with Mike Timlin, who was brought in to be the
team's closer and signed to a four-year contract, blowing eight
saves in 17 chances. Miller called on Timlin to pitch the ninth and
he held the Red Sox scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``My defense worked for me tonight,'' said Mussina. ``The
hardest ball that was hit went to my left fielder. You need breaks
to win games like that. If you play well, you create your own luck.
That's why we're winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 79-83 season, the Orioles retooled, and except for
injured second baseman Delino DeShields, much of the club put
together by general manager Frank Wren is intact.
</P>
<P>
   That includes $65 million baby Albert Belle, a free agent
signing who's hitting .276 with 20 home runs and 59 RBIs.
Considering what he is making _ and Baltimore's dreadful start,
that's a bad year. So bad Belle reportedly has voided the no-trade
clause in his five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard that one,'' said Miller. ``I know Albert is
not at the pace that he was last year. But still he's going to
drive in 100 runs. Obviously, he's hasn't gotten as hot as he has
gotten the last several years. But he's been hitting pretty good
the last month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a top player and getting top billing, it comes
back on you. When the bullpen isn't doing the job, the pitching
isn't doing the job and you're losing games. That's also true if
you leave a lot of men on base.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Orioles have had three six-game losing streaks and
a 10-game losing streak. But in the club's 40 victories entering
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, the team ERA was 2.86.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of the way our club has played all year,'' said
Miller. ``We had pitching problems the first month. Other than Mike
Mussina, nobody was pitching well. In the last 40 games, our
starters are second in all of baseball. As it is, we score more
runs than the Yankees. We're second in hitting and first in
defense. That's pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bullpen does the job we've got a chance. But we've had
20 blown saves. Cut that to a normal amount, four or five, and
we've got 15 in the win column. We can't continue to do that. We
were 1-11 in games against Toronto and we had the lead in nine of
them. But then, they've been kicking everybody's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you say about the Orioles, it all gets back to
Belle. And you can't ask him about the key to the second half
because he's not talking. But Belle can make a statement with his
bat in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Albert is the guy who's taking the biggest beating
because he's got a big contract and still leaves men on base,''
said Miller. ``But we're a team. You've got B.J. Surhoff hitting
right in front of him leading the league in total bases and hits.
Belle and Brady Anderson are 2-3 in walks. Harold Baines has 60
RBIs in 200 at-bats hitting behind him. If Belle was hitting 20
points higher, we'd be hitting .305. So whatever he does has an
obvious effect.''

US WINS, BUT PUERTO RICO STEALS THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ It isn't often that NBA players get upstaged in
international competition, but that was the case here
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. The United States' 83-61 victory over Venezuela,
its seventh in as many games in the pre-Olympic qualifier,
represented the fewest points scored by an NBA-dominated team. The
previous low was 87. But the game was reduced to back-burner status
after an emotional, down-to-the-wire win by Puerto Rico over
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The Puerto Ricans went into the game knowing they had to beat
Canada by at least 4 points to avoid meeting the Yanks in
Saturday's semifinals. They won, 80-75, as their soon-to-be
retiring star, Jose Ortiz, scored 7 unanswered points in the final
2:13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt immortal,'' Ortiz said via translation. ``I felt
ecstatic. I didn't want to go off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   After Canada's Steve Nash threw the ball away on the final
possession, the crowd at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum went wild.
</P>
<P>
   The win likely pits Puerto Rico against Canada in one semifinal
on Saturday, the winner to get a berth in the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' likely semifinal opponent will be Argentina.
Wednesday night, the Yanks led, 48-33, at the half, holding
Venezuela to 30.5 percent shooting. But they played bored in the
second half and will need to be sharper Thursday night against
Puerto Rico.

DODGERS LOSE TO ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ismael Valdes lost the game, but won some respect.
</P>
<P>
   After re-injuring the right hand he hurt in his last start,
Valdes remained in Wednesday night's 5-4 loss to the Colorado
Rockies in front of 34,721 at Dodger Stadium on grit alone.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a game-winning homer to Kurt Abbott with one out in
the eighth inning, two innings after landing on his pitching hand
when Rockies starter and former teammate Pedro Astacio brushed him
off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (8-8) came out for the next inning and threw three warmup
pitches to the backstop. A year ago, a month ago, he would have
come out of the game. But in front of manager Davey Johnson, he
regained his composure. He was in search of his fourth consecutive
victory and wanted to keep the streaking Dodgers moving.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was the losing pitcher for the Dodgers, who had won
eight of 10. Now they face a day-night doubleheader with the
Rockies today before heading on to Arizona for three with the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Dodgers remain a game ahead of last-place
Colorado in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed 12 hits in eight innings, making 113 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers appeared ready to keep him in the game, getting
two-run homers by Todd Hollandsworth and Raul Mondesi to lead 4-3
heading into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mondesi's homer in the third, the Dodgers went cold.
Astacio (10-8), who beat the Dodgers 5-2 on July 6, allowed just
three hits over the final five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Dave Veras took over for Astacio to start the ninth
and retired all three batters he faced to earn his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes left his last start, a 3-1 victory last Friday against
the Angels, after taking a line drive off his left palm. The
swelling subsided between starts, but he was not sharp against the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   They scored twice in the first inning, the same number of runs
he allowed in his previous three starts (19 innings). With one out,
Darryl Hamilton walked and Larry Walker, who entered the game
second in the NL in batting, reached on an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Danta Bichette followed with a two-run double to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got both runs back in the bottom of the inning when
Mark Grudzielanek singled with one out and Hollandsworth crushed a
two-run fastball into the empty right-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, making his 14th start in the last 24 games and
fourth at first base, has responded to the additional playing time.
Hollandsworth batted .381 (8 for 21) with two homers on the recent
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes continued to struggle, allowing a run in the third on
another RBI double by Bichette and a run in the sixth when Kurt
Abbott doubled with two out and scored on a single by former Dodger
Henry Blanco.
</P>
<P>
   But Astacio was no sharper than Valdes. After the Rockies took a
3-2 lead in the top of the third, the Dodgers moved back in front
4-3 when Mondesi drove a low liner into the left-field stands for
his 22nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third in five games after not hitting a home run in
112 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance for more in the fifth when Grudzielanek
opened with a single. Hollandsworth followed with a drive to center
that was hit just as hard as his first-inning homer. But by then
the sun was down and the humidity was rolling in. The ball was
caught by Hamilton at the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek took second on an infield out by Gary Sheffield and
tried to score when Devon White singled to left. But Bichette's
throw to the plate was on a line and Grudzielanek was out.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
For about seven innings, the Astros were working on the defensive
equivalent of a perfect game. Ironically _ when it was all said and
done _ the focus was on a play that wasn't made.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lance Berkman's aggressive pursuit of Tony Womack's
eighth-inning line drive to left turned into an inside-the-park
grand slam, the key blow in the Arizona Diamondbacks'
come-from-behind 7-4 victory over the Astros on Wednesday night at
the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone quick to point fingers at the rookie left fielder
need look no further than the Astros' bullpen, which couldn't hold
the lead, and the offense, which was almost nonexistent with the
exception of a four-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Berkman is not to blame for the loss,'' Astros first baseman
Jeff Bagwell said. ``We could have hit more; the bullpen could have
done a better job. We had our opportunities earlier in the game; we
just didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning a season-high eight games in a row, the Astros
have dropped their last two, allowing the Cincinnati Reds to pull
within a game of first place in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed just eight hits, four in one inning, and the
bullpen failed to protect a 4-2 lead for Scott Elarton, who left
after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Womack's unconventional game-winning hit off Billy Wagner was
the first inside-the-park grand slam in the majors this season.
Seattle's Dan Wilson accomplished the rare feat May 3, 1998,
against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner replaced Jay Powell with two outs and the bases loaded in
the eighth inning and was up 0-2 in the count when Womack lined the
ball into left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the pitch up (in the strike zone) enough,''
Wagner said. ``If I would have gotten the pitch where I wanted it,
it probably would have broken his bat. The thing I'm most upset
about is giving up those runs on an 0-2 pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The traffic jam on the basepaths was created by Powell, who
walked Travis Lee, hit Andy Fox and walked pinch hitter Jay Bell to
load the bases before Wagner entered.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's HBP was controversial since it appeared he stepped into
Powell's pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he stuck his leg out there, but I didn't
think he made a huge effort to get out of the way, either,'' said
Powell, who has been charged with five runs in his last two
outings. ``It was a good play on his part because they needed
baserunners. The walks are what really hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkman, making just his fourth big-league start, came within
inches of making a diving catch on Womack's line drive. But the
ball got past him and rolled to the left-field wall before he could
retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Womack was heading toward the plate for the first grand
slam of his career. It was the Diamondbacks' sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got a pretty good jump, and I came close to
getting it,'' Berkman said. ``But in hindsight, the way it turned
out wasn't the way I planned it. I've always played aggressively,
maybe to a fault.''
</P>
<P>
   As Berkman spends more time around the Astros, he will learn
that aggressiveness is seldom discouraged. In fact, it has been the
mark of the team since Larry Dierker took over as manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Lance did the right thing by going for it,'' Dierker
said. ``With two out, their runners were running with the pitch,
and they probably would have scored a couple of runs even if he had
played it on the hop. I didn't think he could get it, but he made a
nice try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been generally pleased with his defense. To me, it wasn't
the offense or the defense tonight; it was the bullpen. I don't
really want to put blame on anyone, but we just didn't get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Berkman made a highlight-reel defensive play in the first
inning, and Richard Hidalgo, Derek Bell and Bill Spiers each
flashed some dandy leather behind Elarton and the four relievers
who followed him to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who threw 91 pitches, allowed two runs on six hits and
was in position to be the losing pitcher until the Astros took him
off the hook with four runs in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one feels worse than the bullpen about this one,'' Elarton
said. ``Believe me, I know. It wasn't too long ago when I was down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack, whose four RBIs represented a career high, beat out an
infield single to lead off the game and moved to second on a hit by
Matt Williams. Both scored on a double by former Astro Steve
Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got into a rhythm,'' Elarton said. ``Thank goodness
for the defense behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's second homer in as many days keyed the Astros'
four-run fifth. The Diamondbacks had three infielders positioned
between second and third base, daring Bagwell to shoot for the
right side of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell had a better idea, clearing everyone on the field with a
three-run shot into Lefty's Pub. Craig Biggio had a sacrifice fly
in the inning.

HEY, GOOSE, RYAN GOT WHAT HE DESERVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, of course Nolan Ryan received preferential treatment in the
five years he spent with the Rangers. Let's get that on the table
right off the get-go.
</P>
<P>
   No apologies. There was a double standard in those days. There
was Ryan, and then there was everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doesn't understand the reason for that is either
pitifully jealous, disturbingly petty or completely brain-dead.
Maybe all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to old friend Goose Gossage, who has once again
engaged his mouth before notifying his medulla oblongata. It's not
the first time Goose has ever shot from the lip before thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the way-out-of-line remarks Gossage made the other
day about Ryan to New York Daily News baseball writer Bill Madden,
coming just days before Ryan will be inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, N.Y., is that Gossage himself is one
of the most engaging characters and good guys ever to wear a
Rangers cap.
</P>
<P>
   Goose almost always had two fearful weapons at his disposal: A
98-mph fastball and an opinion on everything.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes both were way out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the tone in Gossage's voice was almost plaintive.
How, he all but asked, am I going to get myself out of this one?
</P>
<P>
   He'd been quoted ripping Ryan for ``not going on the road'' when
the two were teammates on the Rangers in 1991. ``I was never a big
fan of Ryan's,'' he'd told Madden, who had actually phoned to talk
to Gossage about George Brett. ``I just didn't think he was a very
good teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage, who had been in the area taping a fantasy baseball show
yesterday, listened carefully as his quotes were read back to him.
He was mentally, if not physically, squirming but there was no one
to blame but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I can do to take it back now,'' Gossage said,
``but I definitely regret saying that. The timing is really bad. To
me, that was a dead issue and I wish I'd left it that way. It's
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is, just like it was unfortunate that it was even an
issue back in '91, or any of the other seasons Ryan spent in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a special case, Ryan, who declined comment,
was one. That's why Rangers TV analyst Tom Grieve, the team's
general manager at the time, was livid when he read what Gossage
had said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it sound like Nolan didn't make any road trips and
that's not true,'' Grieve said. ``When we signed him in Atlanta,
Nolan asked _ and he didn't demand _ that on occasion, when we had
a Monday off after a Sunday day game, if we had a problem if he
flew home to spend that time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 10 years older than everyone else. His kids were
getting ready to leave home. It seemed like a very reasonable
request. We said, `Of course you can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reporting with the other pitchers and catchers, Ryan
waited until March 1 to report to spring training each year, then
came in and regularly embarrassed teammates who'd been throwing for
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't earned the right to miss a few days to be with
his high school-age children, who could?'' Grieve asked. ``If every
player, including Goose Gossage, had the same work ethic and came
to play every day and were in the same physical shape and had the
same mental outlook as Ryan did, our team would have been much
better than it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was ready to pitch five innings when he walked off the
plane at Port Charlotte when everybody else was struggling to go
three. He gave more to the organization five times over than anyone
else on the team while he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, unlike so many of today's spoiled players, never asked
that the request be included in his contract. He paid his own
expenses when he left the team on his own and usually spent part of
those Mondays he was back in Texas working out at Arlington
Stadium, which had better facilities than he could find on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we paid Nolan, it was the greatest investment in
baseball history,'' Grieve said. ``It's mind-boggling that Goose
would bring this up now. The timing of it is so ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage's belated concern is that his remarks might somehow
taint this weekend's ceremony at Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to take anything away from what Nolan has
done,'' said Gossage, who is scheduled to be one of the Rangers' Dr
Pepper Luncheon series guest speakers next month. ``Certainly Nolan
is the greatest pitcher numbers-wise there ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed playing with Nolan but I was always a team player
and I just felt that \RRyan's leaving the team\S wasn't good for
morale. I wasn't the only one who felt that way. But it shouldn't
have been brought up at this time because it wasn't a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, when Gossage was popping off to Madden the other day,
that point was sadly omitted.

MINIMED'S INCOME SOARS 77 PERCENT

   LOS ANGELES -- Insulin pump maker MiniMed Inc. reported
Wednesday that second quarter income jumped 77 percent compared
with the like year-ago period, but its stock price fell 9.15
percent as investors apparently engaged in some profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended July 2, the company had net income of $4.87
million, or 16 cents per diluted share, compared with about $2.74
million, or 10 cents per share, in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales for the three-month period were $49.1 million, up 55
percent from $31.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the end of trading Wednesday, MiniMed's stock had fallen
$7.50 to close at $74.50. The price bounced between $81.375 to
$72.25 during a day in which 1.25 million shares were traded,
compared with a 30-day average volume of 339,000.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Davis, an analyst for BC Ziegler in Milwaukee, had expected
the company to earn 17 cents per share, but said that 16 cents was
not in the least disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very strong,'' he said. ``There's no let-up in demand
for their product.''
</P>
<P>
   According to MiniMed Chief Financial Officer Kevin Sayer,
diabetes patients are becoming increasingly aware of insulin pumps
through the Internet and other means of information and asking to
be put on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see more and more where patients are driving that cycle,''
Sayer said.

SHUTTLE LAUNCHING IS DELAYED A SECOND TIME

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Menacing weather within 10 miles of the
Kennedy Space Center here early on Thursday grounded the space
shuttle Columbia and its first woman commander on their second try
at liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said a thunderstorm drifted too close for comfort, exposing
the shuttle to the dangers of triggered lighting if it happened to
fly through one of the charged clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave it our best shot,'' the launching director, Ralph Roe,
radioed the Columbia's commander, Col. Eileen Collins of the Air
Force. ``Our best bet is to give it another try another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Collins replied: ``You guys did a great job tonight.
We're proud of the work, and the crew will be ready to go at the
next opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said they had obtained Air Force approval for a third launching
attempt at 12:24 a.m. on Friday for the Columbia and its cargo, the
$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle was to have been launched on Tuesday, but it
was halted in the final moments of the countdown because of a
hydrogen leak reading that turned turned out to be wrong, NASA
officials said.

WELLPOINT'S 2ND QUARTER TOPS 1998'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Managed care giant WellPoint Health Networks
Inc., the parent company of Blue Cross of California, reported a
second-quarter profit of $71.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings, released after the close of U.S. stock markets,
were a 15 percent improvement over the same quarter last year.
Revenues grew to $1.7 billion, over 16 percent more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Thousand Oaks-based company credited premium increases, cost
controls and a spike in California memberships for the earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results inched past market expectations; analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected an average of $1.02 a
share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good, solid quarter for them,'' said Ed Kroll, an
analyst with SG Cowen Securities Corp. in New York. ``It bodes well
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did especially well in California, its core market,
where membership grew 13.6 percent, a 586,000-person increase over
last year. Overall, the company said it had more than 7 million
members as of June 30, about 231,000 more than last year's second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's out-of-state presence continued to decline in
the second quarter. The heaviest losses were in WellPoint's
large-employer group, which lost more than 450,000, or about 20.4
percent, since the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll said the company has been purposefully culling members
from large-employer groups outside California.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been part of the program for the last couple of
quarters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint's membership in individual and small employer groups
outside California has grown during the same period, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from health plan premiums outpaced membership for the
quarter, growing from almost $1.5 billion in the second quarter of
1998 to $1.7 billion, a 16.6 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Peter O'Neill said premium increases in
California will average 6 percent or 7 percent this year in all
product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the medical inflation we're seeing in California,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint stock fell $0.0625 to $83.6875 Wednesday.

SPARKS ROUT MERCURY
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In their best start all season, the Sparks
accumulated a 25-point halftime lead to snap Phoenix's three-game
win streak as they coasted to an 84-63 victory in front of 5,723 at
the Forum Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (12-6) won their second straight game, ninth in 11
games, as they moved back into a second-place tie with Sacramento
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie had 18 points on 6-of-10 shooting as the Sparks shot
58 percent from the field in the first half, finishing at 50
percent overall while limiting Phoenix to a 29-percent effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first half was the best basketball we've played,'' Sparks
coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``As long as we continue to do that
we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Gordana Grubin was instrumental in building the Sparks'
early 22-10 margin, making all four of her shots, including three
3-pointers. It became a free-for-all for the Sparks, who weaved in
and out of the Mercury defense, creating exceptional plays with
relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton, who picked up two fouls in the first two minutes
of the game, came back with about eight minutes to go and scored 10
points before the half. She finished with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sparks easily in command, reserves Penny Toler, Tamecka
Dixon, Allison Feaster and Nina Bjedov got plenty of playing time.
With all but Ukari Figgs (sprained ankle) playing, the bench scored
29 points overall.
</P>
<P>
   This was sweet revenge for Saturday's 84-76 loss to the Mercury,
who were 34-of-41 from the free throw line, while the Sparks made
only eight visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so mad,'' said Mwadi Mabika. ``We played good out
there and the refs didn't give us our calls. We were just waiting
for our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks won the season series, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom had 18 points for Phoenix, but she was held to
6-of-17 shooting. The Sparks outrebounded the Mercury, 40-31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly, it was ugly,'' said Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller.
``First half we didn't set the tone, we walked on the floor as if
we were going to win it. L.A. played a great game. They were
physical, patient, they were great in transition and ran the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES: WNBA president Val Ackerman, who spoke to the
media before the game, reiterated her stance on the Buss family
retaining the ownership of the Sparks, who are second to last in
attendance. ``There's nothing to report that is any different than
it was before,'' she said. ``No one has a permanent right to have a
team.'' ... The attendance was the second lowest this season.

   Wednesday night, it was goodbye home runs No. 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   And so long, Jeff, after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Oakland A's, the Mariners' Fassero was treated to a
familiar yet unpleasant sight _ balls hit high and hard, screaming
out of the ballpark, with the shaken pitcher's exit not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez touched the lefty for a three-run homer in the
second and John Jaha followed with a two-run blast an inning later,
the ignition points for a 13-3 Oakland victory before a crowd of
42,223.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Fassero on a record-setting pace for homers served up
by a pitcher in a season, not to mention in grave danger of losing
his spot with the Mariners before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero stands just five homers shy of catching Ferguson Jenkins
(35 in 1973) for fourth on the pitchers' long ball list, 20 away
from tying Bert Blyleven (50 in 1986) for the worst pounding ever.
</P>
<P>
   A big season would have meant a big contract extension. Only
Fassero's once unsullied reputation currently is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   His career has gone south because: 1) he doesn't have the
financial security he desires; 2) his arm hasn't bounced back from
offseason surgery; or 3) it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The shellshocked Mariners starter made it through the first
inning, retiring the A's on a flyout, a caught base-stealer after a
walk and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Hernandez stroked a 2-0 pitch over a beer sign in
left and into the bullpen, scoring Olmedo Saenz and Matt Stairs,
who had reached on a hit batter and fielder's choice. For
Hernandez, it was just his third big-league homer, but second
against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Jaha jumped on a 2-2 delivery and smacked it 10
rows up in left, plating Jason Giambi, who had singled with two
outs. Jaha's homer was his 21st. He nearly had it his first time
up, driving one over Ken Griffey Jr.'s head and off the centerfield
wall for a 405-foot double.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (4-11) didn't come out for the fourth inning, drawing
his second-quickest hook of the season. He threw just 69 pitches,
again his second-lowest total. Just 37 were strikes, yet another
runner-up figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero didn't feel comfortable from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get behind every hitter, it's going to hurt you,'' he
said. ``I felt like I was just forcing it tonight. The first pitch
was bad location. When you start fighting yourself for control, the
location will be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He searched hard for some solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third inning, I relaxed a bit,'' Fassero said. ``Jaha
got a fastball in and hit it out. If I don't give that up, it might
have been a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing eight shutout innings at Anaheim on July 5,
Fassero had talked eagerly of getting a fresh start after the
All-Star break, of playing in a hitter's ballpark, that he was
back. But he bombed out at Dodger Stadium, getting lifted in the
fourth inning of an eventual 14-3 rout. Now he's 0-2 at Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero's earned run average is a bloated 7.04. His confidence
level is running on zero.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners must have known something. Earlier in the day, they
recalled Ryan Franklin from Class AAA Tacoma for long relief. He
was barely unpacked when the call came for him to replace Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and his mound successor, Ken Cloude, were hardly sharp.
Franklin went four innings, walking four, giving up a pair of runs
and barely escaping after loading the bases in the seventh. Cloude
served up six runs in two innings, including the first career grand
slam for Eric Chavez, who was an injury replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The A's mostly needed just one pitcher to get the job done,
control specialist Gil Heredia (7-5). Beating the Mariners, and
Fassero, for the second time this season, the right-hander went
eight innings, permitting RBI singles by David Bell and Raul Ibanez
and Tom Lampkin's fifth homer. Oakland's Chad Harville pitched the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella had little to say after his first
double-digit setback at Safeco. He had trouble differentiating any
of his pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's behind the hitters, that's for sure,'' Piniella said of
Fassero. ``Then Franklin got hit, Cloude got hit and our pitching
wasn't very good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field's first homestand comes to a close Thursday with a
3:35 p.m. contest. The Mariners will try to even their record at
4-4 in their new ballpark.

MARTE SENT DOWN, FRANKLIN RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Damaso Marte won't have to worry about that three-game
suspension any time soon. He might come to regret that.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after sliding down a clubhouse bannister and heading out
into the sunshine at Safeco Field Wednesday, the Mariners' rookie
reliever returned inside to find his name scratched from a hallway
lineup card. After five largely ineffective games in the big
leagues, Marte was optioned to Class AAA Tacoma, replaced on the
roster by Ryan Franklin, back for his second stint in Seattle this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Marte, 24, was in the process of appealing a three-game penalty
meted out by the American League for his part in a brawl at Dodger
Stadium July 11. Depending on his career progress, the lefty from
the Dominican Republic faces the unusual prospect of having the
possible suspension trail him throughout his baseball career and
resurface in a most inopportune moment: For instance, he might not
come back to the majors right away or he might return with another
organization.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think something like that has ever come up before,''
said Lee Pelekoudas, vice president of baseball administration.
``I'm assuming they would (penalize Marte eventually). He can pitch
in Tacoma right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marte, 0-1 with a 9.35 earned run average, heads to Tacoma after
taking the loss against Randy Johnson on Tuesday, giving up six
runs and 10 hits in four innings. He had entered a scoreless game
in relief of substitute starter Frankie Rodriguez, who had tired.
He left a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to work on a few things down there,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said of Marte. ``He needs to get more depth on
his slider and pitch away from left-handed hitters. His ball has
been coming back over the center of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, 26, was a starter in Tacoma but will be used in long
relief by the Mariners. The right-hander made three relief
appearances, including his big-league debut, with Seattle in May,
going 0-0 with a 6.35 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   This roster move likely won't be the last for the Mariners'
pitching staff. Without Marte, the club doesn't have a lefty in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLAINT DEPT.: The only loud bellowing heard from a player
regarding conditions at Safeco Field so far has come from former
Mariners pitcher Sterling Hitchcock. He didn't like the mound. And
he turned in seven shutout innings and got a victory throwing off
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably could have spent $250 and put a decent mound in
there,'' the San Diego lefty said last week. ``There was no stick
to it. Just a lot of slipping around.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Mariners pitchers quizzed about the hill Wednesday
swear by it. Jamie Moyer said it works fine for him. Frankie
Rodriguez said the only mound that compares is in Cleveland. Jose
Paniagua said the bullpen mound is too steep, but the regular one
is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Taking this complaint to the top, Safeco Field groundskeeper
Steve Peeler was stopped during pregame activities Wednesday. He
said any new mound might have a little too much give to it,
something that improves with use. He also had a response for
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he starts wearing a Mariner uniform, I don't care,''
Peeler said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE DRILL: A small fire was started in a club-level concession
stand, creating a little pregame excitement just after 4 p.m. An
employee inadvertently left a plastic bag filled with popcorn on a
grill, then turned on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinklers quickly doused the blaze, but stadium-wide alarms and
flickering lights stayed on for 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, eight emergency vehicles also showed up on the scene,
including two hook and ladder trucks, before it was determined the
new ballpark was not in serious danger.
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERY ROOM: Disabled list pitchers Eric Weaver and Rafael
Carmona threw simulated three-inning games from the Safeco mound
Wednesday and both were cleared to join Tacoma on rehabilitation
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Both right-handers, Weaver had surgery in May to remove a bone
spur, Carmona has missed a month with a tricep strain.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver will start in Calgary on Saturday and throw two innings
or 30 pitches, and gradually build up arm strength. Carmona will
have the option to start in a similar fashion or relieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't knock anybody over, but I was thrilled to get out
there and be engaged in competition again,'' said Weaver, who had
either Raul Ibanez or Ozzie Timmons stand in against him at the
plate. ``It's kind of like spring training again.''
</P>
<P>
   AND FINALLY: After Tuesday night's game, the official scorer
changed a walk originally credited to Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson
to reflect that the batter, Ken Griffey Jr., was hit by a 3-1
pitch.

 It'S BEEN A WEEKLONG PARTY AT SAFECO  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _
</P>
<P>
   Baseball may be baseball, but baseball at Safeco Field is a
party.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it has felt like this past week as the Mariners
moved outdoors and Safeco spectators found 517 million reasons to
fall in love with being out at the old ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe there wasn't a reason for every dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe splendor in the grass does not fully distract us from
the fact that that the Mariners' pitching is in a world of hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa was disastrous on opening night. Damaso Marte was the
ruinous answer for Randy Johnson and Wednesday night, Jeff
``Longball'' Fassero might have given the M's the final reason to
trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the new ballpark has been a festive and forgiving
atmosphere, one that makes a ballgame in Seattle now better than at
Jacobs Field, Coors Field, the Ballpark at Arlington or even Camden
Yards _ if only because Baltimore in July is hotter and sweatier
than Babe Ruth on a home-run tear and because Albert Belle might
flip you the bird.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Safeco Field's inaugural homestand ends Thursday. Too
bad, too, because it's been so much fun, we've barely noticed the
M's are still eight games out with the trade deadline looming.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few things observed, overheard, or learned _ the hard
way _ from a week in the new outdoor yard.
</P>
<P>
   Fly away?
</P>
<P>
   We can still see Ken Griffey looking out toward the fence in
right center after his first at-bat on opening day. On Monday, it
was the fence in left center when his second shoulda-been-gone fly
ball was caught at the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hit the ball any harder,'' Alex Rodriguez said after
launching his grand slam to lead the Mariners to a win Monday
night, when his best shot barely landed eight rows over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guess: Any chance for a new deal with either A-Rod
and/or Griffey will involve some guarantee that the fences come in.
</P>
<P>
   Food for thought
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1: How many innings have Mariner fans lost standing
on the hot dog line?
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 2: How many Safeco visitors committed midnight
raids on their home refrigerator after leaving the park hungry?
</P>
<P>
   Taking one for the team
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, am glad the public address announcer has made an
effort to educate Safeco Field patrons to be aware of foul balls.
They are wicked. I should know, since my personal Safeco moment
came in the seventh inning on opening night when, taking a break
from the press box, I sat in Section 146 to visit friends and a
Russ Davis foul ball landed in my face.
</P>
<P>
   A word of encouragement to fans who bring gloves: Make the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as in after the Safeco Field EMT's administered gauze
bandage and a check of my two front teeth that sent dentistry back
to the days of the Crusade, the guy in the row ahead of me
apologized. He said the ball grazed the top of his mitt before
bouncing off my bicuspid. And he kept the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger is better?
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a wrong turn in this place, you could be lost for a
week,'' Jay Buhner said on his first official day in the new
Mariner clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
</P>
<P>
   A few people have commented that with the amount of advertising
adorning the edifices as Safeco, they should have named the park
Logos-R-Us.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from Oberto beef jerky to Budweiser, Pizza Hut to Les
Schwab tires. Heck, even the big guns here at your morning P-I
opened their wallets to slap a handsome promotional poster near the
left field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of open space _ maybe still up for sale,
who knows. Luckily, there's that manual scoreboard to help us
pretend these are the days of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Beer Man?
</P>
<P>
   On Randy Johnson night, the sellout produced another squeeze
play on concessions and prompted some extreme measures amongst
refreshment seekers.
</P>
<P>
   In Section 143, a group of fans considered pooling cash in order
to induce the beer man to come back before the next millenium.
</P>
<P>
   Beach Ball Etiquette
</P>
<P>
   People, the point of beach ball volleyball is to keep the thing
in play. Don't go swatting giant beach balls onto the field as if
you're Karch Kiraly spiking for an Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   Simply punch the ball clockwise to the adjacent section, keeping
it away from the outstretched hands of the security guys and gals
whose job it is to kill the fun.
</P>
<P>
   The beach ball madness reached a peak during Tuesday's game. The
ball was setting a land speed record for its zippy rotation around
the 100 level until a couple of jokers insisted on knocking it onto
the field.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, when the ball fell into right field and Jay Buhner
shanked his punt attempt to clear it back to the stands, Griffey
did appear to be giggling.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether Buhner needed more acupuncture on his
strained hamstring after that ill-fated kick, but Buhner sure
showed his party-animal spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, Safeco made a party animal out of everyone
this past week. Not a bad way to start.

SONICS ADMIT INTEREST IN MITCH RICHMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the Sonics are getting ready to acquire Mitch
Richmond, Wally Walker would not admit as much. But the team
president acknowledged Wednesday he is interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, anybody would be,'' Walker said. ``I don't know what the
odds are of getting something done. I wouldn't want to handicap
that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who just returned from the Pre-Olympic Tournament of the
Americas in Puerto Rico, indicated that all deals and signings
involving the Sonics are difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is trying to keep scenarios alive,'' he said. ``Some
are realistic, some are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker intimated that the Richmond scenario is realistic. The
Detlef Schrempf scenario is iffy. Discussions have been held with
Schrempf and his agent about a contract.
</P>
<P>
   A source in the Sonics' organization said the team was not
overly optimistic about re-signing Schrempf, who is trolling for
offers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempf, 36, has indicated he would rather not return to the
Sonics unless they are willing to offer more than the $1 million
exception that teams have available under the salary cap for a
veteran free agent. Schrempf made more than $4 million in the final
year of his Sonic contract.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying for free agents has been under way since July 1. No
signings can be made until Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of more significance to the Sonics is a sign-and-trade deal for
Richmond, who has averaged 23 points through an 11-year career with
stops at Golden State, Sacramento and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 guard has played in six All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond wants to return to the West Coast, even entertaining
the thought of going back to Sacramento, where he once demanded a
trade from the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics would appear to have the ability to acquire Richmond
if a number of complicated variables fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics need to create salary-cap space to sign Richmond, who
as a free agent of 10 or more years can command up to $14 million a
year in his new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Richmond's age (34) and off-year last season (41
percent shooting), it is unlikely that any team, including
Washington, will offer the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics conceivably could clear up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of playing on the West Coast alongside Gary Payton
with a potential contender might be enough for Richmond to consider
relocating in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   To make cap room, Hersey Hawkins and his $4 million salary
likely would be traded, particularly because he plays the same
shooting guard position as Richmond. If Schrempf were to re-sign
with Seattle for more than the exception, he too could be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   If Richmond signs with the Wizards, the Sonics would not have to
find as much room under the cap. If Richmond were to sign a $10
million deal with Washington, the Sonics would be responsible for
only half that amount as applied to the cap.
</P>
<P>
   In a situation that works because of the salary math, the Sonics
could also trade Hawkins and Horace Grant to swing the deal with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Walker said Wednesday the Sonics are not apt to trade Grant,
who was acquired from Orlando on draft day in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We traded for Horace with the intention for him to be a
stalwart inside in Seattle,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond's agent, Mike Sharpe, said talks with the Wizards have
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like you're not making progress, then you have to
look at alternatives,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, Richmond said he wanted to return to
Washington, and general manager Wes Unseld and coach Gar Heard have
said they want him back. But the Wizards acquired shooting guard
Richard Hamilton in last month's draft, and the impasse in
negotiations has Sharpe feeling that Richmond will probably be
playing somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no planned negotiations with Wes,'' Sharpe said.
``Certainly, Wes and I have left the door open, but it would be
fair to say talks have stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about any interest the Sonics might have in another free
agent, Houston's Charles Barkley, Walker would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to put the best possible team out there,'' Walker
said. ``Any deal is a long way from getting done.''

MARTE SENT DOWN, FRANKLIN RETURNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Damaso Marte won't have to worry about that three-game
suspension any time soon. He might come to regret that.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after sliding down a clubhouse bannister and heading out
into the sunshine at Safeco Field Wednesday, the Mariners' rookie
reliever returned inside to find his name scratched from a hallway
lineup card. After five largely ineffective games in the big
leagues, Marte was optioned to Class AAA Tacoma, replaced on the
roster by Ryan Franklin, back for his second stint in Seattle this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Marte, 24, was in the process of appealing a three-game penalty
meted out by the American League for his part in a brawl at Dodger
Stadium July 11. Depending on his career progress, the lefty from
the Dominican Republic faces the unusual prospect of having the
possible suspension trail him throughout his baseball career and
resurface in a most inopportune moment: For instance, he might not
come back to the majors right away or he might return with another
organization.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think something like that has ever come up before,''
said Lee Pelekoudas, vice president of baseball administration.
``I'm assuming they would (penalize Marte eventually). He can pitch
in Tacoma right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marte, 0-1 with a 9.35 earned run average, heads to Tacoma after
taking the loss against Randy Johnson on Tuesday, giving up six
runs and 10 hits in four innings. He had entered a scoreless game
in relief of substitute starter Frankie Rodriguez, who had tired.
He left a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to work on a few things down there,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said of Marte. ``He needs to get more depth on
his slider and pitch away from left-handed hitters. His ball has
been coming back over the center of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, 26, was a starter in Tacoma but will be used in long
relief by the Mariners. The right-hander made three relief
appearances, including his big-league debut, with Seattle in May,
going 0-0 with a 6.35 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   This roster move likely won't be the last for the Mariners'
pitching staff. Without Marte, the club doesn't have a lefty in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   COMPLAINT DEPT.: The only loud bellowing heard from a player
regarding conditions at Safeco Field so far has come from former
Mariners pitcher Sterling Hitchcock. He didn't like the mound. And
he turned in seven shutout innings and got a victory throwing off
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably could have spent $250 and put a decent mound in
there,'' the San Diego lefty said last week. ``There was no stick
to it. Just a lot of slipping around.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Mariners pitchers quizzed about the hill Wednesday
swear by it. Jamie Moyer said it works fine for him. Frankie
Rodriguez said the only mound that compares is in Cleveland. Jose
Paniagua said the bullpen mound is too steep, but the regular one
is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Taking this complaint to the top, Safeco Field groundskeeper
Steve Peeler was stopped during pregame activities Wednesday. He
said any new mound might have a little too much give to it,
something that improves with use. He also had a response for
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he starts wearing a Mariner uniform, I don't care,''
Peeler said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE DRILL: A small fire was started in a club-level concession
stand, creating a little pregame excitement just after 4 p.m. An
employee inadvertently left a plastic bag filled with popcorn on a
grill, then turned on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinklers quickly doused the blaze, but stadium-wide alarms and
flickering lights stayed on for 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, eight emergency vehicles also showed up on the scene,
including two hook and ladder trucks, before it was determined the
new ballpark was not in serious danger.
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERY ROOM: Disabled list pitchers Eric Weaver and Rafael
Carmona threw simulated three-inning games from the Safeco mound
Wednesday and both were cleared to join Tacoma on rehabilitation
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Both right-handers, Weaver had surgery in May to remove a bone
spur, Carmona has missed a month with a tricep strain.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver will start in Calgary on Saturday and throw two innings
or 30 pitches, and gradually build up arm strength. Carmona will
have the option to start in a similar fashion or relieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't knock anybody over, but I was thrilled to get out
there and be engaged in competition again,'' said Weaver, who had
either Raul Ibanez or Ozzie Timmons stand in against him at the
plate. ``It's kind of like spring training again.''
</P>
<P>
   AND FINALLY: After Tuesday night's game, the official scorer
changed a walk originally credited to Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson
to reflect that the batter, Ken Griffey Jr., was hit by a 3-1
pitch.

FASSERO YIEDS TWO MORE HOMERS IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   fixing byline  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A day after the Randy Johnson welcome-home party,
Safeco Field played host to the Jeff Fassero farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, it was goodbye home runs No. 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
   And so long, Jeff, after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Oakland A's, the Mariners' Fassero was treated to a
familiar yet unpleasant sight _ balls hit high and hard, screaming
out of the ballpark, with the shaken pitcher's exit not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez touched the lefty for a three-run homer in the
second and John Jaha followed with a two-run blast an inning later,
the ignition points for a 13-3 Oakland victory before a crowd of
42,223.
</P>
<P>
   That kept Fassero on a record-setting pace for homers served up
by a pitcher in a season, not to mention in grave danger of losing
his spot with the Mariners before the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero stands just five homers shy of catching Ferguson Jenkins
(35 in 1973) for fourth on the pitchers' long ball list, 20 away
from tying Bert Blyleven (50 in 1986) for the worst pounding ever.
</P>
<P>
   A big season would have meant a big contract extension. Only
Fassero's once unsullied reputation currently is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   His career has gone south because: 1) he doesn't have the
financial security he desires; 2) his arm hasn't bounced back from
offseason surgery; or 3) it's over.
</P>
<P>
   The shellshocked Mariners starter made it through the first
inning, retiring the A's on a flyout, a caught base-stealer after a
walk and a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Hernandez stroked a 2-0 pitch over a beer sign in
left and into the bullpen, scoring Olmedo Saenz and Matt Stairs,
who had reached on a hit batter and fielder's choice. For
Hernandez, it was just his third big-league homer, but second
against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Jaha jumped on a 2-2 delivery and smacked it 10
rows up in left, plating Jason Giambi, who had singled with two
outs. Jaha's homer was his 21st. He nearly had it his first time
up, driving one over Ken Griffey Jr.'s head and off the centerfield
wall for a 405-foot double.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (4-11) didn't come out for the fourth inning, drawing
his second-quickest hook of the season. He threw just 69 pitches,
again his second-lowest total. Just 37 were strikes, yet another
runner-up figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero didn't feel comfortable from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get behind every hitter, it's going to hurt you,'' he
said. ``I felt like I was just forcing it tonight. The first pitch
was bad location. When you start fighting yourself for control, the
location will be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He searched hard for some solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third inning, I relaxed a bit,'' Fassero said. ``Jaha
got a fastball in and hit it out. If I don't give that up, it might
have been a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing eight shutout innings at Anaheim on July 5,
Fassero had talked eagerly of getting a fresh start after the
All-Star break, of playing in a hitter's ballpark, that he was
back. But he bombed out at Dodger Stadium, getting lifted in the
fourth inning of an eventual 14-3 rout. Now he's 0-2 at Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero's earned run average is a bloated 7.04. His confidence
level is running on zero.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners must have known something. Earlier in the day, they
recalled Ryan Franklin from Class AAA Tacoma for long relief. He
was barely unpacked when the call came for him to replace Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and his mound successor, Ken Cloude, were hardly sharp.
Franklin went four innings, walking four, giving up a pair of runs
and barely escaping after loading the bases in the seventh. Cloude
served up six runs in two innings, including the first career grand
slam for Eric Chavez, who was an injury replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The A's mostly needed just one pitcher to get the job done,
control specialist Gil Heredia (7-5). Beating the Mariners, and
Fassero, for the second time this season, the right-hander went
eight innings, permitting RBI singles by David Bell and Raul Ibanez
and Tom Lampkin's fifth homer. Oakland's Chad Harville pitched the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella had little to say after his first
double-digit setback at Safeco. He had trouble differentiating any
of his pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's behind the hitters, that's for sure,'' Piniella said of
Fassero. ``Then Franklin got hit, Cloude got hit and our pitching
wasn't very good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field's first homestand comes to a close Thursday with a
3:35 p.m. contest. The Mariners will try to even their record at
4-4 in their new ballpark.

DODGERS' VALDES HANDED PAINFUL LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson stayed with the hot hand, even if it
was red, puffy and really sore.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers manager thought Ismael Valdes deserved to remain in
Wednesday night's game with the Colorado Rockies, even after he had
reinjured his pitching hand in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes has been the Dodgers' best pitcher the past month and
with a doubleheader today, Johnson was hoping he could finish what
he started. But two innings later, Valdes gave up a game-winning
home run to Kurt Abbott in a 5-4 loss in front of 34,721 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pitching well and he told me he was OK,'' said Johnson,
whose team came in with eight wins in the last 10 games. ``That was
a good-hitting team he faced and he was doing fine. I felt good
leaving him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott hit a good pitch, a 3-2 breaking ball down in the strike
zone. No one faulted the location, but the question was whether
Valdes should have been in the game after he fell on the hand
trying to avoid a high and tight pitch from Rockies starter Pedro
Astacio (10-8).
</P>
<P>
   It was the same hand he hurt last Friday when he took a
fifth-inning line drive off the bat of the Angels' Matt Walbeck. He
left the next inning but said the hand felt fine before Wednesday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes wasn't sharp, ending a three-game winning streak by
allowing five runs for the first time this season. In his previous
three starts, he had given up just two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in because with the doubleheader we needed
the innings,'' Valdes said. ``I wanted to keep us in the game. The
bullpen needed the day off.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubleheader will be interesting for several reasons. The
Dodgers, who remain a game ahead of the last-place Rockies in the
NL West, have never played a day-night doubleheader where they will
empty the stadium after the first game and let in a new crowd for
the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   They also are hoping they can play Todd Hundley in the first
game, then let him start his three-game suspension for his part in
the July 11 fight with Seattle. The Arizona Diamondbacks, the
Dodgers' next opponent, are using three left-handed starters in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed 12 hits in eight innings, making 113 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers appeared ready to keep him in the game, getting
two-run homers by Todd Hollandsworth and Raul Mondesi to lead 4-3
heading into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mondesi's homer in the third, the Dodgers went cold.
Astacio (10-8), who beat the Dodgers 5-2 on July 6, allowed just
three hits over the final five innings. Right-hander Dave Veras
took over for Astacio and pitched a perfect ninth for his 16th
save.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes left his last start, a 3-1 victory last Friday against
the Angels, after taking a line drive off his left palm. The
swelling subsided between starts, but it was not his best day
against the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   They scored twice in the first inning, the same number of runs
he allowed in his previous three starts (19 innings). With one out,
Darryl Hamilton walked and Larry Walker, who entered the game
second in the NL in batting, reached on an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette followed with a two-run double to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got both runs back in the bottom of the inning when
Mark Grudzielanek singled with one out and Hollandsworth crushed a
two-run fastball into the empty right-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, making his 14th start in the last 24 games and
fourth at first base, has responded to the additional playing time.
On the recent road trip, Hollandsworth batted .381 (8 for 21) with
two homers.
</P>
<P>
   For Mondesi, it was his 22nd homer. It also was his third in
five games after not hitting a home run in 112 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was out and that felt really good,'' Mondesi
said. ``I feel like I've come all the way back.''

 CLINTON SAYS HE'LL CAMPAIGN HARD FOR WIFE, GORE  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's pre-eminent politician declared
himself out of the political-advice business Wednesday, and then
promptly plugged the candidacies of Vice President Al Gore and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a free-wheeling 70-minute news conference,
said it was not his role to manage the campaign of either his wife
or his vice president, and insisted that he had no intention of
yielding the spotlight in the final 18 months of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel myself winding down, I feel myself keying up. I
want to do more. I want to try to make sure that I give the
American people as much as I can every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed for his insight into the 2000 campaign, Clinton said,
``My job is not to handicap this horse race, not to comment on it,
not to comment on the candidates. My job is to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with such disclaimers out of the way, he promised to do
whatever he could to help Gore win the White House and his wife
capture a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Texas Gov. George W. Bush by name, Clinton
appeared to take aim at the front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination by pressing candidates to be specific on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing is that all the candidates
make their positions clear on the great debates going on now, and
make their positions clear on what they would do if they got the
job,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every candidate should tell us ... are you for the Patients'
Bill of Rights?'' Are you for closing the gun-show loophole? Are
you for raising the minimum wage? Are you for the House Republican
tax plan or do you favor our plan on saving Social security,
Medicare and making America debt-free?'' Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
   The East Room news conference was Clinton's second in two
months, part of a White House plan to meet with the press more
frequently. After going for more than a year without a single solo
press conference during the Monica Lewinsky investigation, the
White House hopes to hold such sessions at least every six to eight
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing completely at ease with a press corps that he once
berated for focusing too much on scandal, Clinton joked with
reporters and took questions well after his press secretary tried
to end the session.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the news conference on a light note, hardly flinching
when veteran White House correspondent Sarah McClendon broke
decorum and shouted in her raspy voice that the television lights
were so bright it was hard to see the podium. Clinton simply
smiled, then said, ``I've been waiting a long time for the halo to
appear.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments on the 2000 election, Clinton said he was not
singling out Bush, and declined to elaborate on an offhand comment
made last week when he poked fun at Bush's description of himself
as a compassionate conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic Leadership Council in Baltimore,
Clinton said he defines a compassionate conservative as someone who
is too conservative to vote for popular measures like gun control
and patients rights, but is compassionate enough to feel bad about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just having a little fun,'' Clinton said Wednesday with
a laugh. ``You know it's a long time (until the election). If we
don't have any laughs, its going to be a very tedious struggle
between now and November of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attributed his own success in 1992 to being specific on
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is that there are a lot of things that count in a
presidential election and toward a successful presidency. ... But
what really matters is where you stand on the big issues that
everybody knows about that are going on right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke with zeal about his remaining days in office,
saying he loves being president, ``even on the bad days.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might ever run for office again, Clinton
hesitated only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his wife's candidacy in New York, Clinton said her
election would be ``a great thing for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowering his voice and pausing frequently to collect his
thoughts, Clinton said he would do whatever he could to help her
win election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only because of what I owe her, but because ... what she
knows and how she's lived and what she's done, ... it's very
unusual to find somebody like that, who has that much knowledge and
background and passion all packed into one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton displayed his trademark linguistic dexterity when he was
asked whether there isn't a contradiction between his strong
support for the vice president and his constant refrain for change.
</P>
<P>
   The president responded that a vote to continue the work of the
current administration was in fact a vote for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the American people have to decide is what kind of change
do they want,'' Clinton said. ``Do they want to build on what has
worked for the last 61/2 years, or do they want to abandon it and
go back to what failed them for 12 years before?''

 SOME COLORFUL LANGUAGE FROM GOVERNOR GRAY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chickenpoop. The nonedited version of that colloquialism is
Governor Trashtalk's analysis of a Chronicle article in which
critics say California Governor Gray Davis sells his influence, or
creates that impression.
</P>
<P>
   If only the newspapers and state legislators would go away, so
his royal Grayness could carry out his holy mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, rewriting basic civics, said of the state legislators:
``Their job is to implement my vision.'' And fetch his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Founding Fathers' fetish for government checks
and balances? Check and balance  &UR; this,  &LR; says King Guv.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said it's ``cheap poop'' to say his influence is being
bought by big contributors, just because he spends a lot of quality
time with them.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I found under ``coincidence'' in the Rube's
Dictionary: ``Example: Gray Davis showing up at an intimate
fund-raiser given by health insurance big shots, listening
attentively, pocketing their donation and three days later taking
behind-the-scenes action to further their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis refers to a $125,000 contribution from HMOs as ``chump
change.'' I looked up ``chump change'' in the Hipster Handbook: ``A
large donation intended to change the mind of a chump.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough; I hear the distant swoosh of a guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   A FAMOUS OLD hotel in San Francisco's South of Market District
hosted two wedding receptions simultaneously Saturday. Some fellows
from Reception A strolled over to Reception B and began dancing
with some of the girls there.
</P>
<P>
   The Reception A fellows were asked to leave Reception B. A brawl
ensued, with cops and ambulances rushing to the scene. And all
because the lass is always keener on the other side of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW, '99 model Bay Bridge East Span is a beauty, with white
concrete and a light bar running its length.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the bridge design people are going to come out with
a new model every year or so, until the bridge actually gets built.
</P>
<P>
   The new optional extras will cost about $50 million, but the
bridge salesman will throw in free undercoating.
</P>
<P>
   Or, instead of $50 mil for the light bar and spiffy concrete, we
can save $49,999,950 by going to Pep Boys and buying a very, very
large pair of fuzzy dice to hang from the new tower.
</P>
<P>
   PICKY FOLKS, those travel-movie buffs. The Golden Gate
Geographic Society presents major travel films in the Bay Area.
Bettine and Ken Armstrong head the society and send out
ticket-request forms, with a blank for ``seat preference.'' Some of
the requests:
</P>
<P>
   ``The first row of the balcony or closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A seat facing the front.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we sit near the men's room because my husband wears a
hearing aid.''
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS A QUIET morning. So quiet your could hear your socks
droop. Mike Spencer propped his feet on his desk and poured himself
a stiff root beer. The phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   There's your cheap detective novel lead-in to this item: Mike
Spencer, Oakland PI, got a call from an Alameda woman. She wanted
him to obtain (i.e., steal) for her the answers to the math portion
of the CBEST (California Basic Educational Skills Test, the
teacher-qualification exam), so she can become credentialed to
teach our children.
</P>
<P>
   Mike suggested to the woman that she is scum. He suggested that
she try studying. He suggested she consider a career in politics.
Mike is a suggestive guy.
</P>
<P>
   The woman phoned again later, leaving a message laced with many
very nasty words, so Mike figures she might also need the answers
to the CBEST vocabulary section.
</P>
<P>
   MEANWHILE, animals apparently are getting smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Guthertz was in Point Arena and reports that on the side
of a brick building in the heart of town were several boldly
lettered signs: ``NO BARKING.''
</P>
<P>
   And clean up after your master.

   BIRD UPDATE: Following a recent major scoop reported here that a
mockingbird in Los Banos has learned to imitate the sound of a
cell-phone ring, several readers report hearing birds that imitate
car alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Housley of Arnold claims that a talented bird in his 'hood
can impersonate all four stages of an activated car alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Annoying, sure. On the plus side, wild bird thefts are down.

RETURNING NOT IN STARS FOR VERBEEK, LUDWIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veterans Pat Verbeek and Craig Ludwig are not in the Stars'
plans for next season and have been told to seek offers from other
teams, general manager Bob Gainey said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of two of the team's more important role players
brings to seven the number of players who will not return to the
defending Stanley Cup champions. In addition to Ludwig and Verbeek,
who both are unrestricted free agents, the Stars have:
</P>
<P>
   told free agents Dave Reid, Tony Hrkac and Brent Severyn to seek
offers elsewhere;
</P>
<P>
   traded goalie Roman Turek to the St. Louis Blues;
</P>
<P>
   accepted the retirement of Doug Lidster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, it would be nice to keep everyone
together, but things move forward,'' Gainey said. ``We have younger
players who are ready to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars last week traded for 26-year-old defenseman Jamie
Pushor to take the place of Ludwig, 38, and late last season
discovered a fourth-line right winger in Blake Sloan, 24. Verbeek,
who two seasons ago scored 31 goals while playing beside Joe
Nieuwendyk, was bumped off the second line by Jamie Langenbrunner
and was too expensive to keep on the third or fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek made $3.2 million last season. Sloan will make $350,000
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain moves that need to be made,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek is speaking with several teams, including the New York
Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers and expansion
Atlanta Thrashers. One of the NHL's top active scorers with 478
goals and 965 points, Verbeek was held to 17 goals and a career-low
34 points last season while getting below-average ice time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he and Hitch \RStars coach Ken Hitchcock\S
agreed on how he should be used,'' Verbeek's father, Gerard, told
the ``London \ROnt.\S Free Press''. ``He really enjoyed playing
with Jamie Langenbrunner and Joe Nieuwendyk, but he didn't get to
play with them in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner was moved from left wing to right wing, forcing
Verbeek to the third and fourth lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig said he is talking with three or four teams after winning
the second Stanley Cup of his career. Though 38, he played in 160
of the past 164 Stars' regular-season games and all 40 of their
playoff games over the past two seasons. Ludwig played eight
seasons with the Stars, was an alternate captain and one of
Hitchcock's most vocal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of had an idea it would end up this way, but I would
have liked to stay,'' Ludwig said from his summer home in
Wisconsin. ``I love it down there, and I loved being a part of what
we built from scratch. It was a great ride, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Pushor and Sloan, the Stars also have signed
26-year-old winger Juha Lind and 27-year-old center Pavel Patera to
contracts for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are in negotiations with center Guy Carbonneau and
winger Benoit Hogue, their only two remaining unrestricted free
agents. Restricted free agents include: Richard Matvichuk, Manny
Fernandez, Grant Marshall, Pushor, Derek Plante, Jamie Wright,
Aaron Gavey and Warren Luhning.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, Pushor and Plante have filed for arbitration and their
cases are scheduled to be heard in August.

MYSTERY AND MYSTIQUE PART OF THE HALL'S AURA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll find his shoes, but you won't find Shoeless Joe Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the bat used to break his single-season home-run
record, but you won't see Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find his baseball, but you won't be sure it was stitched
by Abner Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown,
N.Y., a tiny village three hours north of Yankee Stadium, the
mystique of America's pastime is equaled only by its mystery.
</P>
<P>
   When former Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan and six others are
inducted into the Hall Sunday, they will join an exclusive club
whose members are wrapped in nostalgia and whose origin remains
shrouded in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball goes back so far that a lot of its history is
sketchy,'' said Hall of Fame director of information John Ralph.
``We don't know a lot more than what the people believed at the
time. But that's part of the attraction, letting the imagination
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Pestered by questions about the origin of baseball as far back
as 1905, sports pioneer Albert G. Spalding and famed writer Henry
Chadwick helped form an investigative commission. That group, led
by former National League president A.G. Mills, conducted a
three-year study centering on one place _ Cooperstown, N.Y. _ and
one man _ Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the proceedings was testimony from long-time Doubleday
associate Abner Graves, who presented evidence that it was
Doubleday who indeed became bored with a game known as ``Town
Ball,'' in which 20-50 boys would try to catch balls hit by a
``Tosser'' with a four-inch flat wooden bat. In a barren pasture
now home to Doubleday Field _ where the Rangers will play the
Royals in an exhibition Monday _ Doubleday supposedly added the
four bases and nine positions that have defined baseball for 100
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 30, 1907, the commission concluded that ``the concept of
baseball was devised'' by Doubleday on a field in Cooperstown
around 1839.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperstown is more like the symbolic home,'' said Ralph. ``It
may be more folklore than fact, but there's no more appropriate
place on earth. There have been several uprisings to move to New
York City, but making the pilgrimage here seems more justifiable
than just making us another stop on a sight-seeing tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Doubleday theory point to the fact that military
records indicate he was not in New York during that time period,
that Graves' documentation mysteriously was destroyed in a fire in
1916 and that Doubleday's personal diaries never mention the word
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one has disproved Doubleday yet,'' Ralph said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years after the ruling, philanthropist and Singer
Sewing Machine Co. co-founder Stephen C. Clark found a baseball in
an attic trunk in nearby Fly Creek. The trunk belonged to Graves
and the ball _ the hand-stitched laces unraveled to reveal a cloth
center _ to Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first piece in the baseball museum and probably
still the most coveted,'' said Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to display his $5 purchase, Clark unknowingly created
the museum. As the demand increased for such artifacts, the Hall of
Fame was formally christened in 1935 and in January of '36 the
first class enshrined: Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Walter
Johnson and Christy Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall has undergone three major renovations and in '94 added
an $8 million library of video and audio archives. Today, it is
home to 244 members, an annual attendance of over 400,000, an
admission fee of only $9.50 and 165,000 artifacts including Rangers
memorabilia such as Ryan's cap from his 5,000th strikeout, Kenny
Rogers' shoes from his perfect game in '94, Juan Gonzalez' cap from
his 1,000th run batted in and even a Mike Hargrove bat from his
American League rookie-of-the-year season in '74.
</P>
<P>
   The only things missing _ due to the lifetime suspensions
stemming from gambling scandals almost a century apart _ are
Jackson and all-time hits leader Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But both are very well represented,'' said Ralph, noting that
Rose donated the bat he used to break Cobb's all-time hits record.
``There are eligibility issues beyond our control, but it's not
like they are being blackballed from the Hall of Fame.''

LETT APPLIES TO NFL SEEKING REINSTATEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett has applied
to the NFL for reinstatement, and the team expects a decision from
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has been serving an ``indefinite suspension'' for a
violation of the after-care program of the NFL's substance-abuse
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue will determine how many games, if any, Lett will miss
in 1999. The possibility remains that Lett could miss all or part
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter went out to \RLett\S or the Cowboys, or both, asking
if they had anything new on the matter to add,'' NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones acknowledged receiving the letter _
addressed to Lett _ but declined to say how it was handled in
compliance with the confidential nature of the NFL's
substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anticipating, it's fair to say, some kind of decision made
by the commissioner this week,'' Jones said. ``\RBut\S I'm totally
in the dark _ totally _ as to what \RTagliabue\S may or may not
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been quietly confident that the suspension will
not keep Lett out a major part of the season. They have not made
any player moves to fill his position.
</P>
<P>
   The current suspension marks the third since November 1995 for
Lett, 30. He served a four-game suspension at the end of the 1995
season, followed by a one-year suspension beginning in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a player serves a minimum of one year \Rof a
suspension\S, the next time it becomes an ``indefinite suspension''
and is handled by the commissioner on a case-by-case basis,''
Aiello said. ``The league office and the Cowboys have stayed in
touch. The letter that went out \Rlast week\S to let the Cowboys
know that the commissioner would make a determination soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are aware of the precedent set by former Cowboys
defensive back Clayton Holmes, whose indefinite suspension ended up
costing him four games with the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello indicated a decision most likely will be made before the
start of training camp, which begins Monday in Wichita Falls for
Cowboys rookies and selected veterans.
</P>
<P>
   As to the outcome, Jones wouldn't speculate, adding, ``I
wouldn't want to influence \Rthe decision\S one way or another.''

FORCE DECLARES HIS NEUTRALITY IN THE MEYER-SMITH FEUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest name in professional drag racing has pledged
allegiance to his bottom line in the impending one-on-one between
Billy Meyer and Bruton Smith for control of the sport in North
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if eight-time Funny Car champion John Force's
stance is copied by many of the National Hot Rod Association's top
professional drivers as they survey the latest Meyer-Smith
power-play.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this one, I walk the fence,'' Force said yesterday
afternoon. Approximately 24 hours earlier, Force had attended a
news conference in Las Vegas where the NHRA awarded a national
event to a swank, new $10 million drag strip under construction at
Smith's Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as an aside, Smith, the chairman of Speedway Motorsports
Inc., informed Texas Motor Speedway general manager Eddie Gossage
that it was OK to announce plans to build a similar facility at TMS
in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the second time that Smith and Meyer have squared off
in a motorsports construction race. Smith, a North Carolinian with
extensive ties to NASCAR and its Winston Cup Series, was a runaway
winner over Meyer in late 1994 and early 1995, after both presented
projects for a superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the loyalty factor lies with Meyer, the Waco
businessman who has owned and operated the Texas Motorplex in Ennis
since 1986. But partly in response to the creature comforts
introduced by Smith at TMS, Meyer has spent nearly two years
attempting to relocate and reinvent the Motorplex in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   His friends at the NHRA, including president Dallas Gardner,
insist they will remain loyal to Meyer. That Meyer has a contract
with the NHRA giving him exclusivity over national events within a
150-mile radius of the Motorplex through 2007 or 2008 is a huge
plus in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   As a team owner who regularly deals with sponsors and corporate
America, Force understands the sanctity of contracts. Force also
has been one of the most vocal supporters of the all-concrete
Motorplex as built by Meyer, himself a former Funny Car driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what he did \Rat Ennis\S, and Billy's said he's going
to build another track in Dallas \RGrand Prairie\S,'' said Force,
who is bearing down on a record ninth championship in the Castrol
GTX Ford Mustang. ``I'm 100 percent in support of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was at the press conference in Las Vegas in support of
Bruton Smith. Now, everybody thinks Bruton Smith is my dad. He's in
Vegas, and all I did was verify that if this man says he'll have a
track built and operating in April, he'll do it. He's trying to
help us improve the sport. I'm in support of what he'll bring to
the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an allegiance to anything that makes the sport bigger.
Could it \Rthe North Texas market\S support two tracks? Could it
support two races or four races? It's not my business.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, whose two-car team is based in Southern California, is
vitally interested in the outcome of this debate for another
reason. Force reiterated yesterday that he is planning to build a
satellite race shop in either Dallas-Fort Worth or Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Force already has scouted real estate in proximity to Meyer's
planned facility in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is my No. 1 choice because I love Texas,'' Force said.
``If Billy gets in there closer to downtown so you could test and
get in and out, I'll go there. If Billy doesn't do it and Bruton
does, I'll go there. If none of it happens, I'm going to Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm building for the future. Because I'm no Bruton Smith. I'm
just a little guy trying to invest his money.''
SPOTLIGHT ON... `Not-So-Awesome Bill' definitely is rebuilding
What do Bill Elliott and Ricky Rudd have in common?
</P>
<P>
   They are both single-car NASCAR Winston Cup owner/drivers who
won't be drinking a beer with Cal Wells III anytime this summer.
Maybe never.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and Rudd recently have lost their primary sponsors to
Wells, an invader from the off-road and Championship Auto Racing
Teams FedEx ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Rudd _ who ripped Wells' tactics after losing his
Tide sponsorship at Daytona Beach, Fla., earlier this month _
Elliott has taken a less cantankerous attitude. It probably helps
that Elliott will retain backing from McDonald's through the 2000
Winston Cup season for his No. 94 Ford Taurus, whereas Rudd will
lose his sponsorship at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to take a lot of different punches through this
deal,'' said Elliott, who is 15th in Cup points heading into the
Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway on Sunday. ``If that's where
McDonald's wants to go, that's perfectly fine with me. I've not
performed well on the racetrack. We've still got a year and a half
to go \Rwith McDonald's\S and we've got several people looking at
us. A fine finish like we had at New Hampshire doesn't hurt. I
don't see a problem getting a good deal down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elliott, 43, finished fifth at New Hampshire International
Speedway on July 11, it was his best result since a fifth-place run
at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway on Sept. 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Elliott's next victory will be his first as an
owner/driver. ``Awesome Bill'' last visited Victory Lane at
Darlington, S.C., on Sept. 4, 1994, when he drove for the legendary
Junior Johnson. That is a span of 144 consecutive races without a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his lack of recent top-fives, Elliott has remained a fan
favorite. He has, of course, won an unprecedented 13 Winston Cup
Most Popular Driver Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win races. I've been programmed to win races from
the past,'' said Elliott, who has 40 career victories. ``I
understand what we're fighting against. It makes it a lot easier to
step in there and say we're not winning because of these reasons.
We're trying to do it our way and get where we need to be. Every
year it's a building block. That's what this business is all
about.''
\Nsubheds:INSIDE THE NUMBERS Running a bit lean Bill Elliott, the
1988 NASCAR Winston Cup champion and 13-time most popular driver,
has struggled to put up the numbers since becoming an owner/driver
in 1995: Year Races Poles Wins Top-fives Top-10s DNFs 1995 31 2 0 4

</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:QUICK HITS Follow the leader(s) With the return of the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series to Michigan Speedway
for the U.S. 500 this weekend, it's time to get reacquainted with
the Handford Device.
</P>
<P>
   The aerodynamic flap on the rear wing of CART cars was
introduced before last year's U.S. 500 to help reduce speeds. An
offshoot, however, was creation of a NASCAR-like draft that allowed
the open-wheel CART cars to rack up an astonishing 62 lead changes.
That smashed the former record of 27 lead changes established at
the 2-mile Michigan track in 1982 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Handford Device probably is a bigger benefit to the fans
than the drivers,'' said Michael Andretti, driver of the No. 6
Kmart/Texaco-Havoline Ford/Swift. ``It does slow the cars down.
Basically, it bunches up the cars. It makes for a hairy race for
the drivers and a great race for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if everybody could drive 240 mph for 500 miles, racing
wouldn't be as popular as it is.'' \Nsubheds:Force eyes Top Fuel
John Force says the rumors about his eventual move from Funny Car
to Top Fuel are true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will drive a Top Fuel car in the future,'' said Force, the
eight-time and reigning National Hot Rod Association Funny Car
champion. ``I may get in a dragster for a year or two, and then
come back to Funny Car. I'm going to stay five years in the sport,
maybe more. Bottom line is I will be in a dragster.''
</P>
<P>
   Force, who owns the Funny Cars driven by himself and teammate
Tony Pedregon, said he ultimately would like to add two Top Fuel
dragsters to his stable. One of the Top Fuel cars, Force said, most
likely will be driven by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it \Rthe program\S to be up-and-running before I get in
it ... and be able to go after a championship,'' said Force, who
turned 50 in May. ``That's the plan.'' \Nsubheds:Starr lands
sponsor The Sonntag Racing Team of Little Elm and rookie driver
David Starr have landed apparel marketer Nitro Fish Ultimate Gear
as their primary sponsor in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, of Arlington, plans to debut the sponsor's radical
prehistoric fish logo beginning with the Michigan 200 at Michigan

TONY STEWART NOT YOUR AVERAGE ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Stewart spent the early part of this week at his favorite
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   He and Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Bobby Labonte tested at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway to prepare for the Brickyard 400, which
is scheduled for Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is from Indiana, and grew up fantasizing of winning a
race at the storied racetrack. To earn his first NASCAR Winston Cup
victory at the famous brickyard would be like, well, a dream come
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can win in front of the hometown crowd it would be
great,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   It would be about as great, in fact, as winning at Pocono
Raceway in the Pennsylvania 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to make any racetrack my first win,'' Stewart said.
``Everybody asks \Rabout Indy\S like you've got a choice in it, or
like I'd say, no, I don't want to win this week because I really
want to win next week. Brother, if I can win a race, I'm going to
win a race. I don't care where it's at. I'd take it this week if I
could get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookies are not supposed to talk about winning, at
Indianapolis or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They are supposed to make a brief splash early in the season,
when the experts handicap the rookie race, then fade into the
background for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The average rookie considers himself fortunate just to make a
race, then rides around at the tail of the field, staying out of
the way of the big boys and gaining experience for future seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, though, isn't the average rookie. The brash 28-year-old
is drawing favorable comparisons to successful first-year drivers
like Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can drive anywhere, on any surface,'' said Hall of Fame
driver and commentator Buck Baker. ``It doesn't matter if it's
dirt, pavement, a road course, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Indy Racing League champion made an immediate impact by
qualifying second for the season-opening Daytona 500, his first
Winston Cup race, and has spent the rest of the season to this
point proving it wasn't a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart put the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac in the top five four
times in the first 18 races, and in the top 10 10 times. He is
sixth in the points standings, and is likely to become the first
rookie to finish in the top 10 since Jody Ridley in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any limit on Tony,'' Labonte said. ``He
has some things to learn, but the guy is a racer. He's going to be
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing he hasn't done is become the first rookie since
Allison in 1987 to win a race.
</P>
<P>
   It almost happened in the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire
International Speedway on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had a comfortable lead with the checkered flag almost in
sight, but the first-year team headed by crew chief Greg Zipadelli
made a rookie mistake. Stewart didn't come in for a splash of gas,
and ran out of fuel two laps from the end.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, a bitterly disappointed Stewart received some
rare bad publicity when he failed to meet with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get that close to a major goal and something happens
that's beyond your control, it's disappointing,'' he said. ``I wish
I hadn't run out of there. I was so consumed with emotion after the
race was over that I just didn't do the right thing. I've taken
some grief over this, and I deserve it. I know I have to deal with
the good days and the bad, and I just hope people will see the big
picture, that sometimes you do or say things in the heat of battle
that you wish you could take back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a mistake, but it was part of what makes Stewart a
special rookie. Not only does he have the talent and the equipment
to run up front, but he also has an intense desire to win.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he went back home to Indiana to run in a stock car
race the Wednesday before the Pepsi 400 at Daytona on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won a late model race Wednesday night at Terre Haute, and it
made me feel like I was a kid in a candy store,'' he said. ``I was
so excited. I hadn't won a race since last year. Winning is
winning. It doesn't matter to me where it is or what kind of car
it's in, the feeling is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart is no stranger to Victory Circle. He won the United
States Auto Club ``Triple Crown'' in 1995, which led to a ride in
the fledgling IRL.
</P>
<P>
   His success there prompted Gibbs to hire him to drive a Busch
Grand National car in 1998. He moved up when Gibbs decided to field
a two-car team this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are variables that are important all the way through
your life, being in the right place at the right time with the
right people and the right equipment,'' Stewart said. ``If you take
one of those variables out, you won't be as successful. It just
seemed that it always worked out that I was in the right place at
the right time. All you can do as driver is do the best you can
each week and wait for those opportunities to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's best is very good, and winning that first Winston Cup
race seems not so much a matter of ``if'' as ``when.''
</P>
<P>
   If it comes at the Brickyard, in front of his hometown crowd,
that would be fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes this week at Pocono, that would be even better.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Public broadcasting railroaded again
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Little Nell lashed to the railroad tracks in a silent
movie, public television lives a life of constant danger and narrow
escapes. The latest freight train sent rumbling toward the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting was fired up by a gaffe by
several PBS stations. Or was it a gaffe?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that since 1981, many public TV stations have
exchanged contributor lists with other nonprofit organizations,
mutual back-scratching that lets both parties build their potential
donor rolls. The swaps usually were handled by established list
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Given that only 15 percent of PBS's budget is picked up by
federal funds and that even that miser's mite is begrudged by many
in Congress, you'd think Capitol Hill would cheer the sight of PBS
hustling for non-tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial news accounts reported that PBS's four largest
stations had traded names with, gee whiz, the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a rational world, the issue would have been spiked by the
later intelligence that PBS stations also had swapped with Bob
Dole's presidential campaign and with such outfits as Conservative
Republican Superfile and Country Club Republicans. PBS wasn't
playing political favorites, so end of story, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. We're talking Washington, D.C., here, where the political
weather is always hot, with a 100 percent chance of thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, as a rule, suspect that public TV and radio are
liberal torpedoes aimed at the GOP, free enterprise and The
American Way, and Republican go-getters know perfectly well that
the second wave of a news story falls ashore weakly after the first
tidal slam.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans saw a chance to stomp public broadcasting and
before you could say ``station break,'' they had called committee
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This led to one of the most solemn Washington rituals, the
Craven Grovel. The Craven Grovel demands that the leadership of any
federally licensed or funded agency that has annoyed some trip-wire
number of representatives or senators must eat dirt in public until
the assembled members notice reporters are starting to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did corporation President Robert Coonrod agree that
swapping lists with political organizations had been
``inappropriate, embarrassing and downright stupid'' and promise
his stations would be rebuked and told never to err again.
</P>
<P>
   (Do these scenes strike anyone else as bad imitations of the
public confessions that Red Guard cadres wrung from cultural
offenders before the errant were ordered to re-education camps?)
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are still calling for PBS to be cut off, but
the Craven Grovel seems to have satisfied enough to get public TV
through the funding season.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of us are left, once again, to wonder why the
politicians who denounce trash-mouth commercial television loudest
are usually the same ones out to kill the lone broadcast source of
good drama, classical music and dance, excellent documentaries and
in-depth news. What have they got against Little Nell?

 &HT;    JETSONS VS. FLINTSTONES: IT WON'T BE FUNNY
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans generally assume that the next century
will bring us heaps of new high-tech tools, toys and gadgets. In
the Information Age, we'll be living the George Jetson lifestyle,
zooming around in our advanced vehicles and coming home to a host
of labor-saving devices.
</P>
<P>
   But millions, indeed billions, of people in other countries may
be living more like Fred Flintstone in the new century, using rocks
and other raw materials to pound out a bare existence.
</P>
<P>
   A recent United Nations report suggests that unless wealthy
nations do more to help poor ones catch up, the 21st century will
see the Earth split into two very different planets, one inhabited
by a minority enjoying new technologies, and another populated by
poverty-stricken, low-tech masses.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, technological advances have always allowed some
people to lead much better lives than others. When Egypt's Queen
Cleopatra was lounging by the Nile, many cavemen were still wearing
skins and chasing wild animals for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology gap has never been so wide as today. For
example, 200 years ago, a wealthy American could sip fine wine,
ride in an elegant carriage and wear well-tailored clothes. Still,
he was no better off than his poorest neighbor in many ways: Both a
rich man and a beggar got their light from a flame and their warmth
from logs on a fire. The wealthiest families had no more protection
against smallpox than the poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, wealthy people lead lives so technologically advanced as
to be unrecognizable to the world's poor. While people in the
poorest places still huddle around fires to cook, citizens of
developed countries use computers, cell phones, airplanes,
microwave ovens and countless other devices to make life easy. The
well-vaccinated American with access to antibiotics and clean
operating rooms has far less to fear than his counterpart in the
Third World.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Development Program's report on the ``haves'' and
``have-nots'' measured the breadth of the gap at the close of this
millennium. One statistic told the story: the world's 200 richest
people _ a group small enough to gather for dinner in a hotel
ballroom _ together have more money than the lowest 40 percent of
the world's population, or about 2.4 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Among nations, Canada, Norway and the United States are the
richest. The poorest 22 countries are all in Africa, but poverty
also abounds in Asia and Latin America. The report says technology
and wealth clearly are linked. For example, in the wealthy
principality of Monaco in 1996, there were 99 telephone lines for
every 100 people. In poverty-plagued Cambodia, there was one phone
line per 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Such contrasts will increase, because wealthy people can afford
to keep buying more advanced tools, while the poorest people still
can't get basic equipment for participation in the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the average American pays about one
month's wage for a personal computer; the average Bangladeshi would
need eight years of income to buy a computer. In addition to saving
that much money, the Bangladeshi would have to learn English to
take full advantage of the Internet, where 80 percent of the sites
are in English.
</P>
<P>
   To help poor countries pull themselves up in the new millennium,
the U.N. report floated the idea of having advanced countries
impose upon themselves a tax of one U.S. cent on every 100 lengthy
e-mails sent by an individual. The U.N. economists said such a tax
would have raised about $70 billion in 1996 to help pay for wiring
undeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. politicians and Internet users raced to attack the
tax, and U.N. officials backed off, saying the proposal didn't
necessarily reflect the agency's position.
</P>
<P>
   But while the e-mail tax was sent straight to the dead letter
office, no other serious plans for narrowing the technology gap are
circulating. So as the George Jetsons of the world prepare to zip
around faster and higher, the Stone Age families are slipping
further behind. Whether two such different worlds can share the
same planet will be one of the great questions for the next
century.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: CAN BUSH WEAR THE KENNEDY MANTLE?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Did relentless press coverage arouse the remarkable
wave of interest in the accidental death at an early age of John F.
Kennedy Jr.? Or were the guardians of the media gates bowing to the
popular will by simulating on a summer weekend the national
catharsis that followed his father's assassination on a warm
November day in Dallas 36 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The young Kennedy's modest bearing and populist manners belied
an elaborate web of personal alliances that he had forged with key
people in the journalism and publishing worlds, an approach toward
the media elite that he shared in adulthood with his late mother,
Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, and with the father whose
famous name he bore.
</P>
<P>
   These multiple media relationships served to inspire a
sympathetic and often incisive look back at a life which peaked on
the celebrity scale on JFK Jr.'s third birthday, the same day he
famously saluted his father's casket.
</P>
<P>
   There's no national holiday to remember the father. All the
same, the first JFK, since his death at 46, has been ranked in
popular surveys as one of our greatest presidents, perhaps because
he was the last of our national leaders to make people feel good
about public service.
</P>
<P>
   Four presidents later, Ronald Reagan, the oldest man ever to be
elected to the office, would privately voice his admiration for the
youngest man to win that position. To be sure, Reagan also would go
out of his way to trash public servants, on whose shoulders he laid
many of the nation's ills. All the same, entering the White House
after a bad patch, Reagan made many Americans feel good about their
country. That's why both Presidents Kennedy and Reagan are likely
to continue to confound carping revisionist historians.
</P>
<P>
   Is there someone out there now _ in the wake of Bill Clinton's
failed bid at the JFK mantle _ whose deprecatory style on the
presidential stump reminds people of a Kennedy (take your pick) or
Reagan? Someone whose idea of a good time is to ask his pal, the
cigar-smoking mystery writer and country folk singer Kinky (''They
Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore'') Friedman to join him at
University of Texas Longhorn basketball games in Austin?
</P>
<P>
   In mixing it up with the likes of Friedman (the author of ``The
Love Song of J. Edgar Hoover,'' a saga recently translated into
Hebrew and Japanese) Bush the Younger evokes the kind of relaxed
style that Kennedy the Younger often showcased in George, the
magazine he founded to celebrate both politics as such and
particular politics of celebrityhood.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. John McCain of Arizona seeks the presidency through
restoring tattered public confidence in the campaign finance
process, George W. Bush would get to the same place by being a nice
guy: a self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' who wants you to
know he's on your side.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 campaign promises to revolve around twin axis:
Clinton's relative public policy successes in the White House and
the Republicans' relative inability to hold him to account for his
personal failings. It is an election that the young Kennedy would
undoubtedly have savored.

fashion icon _ the only real successor to her mother-in-law,
Jacqueline Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities offer little hope that Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her husband, John F. Kennedy Jr., and sister Lauren Bessette
survived the crash of their small private plane off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The news media's focus has largely been on John's fate. But in
the eyes of the fashion world, it is Carolyn who was the undisputed
star, a fact John himself admitted with easy humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me use the same phrase that my father did when he went to
Paris with my mother 35 years ago,'' he told guests at an Italian
industry fashion dinner in 1997. ``My name is John Kennedy, and I
am the man who is accompanying Carolyn Bessette to Milan. I am
honored to tell you she is my wife.''

   1. WEALTH OF BARGAINS : THE HUGE SUCCESS OF EUROPE'S
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE AUCTION HOUSE Six young German entrepreneurs, none of
them over 30, were casting about only months ago for a business
idea. Then they stumbled on eBay, the incredibly profitable online
auction house, and decided to found a German version. In one of
those astonishing Internet success stories, they have already been
taken over by eBay, in a deal that made them all millionaires. The
phenomen of Internet auctions, meanwhile, is growing so rapidly
that many experts say it will bring an end to fixed prices and that
we will head toward a future much like our past, where bargaining
and haggling were the norm, not the exception. From Der Spiegel.
700 words. (English translation available.)
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
DRONES OVER THE CITY, FOR SURVEILLANCE AND PUNISHMENT Is Big
Brother already here in the shape of the Drone? These unmanned,
remote-controlled little planes made their mark during the war in
Kosovo, discreetly monitoring details of the terrain, identifying
any activity and bringing back observations to controllers on the
ground. Now Drones may be used in a Big Brother role to curb the
risks of urban guerilla warfare. Flown by security forces, they can
monitor the activities of extremist groups, find arms and drug
caches, spot snipers, identify no-go areas and follow
demonstrators' movements. By Jacques Isnard. From Le Monde. 400
words. (English translation available.)
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
ERNEST HEMINGWAY IN CUBA How did Papa's writing turn so bad so
fast? According to newly declassified CIA and FBI documents, the
answer might lie with his misadventures in Cuba. By D.T. Max. From
The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,200 words) + edited
article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
THE ART CON OF THE CENTURY A forger's chief motivation is typically
intellectual gamesmanship. Embittered by the spurning of his own
work, he takes satisfaction in fooling the entire art world, then
pulling aside the curtain, exposing himself as a renegade genius
and the art experts as the frauds and fools. In what is probably
the biggest art con of the 20th century, the experts may never know
how much damage was done. By Peter Landesman. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (7,800 words) + edited article
available. (N/A U.K.) 5. BEEF VS. TRUFFLES IS NOT THE REAL ISSUE
The U.S. has ordered 100 per cent duty on an assortment of European
foods, including foie gras, truffles, onions, chicory and mustard,
to retaliate for the European Union's ban on hormone-fed American
beef. The Europeans are furious, all the more because this is one
round in what is building up to be a much larger, nastier fight.
The point is whether it is about protecting markets, as the U.S.
charges, or protecting consumers, as the EU asserts. The big new
issue, which will have much greater impact, will be food and food
products containing genetically manipulated organisms. By Flora
Lewis. 800 words. 6. FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES SCIENCE TIMES
</P>
<P>
   A. When Pains In The Wrist Leave Workers Disabled
</P>
<P>
   Carpal tunnel syndrome is more prevalent than experts once
believed, according to a new report, but doctors still disagree
over the proper way to diagnose it. By Eric Nagourney. 950 words +
graphic.
</P>
<P>
   B. Many Doctors Learn The Hard Way That Love And Medicine
</P>
<P>
   Don't Mix
</P>
<P>
   A doctor explains firsthand why most doctors don't - and
shouldn't - treat close friends by Abigail Zuger M.D. 900 words.
</P>
<P>
   C. Sophisticated Tests Eclipse Art Of Physical Exams
</P>
<P>
   Medical educators worry that a generation of young doctors
dazzled by sophisticated tests and computer printouts is turning
away from the hands-on skills for the physical examination that,
once forgotten, may never be retrieved. By Abigail Zuger. 2,000
words + photo.
</P>
<P>
   D. China and Space
</P>
<P>
   China is striving to become only the third nation in history to
launch humans into space, a feat that could come as early as next
year, say international space experts. By Warren E. Leary. 1,500

 &HT;    A life too short
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I have never met a Kennedy, but like so many
Americans, I feel I know them.
</P>
<P>
   My first recollection of anything political was watching the
inauguration of John F. Kennedy. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, 1963, ill and not at school that day, I watched
events unfold in Dallas that forever changed how we viewed the
presidency. JFK cut down by an assassin's bullet, and he was only
46 years old. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   America watched as little ``John-John,'' just 3 years old,
saluted the caisson carrying the dead president's body. So young,
everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   We watched as little John-John grew into the man. For someone
who had experienced so much tragedy, he was so grounded. JFK Jr.
never fell into the traps of drugs, money and power his cousins
seemed to make headlines with on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   This Kennedy, we thought, would be the Kennedy to carry the
torch into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, America once again came to grips with the
loss of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. This time the son. Hope that he,
his wife and sister-in-law would be found safe from the plane crash
off the waters of Martha's Vineyard slowly dwindled as bits and
pieces of the wreckage washed ashore. So young, everyone said.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr. will forever be young.
We will never know what these two man could have accomplished had
they not died so young.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes me feel old.

 &HT;    Cruel fate strikes another Kennedy
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He was young, handsome, topped by a ready wit
and a great smile.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief, shining moment we watched his antics as he romped
through his father's White House. And then there was the indelible
image of a 3-year-old John Jr. saluting as his father's flag-draped
coffin rolled by.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend was an overdose of bad memories as once again a
Kennedy tragedy dominated the airwaves and conversation. Once
again, a family's torment was broadcast live. John Fitzgerald
Kennedy Jr. was only 38. His father was killed at 46.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr., who never quite shook the ``John-John'' sobriquet of
his young childhood, was claimed by the sky, like his uncle Joseph
P. Kennedy Jr. and his aunt Kathleen.
</P>
<P>
   Young Joe was supposed to be the politician and the one who was
going to become president one day.
</P>
<P>
   That dream ended over the English Channel during World War II
when the dashing young naval aviator was blown to bits. The B-24
bomber packed with high explosives exploded on its way to attack
German rocket sites. Kathleen, who was known as ``Kick,'' died in a
plane crash in the south of France in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Young John was believed to be at the controls of a Piper
Saratoga II _ which, like the B-24, has a reputation for
reliability _ flying his wife and her sister to a family wedding at
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to underscore how cruel fate can be, the wedding was
that of his cousin Rory, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. Bobby
Kennedy's presidential quest ended in a Los Angeles hotel kitchen
in 1968, moments after he won the California Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most shopworn of journalistic cliches to call the
Kennedys American royalty. But then, cliches become cliches because
there is an element of truth to them.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the patriarch, saw to it that his
children were media darlings before people knew what a media
darling was. They were a frequent presence in magazines and
newsreels.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jack Kennedy became president, it was the image his father
had so carefully crafted for him that was seared into the public
consciousness. After the assassination, JFK attained martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   We know a lot more about him today than we did then, but the
dark side hasn't dimmed my admiration for JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a grown and urbane JFK Jr. sparked a special feeling;
it took me back to a time that was lost forever on Nov. 22, 1963, a
bright sunny Texas afternoon that changed the world. John Jr. had
the trademark Kennedy wit and the grace.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Jacqueline, was obviously owed most of the credit
for that. She took great pains that he and his sister, Caroline,
would live as close to a normal life as a Kennedy is allowed. Even
though he was but 3 when his father was killed, young John
obviously inherited his father's dry wit.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked tactlessly whether he had seen the Oliver Stone
film ``JFK,'' which features seemingly endless repetition of the
Zapruder film _ the one that captured the moment that the
assassin's bullet caused his father's head to explode. JFK Jr.
responded that he hadn't seen it. ``You have to understand that for
my sister and I, it isn't entertainment.'' That was the old man
talking, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Some people I talked with over the weekend were wondering if the
suffering of the Kennedy family is ever going to end. The question
is, of course, rhetorical. There is no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   All we are left with is, once again, a sense of shared loss with
a famous family with money to buy most anything _ anything, that
is, except freedom from grief.

 &HT;    Bush and health care: Wait and see
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush was asked last week in
Virginia:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel you can run comfortably on the patients' bill of
rights being offered by the Republicans in the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' Bush said of the bill that passed the U.S. Senate
without a single vote from Democrats. ``And, I believe again, I
haven't looked at all the particulars of the patients' bill of
rights. We've had good legislation in my own state _ as to making
sure that there are patient and providers protection in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Texas state Sen. David Sibley (R-Waco) _ the author
of state laws that made Texas a leader in standing up to health
maintenance organizations _ is in the nation's capital to be
honored by the American Medical Association for that reason. While
there, he's also counseling House members to keep the potential
federal law from undermining Texas' laws.
</P>
<P>
   While making it abundantly clear he's not being critical of
Bush, Sibley nonetheless said he fears the Senate bill, if left
intact, could undermine such Texas innovations as the right to sue
HMOs and to an independent review of whether an HMO is correct in
denying a treatment option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're denied treatment for leukemia, and you die, you
don't really have two years to go through federal courts'' to be
sure of getting the proper treatment, Sibley said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was trying not to rain on the parade of the national
Republicans he seeks to lead as president, his experience with HMO
regulation has been one of the few in which he's run into stormy
waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, two weeks after his maiden legislative session ended,
he vetoed Sibley's Patient Protection Act. It had been pushed by
doctors organized as the Texas Medical Association and by consumer
groups. It would have, among other things, allowed patients greater
freedom in choosing health care providers, and doctors more
latitude in prescribing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Monthly political writer Paul Burka called the veto Bush's
``first big political mistake.'' (Indeed, three years later, Bush's
re-election opponent, Democrat Garry Mauro, made the veto the
subject of TV ads, but too early in the race to dent Bush's
popularity.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush's reason for the veto was a belief that government should
not unnecessarily interfere in the health care market. The less
government intrusion, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Some close to the governor had counseled him to sign the bill.
It had passed the Legislature overwhelmingly, and the doctors'
lobby group in Texas was (and is) far more powerful and effective
than that of the medical insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush moved to soften the blow and pacify the doctors in his veto
message. He said he would assign his newly appointed commissioner
of insurance, Elton Bomer, to write rules to accomplish many of the
things proposed in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer, who quickly developed a reputation as a fierce and
fearless policeman of the line between consumers and insurance
companies, did just that. He adopted most of the provisions in the
bill except for doctor choice, which required legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley and the Legislature added some additional protections in
their 1997 legislative session, codified Bomer's insurance rules
into law and allowed the right to sue HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, suspicious of suit-happy plaintiffs attorneys, did not
veto the bill allowing HMOs to be sued. But he avoided risking
having a veto overridden by allowing the measure become law without
his signature _ an option open to Texas governors but not to U.S.
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he cited his misgivings. ``I am concerned that this
legislation has the potential to drive up health-care costs and
increase the number of lawsuits,'' he said. ``I hope my concerns
are proven wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   If numbers are evidence, he was. In almost two years since the
law took effect, there have been three lawsuits in Texas against
HMOs under it. And in 1999, when the Legislature added doctor
choice, Bush claimed it as part of his own legislative package.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the U.S. Senate bill passing the House without
substantial change _ if it passes at all _ are iffy. Bush on many
issues has refused to state his attitude toward particular bills,
saying he'll wait until they reach his desk to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Although he may have already gotten ankle-deep in political
quicksand on this sensitive and contentious issue, Bush may well
try to clamber back to that less decisive but probably safer
wait-and-see approach.

 &HT;    GOP whip takes his rhetoric to insulting extremes
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Last week, New York Congressman Michael Forbes
switched from Republican to Democrat, saying leadership has taken
his former party to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no communist menace to rail against, and with an American
economy that is the strongest to be sustained in our lifetime,''
the party has been ``defined by extremists in the House of
Representatives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some will wonder what that means, since House Speaker Dennis
Hastert has been portrayed as a moderate. Who speaks for
Republicans in the House, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Tom DeLay, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan from Sugar Land increasingly is called the most
powerful House Republican. Certainly he's the most vocal. And no
speech better characterizes him than one delivered June 16 on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   For a party that wants to be broad-based, DeLay's rant ranks
among regrettable performances right up there with Pat Buchanan's
GOP convention ``culture war'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's words were in response to a gun-control package in the
wake of the Columbine shootings. Rather than address the merits of
such controls, the man called the Hammer went after everything but.
</P>
<P>
   He read from a letter to the editor printed in the San Angelo
Standard-Times by an Addison Dawson. Reacting to recent shootings,
it is a littany of perceived social ills that dismisses entirely
guns' role.
</P>
<P>
   It talks about children being raised in broken homes, a lack of
meaningful conversation between parents and children, about violent
TV and video games. I doubt 1 percent of America would disagree
that these conditions are troubling.
</P>
<P>
   It talks about ``treating children as pets and pets as
children.'' Good line.
</P>
<P>
   It is shortly thereafter that DeLay's chosen phrases go off into
the briny deep.
</P>
<P>
   The root of violence could be, it ventures, ``that we have
sterilized and contracepted our families down to sizes so small
that the children we do have are so spoiled with material things
that they come to equate the receiving of the material with love.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting theory, this. DeLay may be the first national leader
to advocate that Americans get down to breeding like bunnies.
Sociologists may quibble, but apparently the whip is asserting that
an increase in the birth rate would bring a decrease in the school
shooting rate.
</P>
<P>
   It may disappoint him, but the marketplace dictates these
matters _ the matter of choice, which on reproductive matters
clearly is the dirtiest word to Tom DeLay. The letter also gets off
a line about abortion being pivotal to a ``culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the letter had attacked evolution theory
and, of course, public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school systems teach the children that they are nothing
but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial
soup,'' it bemoaned. Science teachers across the country simply
moaned.
</P>
<P>
   Without any evidence to back up it up, the letter spoke of
schools ``handing out condoms as if they were candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat a big lie often enough and it becomes fact. ``All those
schools handing out condoms'' is a big lie told by small people. I
hear it from them as they campaign for state school board in Texas.
They can't back it up. But, then again, too few people ask them to.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Forbes got out rather than defend demagoguery like this.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush offers himself as a moderate, and by most
definitions he is. A good campaign guru will advise Bush to avoid
Tom DeLay like dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
   Americans bothered by the comments of the most powerful
Republican in the House had better give some thought to how much
less of a danger he is to society with a veto pen hanging over him.

   AN 'UNKNOWN SEAMAN ' IS CLAIMED
</P>
<P>
   Family thought son was lost at sea in WWII torpedo attack near
St. Simons, but now
</P>
<P>
   they get word that he's buried in Georgia soil
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Hendrick/Staff
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven years after she last saw her older brother, Verna
Mae Ardoin has finally found him again ---
</P>
<P>
   buried in a grave marked ``Unknown Seaman'' in Brunswick's
Palmetto Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, but it's wonderful,'' says Ardoin, 69, who recently
drove 800 miles from Louisiana to visit the
</P>
<P>
   grave with several other family members. ``We knew he was dead
but always thought he was in the sea,
</P>
<P>
   right there near Georgia's coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Osswald Ryder, was one of 19 sailors killed when a
German submarine torpedoed their
</P>
<P>
   merchant ship, the SS Oklahoma, within sight of the St. Simons
coast at 2 a.m. on April 8, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder and four other victims were burned beyond recognition and
buried in Palmetto, each under a
</P>
<P>
   plaque marked ``Unknown Seaman.'' Because of bureaucratic snafus
and wartime military censorship,
</P>
<P>
   the families were told their loved ones were missing --- but not
that their bodies had been found or
</P>
<P>
   interred.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, Ryder's parents erected a marker to his memory in the
family cemetery in Ville Platte, La.
</P>
<P>
   But they went to their graves, says Ardoin, still hoping their
son might turn up.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks mostly to the efforts of Michael Higgins, a Darien
businessman, former merchant seaman and
</P>
<P>
   member of the Propeller Club of the United States, a maritime
organization, the family learned a few
</P>
<P>
   weeks ago that Ryder had been buried in Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, 48, stumbled upon the graves a little more than a year
ago, and made it his personal mission to
</P>
<P>
   identify the five and, if possible, find any living relatives.
After months of futile efforts to cut through
</P>
<P>
   Washington red tape, Higgins enlisted the help of Bill Chubb, an
executive of the U.S. Coast Guard's
</P>
<P>
   National Maritime Center.
</P>
<P>
   Digging through dusty archives, Chubb found the files --- and
Higgins finally had the names --- as we
</P>
<P>
   detailed in Dixie Living on Feb. 14. The Brunswick News and The
Associated Press also published
</P>
<P>
   articles on the discovery, and Ardoin's hometown paper, The
Opelousas (La.) Daily World, picked up
</P>
<P>
   the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder's sister was contacted out of the blue by the Daily World
and local TV and radio stations, and
</P>
<P>
   was soon in touch with Higgins. Then Ardoin and her sister,
Winnie Pearl Ryder Ardoin (the sisters
</P>
<P>
   married brothers), and two of Ryder's nieces drove to Brunswick
to visit the five graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bring him home,'' Verna Mae Ardoin says. But there
was no way to tell which was his
</P>
<P>
   grave. ``So we just picked one to be his.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, they bought red roses for each grave, and placed a
permanent marker --- of dried flowers
</P>
<P>
   and seashells --- for Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   On May 22 --- National Maritime Day --- the Propeller Club had
installed a monument with the names
</P>
<P>
   of the long dead mariners at the grave site. The U.S. Coast
Guard identified the other four as Charlie
</P>
<P>
   Rivette, of Leonville, La.; Alfredo Carmona, of San Juan, Puerto
Rico; Joseph Geary, of Boston; and
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Genter of New Orleans. All are eligible for veterans'
gravestones, and Higgins is helping Ardoin
</P>
<P>
   get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom and dad always waited for Osswald,'' Verna Mae Ardoin
says. ``They thought he would come
</P>
<P>
   home any time.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the family is grateful to the Propeller Club for its
efforts to identify the bodies and make more
</P>
<P>
   people aware of the crucial role the Merchant Marine played in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma was sunk during a season of slaughter off the East
Coast. Eighty-two American vessels
</P>
<P>
   hauling war supplies were destroyed by German subs between
January and May 1942, including several
</P>
<P>
   near Brunswick and southward off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Propeller Club has raised enough funds to erect a
memorial stone at the cemetery, a
</P>
<P>
   monument at the Glynn County Courthouse to all the Georgia
seamen who were killed and a 20-foot
</P>
<P>
   replica of a Liberty Ship, as the wartime freighters were
called, on the Brunswick waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of contributions because of the news coverage,''
Higgins says. ``It brought out the best in
</P>
<P>
   people, and most of the money came from the Atlanta area. People
were just unbelievably generous, and
</P>
<P>
   we're very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the family's recent visit, Higgins says: ``It was an
extremely emotional day --- finding their brother
</P>
<P>
   and, in a sense, burying him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 13 when we found out about Osswald,'' Verna Mae
Ardoin says. ``I was in school, and
</P>
<P>
   somebody came to get me. I was deeply in pain. Now, we have some
comfort, like a closing. And next
</P>
<P>
   year on Maritime Day, we all plan to go back. They'll take us
out to sea and let us throw flowers where
</P>
<P>
   the ship was hit.''

 &HT;    UGA animal health center will be monument to safety
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When the new Animal Health Research Center opens,
University of Georgia veterinarian Dr. Barry Harmon will no longer
have to collect and incinerate the byproducts of his research on E.
coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million facility has built-in safeguards designed to
capture, contain, decontaminate and sterilize everything coming out
of it, including the waste water, air molecules and incinerator
ash. The building will allow researchers to study contagious
pathogens such as campylobacter, Chlamydia psittaci and Salmonella
DT 104, which infect humans as well as animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian government has already contacted us about
hiring vet school faculty to investigate Exotic New Castle Disease,
which doesn't exist in the U.S.,'' said Corrie Brown, head of the
College of Veterinary Medicine's pathology department. ``It's a
poultry disease that they didn't have in Australia until a little
while ago. They've had to slaughter 2 million chickens because of
it. In the new building we could study the disease safely.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years in the making, with federal and state
funding, the new research center is the only nongovernment facility
in the country designed to accommodate a wide range of animals,
said Mike Mispagel, facility manager and quality assurance manager
for the university.
</P>
<P>
   With special gates, tie-rings and high ceilings, the animal
rooms are large enough for horses, cows and pigs, as well as for
rodents and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Mispagel expects scientists from agencies outside the
university, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to use the
AHRC for their projects in collaboration with UGA researchers. He
also plans to schedule research on noninfectious diseases for the
first six months the building is open ``to work out any bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the idea of constructing a secure laboratory
setting first surfaced among vet school officials, there had been
outbreaks of Legionnaires' Disease, aflatoxin and various avian
diseases, all of which were studied ``under less than ideal
conditions,'' said Mispagel.
</P>
<P>
   UGA officials brought in a team from the USDA that determined
there was indeed a need for such a facility in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building will provide an additional level of safety and
control,'' Mispagel said. ``The engineered design gives you more
scientific control. You can control the microorganism within a
confined space and avoid the possibility of contaminating other
animals. If you're trying to study an organism, you want to have as
much control as possible over all variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders will be invited to an Aug. 12 dedication, when
the building will be open for tours. Vet school experts have been
working with local public safety officials to devise a plan should
a fire occur in the facility. The UGA Biosafety Committee, which
also has toured the facility, will be closely involved in oversight
responsibility, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Located across from the College of Education, the
70,000-square-foot, bunkerlike building has had its own maintenance
staff for the past six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   An electrician, a plumber and a systems engineer have been
learning the building inside and out, even as architects and
construction crews ready it for final tests and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the building seems unremarkable, just a brightly
lit lobby, a reception area and a hallway of offices, one of which
will house a person to monitor the animals being used in research.
Without access cards, visitors are restricted to the lobby; with a
card, one can enter the locker rooms and showers that lead into the
laboratory areas. Everyone going into these areas must shower
before leaving the building.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 16 animal research rooms, the labs for toxicology,
surgery and necropsy _ animal autopsy _ have special features to
minimize exposure to deadly organisms.
</P>
<P>
   With $5,000 doors that seal to be airtight, the rooms are all
depressurized, meaning that air flows only into them _ outgoing air
circulates through a special filter before being released. There
are autoclaves that sterilize equipment with high temperatures;
biosafety cabinets, which are filled with sterilized air; and
downdraft tables that pull fumes away from the room.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor of the building isn't finished yet, but
Mispagel said it will house the laboratories of the vaccinology
scholar that the Georgia Research Alliance plans to hire.
</P>
<P>
   The air handling system for the building is on the top floor;
the incinerator, waste water holding tanks and emergency generator
are in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much redundancy built into the system that this is
going to be the safest building on campus,'' Mispagel said. ``It's
going to really help give the university a leg up in research. It
will provide a resource for UGA to be able to investigate
microorganisms in a safe environment that otherwise wouldn't be
able to be investigated.''

 &HT;    Tackling the world population boom
 &HT;    By Moni Basu and Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before Y2K, the world will have to deal with Y6B _ the
year of 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations says the world's 6 billionth baby will be
born Oct. 12. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated it already happened
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Earth's human population crosses the 6 billion threshold,
international development agencies with ties to Atlanta are working
hard to stem the growth _ not because the planet cannot sustain so
many people but because high population growth threatens efforts to
improve the lives of the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Foundation, set up to distribute Atlanta businessman
Ted Turner's $1 billion gift to U.N.-related causes, has made
population control one of its main focuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center is concentrating on food supply and ways to
improve health delivery systems in 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
   And the relief agency CARE, an organization that had no family
planning program as recently as 1991, now helps offer birth control
to 4 million people in 36 countries, said Maurice Middleberg, the
organization's director of health and population programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, God willing, is that we will serve over the next
five years something on the order of 14 million,'' Middleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen million. Six billion. What do the numbers mean? To put
it in perspective, consider that one-tenth of all the people who
have ever lived on planet Earth are alive today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1800, the world's population reached 1 billion. By 1930, it
was 2 billion. Now, we're heading toward 6 billion,'' said Peter
Bahouth, executive director of the Turner Foundation. ``The world's
population is increasing by 78 million people a year _ that's the
population of Greece, Sweden and France combined.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the time his boss Turner was born roughly 60 years ago,
the world has added 2 billion people, Bahouth said. ``That's
amazing. It's just an incredible statistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though fertility rates are decreasing, the United Nations
projects a population of 9 billion by 2050. Bahouth said the growth
rate will not stabilize for years because of what is known as
``demographic momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already so many young people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 1 billion people ages 15 to 24 and the 2 billion
under age 15 are destined to become parents. That's why the Turner
Foundation is focusing special attention on adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the largest ever group of adolescents that the world
has ever seen,'' said Ellen Marshall, program officer for
population and women for the U.N. Foundation. ``Looking at what
(adolescents') opportunities are and the decisions they make is
going to have an enormous impact on their countries and the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, for example, the Turner Foundation funds the Georgia
Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy and Prevention, which, Bahouth
said, concentrates on providing good health care and opportunities
for youths without early pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Such educational programs coupled with better access to
contraception are the only way to start curbing population growth,
experts say. But a variety of economic and cultural reasons hamper
access to birth control for women in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies like CARE, which has its U.S. headquarters in Atlanta,
have taken on the task of easing accessibility. In Ghana, for
example, CARE trains hairdressers on how to use condoms so that
they can show their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) get their hair done, and while they're waiting, they
also pick up their contraceptives,'' said spokeswoman Cynthia
Glocker.
</P>
<P>
   Even where there is availability of birth control, bad
information often abounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk to women, and they'll say things like: `Is the IUD
going to float in my body? I've heard stories that it enters my
lungs. Or the pill gives you cancer,''' said CARE's Middleberg.
</P>
<P>
   A problem, say family planning workers, is that it takes a long
time to change perceptions and beliefs, and ultimately, ways of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to see results,'' said Gordon Streeb, associate
executive director of the Carter Center. ``There is a definite time
delay between putting the foot on the brake now and
deacceleration.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rapid population growth continues to exacerbate
existing global problems. It contributes to more poverty,
joblessness and the spread of disease. It hurts the environment by
increasing pollution, exhausting dwindling natural resources and
leading to the extinction of other species. In short, it adds
enormous stress to an already stressed out world.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated, for instance, that 1 billion people in
developing nations today do not have access to safe drinking water.
By 2050, 4 billion people likely will face severe water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In India, which will see its billionth baby born this year,
water tables are dropping 3.3 feet to 9.9 feet a year. That could
mean less water for irrigation, cutting India's grain harvest by
one-fourth and increasing hunger and malnutrition, according to the
Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapid population growth makes everything else that countries
are trying to do more difficult,'' Middleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems created by overpopulation in south Asia cannot go
ignored here, Bahouth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't just say the problems are somewhere else and that
they won't impact us. Americans are dubious about foreign
assistance but they think that we are spending far more than we
actually are,'' Bahouth said, referring to the controversy
surrounding U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Congress voted against contributing to the UNFPA last September
after critics charged that funds were being used for forced
abortions in China. The UNFPA maintains that funds are only used
for voluntary family planning programs. The agency supplies 25
percent of all grant assistance to population programs around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the House voted to restore $20 million in funding for
the UNFPA _ $5 million less than the United States' last
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five million _ that's one-third of Frito cornchips'
advertising budget. It's nothing,'' Bahouth said.
</P>
<P>
   At the groundbreaking world population conference in Cairo five
years ago, the United States made commitments to tackle the problem
of overpopulation. Those commitments, said Bahouth and Middleberg,
have been forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, the U.S. provided $540 million for family planning
worldwide. It's now down to $365 million a year,'' Middleberg said.
``So, at a time when we have been able to demonstrate clearly that
we have the technical package to make this work and the evidence is
manifest, we've withdrawn from this commitment. And I think it's
tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the Carter Center's Streeb: ``It's not all gloom and
doom.''
</P>
<P>
   Several developing countries scattered across the globe _
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Tunisia, Colombia among them _ have
demonstrated considerable success in stabilizing their growth
rates, Streeb said. ``It just takes a commitment at the top. That's
the difference.

 &HT;    Taye Diggs seeks a challenge
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After playing Jamaican boy-toy to Angela Bassett in
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' and then showing up in the
adrenalin-stoked Gen-X feature ``Go,'' actor Taye Diggs is still
grooving, still going.
</P>
<P>
   His latest outing, as a bridegroom with cold feet in the
evocative 1980s flashback movie ``The Wood,'' teams him with Omar
Epps and Richard T. Jones. While trying to get Diggs' character
Roland to the chapel on time, they reminisce about their awkward,
and very hormone-driven, teen-age years in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Diggs in New York by telephone, and he talked
about the new movie, his career and why he's perfectly comfortable
showing that killer smile and those sculpted abs:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What appealed to you about ``The Wood,'' and why do you think
audiences will like it?
</P>
<P>
   A: People will look at it as a heartwarming and fun trip down
memory lane. It's a feel-good movie, and a lot of black audience
members are saying it's nice to have a film that touches on this
time period for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did any of the scenes in the movie remind you of your
teen-age years?
</P>
<P>
   A: In reading the script, the exact sequence of events that
takes place is almost like I went through myself, down to the dates
and the dances and the nerves and the lack of confidence. I was the
nerdy, shy type in school, up until 11th grade when I started to
find my confidence. It was difficult for me. I wasn't the most
secure kid in the world. I had the glasses with the tape on them,
the cheapest form of eyewear possible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's hard to imagine you were an awkward kid since you're
considered a sex symbol now.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was rough for me. I went to a performing arts high school
where the emphasis was changed as to what makes a person cool. In
most high schools it's how athletic you are, or how much money your
parents have. In my high school there were different people from
different walks of life, and what mattered was your talent as an
actor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think this movie will start a trend in black movies, a
departure from shoot-'em-ups?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think it's the beginning of something; I think it
will be a contributing factor. There were a couple of movies that
have trailblazed, like ``Love Jones'' and ``Waiting to Exhale.'' I
don't know if that will happen with ``The Wood,'' but it will
(definitely) help as opposed to harm. But I don't consider ``The
Wood'' a black movie. It's a story about black people that's
universal. I hope people will realize we have more to offer than
killing ourselves and people in do-rags selling crack. We have
stories like that, too. But there's more to us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's one scene in the movie where you and your co-stars
are almost naked. Do you mind doing beefcake shots?
</P>
<P>
   A: When we shot it, I didn't think beefcake; we were thinking
humor. When you see someone completely naked it makes them seem
vulnerable. But because of my past with ``Stella'' and the sex
symbol thing, it will be seen as a beefcake shot. To me it was just
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you enjoy the sex symbol roles?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm young; I'm just trying to have fun. I just want some
roles that are challenging. The fun factor is of great importance
to me. Who I work with is most important. I learned a lot from
Whoopi (Goldberg, who co-starred in ``Stella''). She had a lot of
people in stitches. But I'm not upset about being a sex symbol. I'd
be stupid if I tried to say that it bothered me, or that it's a bad
thing. There are worse things to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you notice any changes, improvements in films with black
casts?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think things in black films are slowly but surely
improving. I'm nervous about saying that, because as soon as things
start improving they think it doesn't need to improve anymore. I
say that only in hopes that this trend will continue to occur and
studios will continue to give these stories and these writers a
chance and put the publicity into them that they need.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think it's important for white moviegoers to see these
kinds of films as well?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take for granted that, for a lot of white people, the only
exposure they have is the images on the screen. I think it is a
wonderful thing for whites to see blacks in this light. Three black
educated men loving each other.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The movie shows blacks in a very favorable light. But why
weren't there any fathers on-screen? Among the three friends, there
was no explanation for their fathers being absent.
</P>
<P>
   A: To me this wasn't about the fathers; it was about the boys.
But I know the story was autobiographical for the writer. I think
those were the situations that occurred in life. His friends grew
up in single-parent households. But that didn't bother me at all. I
wouldn't be bogged down by that, and I don't think the audience
will either.

 &HT;    Return to '80s: Love, not guns, fuels `The Wood'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine. A Hollywood movie about three twentysomething
black males that has more laughs than gunshots, more scenes showing
guys in tuxes than gang colors.
</P>
<P>
   There's much more benevolence than violence in ``The Wood,''
first-time writer/
</P>
<P>
   director Rick Famuyiwa's funny big-screen homage to his
growing-up days in the '80s in Inglewood, Calif. The movie, which
opened last weekend, stars Omar Epps, Taye Diggs and Richard T.
Jones as friends Mike, Roland and Slim, who periodically recall
their teen years on Roland's wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first movie I have seen with more than three black
guys and only one gun,'' says E. Carl Touchstone, 33. ``You hear
about movies with a primarily black male cast and you know already
it's going to be full of violence and stuff. This wasn't like that.
I was just floored. It was a true depiction of coming of age and
trying to get the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is a gang subplot in the film, the emphasis is
overwhelmingly in favor of music, hairstyles and clothes from the
'80s shown in a series of flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection of the past for black youth _ back when you
could come to school and not be afraid somebody might shoot you,''
says Twana James, 28, a co-host of Hot 97's ``The Ryan Cameron
Morning Show.'' ``It just made me reminisce. Now I'm one of those
people who say, `I remember when ...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wood'' is part of a recent trend in Hollywood that is more
frequently portraying the wider experience of blacks in America.
</P>
<P>
   Films such as ``Soul Food,'' ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back''
and ``Waiting to Exhale'' have veered away from early '90s films
such as ``Menace II Society'' and ``Boyz N the Hood'' that focused
on the violence that confronts many African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Those earlier ghetto films ``were a successful formula,''
Famuyiwa says. ``The same reason you had two volcano movies is the
same reason you have two or three 'hood films. Hollywood will
proceed to replicate them. It's a business.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Wood' is a different image that should exist in the same
space as those other films,'' he says. ``There is no one
African-American experience. If the Three Stooges were the only
thing that represented white culture, you'd see the problem. If one
thing is all you see, then people start thinking that's all that's
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem Famuyiwa faced was that the young actors playing
Epps, Diggs and Jones as teens knew nothing about the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to think hard about getting them into that mode, into
that slang and the dress,'' Famuyiwa says. ``They watched a lot of
films like `Purple Rain.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jheri curls, spandex, hip-hop music and flattop haircuts.
Jellies, break dancing, the whop and fluorescent-colored socks:
They all come alive again in ``The Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what I used to look like,'' Atlanta moviegoer Touchstone
says. ``It caused me to have a lot of memories _ the clothes, the
hair and just being in junior high.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is one thing about the '80s ``The Wood'' leaves up to
moviegoers. In an early scene, the film asks one of the decade's
ultimate questions: Vanity or Appollonia?
</P>
<P>
   ``Vanity, of course,'' Touchstone says. ``I saw her in concert
in 1982 at the Fox Theatre and the things she did ... uh ... whew.
Vanity. Of course.''

   TVCENTURY _ ATLANTA _ In the spring of the last year of the

The comment was fictional, in a novel titled ``Messiah'' by
Romanian poet Andrei Codrescu, but reality was working hard to make
such speculation seem reasonable. By the end of the century,
television had become more than a mere medium; it was the
uber-medium, the technology that ate the world. The single biggest
influence on what books people read was Oprah Winfrey's Book Club.
For years, the best guide for movie audiences had been the thumbs
of Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel on their TV show. TV ads

objectionable than half a dozen others. What goes unnoticed is the
impunity with which other words _ equally coarse, equally repugnant

best nonfiction books of the century list. (Milner, Cox News

 &HT;    Fans take heavy hit in the wallet to see top acts
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to go out for an evening of live music? Better
swing by the ATM first. Or take out a loan.
</P>
<P>
   It can cost a small fortune to attend a concert these days. A
designer-drenched Whitney Houston show at the Fox Theatre, for
example. A seat in front went for $125. That's one seat.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, hundreds of fans surely were ``Livin' la Vida
Loca'' when they paid $95 a ticket for a prime spot at Latin hunk
Ricky Martin's Oct. 24 show at the new Philips Arena. When Cher
recently danced across the Lakewood Amphitheatre stage, it cost
concertgoers as much as $75 to catch her splashy act. Even the once
mod Rod Stewart, who hasn't had a major hit record in years,
commanded $51.25 a ticket for his June show at Chastain Park
Amphitheatre. Can hair spray really cost that much?
</P>
<P>
   How are fans taking this?
</P>
<P>
   Music lovers such as 40-year-old Carol Jenkins, a hairstylist in
southwest Atlanta, think prices hovering around $100 are
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like Whitney, but we were like, $125! We're not trying
to support Bobby Brown's kids!'' she says, referring to the R&AMP;B
artist who is Houston's husband. ``That price is really putting a
lot of people out. If you and your husband want to go, and you've
got kids like I do, that's going to be a really expensive evening.
Forget about dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans seem reconciled to paying the price for hot acts.
Consider the Martin show, which sold out in 30 minutes, according
to Philips Arena President Bob Williams. The tickets were snatched
up by fans such as mom Audrey Baxter and daughter Katie, 13, who
were first in line at Ticketmaster at an Atlanta Publix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never paid this much for tickets before,'' Baxter said.
``But I don't go to as many shows as I used to. This is a rare
occasion. Yeah, I think it's too high. But I saw him on the Grammys
and thought he was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this new kind of sticker shock, consumers are
scratching their heads and wondering, ``How did this happen?'' We
polled music industry executives and Atlanta concert promoters, who
cited these reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ Artists began demanding more money _ and got it. In the baby
boom generation, it was often perceived as greedy for pop music
acts to ``gouge'' the public on ticket prices. Remember the
laid-back voice over the loudspeaker at Woodstock? ``It's a free
concert from now on.'' Thousands of teen-agers who never paid a
dime of the $18 ticket climbed over the fence. Few of the acts who
played were ever paid. Peace and love, man.
</P>
<P>
   While concert prices certainly rose over the years as rock music
exploded, they usually played leapfrog with inflation. In 1965, it
cost $5.50 to see the Beatles at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
When Paul McCartney brought his first solo tour, ``Wings Over
America,'' here in 1976, a seat cost $10. His 1993 show topped him
out at $32.50 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Eagles. When the graying band announced its ``Hell
Freezes Over'' reunion tour in 1994, fans stunned the music world
by shelling out $100, $75, $50 and $35 for seats. Other artists
took notice, particularly acts that fell into ``legends'' or
``super-hot-for-the-moment'' status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life cycle of artists has been growing shorter over the
years,'' says Rudi Schlegel, the marketing brains behind the
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's Chastain pop concert series. ``That
means that when they're hot, they are extremely hot. They have to
make money in a shorter window of time before the public moves on
to the next hot act.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Scalping was getting out of hand. ``If anything happened out
there, the solidarity of the scalpers made people pay attention,''
says veteran Atlanta concert promoter Peter Conlon. ``It went from,
`Hey! I've got a couple of tickets, give me an extra $20,' to `I've
got front-row seats for $500.' It got to the point where artists
were seeing (that the scalpers) were getting more than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring there are always hardcore fans willing to pay
extraordinary prices for premium seats, artists and promoters began
tiering show packages to reflect more varied levels of price
ranges. The Houston show, for example, offered its best seats on
the high end ($125) _ tickets that, if priced lower, would most
likely have been snatched up by scalpers and resold at higher
prices anyway. But fans could also buy tickets for $75 and $55.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bongiovani, editor in chief of the concert trade
publication Pollstar, sums it up this way: ``Everybody was fighting
over how to split up a $30 ticket, yet when you talked to the
people in the front rows, they paid $150 a ticket _ and none of
that was going to (the artists).''
</P>
<P>
   _ MTV created the video star. Imagine this: You've stood in line
for three hours to pay $95 to a Ricky Martin concert. You go to the
show and take your seat, only to watch Martin stand still at a
microphone for 90 minutes singing various album cuts. No half-naked
dancers shaking their lambadas, no big screen blasting Martin's
rain-drenched ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' video, no smoke, no costume
changes, no light show, not even candles dripping wax onto
strategic places.
</P>
<P>
   What a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   The video images that today's pop artists work so carefully to
cultivate are now what the public expects to see in concert. And
those can be very, very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The videos create a certain image that these acts have to
re-create on the road, and that makes the show much more complex,''
Conlon says. ``These people are traveling with 12 tractor-trailer
tucks and eight buses of people who are staying in 100 hotel rooms.
The cost can be up to $150,000 in traveling expenses. I remember
when Ted Nugent would show up with a trailer hitched to the back of
his car. We're much more sophisticated now, and the production
costs are tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Concert promotion has gone corporate. Perhaps the best place
to find the reason for staggering concert ticket prices is on Wall
Street. For years, the U.S. concert promotion business was mostly a
mom-and-pop operation controlled by independent promoters at the
local level. In Atlanta, for example, Alex Cooley emerged from the
experimentation of '60s rock festivals to dominate the local
concert scene, and still books most major local shows _ from the
Stones to the Allman Brothers. The same system was in place across
the country _ Bill Graham in San Francisco, Don Law in Boston, Ron
Delsener in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, however, these entrepreneurs (and
dozens of others) faced a mounting challenge to book acts
independently. Instead of committing to one-night stands, artists
were signing with promoters who could guarantee appearances in
multiple cities. Then a new company called SFX Entertainment made
them an offer they couldn't refuse, systematically buying out and
consolidating the nation's independent promoters. This brought the
bulk of America's concert promotion business under one corporate
umbrella. With the potential to earn billions, SFX took live music
to the stock exchange, making it a public commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it has gotten centralized, the industry has gotten to be a
multibillion corporate business,'' Schlegel says. ``They are now
publicly owned companies traded on the stock exchange. And that
means they've got to bring a quarterly dividend to shareholders,
not unlike what's happened in radio or network television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``SFX has borrowed a lot of money by stock offerings and bonds
to acquire these small, independent concert promoters. So they've
got to make a return on their investment or they're dead ducks.
That just puts them under more pressure to have to raise ticket
prices to get every nickel they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the bottom line with concert ticket prices, like in
any capitalist venture, is that supply meets demand. Perhaps
Pollstar's Bongiovani says it best: ``The public will vote with
their wallet. Until the public starts saying `no' _ and we haven't
seen any sign of that _ there isn't any reason to believe the trend
will change.''

delivered June 16 on the House floor. For a party that wants to be

speech. (John Young is opinion page editor of the Waco

The comment was fictional, in a novel titled ``Messiah'' by
Romanian poet Andrei Codrescu, but reality was working hard to make
such speculation seem reasonable. By the end of the century,
television had become more than a mere medium; it was the
uber-medium, the technology that ate the world. The single biggest
influence on what books people read was Oprah Winfrey's Book Club.
For years, the best guide for movie audiences had been the thumbs
of Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel on their TV show. TV ads

objectionable than half a dozen others. What goes unnoticed is the
impunity with which other words _ equally coarse, equally repugnant

SANDWICH DRESSING THAT BEATS MAYO, MUSTARD

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was a recipe I'd forgotten about until my
husband waltzed into the apartment with hot ham, prosciutto, Genoa
salami, provolone cheese and a bag of sub rolls. His sister and her
family were here from Boston for the weekend and he'd decided to do
Italian subs for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Since I didn't want mayonnaise or mustard on these exquisite
cold cuts, I whipped up an old dressing recipe I'd used previously
on cold antipasti and pasta salads. I didn't think anyone else
would want it but it was easy enough to make for only me. And the
leftovers could be used on salads throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was I wrong. All the adults skipped the mayo and mustard
and went for the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 2
cloves chopped fresh garlic, 1 tablespoon each fresh chopped
oregano and basil (you can use 1 teaspoon dried of each herb too),
salt and pepper in jar with a lid. Shake well. Add 3/4 cup
extra-virgin olive oil and shake again.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a more authentic dressing, mash a couple anchovies
with the salt and pepper before adding the spices to the dressing.
I don't, but only because anchovies are something I don't usually
have in the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't even enough leftover to make a salad the next day.
Next time, I'll double the recipe.

NEW ENTERTAINMENT BOSS BRINGS HISTORY OF SUCCESS TO FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Doug Herzog, the new entertainment president
for Fox, may find himself on a fabulous new throne in the next
television season, by dint of one of those Horatio Alger stories
Hollywood loves so much.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than six months ago, Herzog was Cable Guy. You may
have read a lot about the networks losing viewers to cable like
mad, but there's still a pretty clear pecking order in the
television industry, and Cable Guy _ even Well Qualified Cable Guy
_ parks his car a lot farther from the trendy hot-spot restaurant
than Network Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog has been in place for about six months, taking over a
network better known for failed potential and a glorious beginning
than a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years, The WB, that little upstart fifth
network, was not only garnering all the headlines and creating the
buzz shows, its founders were the ones who started Fox _ and they
took any chance available to say they left a sinking ship, a
network with an identity problem. And they were right.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, once the young, urban, hip network, decided several years
ago to become CBS, to try to gain respectability by adding news and
sports and seeking a slightly older demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Like a country girl in a tattered dress trying to get into the
debutante's ball, Fox looked out of place and soon felt the
embarrassment of its own ambitions and growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing President Peter Roth got a lot of the blame for Fox's
stalled improvement and its inability to create a comedy that
wasn't animated, and he couldn't shake the perception that Fox, at
a fork in the road, was overtaken by The WB like the Road Runner
smoking past Wile E. Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   But everything seems different at Fox with Herzog, who put on a
virtuoso performance in front of the nation's television critics
Wednesday, coming off as smart, funny, hip, clear in his vision
and, well, Fox-like. Perception is everything, and Herzog
immediately has improved that of his new network.
</P>
<P>
   He got the job at Fox after stints at MTV and Comedy Central,
for which he helped develop ``The Real World,'' ``MTV News,''
``Unplugged,'' ``South Park,'' ``The Daily Show'' and ``Win Ben
Stein's Money.'' In the cable world, the guy is instant gold.
</P>
<P>
   What he does with Fox remains to be seen, because his
fingerprints are not yet evident.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear he is blessed by luck. Many people believe that
Fox has perhaps the strongest shows for fall, and it's been a long
time since anyone thought that. Herzog is too new to have created
these shows from scratch. He just gave the green light to what was
in the pipeline. Roth, as it turns out, finally had some mojo going
before getting dumped, and Herzog is the beneficiary of that plus a
few key acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   That's not normally what happens to incoming entertainment
presidents. Mostly they're saddled with horrendous offerings and
are forced to take the company line in spinning their wonderful
potential, then sit back and take the critical drubbing when the
shows falter.
</P>
<P>
   But Herzog said that even though his stamp isn't on the new
season _ and it may not be until midseason or beyond _ he's
comfortable that the shows are true to the Fox philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   They are indeed edgy, enough so that some critics wonder if they
are appropriate for teens and family and if some of the humor isn't
too crass or over the top. Translated, that means yeah, baby, Fox
is back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants a Fox network that plays it safe?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about shows of the coming season is a Fox
sitcom called ``Action'' that ruthlessly skewers the movie
business. ``Action'' has a mean-spirited, nearly unlikable but
hilariously angry lead character, played by Jay Mohr, and there are
plenty of bleeped-out swear words. The show is ``clearly breaking
new ground,'' Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' will be a lightning rod for criticism, but the fact
remains it's brutally funny and daring _ an old Fox hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Other Fox shows also will push buttons, and it was a delight to
watch Herzog roam the stage and not apologize as the network tries
to reclaim its identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be daring, we've got to be different, and we've
got to be Fox,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Herzog is good _ and this time, lucky _ and the
combination is just the spark Fox needs. If the fall lineup pans
out and repositions Fox _ or at the very least defines a strong new
direction _ then Herzog's stock will go only up. He's already
proven capable of reading what the public wants _ at least the kind
of cable- world public that is willing to take chances _ and that's
what got Fox noticed in the first place.

BRENDAN FRASER HAS ANOTHER `BLAST FROM THE PAST' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brendan Fraser is the only actor who can boast two
roles in which he comes out of the ground to begin life anew in the
San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   You may remember the classic teen film (isn't everything a
classic that's more than 10 minutes old these days?) ``Encino
Man.'' In it, Fraser played a frozen cave man unearthed by a high
school student (Sean Astin) in his back yard. After he and his
friend (Pauly Shore) defrost him, the cave man _ thanks to Fraser's
comic timing _ proves it's cooler to be a Neanderthal than a
slacker.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``Blast From the Past,'' which comes out Tuesday on
video and DVD, Fraser plays a 35-year-old man (Adam) who has been
kept in a Valley fallout shelter all his life after his wacky
parents, Calvin (Christopher Walken) and Helen (Sissy Spacek),
mistakenly believe there had been a nuclear attack during the Cuban
Missile Crisis of 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the logic. After waiting out the 35-year half-life of
radioactive contamination, Calvin takes a preliminary foray to the
surface and finds that his pristine suburban paradise has been
rezoned and now, among other things, is home to an adult bookstore.
After an encounter with a transvestite, he concludes that the world
is populated with mutants and scurries back to the shelter. But the
family needs supplies, and Calvin is unable to go, and so he sends
Adam out into modern-day L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with $3,000 and a box of valuable baseball cards, Adam
meets Eve (Alicia Silverstone) when she saves him from getting
ripped off. ``Blast From the Past'' then turns into a charming
fairy tale as Adam is introduced to the real world. It's a
fish-out-of-water tale. Adam is a gentleman from the old school _
literally. His conservative parents taught him how to be one,
including dance lessons. And what comes out is as much about what
is no longer in fashion _ manners, for one thing _ as well as what
we take for granted _ nature.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Blast'' isn't an outright one, it will give you a
lift, especially from Fraser, who has proved that he's not afraid
to be goofy, despite his leading-man looks. In fact, he has pretty
much made a career of it. In Michael Ritchie's sweet comedy ``The
Scout'' he played an emotionally backward pitching phenom. In
``George of the Jungle,'' he's George. Enough said. In ``Airheads''
he was one, and later this year, he'll be ``Dudley Do Right,'' for
Hugh Wilson, who directed ``Blast.''
</P>
<P>
   What these wacky roles overshadow is that Fraser is a pretty
fair actor, which is more evident when he takes on a serious role,
as in ``Gods and Monsters.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`Haunting' lessons
</P>
<P>
   &LR; While Jan De Bont's ``The Haunting,'' which opens today, relies
heavily on special effects for creepy atmosphere, Robert Wise's
1963 version creates it with imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wise was honored last year with a Lifetime Achievement
Award from the American Film Institute, he was never a true auteur.
He did make some interesting and lucrative films _ ``The Day the
Earth Stood Still,'' ``West Side Story,'' ``The Sound of Music,''
and ``Two for the Seesaw,'' but there is no real Wise stamp on the
films. He was, though, a consummate craftsman, turning out solid
entertainment featuring good performances. That in itself is an
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Wise began his career working for low-budget horror-meister Val
Lewton, who directed the 1942 version of ``The Cat People.'' In
fact, Wise's first directing credit was when he finished up the
sequel, ``The Curse of the Cat People'' (1944). Wise learned his
lessons well, and with ``The Haunting'' was able to create terror
in the minds of the audience with a minimal amount of effects.

PURISTS BELIEVE HALL OF FAME STANDARDS ARE SLIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUZZ GRAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven plaques will be added to the Baseball Hall of Fame Gallery
this weekend in Cooperstown, N.Y. Three of them will commemorate
the careers of players elected in their first year of eligibility,
making this not only the largest induction class since 1972 but
also one of the most-anticipated ever.
</P>
<P>
   For purists who might see in the class size a trend toward
lowering standards for admission, the secretary of the organization
that serves as the Hall's gatekeepers has a two-word answer:
``Definitely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This just happens to be a special class, an exceptional
class,'' said Jack O'Connell, the secretary of the Baseball
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) and veteran Yankees beat
writer for the Hartford (Conn.) Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the BBWAA have been voting on Hall of Fame candidates
for 55 years, electing just 91 in that time. More than a few
eyebrows were raised this year, however, when Nolan Ryan and George
Brett each finished among the all-time top four in percentage of
votes received, surpassing such former stars as Willie Mays and
Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is look at their stats,'' Jeff Idelson,
executive director of communications and education at the Hall,
said of this year's inductees. ``They speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be hard to argue with this year's selections. Ryan,
after all, is the game's all-time strikeout king, pitched a record
seven no-hitters and won 324 games. Brett and Robin Yount of the
Milwaukee Brewers are among the 20 players in history with 3,000 or
more hits, and Brett is the only player to win batting titles in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But one longtime voter, former Red Sox writer Neil Singelais of
the Boston Globe, had concerns about the credentials of some
players presented for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even lousy players are put on the list these days,'' said
Singelais, 74, of Lexington, Mass. ``It's a waste of everyone's
time. My level of criteria is a lot higher than the working writers
of today. I thought the standards were lowered when Ralph Kiner got
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiner, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1975, batted .279
with 369 home runs in 10 major-league seasons. He led the league in
homers seven times, and 7.1 percent of his at-bats resulted in a
home run. Only Babe Ruth (8.5) had a higher percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of a particular inductee's merits, it remains a fact
that only about 1 percent (182) of major-league players have gotten
into the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's name was on 491 of the 497 ballots cast this year by
members of the BBWAA. That translates to 98.79 percent of the vote,
second only to the 98.84 Tom Seaver received in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Brett amassed 488 votes, or 98.19 percent, fourth-highest
all-time. Only Seaver, Ryan and Cobb are ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean our standards are slipping at all,''
O'Connell said. ``It might be another 20 years before two players
like (Ryan and Brett) become eligible for induction.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what Ryan and Brett accomplished, it might be more
appropriate to question the few writers who did not vote for one or
the other. The ballots are secret, so writers who chose not to
reveal their votes can remain anonymous. But Philadelphia Daily
News columnist Bill Conlin and BBWAA member acknowledged being one
of the six who did not vote for Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, it's a matter of principle,'' Conlin said. ``I refuse
to vote for any player on the first ballot. A particular player's
merits are not at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Conlin isn't the only member of the BBWAA to harbor
reservations. No player ever has been elected by a unanimous vote,
or even come within one vote of being the first.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Kachline, the retired historian of the Hall of Fame,
said he thinks the process is fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some voters who are totally unfair,'' Kachline said.
``Some people say, `(Joe) DiMaggio didn't get in the first time, so
why should anyone else get in the first time?' It's the voters, not
the system, that's at fault.'' Because the ballots are secret,
there is no accountability or public pressure on those who may have
different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confidently say that our members take their
responsibilities very, very seriously,'' O'Connell said. ``We treat
it as a special privilege. I know (Hall of Fame voting) is a topic
of discussion throughout the year by our members.''
</P>
<P>
   To become a member of the BBWAA, a person must serve a minimum
of 10 consecutive years as a newspaper beat writer for a
major-league baseball team or teams. After that, he or she can
apply for membership. There currently are nine women among the more
than 500 members of the BBWAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members return their ballots unsigned,'' O'Connell said.
``They are usually the ones who have been retired for a few years
and don't feel as though they have the needed information or
observation to cast their votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Players themselves often are overwhelmed when selected. Such is
the case with Yount, the other inductee selected by the BBWAA this
year. He received 77.5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   To be elected, a player must be named on at least 75 percent of
the ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you never really know what the writers think of
you,'' Yount said. ``I think (writers) try to be fair when they
vote. Most of us believe they do a good job. I don't think there's
anybody in (the Hall) that shouldn't be in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The writers have done an outstanding job over the years,
especially compared to some other Hall of Fames,'' said Bill
Guilfoile, a former vice president at Cooperstown. ``In some cases,
players might have waited longer than they should have, but I think
the formula is working.''

BUSH PLANS TO MIX BASEBALL, FUND-RAISING IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ George W. Bush will be in Cooperstown this
weekend, and one of the items on the Texas governor's schedule is a
private meeting and sleepover with New York Gov. George E. Pataki,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who recently became the 17th Republican governor to
endorse Bush for the Republican presidential nomination, has
occasionally been mentioned as a potential vice presidential
candidate, or perhaps Cabinet member if the son of former President
George Bush wins the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to be in Cooperstown to attend a fund-raiser
on his behalf at the home of businessman Walter Rich. He is also
slated to attend the induction of pitcher Nolan Ryan, a former
Texas Ranger, into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Bush is a former
owner of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is scheduled to attend a 1:30 p.m. news conference
Saturday with Bush and Ryan at Cooperstown High School before
hosting the fund-raiser, spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said Wednesday.
Aides to Bush said the news conference would deal only with
baseball, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha said the two governors will spend the night at the home of
a ``top Republican fund-raiser.'' On Sunday, Pataki and Bush are
scheduled to attend a brunch in Ryan's honor, after which New
York's governor will open the ceremony at the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Pataki may be chosen as a candidate to run for
vice president on the Bush ticket has helped raise money in a
heavily Democratic state, said Lee Miringoff of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign took in a record $37 million nationally from
March to the end of June, according to Federal Election Commission
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he will ultimately carry New York remains to be seen.
At this stage, with the blessings of Pataki, the fund raising is
going very well for him,'' Miringoff said. ``I get the message that
when Pataki endorsed him, what he was telling Bush was that `New
York could provide money, media and maybe me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Texas Lt. Gov. Rick Perry will be featured at a
fund-raiser in Albany hosted by Pataki's lieutenant governor, Mary
Donohue, and state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fund raising in the world won't change the fact that
the state Republican Party is bankrupt on ideas,'' state Democratic
Party spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said.

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some roles are all too easy for a performer to grasp.
 &HT;    When singer/actor Roger Daltrey, a pop icon since his days with
The Who, was asked to play an aging rock superstar with serious
problems with drinking and drugs, he hesitated.
 &HT;    ``I was a bit nervous doing it,'' Daltrey says. ``It was a bit
too close to home for me.''
 &HT;    His own drinking and drugs never got out of control, he hastens
to add. But the role in an episode of Showtime's cable series
``Rude Awakening'' evoked memories of his former bandmate, drummer
Keith Moon, who struggled with various forms of substance abuse
before dying of an overdose of sleeping pills in l978.
 &HT;    Finally Daltrey accepted the role of Nobby Clegg, an English
rocker who spends a lot of time at Addictions Anonymous meetings
with the show's leading lady, Sherilyn Fenn. The episode will air
July 31.
 &HT;    If nothing else, he says, he enjoyed the costume. As Nobby, his
hair is a tangle of black and pink topped off with a red ribbon.
His fingernails are painted black and purple, and he wears tons of
mascara.
 &HT;    ``In my acting career I try to keep people guessing, doing roles
that will surprise them,'' he adds. ``Nobby is a cross between
Marilyn Manson and Boy George _ all the bad boys of rock rolled
into one.''
 &HT;    At 55, Daltrey is one of a handful of survivors who seem to have
emerged from the caldron of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll more or
less intact. Married for 28 years, he is a family man with two
daughters and a son, as well as another child from an earlier
relationship.
 &HT;    ``I've avoided becoming a casualty,'' he says. ``I've avoided
going mad on it. I've been lucky. My wife Heather has been a rock
for me _ I could so easily have gone off the rails.
 &HT;    ``I'm not against drugs,'' Daltrey adds. ``In fact, I'm probably
off the wall with my views about drugs: I think they should all be
legalized, and it disturbs me that we still can't deal with the
drug problem rationally.
 &HT;    ``In most countries they make criminals out of addicts,'' he
says, ``and that should never be ... It spins out of control _ a
vicious cycle.''
 &HT;    Moon's drug problems began when he gave up alcohol, Daltrey
adds.
 &HT;    ``The stuff they gave him to help him give up the drink killed
him,'' he says with a shake of his head. ``Can you believe it?''
 &HT;    Daltrey spent the 1960s and 1970s competing with, among others,
fellow rock stars Mick Jagger and David Bowie. Now all three have
launched acting careers, but Daltrey is clearly in the lead in that
arena.
 &HT;    As Daltrey recalls, his acting career began unexpectedly, with
director Ken Russell's offering him the title role in the 1975 film
adaptation of The Who's rock opera, ``Tommy.''
 &HT;    `` Nobody would have taken me seriously but for that film
role,'' he says. ``Until then I'd never acted _ I was always the
kid who turned up for the school play and was laughed out of the
room. When I was a kid, I saw Elvis in rock 'n' roll and said,
`Hey, that's for me.'''
 &HT;    After a childhood spent in a working-class London neighborhood
still struggling to dig itself out of the rubble of World War II,
Daltrey was working as an apprentice welder when he teamed up with
Moon and guitarist Peter Townshend to form The Who. To his
surprise, they became a roaring success.
 &HT;    ``We were a raving, left-wing, socialist band,'' Daltrey
recalls, ``and we always got criticized for making loads of money.
On tour we gave $8 million to charities. I wish I'd kept some of it
_ I need it now.
 &HT;    ``But I've always been a disaster with money,'' he admits. ``I'd
have been better off if I'd put that money in the bank and lived
off it. I'm not complaining _ I'm a very rich man _ but you could
say I'm asset-rich and cash-poor. That's why I go to work.''
 &HT;    As unlikely as it may seem to anyone who ever saw The Who in
their prime, Daltrey long since fled London and bought a 400-acre
cattle farm in East Sussex, as well as trout farms in rural Dorset.
 &HT;    ``Living on the farm balanced out my life,'' he says, ``and it
probably saved me from ending up like my drummer and quite a lot of
other people in this business.''
 &HT;    Or in Hollywood, for that matter, though Daltrey's has not been
a typical acting career. After ``Tommy'' he starred in another
Russell film, ``Lisztomania'' (l975), which he calls ``a
comic-strip version of the life of Franz Liszt,'' and went on to
play the lead in the l980 prison drama ``McVicar.''
 &HT;    Among his more recent efforts was the disappointing ``Lightning
Jack'' (l994), a Paul Hogan western co-starring Cuba Gooding Jr. In
l995 he played the Tin Man on a Broadway version of ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' and last year he played Scrooge in ``A Christmas Carol'' in
New York.
 &HT;    ``I took any job that came up,'' he says, ``whether the part was
big, small or required me to sweep the stage. As a character actor
you've got to lose yourself in the role _ and that's hard, because
rock 'n' roll demands such a strong image.''
 &HT;    Next up is ``Romantic Moritz,'' a low-budget independent film
with Christopher Lloyd and Caspar Van Dien. In the film, due early
next year, Daltrey plays a Texas bass player from a 1960s band.
 &HT;    ``He's a very old hippie with beard and beer belly, and no one
will recognize me,'' Daltry says. ``My attitude is the further away
the roles are from me, the more I like it.''
 &HT;    He's even combining his past and his present as producer of an
upcoming film on the short, troubled life of Moon, his former
bandmate.
 &HT;    ``I'm not sure who's going to play me,'' he says, laughing.
``Now, playing Keith _ that's the problem. We need someone who
should look like a cherub for the first 16 years of his life and
then look like Robert Newton on a bad day towards the end of his
life.''
 &HT;    There is another Moon film in the works, with Robert De Niro
reportedly attached, and Daltrey pulls no punches in dismissing the
rival project.
 &HT;    ``It's a crappy script,'' he says. ``I tried to work with them
at first, but their script was terrible. Sure, they can go ahead
and make their movie, but they won't get any music and it won't be
a film about Keith Moon. Theirs will be a film about some joker,
some shallow shadow of what he really was.
 &HT;    ``I still miss Keith,'' Daltrey says somberly. ``He was such a
flamboyant character, and unlike anyone else.''

   IOWA _ Lamar Alexander still goes from town to town looking for
support. At one stop, there's nine Republicans waiting to hear him,
at another, 18. Down in the polls, way, way behind George Bush in
cash, Alexander is a definate have-not in the coming straw poll,
despite spending years here in search of votes. Down the road is
Steve Forbes, who is hardly a have-not with all his millions. Yet,
he, too, is still scrambling to avoid the Bush bulldozer. Steve
Kraske. 35.

   WATKIN: Later this month another stretch of the long-planned
Bruce Watkins Drive will open and some urban dwellers can hardly
wait. They'll be able to zip south a lot faster. But some black
residents east of the roadway feel boxed in, trapped and isolated.
They fear slowly losing touch with the heart of the city and worry
about the beginning of a new era of urban decay. Jeffrey Spivak.

   RIVER: (Brite) A couple years ago the U.S. Postal Service
promised the tiny town of Riverside it could have its very own zip

But now the Postal Service says zip to a new zip code and the
friendly folks of Riverside are really PO'ed _ and that doesn't
stand for Post Office. Bill Graham. 12. Photo.

 By PETER RADETSKY  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Istitute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,
the breast milk induced these cancer cells to take their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Could the discovery be developed into a cancer cure?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, much of Svanborg's work has prepared her for this
specific research. She and her group had studied the nature and
function of epithelial cells, the gut-lining cells that come into
contact with breast milk in nursing infants. And they had
experimented with mother's milk many times.
</P>
<P>
   They had shown that it does a terrific job of blocking infection
by pneumococcus bacteria, the cause of pneumonia, and that
breast-fed children suffer significantly fewer ear and upper
respiratory tract infections than babies who don't nurse.
</P>
<P>
   And her team had already done much of the homework that would be
needed. They had tracked down studies showing that breast milk also
protects against cancer. She wondered what accounted for that
discrepancy. Now she had at hand the results that might provide an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than two years before her team felt ready to share
its discovery with the rest of the world. In August 1995 they
announced that breast milk kills cancer cells and pinpointed the
killer, which turned out to be the protein alpha-lactalbumin
(alpha-lac for short). It helps produce lactose, the sugar found in
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Svanborg and her colleagues discovered that the protein was
performing the decidedly unprotein-like trick of changing its shape
_ and that it was persuading cancer cells to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also suggested a possible explanation of how
breast milk protects against cancer. Perhaps, Svanborg reasoned,
the errant cells that give rise to malignancies first show up in
infants. The key is breakneck reproduction, a characteristic of the
cells lining an infant's gut. Some of these cells may proliferate
out of control. That's called cancer. Or they may never fully
mature or stabilize, lurking in the system like time bombs, ever
ready to burst forth into tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Transformed alpha-lac ``targets not only cancer cells but all
kinds of immature, rapidly growing cells, and leaves mature, stable
cells alone,'' Svanborg says.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-lac, then, may be conducting surveillance missions within
the nursing child, rooting out potentially malignant cells and
encouraging properly growing cells to mature. Because the lining of
the gut, a prime meeting point between the inside of the body and
the hazards of the outside world, is a headquarters of the immune
system, the vigilance may help the child's immune defenses develop.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, a vice president of grants at the American Cancer
Society, took notice. After reading the Svanborg team's research
paper, he made a journey to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not known of Lund University before, but we found
Catharina and her team to be very talented researchers, very
dedicated, and their work fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   A $200,000 grant made Svanborg's the only non-American lab with
ACS support. So she got back to work with renewed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grant gave us recognition,'' Svanborg says. ``We came into
this from nowhere, and the cancer society gave us the stamp of
quality. Now the weight was on us to prove that this is real and
reproducible.''
</P>
<P>
   That effort has taken another four years. In January, Svanborg
released the team's most recent findings, bolstered by the work of
new collaborators, including researchers from the renowned
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and Oxford University in England.
</P>
<P>
   The studies explain how transformed alpha-lac snuffs out cancer
and other risky cells, and characterizes the protein down to the
molecular level. And they announced that not only does it kill
cells, it eliminates pneumococcus bacteria, too. Svanborg, with her
longstanding interest in infectious disease, is as excited about
this finding as any. She envisions using alpha-lac as a tonic to
stop infections before they begin.
</P>
<P>
   The team has given the new protein a name: HAMLET for Human
Alpha-lactalbumin Made LEthal to Tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   They now know just how the protein changes into a cancer
assassin. One key is the acid content of its surroundings. When
Svanborg initially prepared milk to pour over cells, she added acid
to the solution, hoping to separate out the microbe blockers.
Little did she know that this acid bath, like some magic potion,
would transform the well-mannered alpha-lac into HAMLET.
</P>
<P>
   But acid alone wasn't enough. Another mysterious factor was
needed. That, too, turned out to be a component of the milk itself.
(The lab has not yet made its identity public).
</P>
<P>
   Now that the team can generate genetically engineered HAMLET,
they can make changes in it, helping them learn the function of its
structural parts.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to test HAMLET as a tumor killer in animals.
Svanborg and her team hope that because HAMLET is a naturally
occurring substance, it might not be toxic like so many other
cancer drugs. They've already tried it in mice, who tolerate very
high doses with no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   If animal tests go well, the next trials will be with humans.
That can take years. And then, Svanborg says, ``A major
pharmaceutical company must become convinced that this is worth
their investment. But if we can demonstrate that HAMLET works, I
think no major company would be able to refuse.''

<P>
   When Catharina Svanborg and her research associates began mixing
mothers' milk and cancer cells together seven years ago, she wasn't
looking for a cure for cancer; she was after a way to fight germs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the physician and immunologist at Lund University
in Sweden has discovered that a previously taken-for-granted
component of ordinary human breast milk compels cancer cells _
every type of cancer cell tested _ to die.
</P>
<P>
   Now Svanborg must prove her discovery, demonstrating to wary
scientists that her surprising find is for real. So far, it hasn't
been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely important observation, interesting and
provocative,'' says breast-cancer researcher David Salomon of the
National Cancer Institute. ``But it's novel, and novelty always
runs the risk of challenging the current dogma. A lot of times you
run up against a brick wall of people who have tunnel vision.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began seven years ago, when her student Anders Hakansson
rushed into Svanborg's office with perplexing news. He had been
experimenting with human cancer cells, microbes and mothers' milk.
(Cancer cells make popular experimental models because they come in
standardized lab strains. In many important respects they behave
just like other human cells in lab dishes.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to pinpoint how the milk blocks bacteria from
infecting other cells. But the cancer cells in this experiment were
acting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their volume was decreasing,'' Hakansson recalls. ``Their
nuclei were shrinking. Something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Svanborg sat down at the microscope, she diagnosed the
problem immediately. ``The cancer cells are committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Cells commit suicide all the time, a phenomenon called
apoptosis, in which the body rids itself of old or unnecessary
cells. They simply fall apart and are recycled.
</P>
<P>
   For cancer cells, however, suicide is rare indeed. Their
defining characteristic is uncontrolled reproduction. Yet somehow,

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Ever wonder how Post-it notes work?
</P>
<P>
   How about Scotch tape?
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of secrets about adhesives. One is the
chemical and industrial recipes for how to make the best ones.
</P>
<P>
   The other kind of secret is the deeper kind: the physical
mechanism that explains how adhesives work. No one really knows
that secret, surprisingly enough _ maybe not even 3M, the
manufacturer Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age when everything from space-shuttle engines to
disposable diapers are strewn with adhesives. Yet we still don't
know exactly what makes them stick.
</P>
<P>
   Or do we? A couple of French physicists have recently come up
with a new idea. Their hypothesis applies especially to adhesives
like those used in Scotch tape and Post-its, the kind that stick
immediately when you push them against a surface. (Glues, which
have to dry to become sticky and, in the process, undergo a
physical or chemical transformation, are a whole different kettle
of polymers.)
</P>
<P>
   The key to pressure-sensitive adhesives, say Ludwik Leibler and
Cyprien Gay, are bubbles: microscopic bits of partial vacuum that
act like suction cups to keep the sticky stuff stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The lab Leibler directs and Gay works at resides at Elf Atochem,
another of the world's leading adhesive manufacturers. But the two
physicists are also affiliated with the French National Center for
Scientific Research, which explains why they have the leisure time
to look into the basic physics of adhesion.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that nothing is known about the subject, Gay says.
Researchers discovered more than a century ago that there was an
electrostatic attraction, called the van der Waals force, between
any two surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Positively charged particles on one surface tend to be attracted
to negatively charged particles on the other, with the result that
the two surfaces as a whole attract each other. Press your finger
flat against the surface of a table and then pull it away: the
slight stick is the van der Waals force.
</P>
<P>
   But it is very slight. The van der Waals force is roughly a ten-
thousandth of the force exerted by an everyday tape. Adhesives have
something else going for them: They are all made of polymers.
</P>
<P>
   Polymers are chain molecules, like spaghetti, except that
relative to their own diameter they are even longer than spaghetti
strands. And, like spaghetti, they get tangled up.
</P>
<P>
   Polymer adhesives are viscoelastic. It takes a lot of work to
pull them apart _ about 100 times, physicists have calculated, what
it would take to unstick something held by van der Waals attraction
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that even the aforementioned hundredfold increase
cannot completely explain the stickiness of real adhesives. This
has been brought home to researchers in the past decade, as they
have now learned how to measure stickiness precisely.
</P>
<P>
   In such experiments, a surface is coated with an adhesive, a
metal probe is pressed against the adhesive, and the probe is then
pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

pulled away. It's like using your finger to see if a surface is
sticky, only the laboratory apparatus is sensitive enough to
measure precisely what force the probe has to exert to pull away at
a steady speed.
</P>
<P>
   To break free of a good adhesive, it turns out, a probe or a
finger typically has to give a brief hard yank at first, followed
by a long, steady, but less forceful pull _ that is, the force
curve shows a sharp peak and then a long plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have had no good explanation for this familiar
pattern, Gay says. Nor could they explain why the overall adhesion
energy should be so much larger than that accounted for by van der
Waals and viscoelastic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``With viscoelasticity you get about a hundred times more than
from the van der Waals force alone,'' Gay says. ``But if you
actually measure the energy of an adhesive, you get something
10,000 times more. That's the great problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, physicists are missing a factor of 100; they
understand only about 1 percent of the reason why Scotch tape
sticks as well as it does.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler and Gay think bubbles may account for the other 99
percent. The bubbles arise because the surface of Scotch or any
other tape is not as smooth as it looks to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   Under a microscope the adhesive becomes a rugged landscape of
mountains a few ten-thousandths of an inch high, separated by val
leys a few thousandths of an inch across.
</P>
<P>
   When a metal probe presses down onto that landscape, the
mountains and the passes between them come into contact with the
metal _ but not the floors of the valleys. Lens-shaped bubbles of
air get trapped there, like patches of ground fog.
</P>
<P>
   When the probe is pulled away again, those bubbles swell in
volume. At first the passes are still blocked, and no air can
parent than the physics. flow into them from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Because the same amount of air is now filling a bigger volume,
the pressure inside the bubbles falls much lower than it is outside
_ just like in a suction cup.
</P>
<P>
   Picture thousands of tiny suction cups gripping a surface as you
try to rip off a recalcitrant strip of duct or packing tape: This
is the peak of the adhesive's force curve. As you keep pulling,
though, the bubbles widen and start to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all the valleys are connected to one another and to the
outside,'' Gay says, ``and the air comes rushing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The nontechnical term for this moment is ``pop.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air-filled valleys continue to grow, the shrinking
mountains of adhesive become islands that soon stretch into long
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The fibers still cling to the surface, in Leibler and Gay's
model, thanks to a second population of bubbles _ the ones that
form in the tiny valleys on the surface of the metal probe, which
isn't smooth either. Only when those bubbles pop, too, or the
viscoelastic fibers snap in the middle, does the adhesive
relinquish its grip.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has reason to be proud of his bubble theory, Ludwik
Leibler can step back from his work and see the big picture:
``People have made very good adhesives without understanding
bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.

HONG KONG CHIEF CONFIDENT ABOUT ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Asia is bouncing back, the return of Hong Kong
to China is going fine, and the former British colony is
positioning itself as a technology mecca even as it aggressively
expands traditional bases such as shipping.
</P>
<P>
   That was the reassuring message delivered by Tung Chee-hwa,
chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, who visited the San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday and
Thursday, said he was cautiously optimistic about the recovery from
the Asian financial crisis that began 2 years ago with a meltdown
in currencies and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is behind us,'' he said, referring to Hong Kong,
which became a part of China in 1997 after more than 150 years of
British control. Property prices have stabilized after falling 50
percent, and unemployment has dropped from 6.3 percent in the first
quarter to 6.1 percent in the second. Unemployment was just 2
percent in 1997 before the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a recovery is slowly on its way,'' Tung said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech co-sponsored by the Commonwealth Club, the World
Affairs Council, Hong Kong Trade Development Council and other Bay
Area organizations, Tung on Wednesday said Hong Kong was
negotiating with the Walt Disney Co. to develop a new theme park,
pushing ahead with plans for a high-tech industrial park and
expanding its already bustling seaport.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998,'' he said, ``our container port was the second
busiest in the world. The private sector has committed about $1.3
billion to build new container terminals, which will increase
capacity by approximately 25 percent by 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade is the lifeblood of Hong Kong, which ranked ninth in the
world as a trading entity in 1998, according to the Hong Kong
Economic &AMP; Trade Office, despite having a population of just 6.7
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Tung said the Asian fiscal crisis that began in Thailand in July
1997 and raced through East Asia prompted Hong Kong to institute
tax cuts to stimulate demand. It also initiated rail, highway and
school construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the total spending in these areas alone over the next
five years will exceed $30 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these policies, Tung said, ``Staffing costs are still
being adjusted through layoffs or cuts in salary. While the painful
process is continuing, I believe our economy has bottomed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is often criticized in Hollywood and Silicon Valley
for not controlling the piracy of movies, music, videos and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong protection regime for intellectual
property rights,'' Tung said, while acknowledging, ``Obviously we
need to do more, and we will do more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai-born, a 62-year-old shipping magnate, has headed
Hong Kong's government since its return to China in 1997.

HOOKED ON THAT KENNEDY GOLD, BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hey, man. Where you been? We haven't seen you
around since Littleton _ and then you didn't hang long enough to
score your usual cache.
</P>
<P>
   You goin' to somebody else for your stuff now, or what? Come on,
man, take a sample hit of this latest goody. We call it Kennedy
Gold. It's beyond awesome. Just came in from Martha's Vineyard.
Some of the best stuff we ever deal comes from that corner of the
country. Remember?
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell us you're tryin' to kick the habit? Don't be a fool,
man. Look around. The whole nation's hooked. It's the American way,
baby. East Coast, West and all the land in between. Big city,
little town, rich folk or poor. If they got a TV set, they got a
jones for what we're peddlin'.
</P>
<P>
   This new stuff's as good as free. You don't even need cable.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, NBC and CBS got at least as much to sell as CNN or MSNBC _
so much stuff that they brought their big boys in on a Saturday to
push it. And push it and push it.
</P>
<P>
   Cogitate on it, man. Rather, Jennings and Brokaw in suits on a
summer Saturday. Pullin' 10-hour shifts like some terrorist group's
taken Disneyland hostage or blown up the space station.
</P>
<P>
   All because one good lookin' cool dude with the magic name went
into the sea in a Piper Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Trust us. This stuff's different from anything you've tried
before. This one's got it all. It's an upper, a downer, an
aphrodisiac and a hallucinogen, all rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   It's kinda like O.J. Gold, but without the racial complications.
A little like Monica Red, but with more substance _ and not as
drawn out. It's oozing with tragedy like Littleton Blue, but with
more mystery and less actual blood.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably the most like Princess Diana Platinum _ remember
how you couldn't get enough of that stuff? _ but minus the foreign
intrigue, Elton John and the photos with Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   See, the essence of this Kennedy Gold is a strong blend of
mythologizing and rank sentimentality, a combo that's pretty hard
to resist. It can get you to thinking about the big, black hole of
death then cause you to puddle up for your own lost youth. It can
keep you up nights and mess with your head, but it does it in a
kind of detached, mesmerizin' way.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, this stuff is cut with some super powerful side
substances: history, celebrity, superstition (``the family
curse''), vicarious thrills, faux intimacy, voyeurism and that
fail-safe rush, Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Just a little while on it _ say, twice through the video
collages, one family biographer and some citizen phone-ins (``He
was, like, our crowned prince'') _ and you'll swear you hung with
the good lookin' cool dude your whole life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you didn't know his birthday, his favorite music or
what made him laugh or cry, and you hadn't given him a thought for
months until his plane went down, you'll start to feel like he was
part of your own family.
</P>
<P>
   You'll say, ``I watched him grow up.'' And you'll believe you
did.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you, man, everybody loves this stuff. You walk away
from it and you're deprivin' yourself of one hell of a collective
trip. You know, ``Once again, a nation grieves as one''? It's the
ultimate hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you're sayin', man? That this stuff we're peddlin'
has trivialized the good-lookin' cool dude's life by making his
death the biggest thing about him?
</P>
<P>
   That this collective trip has turned the family with the magic
name into a kind of R. Crumb cartoon?
</P>
<P>
   That the repetitive binge of film clips, remembrances, florid
verbiage and aviation analyses has transformed even the poignant
image of a little boy's salute into an infomercial?
</P>
<P>
   Get away from here with that talk, man. You're bad for business.
You don't wanna buy what we're pushin', don't. It's a free country.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll be back. Sooner or later, everybody comes back.
</P>
<P>
   What we peddle gets into your brain, baby, and you just gotta
have it. We're all hooked; you on buyin' and us on sellin'. Can't
stop if we tried.
</P>

   The New York Times Syndicate is transmitting a TIMELY article
titled ``BEST OF FRIENDS: CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR ON JOHN F. KENNEDY
JR.,'' which was created from a transcript of the TV news show ``60
Minutes.'' The show, telecast July 18, featured an interview by
Mike Wallace with Christiane Amanpour, chief international
correspondent for CNN and special correspondent for ``60 Minutes,''
who recalled her friendship with John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Kennedy and Amanpour were students at
neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, and they became close
friends.

   From the article ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   With John, everybody has always tried to project what they think
he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable conclusion that
he will be an office holder and president of the United States, if
he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ... But, of course, whenever we asked him that question, `What
will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh, shut up,
Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that kind of
stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed himself ... to
be swept away by other people's projections and other people's
image of what he should be or what he shouldn't be.

   The New York Times Syndicate is transmitting a TIMELY article
titled ``BEST OF FRIENDS: CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR ON JOHN F. KENNEDY
JR.,'' which was created from a transcript of the TV news show ``60
Minutes.'' The show, telecast July 18, featured an interview by
Mike Wallace with Christiane Amanpour, chief international
correspondent for CNN and special correspondent for ``60 Minutes,''
who recalled her friendship with John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Kennedy and Amanpour were students at
neighboring colleges in Rhode Island, and they became close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The article is available for oneshot purchase.
</P>
<P>
   (FOR PURCHASE INFORMATION, SEE BELOW.)
</P>
<P>
   From the article ...
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE: Did the two of you ever talk about what you wanted to
be when you grew up?
</P>
<P>
   AMANPOUR: I was very clear from the beginning. I came to the
United States from Iran ... knowing that I wanted to be a foreign
correspondent. So when I came to college, I knew, and also I'm
about three years older than him so I had a much clearer idea.
</P>
<P>
   With John, everybody has always tried to project what they think
he should be. So everybody leapt to the inevitable conclusion that
he will be an office holder and president of the United States, if
he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ... But, of course, whenever we asked him that question, `What
will you be? What do you want to be?' he used to say `Oh, shut up,
Chrissy,' you know, and `I don't want to talk about that kind of
stuff.' He never sort of bought in or never allowed himself ... to
be swept away by other people's projections and other people's

PANTOMIME MASTER MARCEAU REMAINS ELASTIC, ENTERTAINING AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT HURWITT  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Age cannot wither him. It only seems to have
refined his economy of gesture and amplified the expressiveness of
his remarkably elastic face.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't slowed him down a bit. At 76, Marcel Marceau is still
taking his solo shows all over the world, still running his Ecole
Internationale de Mimodrame in Paris, still creating new ensemble
``mimodramas'' for his own company and still trying out new
creative endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, audiences on his current North American tour have
witnessed his first performance in a circus tent (in Vermont) and
his first with a live orchestra (at the Hollywood Bowl).
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at Theatre on the Square, Marceau opened his first
extended engagement in San Francisco since he played the Curran in
1984. His work isn't just as impressive as it was then. It's as
bright, funny, poignant and eye-openingly original as it seemed
some 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's also somewhat new. Marceau is performing three separate
programs of his celebrated pantomimes here, a different program for
each of the three weeks of his scheduled run. Each two-hour show
consists, as usual, of a first act of ``pantomimes of style'' and a
second act of ``pantomimes of Bip,'' the classic poignant-innocent
fool of Marceau's own creation.
</P>
<P>
   His newest creation is ``Soliloquy of Three Lost Souls.''
Cleverly constructed and performed with extraordinary clarity, it's
a sweet-and-sour mini-drama in which a desperate loser recounts his
sad tale _ wife and children and no money, leading to a failed
suicide attempt _ to two other lost souls. Each tells the man's
story back to him, with a very different emphasis, leading to an
oddly upbeat resolution.
</P>
<P>
   As with any Marceau show, you never know exactly what you're
going to get. In the past, the printed program would list over 50
routines from which Marceau would select the ones he'd perform that
night. This time, the playbill lists the specific pantomimes for
each program, but the artist may change the scheduled repertoire at
will.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's audience, for instance, was treated to an extra _
``Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death,'' one of the master mime's
great, signature routines, in which Marceau evolves through a Four
Ages of Man by deftly suggested degrees, growing in height and
aspiration and shrinking in upon himself to a final, lyrical
release.
</P>
<P>
   And each show is something of a trade-off. The upcoming Program
B is the only one that includes his cunningly contradictory ``The
Seven Deadly Sins'' mini-epic (along with ``Youth, Maturity, Old
Age and Death'' and the longtime audience favorite, ``Bip as a lion
tamer''). Program C features his celebrated ``The Creation of the
World.'' Every program contains more than enough classic Marceau
gems to satisfy the hungriest fan.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't really silent. Most of Marceau's routines are
accompanied by some recorded music or the precise sound effects
provided by his own feet. But it's all performed without words,
except for the placards announcing each scene, brandished in
presentational poses by Marceau's capable assistants, Alexander
Neander and Thorsten Rheinhold. The eloquence, which is
considerable, is all in the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The bob of a head, for example. In ``The Bird Keeper,''
Marceau's head twitches up and down as he watches a bird hop on its
perch, a movement immediately distinguishable from the way his head
bounces along to the step of a passing marching band in ``Bip as a
street musician'' _ or the way it undulates with increasing
queasiness as he gazes at the waves in ``Bip travels by sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The angle of his upper arm precisely defines the height of a
cafe counter, a painter's easel, a shop shelf or a ship's railing.
</P>
<P>
   The cock of his hip or slant of his torso seems to convey an
immediate sense of his surroundings. So precise are his movements
that an occasional lapse _ an ill-defined pool cue or haphazard
violin stroke _ is momentarily jarring, but soon forgiven. The
cumulative impact is one of astonishing artistry at the hands of a
master.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly the hands. With one gesture, they're fish swimming
past, suddenly transformed into a bird flying toward you. In ``The
Bird Keeper,'' Marceau's hands both reach for his avian captives
and become them, fluttering out his reach or nestling in his palm.
His hands pulse with the frightened or calm hearts of the birds he
holds. They define the bars of a cage and each of the objects he
picks up in a porcelain shop.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 11 routines he performed Wednesday is a tiny drama
of its own. Most are solo tales, though in ``The Small Cafe'' he
plays everyone from the harassed and overworked waiter-proprietor
to a variety of deftly caricatured customers.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``The Hands,'' the characters are the hands themselves,
angelic and diabolical sides of human nature whose conflict comes
to a fragile but optimistic resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among his characters, of course, is the eternal Bip, the
ever-hopeful everyman who maintains his sweet, innocent outlook
even through his comical failures as a street musician or porcelain
salesman. Even through one brightly macabre blunder after another
in ``Bip commits suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the great ``The Maskmaker,'' which closes Program A
(and Program C). As stunning a display of Marceau's mastery as
ever, with its lightning- quick shifts of expression as Bip tries
on one mask after another, it achieves a magnificent layering of
comedy and psychological horror when one of the masks gets stuck.
The mounting terror of a man who realizes he's trapped within a
laughing mask may be Marceau's most acute parable for our whole
age. The rest is silence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Marceau performs three separate programs of pantomimes _
Program A through July 25; Program B, July 27 through Aug. 1;
Program C, Aug. 3 through 8 _ at Theatre on the Square, 450 Post
St., San Francisco; telephone: 415-433-9500.

TRAGEDY IN THE AIR: A PILOT'S VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Ken Hamblin's
weekly column of political commentary.)
 For release: Thurs., July 22 or thereafter  
 By KEN HAMBLIN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The plane that disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean near Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., evoked many sad echoes, carrying with it as it did
the lives of its 38-year-old pilot, John F. Kennedy Jr., his
33-year-old wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister,
35-year-old Lauren Bessette, on the night of Friday, July 16.
 &HT;    Rescue and recovery teams were still searching the waters on the
early hours of July 18, three decades to the day after a car driven
by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D.-Mass.) plunged off a bridge on
Chappaquiddick Island, near Martha's Vineyard. His passenger,
28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned.
 &HT;    A sad coincidence? Or another installment of some curse on the
Kennedy clan, seemingly plagued by death and tragedy? The media,
needless to say, didn't miss a beat in suggesting the latter.
 &HT;    But while they and the more superstitious among us were
pondering the supernatural implications of a Kennedy curse, the
real story about how and why that plane went down was being all but
ignored.
 &HT;    It has been reported that John Kennedy Jr. had completed only 46
hours of flight time since receiving his solo license in April of
last year. If this or any similar number is accurate, it's
appalling to me _ not as a commentator or a columnist, but as a
longtime pilot of private aircraft, some not dissimilar to the one
Kennedy was flying.
 &HT;    It was common knowledge that Kennedy, a low-time private pilot,
usually flew with a flight instructor on his trips to Martha's
Vineyard. The area is noted for its unstable weather conditions _ I
flew there myself not long ago, though in a safer double-engine
aircraft _ and can be tricky even for an experienced pilot.
 &HT;    In particular, the region often develops hazy conditions around
dusk. Kennedy took off from Fairfield, N.J. around 8:30 p.m., and
his plane apparently vanished from radar screens at 9:38.
 &HT;    Already a relatively inexperienced pilot, Kennedy also was
flying an unfamiliar plane _ he'd purchased it only in April _
working without a flight plan and on crutches due to a broken foot,
any of which would by itself be a potential hazard, but all of
which collectively constitute conditions under which I myself would
simply refuse to fly.
 &HT;    Actually, the crash is tragic but hardly unique _ statistics for
aviation-accident trends and causes suggest that adverse weather
conditions combined with pilot error are the biggest factors in
fatalities.
 &HT;    According to the Nall Report, a study of 1997 aviation accidents
commissioned by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air
Safety Foundation, it is rare for weather itself to destroy an
aircraft.
 &HT;    ``Most accidents involving weather were the result of controlled
flight into terrain or other objects, spatial disorientation
leading to uncontrolled flight, or pilot-induced structural failure
of the aircraft,'' the report says. ``The high-impact forces made
weather accidents some of the deadliest of all.''
 &HT;    Let others natter on about Kennedy curses or inexplicable
tragedies. Combining the facts of the Kennedy crash with the cold
statistical information conveyed by the Nall Report, I see this
story as one of a thoroughly human, highly preventable tragedy
involving one man's failure to respect the sky and the hazards it
holds.
 &HT;    I have always said that what I love most about flying is that it
can kill you. It doesn't mean zilch if you're as famous as the
Kennedys or as obscure as a church mouse when you pull back the
yoke and retract the wheels.
 &HT;    All men _ and, yes, all women _ are created equal in the pilot's
seat.
 &HT;    That's why I've never gotten into an airplane without carefully
inspecting it, thoroughly reviewing the entire series of
pre-takeoff procedures and, if necessary, repeating them until I'm
convinced that both the airplane and I are ready to fly.
 &HT;    It's why I'm particularly careful whenever I'm in a hurry,
tired, anxious to get home or otherwise more likely than usual to
cut a few corners in my eagerness to get into the air. It's why I
never fly on a schedule, never commit myself to arriving in a
particular place at a particular time, regardless of what weather
conditions or other hazards I may encounter along the way.
 &HT;    Have I lost a lot of time on unnecessary precautions which I
gladly would have spent relaxing at home? Absolutely.
 &HT;    But just maybe one of those precautions _ who can say which one?
_ is the reason I'm still around to talk about it.
 &HT;    As unfair as it may seem, in aviation the proficient prevail.
Eulogies are written for those who venture in over their heads.
 &HT;    To that end, I suggest that the real tragedy of the crash of
that plane may have been the deaths of two women who gambled
everything on the aviation skills of John F. Kennedy Jr. ...
gambled and lost.

LIFE ON `BONAROO' AND OTHER PRISON BIPPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAYNE WOLFE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every wonder just what you risk when you bet
your ``bippy?'' Go ahead and bet. A bippy is just a paper cone of
cleansing fluid used to spiff up your cell.
</P>
<P>
   American slang comes from many sources. High on the source list
are sports, bars and jails. In my neck of the woods, San Quentin
slang is known for its spiciness, rhythm and punch.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in the New York Times, one in every 150
American citizens is behind bars, triple the number of prisoners in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   By New Year's Eve, the prison population will reach nearly 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Could a cell be under construction for you? You say you didn't
fiddle with your tax filings (much), drive tipsily or insult your
in-laws? Well, many minor breaches of the law now have mandatory
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   It's always good to be prepared, especially if you're no Boy
Scout. So, here's your chance to bone up on prison lingo.
</P>
<P>
   If a judge and jury are in your future, feel free to take this
mini-tutorial on prison slang.
</P>
<P>
   If your ``bunkie'' (cellmate) offers to throw you a ``blanket
party,'' try to contain your glee. You're in for a beating.
</P>
<P>
   If you're concerned about the fellow you will be spending ``all
day'' with (a life sentence), ask a ``badge'' (a corrections
officer) who might explain that your bunkie is a ``5150.'' No, he's
not incredibly fat and tall; 5150 is police code for a person
needing mental health treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention. Soon enough, you'll recognize ``cheese eaters''
or what James Cagney used to call a ``dirty rat,'' an informer. And
you'll soon realize that there aren't an amazing number of guys
named Chester in prison. A ``chester'' is a child molester.
</P>
<P>
   More slang from ``Q''? How about ``walkalones'' _ prisoners
banned from exercising with others?
</P>
<P>
   What should you do if a ``fogline'' is announced? Head back to
your cell. When low mist hangs in the yard obscuring sight lines,
the guards get nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you'll attain a personal goal as you complete your
sentence. If so, you may hear one of the rarest words in San
Quentin's lexicon. ``Bonaroo'' is the ultimate kudo, meaning _
simply the best.
</P>
<P>
   This word morphed from the French Canadian phrase, bonne rue,
which originally meant ``good street'' and came to signify a type
of easy street, or cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   While national crime figures fall, the population continues to
grow in prisons. A special vocabulary is required. Be prepared.

UMASS PAIR GETS BACK TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ They aren't the fixtures they were at the University
of Massachusetts. Those days are long gone for Edgar Padilla and
Carmelo Travieso. They are spare parts here, trying as best they
can to hold together Puerto Rico's hopes in this final men's
basketball pre-qualifier for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither starts. Both average around 15 minutes a game and it can
be quality time, depending on the flow. Padilla is averaging a
scant 1.8 points but also a team-high 3.5 assists. Travieso hasn't
lost his affinity for shooting (he has yet to get to the free throw
line in 72 minutes) and is averaging 6.4 points a game, fifth
highest on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla is still trying to get back into playing shape, having
been idle for six weeks in the Superior League season here when he
refused to accept a trade from Isabela to Aibonito. He subsequently
ended up with Guaynabo. Travieso just got back from six months in
the pit of the New York Mercantile Exchange, selling futures. He
was a late add-on when another player came up injured. He plays for
Morovis in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   While they play on different club teams, and sometimes even in
different countries, they remain forever linked by their birthdate
(May 9, 1975 for both), their UMass days, and yet another stint on
the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep in touch as much as we can,'' Padilla said prior to
the team's huge game with the United States. ``But when he was in
New York, I was (playing) in Poland. We don't see that much of each
other, but here we are again.''
</P>
<P>
   They were teammates in the last Olympiad, but neither remembers
the experience with any degree of fondness. They rarely played. The
team was 2-5 and finished 10th. Travieso played on the Puerto Rican
team last summer in the World Championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, things are different. The team hired a new
coach after a disappointing loss earlier this year in a tournament
in Cuba. Julio Toro is widely regarded as the best coach on the
island. In 20 years of coaching, he has had 12 champions. He also
had a stint as the national coach of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, that was a tough situation with the coach,'' Padilla
said. ``It wasn't good for me or Carmelo. Now, it's totally
different. The atmosphere is different because of the coach. He is
the best coach in Puerto Rico by far. It's like comparing Pat Riley
to a high school coach. The team is playing loose, there's no
negative stuff, and for me and Carmelo, it's good because he likes
our game, the way we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Travieso, ``I like this team a lot better because the coach
gives us more opportunities to do what we do best.''
</P>
<P>
   They were, of course, almost automatic in Amherst. The team won.
They played all the time, or so it seemed. As juniors, they helped
lead the Minutemen to that storybook, 35-2 season and a spot in the
Final Four. They stuck around for another year after John Calipari
and Marcus Camby left for the NBA and the riches it inevitably
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Both players said they got a kick out of watching the
rejuvenated Camby play so well during the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really happy for him,'' Travieso said. ``I always had
confidence in him. I knew how good he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched every game. I played with him for three years and I
knew his capabilities had not come out,'' Padilla said. ``I knew he
belonged in that league. I knew he could score, they just didn't
run any plays for him. Hopefully, this will give him the confidence
he needs to take it to another level, which I think he has the
skills to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There is inherent pressure on the locals to avoid the US in
Saturday's semifinal game because the two winners that day get
automatic berths in the 2000 Olympics. This is the last
international fling for many longtime members of the Puerto Rican
team, including Jose Ortiz, who briefly played for the Utah Jazz,
and, possibly, Jerome Mincy, who played collegiately at
Alabama-Birmingham in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For Padilla and Travieso, however, the basketball will go on.
Padilla, whose wife has two years remaining in law school in Ponce,
said he hopes to play next season either in Spain or England.
Travieso said he, too, was considering playing overseas, but also
wanted to keep a hand in high finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent six months at the exchange,'' he said. ``I was putting
my finance degree to good use. I was a clerk, learning the ropes. I
like numbers, finance. I always wanted to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only numbers that count are the ones on the
scoreboard here at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Padilla and
Travieso are looking forward to the sold-out game against the
United States. ``It should be fun,'' Travieso said.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid is that they don't want to see the US on Saturday.
That would mean they'd have to win to gain an Olympic berth. Even
more disturbing, it would also signal an end to a disappointing
performance in the tournament their country hosted, one the players
fully expected to use as a steppingstone to Sydney.

CLARE CHIEF SEES PROFIT JUST AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To date the technology boom seems to have bypassed
electronics-maker CP Clare Corp. of Beverly, Mass., which lost $5.6
million after charges last year and has reported just break-even
results lately.
</P>
<P>
   But wait till next year, says Clare chief executive Arthur
Buckland _ because several big bets he's made are about to pay off.
By June of 2000, Buckland says, he hopes to restore the company's
profitability and move it toward a goal of selling $500 million
worth of chips by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stumbled a couple of times as we brought it up to
speed,'' Buckland explained. But now, he added, ``We're really on
the threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics may need some convincing _ Clare's shares closed at 7
1/16 Wednesday, just 27 percent of their high of 25 3/4 three years
ago. On the other hand, the stock has doubled since June on
Buckland's decision to sell a big factory in Guadalajara, Mexico,
to Sumida Electric Co. for $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   The factory accounted for about a third of Clare's sales of
$143.9 million for the 12 months that ended March 28, but faced
increased competition from Asian producers. The transaction will
leave Clare with about $40 million in cash for future acquisitions
_ a reserve roughly equal to Clare's entire market value last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Buckland also boasts of pushing out five vice presidents for
annual savings of $2 million, and of spending $25 million to build
a new chip-fabrication plant in Beverly, replacing an older
facility in Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic moves are meant to help Clare specialize on
supplying analog semiconductors and mixed-signal circuits, for
devices like mobile phones and hearing aides. Previously, Clare
workers in the Guadalajara plant coiled wires to make
electro-magnetic parts.
</P>
<P>
   Total employment will decline to 400 from 1,600 Thursday (July
22) after Clare completes the sale, but it won't affect Clare's 300
employees in Massachusetts, up from 200 two years ago. Another 100
employees are in Southern California and in St. Louis, where Clare
makes switches for flip-open mobile phones by Nokia, Samsung and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, Clare's focus on making more complex parts
should improve profit margins, Buckland said. ``We're not a
manual-labor company anymore,'' Buckland says. ``We can't be if
we're going to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say they are wary of the ambitious agenda, because Clare
has promised much in the past. ``To date the management team hasn't
delivered, and it's critical to get the problems fixed,'' said one
institutional shareholder, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
said he will be watching closely the company's earnings, due out
after the close of trading Thursday. Said Mark Grossman of SG Cowen
&AMP; Co., one of the few analysts still following Clare, ``There's a
potential for them to turn things around by 2000, but I think
they're in for another few quarters of tough business.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman rates Clare as ``neutral'' but adds that ``Given where
their stock is now, if they just show some signs of a turnaround
there's a lot of of upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Clare has gone through several iterations since it was founded
in 1937 by midwestern engineer Carl P. Clare to supply relay
circuits, many of which were used in military aircraft engines
during World War II. Originally based in Chicago, from 1967 through
1989 the company operated as a unit of the General Instrument
Corp., then became independent and moved its headquarters to
Massachusetts following a leveraged buyout in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Buckland, a former vice-president at electronics giant
Schlumberger Ltd., was named chief executive in 1993 and oversaw an
initial public offering of stock in 1995 to pay down debt.
(Buckland, who earned $563,696 in salary and bonus for the 12
months ended in June, 1998, now owns about 6 percent of Clare's
shares).
</P>
<P>
   Under Buckland, the company's sales grew steadily to $156
million in fiscal 1998, from $96 million in fiscal 1995, as
customers like Motorola Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. ordered up
its chips for applications like plug-in modems to connect laptop
computers over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   But profits failed to keep pace, partly as laptop makers turned
to built-in, internal modems, and Clare reporting a $5.6 million
loss in 1999. Damage also stemmed from quality problems as Clare
moved workers from Wakefield into the Beverly facility. Worried
about their supplies, customers including 3Com Corp. began to buy
chips from competing vendors, putting more pressure on prices.
Sales also fell to $143.9 million in fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Buckland says the company has improved operations and at least
one major customer, computer-modem maker Xircom Inc. of Thousand
Oaks, Calif., says it plans to keep Clare as its sole supplier for
certain chips _ and to increase orders from its current level of $7
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``CP has done a reasonable job at cost reductions,'' says Xircom
vice president Sam Bass. He says Clare charges relatively low
prices in the competitive market, making its parts ``a best
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Clare needs enough orders to keep employees busy at its new
local plant. Facilities built by giant chip-makers like Intel Corp.
often run at 80 or 90 percent of the maximum capacity, but the
Beverly plant now operates below 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clare says it will find work by offering the facility as a
foundry to make chips designed by other companies. It isn't as
profitable as selling its own designs, admits Bill Reed, Clare's
vice president of sales and marketing, but the plant didn't cost so
much to begin with. ``Just a little bit more in there and we're
rocking and rolling!'' Reed said.

 &HT;    Crown it as spoof of beauty contests
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking aim at the equivalent of a manicured sitting duck, ``Drop
Dead Gorgeous'' is a cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty
pageants.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new target, having been roasted in 1975's
``Smile.'' But the movie's real inspiration seems to be the 1993
cable flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom'' with Holly Hunter. Except for the
switch from cheerleading to beauty pageant, the plot of
``Gorgeous'' is similar, though its jokes and performances are much
broader than those in ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   In small-town Mount Rose, Minn., contestants for the Sarah Rose
Miss Teen Princess America Pageant have a way of having unexpected
accidents, including immolation in tractor explosions and
concussions from falling stage lights.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious culprits are rich girl Becky Leeman (Denise
Richards) and her stage-mother mom, Gladys (Kirstie Alley). Becky's
main (thus, most endangered) rival for the pageant crown is Amber
Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), who lives in a trailer park with her
white-trash mother, Annette (Ellen Barkin), but dreams of making it
into broadcasting, like Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorgeous'' stoops to obvious sight gags: A contestant
practices her tap-dance routine beside a corpse (she works in a
funeral home). Another sings ``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You'' to a
life-size Jesus doll.
</P>
<P>
   The previous year's pageant winner makes her farewell tour
onstage in a wheelchair because her quest for beauty has turned her
into a hollow-cheeked anorexic.
</P>
<P>
   If the comedy is less than subtle and often cruel, it happily
reduces the rites of beauty pageants to a suitable level of
absurdity. The contestants' talent competition includes a
performance of dog barks, a dramatic speech from ``Soylent Green''
and the deathlessly awful song ``Through the Eyes of Love''
performed in sign language.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's unevenness is somewhat covered by the energetic
young cast, including Brittany Murphy as the only contestant with
enough sense not to take the pageant seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The adults include big Will Sasso of ``Mad TV'' as a sweet,
mentally challenged pageant judge and the invaluable Allison Janney
as a trailer-park neighbor who describes Amber as the ``most
smartest'' in her class.
</P>
<P>
   Barkin gets woozily submerged in her role, playing most of her
scenes with a beer can fused to her hand. Alley comes in as a
distant runner-up, never moving beyond shrill, TV-style
play-acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley and Ellen
Barkin. Rated PG-13 for irreverent and crude humor, sex-related
material and language. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A mean-spirited but often funny spoof of beauty
pageants.

FIRM'S REMOTE-CONTROL CAMERA WAS KEY TO DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searchers found the plane and bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren _ a discovery
many had likened to finding a needle in a haystack _ using a
remote-controlled, camera-equipped vehicle made by a Falmouth,
Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   The box-like vehicle, operated from the surface and equipped
with propellers, lights, cameras, sonar, and a robotic arm, was
sent down late Tuesday night off Martha's Vineyard to investigate a
sonar target. It found an 8- to 10-foot section of Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, all still inside the fuselage, were positively
identified by divers Wednesday morning, said Rear Admiral Richard
Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Several technologies were used to find the plane. Radar data
analysis helped locate where the plane went down and sonar surveys
of the seabed in that area identified items that didn't seem to
belong there.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's remote-controlled vehicle, manufactured by Benthos
Inc. of Falmouth, made it possible to explore likely sonar targets
easier and faster. Divers had been hampered by low visibility and
strong currents.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos officials said their remote-operated vehicles are
capable of generating high-quality pictures and video that can not
only help locate items on the sea bottom but aid in their salvage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer than sending a diver down and it's usually a lot
faster,'' said John Coughlin, president of Benthos.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee, who directed the search, said the vehicle was also
sent down with the divers Wednesday and its lights aided them in
their work. He declined to say how the bodies were brought to the
surface Wednesday afternoon, but said it was done in a way that
``respected the situation we were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Benthos vehicles were used in the search for wreckage from the
Swissair flight that went down off of Nova Scotia last year, and
from TWA flight 800, which fell to the sea off of Long Island in
1996. A Benthos vehicle was also used in 1994 to search the Quincy
quarries for a missing student from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are relatively small and operate much like
the robot vehicle used in the movie ``Titanic'' in the simulated
exploration of the sunken ship. The operator pilots the vehicle
using a joy stick and watching a TV monitor hooked up to the
vehicle's cameras. The vehicle is linked to its operator by a
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said his company's vehicles are most often purchased by
oil and gas companies, underwater construction firms, and nuclear
power plants. He said the equipment is useful in monitoring
underwater equipment or construction, as well as for research and
archeological work.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos makes two models that often operate in tandem. One is
about 5 feet long, weighs 700 pounds, and is capable of carrying
lots of equipment, said company spokesman Peter Zentz. The other is
about 4 feet long, weighs about 50 pounds, and is used for quick
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy purchased its Benthos vehicles around 1993, Zentz said.
The vehicles cost anywhere from $50,000 to $1 million, depending on
what additional equipment is added. Zentz said the larger vehicle
purchased by the Navy cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are currently capable of descending to
depths of 5,000 feet, but the company is preparing to unveil one
that will dive to 10,000 feet. Kennedy's plane was found at a depth
of 116 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos is a publicly traded company with 110 employees and $14
million in revenues. It was founded by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology graduate Sam Raymond.

AN APPEALS COURT SEES SCHOOL PRAYER AS A RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)

Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A U.S. Court of Appeals, one step down from the Supreme Court,
affirmed last week the right of students to pray ''aloud in a
classroom, over the public address system, or as part of a program
in school-related assemblies and at sporting events, or at a
graduation ceremony.''
 &HT;    It is an astonishing ruling, surely the most important about
school prayer since school-sponsored prayer was declared
unconstitutional almost four decades ago.
 &HT;    The court even said, ''`Cleansing' our public schools of all
religious expression ... inevitably results in the `establishment
of disbelief -- atheism -- as the State's religion. Since the
Constitution requires neutrality, it cannot be the case that
government may prefer disbelief over religion.''
 &HT;    The decision does define some limits. Only students can initiate
the prayer, not teachers or administrators. The original 1962
Supreme Court decision declared that a school board may not
constitutionally write and require students to recite a prayer.
When the state commands religious speech, it violates the First
Amendment's prohibition of ''an establishment of religion.''
 &HT;    However, the First Amendment also says Congress can make no law
''prohibiting the free exercise'' of religion. Therefore, the
Supreme Court has also ruled that students have a right to organize
Bible studies using school facilities, as does any other
extracurricular group. There are at least 10,000 student-initiated
Bible studies or prayer groups in public high schools.
 &HT;    In between the extremes of government-mandated prayer and
private student prayer is a gray area -- the right of students to
initiate prayer at events that are mandatory for other students,
such as a graduation ceremony.
 &HT;    Alabama's Legislature passed a law in 1993 which permitted
''non-sectarian, non-proselytizing student-initiated voluntary
prayer, invocation and/or benedictions'' during ''compulsory or
non-compulsory school-rated student assemblies'' or other events.
 &HT;    The Alabama law, publicly supported by former governor Fob
James, was challenged in DeKalb County by a retired vice principal
named Michael Chandler, and his son, Jesse, who were backed by the
ACLU and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
 &HT;    They contended that when the State permits students to speak
religiously in situations that are not purely private, the State
lends its imprimatur to the speech, thereby endorsing or advancing
religion in violation of the ''obligation of the public schools to
provide a religiously neutral environment.''
 &HT;    Therefore, they said, schools must forbid all public religious
speech in school, including genuinely student-initiated speech.
 &HT;    The court disagreed with the right of the school to censor
student speech if it is religious: ''The suppression of
student-initiated religious speech is neither necessary to do, nor
does it achieve constitutional neutrality toward religion.''
Indeed, it demonstrates ''hostility toward religion.''
 &HT;    ''The prohibition of all religious speech in our public schools
implies, therefore, an unconstitutional DISAPPROVAL of religion...
Permitting students to speak religiously signifies neither state
approval nor disapproval of that speech. The speech is not the
State's -- either by attribution or by adoption,'' said the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals..
 &HT;    It cited an ''unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all
three branches of government of the role of religion in American
life from at least 1789.'' There's a law that put this national
motto on our currency: ''In God We Trust,'' and the phrase ''one
nation under God,'' which is part of the Pledge of Allegiance
recited by millions of school children daily.
 &HT;    Congress opens with a prayer and the Supreme Court hears
arguments in a chamber decorated with a depiction of Moses and the
Ten Commandments. The president proclaims a ''National Day of
Prayer'' each year.
 &HT;    The recent decision applies only to Alabama, since it was based
on that state's law. However, the court decision will surely
inspire similar laws in other states to permit prayer in school, as
long as it is initiated by students, and not by the school
administration or teachers.
 &HT;    One footnote of the case argues that the ''Constitution probably
does not require'' a ''wall of separation between church and
state,'' a phrase lifted from a letter by Thomas Jefferson, ''who
was neither present when the First Amendment was passed nor
consulted about its language.''
 &HT;    Chief Justice William Rehnquist is quoted as acknowledging with
''embarrassing candor'' that the ''wall'' is merely a ''blurred,
indistinct and variable barrier,'' which ''is not wholly accurate''
and can only be dimly perceived.''
 &HT;    What a refreshing decision! Credit must be given to Jay Sekulow
of the Christian ACLJ (American Center for Law and Justice) for
making a better case than the ACLU.

IN GROWING RASPBERRIES, PRUNING'S THE KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raspberries are one of the most expensive fruits to buy. The
reason is they are so perishable and have to be harvested promptly
and gently as soon as they ripen. Fortunately, this is not a
problem when the crop is conveniently handy in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback to growing raspberries in the garden is that
they make a messy looking clump, yet small perennial fruits are the
most productive crop for the work involved.
</P>
<P>
   For an ever-repeating happy harvest in a permanent raspberry
patch, choose a sunny spot at the back of your lot, where the
messiness won't bother you. Prepare a linear bed about 3 to 4 feet
wide and as long as you choose. Dig in manure and good stuff now,
maybe plant summer vegetables like kale, lettuce, mesclun, and
beans or grow baby carrots and beets for a fall crop.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberries are planted in early spring, and it takes two to
three years for them to become well established and productive.
After that, it's just a bowl of berries for the picking, about a
pint per row foot. And it can go on forever if it's properly pruned
and modestly tended.
</P>
<P>
   The real trick to growing raspberries (which are closely related
to roses) is to know what kind you have and how to prune them.
There are two basic kinds: summer bearing and fall bearing.
</P>
<P>
   --Summer bearing. These include Titan and many old-fashioned New
England ones and produce berries in July on overwintered stems that
grew up the year before. After they fruit, the stems die back and
never have a crop again. So pruning means cutting off the spent
stems (which are tan and crackled) at ground level as soon as they
finish bearing. Or whenever you get around to it, but ideally
during the summer. The new green shoots, which start in late June,
are left to grow tall, for they will bear the following year.
</P>
<P>
   --Fall bearing. These include Heritage and September Gold and
bear their main crop from August until frost on new, green 6-foot
stems that grow from the ground each spring. These also will bear a
second small crop the next July if the winter is not too cold. Some
people prefer to leave a 12-inch stem over the winter, which then
bears in July from side buds and afterward is cut off at the
ground. Meanwhile the new shoots are allowed to grow untouched.
Other folks, particularly those on vacation during July, just cut
everything to the ground in late fall or early spring and get one
big fall crop.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, that's all there is to growing
raspberries. Of course it helps to know some old farmer's wisdom:
</P>
<P>
   --Raspberries send out multiple new shoots each year. If these
are thinned out to 3 to 5 of the thickest ones per lineal foot,
they will be healthier and bear better.
</P>
<P>
   --They have to be harvested as soon as they turn a good red. If
left hanging too long the ants get on them or they get fungus and
the taste goes off.
</P>
<P>
   --To deter ants, spray the berries with a weak soap solution.
</P>
<P>
   --When ripe, the berries easily slide off their short stalk.
</P>
<P>
   --For ease of harvest, make 2 holes in a coffee can, put a
baggie inside and tie it around your neck. Don't laugh, it works.
Then hold up the end of a stem with one hand, and with your other
hand, pick the berries. They grow underneath the leaves all the way
down the stem.
</P>
<P>
   --To control diseases, don't water overhead but instead soak on
the ground to keep the roots cool and moist. Remove moldy mulch.
Throw out the pruned stems; don't compost them. Ditto the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   --To control insects (but only if you have a problem), spray
with pyrethrum and rotenone when the fruit first forms. Remove and
destroy any wilted tops because they likely have cane borer.
</P>
<P>
   --Virus is an incurable problem. Don't buy or plant stunted,
discolored, or sickly plants, also dig up and throw out any plants
you have that appear diseased.
</P>
<P>
   --It really helps to support the stems. Put in a couple of
4-foot-high T-shaped posts with two wires between them (from the
ends of the Ts).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have to enjoy the peace and quiet when picking
berries in the cool of morning, or at eventide. And you can't have
memories of being forced to pick and pick and pick as a child
laborer for your grandmother's jam.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, your berry plot will spread and thicken, and when
you have more berries than you can eat, fast freeze them on a
cookie sheet. They mush when thawed but are awesome as desert
garnish in the dead of winter.

   The first minute or two of ``Inspector Gadget,'' Disney's
PG-rated, big-screen version of TV's bumbling cartoon lawman, is a
rollicking good time.
</P>
<P>
   There's a runaway bus full of screaming passengers, a crowded

   How he does so is filmed so purposefully tongue-in-cheek by
director David Kellogg and elicits such delicious laughs that one
might expect to go gaga for the rest of ``Gadget,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   But no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadget's'' glorious fun wears off fairly quickly after those
first couple of minutes. What follows isn't a bad movie, it's just
nowhere near as engaging as the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Kids won't mind. ``Gadget's'' got their number. There's lots of
silly Tinkertoy goofiness, lots of crybaby villainy, lots of blue
goo tossed about, and one talking car to boot.
</P>
<P>
   After his initial bravery, Broderick's character gets pretty
much all blown up and, thanks to a lovely scientist (Joely Fisher),
has his whole body reconfigured into the police department's new
wundercop _ Inspector Gadget, a crime fighter implanted with about
14,000 gizmos, gadgets and kitchen utensils. His thumb's a lighter.
One arm can become a giant tube of toothpaste. Another can turn
into a big Slinky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not me anymore,'' Brown moans. ``I'm a hardware store.''
</P>
<P>
   His archenemy, the evil billionaire Sanford Scolex (Rupert
Everett), is almost one too. Scolex ends up losing a hand, and his
own twisted scientist (Andy Dick) replaces it with a big claw. As
Scolex himself says, he's become a ``postmodern Capt. Hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically the whole world is at stake as Gadget and Scolex go
at it mechanical arm to mechanical arm.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick is perfectly cast as the nerdy Gadget. Everett seems
to be here for the pure joy of acting outrageous. Others _ like
Dick, Dabney Coleman (as police chief Quimby) and ``Saturday Night
Live's'' Cheri Oteri (as perky, big-haired Mayor Wilson) _ lend
good goofy support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gadget'' might not seem to add up to a full movie because
director Kellogg has made only one other film: 1991's dreadful
``Cool as Ice'' with Vanilla Ice. Since then he's mainly made some
pretty great TV commercials _ for Coke, Pepsi, Budweiser and Little
Caesars.
</P>
<P>
   So now you know why ``Gadget's'' got at least a couple of
minutes of a great movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector
</P>
<P>
   Gadget''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett. Rated PG. 1 hour,
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It's a hoot only some of the time. But kids will
stay glued to the screen.

 &HT;    A hauntingly lame excuse for ghostly chills, thrills
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The horror, the horror....
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the wrong ways, ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with exactly one scare in it. That
scare is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do
with the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake
of the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's first half-hour offers creepy promise, thanks to
Eugenio Zanetti's massive sets for Hill House. That's the
destination of some light sleepers, including repressed Nell (Lili
Taylor), slinky bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), wisecracking
Luke (Owen Wilson) and their host, Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson), who
has invited them there presumably for a study of insomnia.
Actually, he wants to see how they respond to being spooked by the
haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the movie is as interested in sweetness as in
scares, giving Nell visitations from an awkwardly animated infant
ghost, who leads her on a fact-finding mission about the house's
dark history. (The idea of an investigation being spurred by a
child's ghost was the basis of 1979's creepy, far superior ``The
Changeling.'') Abandoning the primary plot of Shirley Jackson's
novella _ the slow psychological seduction of Nell by the house _
the new take turns the character into an ectoplasmic Nancy Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of the time, anyway. Other times, she's an addled
neurotic. The film underwent several reshoots and rewrites, and the
seams badly show, not least in the way it briefly excuses two
characters from Hill House, then never explains why they don't
return. It also explains Nell's affinity for the mansion in a way
that's both groaningly literal but also confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Taylor, one of the finest character actors around,
virtually oozes flop sweat as she tries to make sense of a role
that simply doesn't. One minute Nell is a flake. The next she's an
action hero, pulling a Ripley, a la ``Aliens,'' as she stands up to
the house's ghostly patriarch, who appears in full
computer-generated bluster like something from ``Twister,'' only
with a face.
</P>
<P>
   With each new movie, director Jan De Bont's tense work on
``Speed'' seems increasingly like a fluke. But the real thumbprint
of ``The Haunting'' belongs to DreamWorks co-founder Steven
Spielberg. The film sags beneath the child-centered sentimentality
and FX over-explicitness of his ``Poltergeist'' and ``Hook.'' It's
a showcase for hydraulic lifts and familiar maw-of-hell computer
graphics. The big, destructive finale plays like ``Gothic Home
Alone.'' Thrilling it isn't, much less any fun _ though a preview
audience laughed often at things that weren't intended to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' is no laughing matter, especially for
DreamWorks, which can add this movie to its lengthening list of
bombs and mediocrities (``The Love Letter,'' ``In Dreams,'' ``Small
Soldiers''). The reportedly $80 million production has surprising
competition in a $20,000 indie called ``The Blair Witch Project,''
which delivers real scares without a single computer-generated
effect. There couldn't be a better David and Goliath comparison
that demonstrates how badly big-budget Hollywood has lost touch
with the basics of telling a good story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen
Wilson. Rated PG-13 for intense horror sequences. At metro
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 53 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Scary in all the wrong ways; a true Hollywood
disaster.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated high school
sexcapade with dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter
between students that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also
the grossest joke involving a beer you're likely ever to see on
film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM)
1 hour, 57 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest moneymaker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' PG-13 (profanity, sex-related material,
</P>
<P>
   crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst,
</P>
<P>
   Denise Richards, Kirstie Alley
</P>
<P>
   and Ellen Barkin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a cheerfully mean-spirited spoof of beauty pageants.
Remember 1975's ``Smile''? But except for a switch from
cheerleading to beauty pageants, the plot here is much the same as
the 1993 cable flick ``The Positively True Adventures of the
Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.'' ``Gorgeous'' stoops to
obvious sight gags and even broader performances than in ``Mom.''
(SM)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge of Seventeen'' Not rated, but there are
</P>
<P>
   sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and adult themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Not much cutting edge here, but this teen saga about coming out
and coming of age in 1984 small-town Ohio has a refreshingly
unforced tone and a really appealing young lead, Chris Stafford.
What works best here is the way Stafford doesn't just discover a
new sense of sexual orientation; he discovers a new sense of
himself as a whole. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (strong sexuality, drug use, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a bittersweet ode to the everyday lies
people tell themselves to justify their actions. (SM) At area
discount theaters. 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM) 2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. Somebody's got to
turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and disguised as an
A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is an over-directed,
overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit B-grade thriller.
(Bob Longino)1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northam
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (whacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as badman Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching them
both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Placid'' R (profanity, violent creature attacks,
</P>
<P>
   gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Pullman,
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes watchable, underpopulated ``Jaws'' retread
about a giant crocodile, the croc attacks are predictable and
rudimentary. This is the sort of movie in which no one but bit
players get their heads bitten off. Pity. The scares aren't scary,
the laughs aren't funny, and poor Bridget Fonda has to keep falling
off moving vehicles directly into the path of the monster croc,
like some 1940s hapless heroine. (SM) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with stunning special
effects and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high
kicks and cascades of spent
</P>
<P>
   bullets. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Muppets From Space'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring The Great Gonzo,
</P>
<P>
   Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
</P>
<P>
   Beam us up, Gonzo. The Great Gonzo goes searching for his roots
and discovers he may have extraterrestrial family ties. It's the
same Muppet mania that's always worked _ a mix of vaudeville
schtick, kid-friendly slapstick and hilarious movie ``in-jokes'' to
tickle their parents. A perfect choice for families who may not be
quite ready to test ``South Park'' waters, but appreciate a blend
of sweetness and wit. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' R (sexuality, profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   In screenwriter Hanif Kureishi's culture-clash drama, a
Pakistani immigrant (Om Puri) falls for a hooker (Rachel Griffiths)
in ways that pit Eastern and Western values against each other. An
interesting setup marred by coincidence and cliche, including
another depiction of the hooker with a heart of gold. 1 hour, 32
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG) 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa June 30, 1999. It should be put inside a time
capsule. (SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM)2 hours, 11 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' R (profanity, sex, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Leguizamo,
</P>
<P>
   Mira Sorvino and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Summer'' is definitely long, but it's not so hot. Psycho
David Berkowitz's killing spree in New York's summer of '77 is just
one of many stories director Spike Lee tries to tell. Also in the
mix are Reggie Jackson's World Series and rising tensions among
some Italian-American homeboys in the Bronx for whom it would
already be a long, hot summer without the added stress of a killer
among them. (ERG) At metro theaters. 2 hours, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 28 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Wild West'' PG-13 (action violence,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent
James West, based on the old TV show, is a bizarre mix of
overproduced camp, sloppy pacing and tepid scripting. Will Smith
and Kevin Kline have zero sparks of buddy chemistry. ``Wild Wild
West'' is anything but wild. It's a washout. (SM)1 hour, 47
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne
</P>
<P>
   and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet proves an unexpectedly good match for Terence
Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true story of an Edwardian
patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear his 13-year-old son's
name when the boy is expelled from a prestigious school for
stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>

   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

WHEN A GIRL'S BODY GROWS UP FASTER THAN HER PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One mother tells of finding underpants in the laundry basket
with a sanitary napkin still attached. Another relates how her
daughter interrupted a meeting in their living room by standing in
the doorway holding a box of pads upside down to show it was empty.
A school nurse tells of a girl who asked her to show her where to
put the tampon.
</P>
<P>
   If the girls in these anecdotes sound immature, well, they are:
They're only 10 and 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The onset of menstruation has steadily decreased in this
century, so that the average age for a first period is now 12 1/2
instead of 14, as it was in 1900, says pediatrician David Kaplan,
chairman of the committee on adolescence for the American Academy
of Pediatrics. That means more girls than ever experience menarche
at 9, 10, or 11; indeed, 62 percent of black girls and 35 percent
of white girls are under 12 when they get their first period.
(Researchers can't account for the big difference in numbers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply,'' Kaplan says, ``a child this young is
cognitively not able to handle it as well as a 13- to
15-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is the typical parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because girls are so young, parents haven't thought to talk to
them about this yet. It's not unusual for a fourth-grader to come
to the school nurse because there's blood and she's frightened,''
says registered nurse Judith Robinson, executive director of the
National Association of School Nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's organization last month urged nurses across the
nation to teach fourth-graders, when appropriate and with gender
separation, about body changes so they know the how and why of
normal monthly bleeding. (Teaching the sexual aspects of
reproduction is recommended for sixth grade.)
</P>
<P>
   Some schools already do. In Swampscott, Mass., school nurse
Roberta Cobbett has more than once been grateful there's a health
unit for fourth-graders, but never so much as the day a few years
ago when a fifth-grader stood up in class to discover blood on her
pants and chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``She screamed, `What is that?' so the whole class was involved.
It was alarming to all of them,'' says Cobbett. But ``by the time I
came into the class, they were saying, `Oh, yeah, remember what we
learned.' '' That they had had a unit on body changes the year
before kept embarrassment and teasing to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean parents should cede the subject to the school.
``Girls need and want to hear about this from mothers. Not that
they're necessarily going to ask you, of course,'' says Los Angeles
psychologist Jessica Gillooly, author of ``Before She Gets Her
Period'' (Perspective Publishing, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   By 8, most girls have heard about ``it.'' ``Part of them wants
to know more, and part of them doesn't,'' says Gillooly. ``Some
girls will actually tell you, `It won't happen to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is one manifestation of how cognition lags behind physical
development. ``The 8- to 11-year-old is still basically a child.
She's not as self-conscious as the 12-year-old, but she can think
it's icky and not be interested,'' says Gillooly.
</P>
<P>
   She's likely to be even more grossed out if parents link
menstruation to sexuality. ``Don't,'' advises Gillooly. ``A girl
this age is turned off by it. It's too much for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as girls start to hear about menstruation, whether from
older girls on the bus or from a classmate who's experiencing it,
they start to worry: Will this happen to me? What if it doesn't?
How do you know when? What happens, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to be one of the first girls in a group to get your
period, especially if the world, including your parents, responds
to your physical growth by treating you like a teenager. ``A girl
feels isolated and alone. Freaky,'' says developmental psychologist
Elizabeth Debold.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for an early developer, parents can be as
surprised as their daughter. Indeed, many mothers are so ambivalent
about a girl's approaching menarche that they ignore it, says
Debold. She researches gender development and is the author of
``Mother Daughter Revolution'' (Bantam, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   With empirical data to rely on, however, there's no excuse for a
parent to be unaware or a daughter unprepared, says Kaplan, who is
pediatric chief of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital in
Denver. He says the typical girl develops breast buds at about 80
pounds. Menarche occurs about 18 to 24 months later, when the body
achieves a certain ratio of fat to weight, about 105 pounds. In
other words, say Kaplan, Debold, and Gillooly, the first
conversation should happen when a girl is 8.
</P>
<P>
   But what to say? It's a mistake to think you need one big,
definitive talk, says Gillooly. ``As you're talking, she's
thinking, `This won't happen to me.' She's not hearing you,'' she
says. Better instead to have many small conversations:
</P>
<P>
   --Soon after she's 8, even if you see no changes in her body:
``I've noticed some of your friends' bodies are changing. Have you
noticed?'' Most girls will say no. Continue anyway, says Gillooly:
``Well, I have, and before long, your body will start to change,
too. Your breasts will start to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   --A month or two later, leave some sanitary pads out: ``This is
the time of the month when I menstruate. Once a month, the lining
of a woman's uterus gets cleaned out. You wear these pads to
collect the menstrual flow. When it stops, I put them away.
Sometimes I also use tampons, which you insert into the vagina.''
Young girls will find that gross, says Gillooly, but a 12- or
13-year-old might be interested.
</P>
<P>
   --At 9, suggest buying pads for her to see, even if she's not
yet menstruating: ``I'm going to get some supplies; let's get some
for you to try. There are so many different kinds of pads, you
might want to experiment. They didn't have any of these choices
when I was your age!'' If she stonewalls _ ``Mom, that's
disgusting!'' _ keep trying. Her mortification may be eased if you
talk about how mortified you were when your mother did this with
you. Once home, show her how to wear it even if she insists she
doesn't want you to. Gillooly says most girls try one (but she may
never tell you). Don't encourage her to experiment with a tampon,
however; it's hard to get one in and out of a dry vagina. Although
there's no medical reason for girls not to wear a tampon, some
pediatricians don't recommend it for girls under 13 because they
tend to forget it's there.
</P>
<P>
   --As her time is getting closer, offer to answer questions:
Pittsburgh developmental psychologist Peggy Stubbs, a researcher on
girls' and women's development, says girls' worries revolve around
concrete issues of management, like how often to change pads and
whether people can tell. Answer these questions even if they are
unspoken: ``When I was your age, I worried everyone could tell I
was having my period. They can't, though.''
</P>
<P>
   --Once her period begins, be positive: The idea that this is
something to dread comes from the culture, says Stubbs. Talk about
how she can still do all the things she likes to do. Stubbs likes
to use Uta Pippig, who ran the Boston Marathon with blood dripping
down her leg, as an example of determination and courage. Avoid
saying, ``Now you're a woman!'' ``She knows this isn't true,'' says
Stubbs.
</P>
<P>
   An early developer feels alone, but a late developer feels
abnormal. Girls who are very athletic, slight, or small tend to
have delayed onset. ``By 12, she's convinced something is wrong
with her even if she doesn't say so,'' says Debold. She may be more
reassured by a few words from a doctor than she would be from you.

WEB FIRM SPENDS $25M TO BUILD ITS BRAND NAME THE OLD WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ If you were going to make a list of the things
you'd need for a successful e-commerce company, MotherNature.com
would seem to have most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which sells natural products on line, got an early
start in the business, received backing from blue-chip venture
capital names, including CMGI, raised a ton of money ($61 million),
and used much of it on a national advertising campaign to create a
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Darwinian business,'' says Michael Barach, the
firm's president. ``There are only going to be a few electronic
winners in each category. Everyone else will die or merge.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural products field represents a huge marketplace.
Americans spend billions on vitamins, minerals, and herbal
supplements like St. John's wort, an alternative remedy for
depression. The problem is, those billions are divided up among
hundreds of players. Supermarkets are in this business; so are
natural foods stores, drugstores, and a whole series of specialty
stores and catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough market,'' says Nancy Nachman Hunt, editor of
Natural Business, a trade publication. ``There is bound to be
attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Barach plans on being one of the survivors. A big man with curly
hair, Barach, 41, looks like the comedian Albert Brooks. He is a
graduate of the Harvard Business School and spent seven years at
Bessemer Venture Partners, a venture capital firm based in
Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Internet pioneers, he is focused on building a
recognizable brand name that will allow MotherNature.com to
distinguish itself from the competition. The company will spend $25
million this year creating that brand awareness. Interestingly,
most of that money will be spent on traditional media _ print,
billboards, and radio. The actress Blythe Danner was the voice of
the radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Why is an Internet company spending its money on old-fashioned
media? In a word: credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of 20-year-olds could put up a Web site and sell
health products,'' says Barach. ``But who would trust them? By
talking to people through media they know, you convince them that
you are for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Barach saw the results firsthand at home. His wife and daughter,
who had paid little attention to the company, changed their tune
after the radio ads aired. His wife even started ordering products.
</P>
<P>
   Barach says the company's better name recognition has also
translated into better sales. Late last year, less than 1/4 of 1
percent of the people who visited the Web site actually bought
products. Today the conversion rate, as it is called, is up to 3
percent. That doesn't sound so great, but Barach insists it is well
above the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Web site can find products and plenty of
information. There is an alphabetical listing of 175 different
health problems _ everything from anxiety to yellow-nail syndrome _
with accompanying articles about each one. Alongside the articles
are product recommendations, including many of MotherNature.com's
private-label products. The private-label business accounts for 45
percent of the company's sales and Barach would like to see it go
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Internet sales are a tiny piece of the natural
products market. The Hartman Group, a consumer research firm in
Bellevue, Wash., estimates that on-line sales in the business
amounted to less than $40 million in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts the numbers will grow rapidly. The question is:
Who will get the sales? MotherNature.com has a West Coast
competitor called Greentree, another pure Internet play. Vitamin
Shoppe, a New Jersey retailer, also has an on-line presence. GNC, a
huge national chain, has teamed up with Rite Aid, a drug store
chain, to sell natural products over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Barach sounds confident, despite the competition. He says his
company will do at least $5 million in sales this year and $14
million next year. He won't comment about a timetable to go public,
but the betting is MotherNature.com will follow the lead of other
CMGI companies and sell stock in the not-so-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hunt of Natural Business says the company is off to a good
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a tremendous amount of financing and some decent
exposure,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be enough? Stay tuned.

FOR SOME, THE WAIT IS AS EXCITING AS THE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people count down the days until their wedding or the last
day of school. Others anticipate the call from the doctor or the
visit from Santa. And in theater circles, folks have been known to
wait for Lefty and some guy named Godot.
</P>
<P>
   But wait for a movie? It used to be that only Trekkers and
aspiring Jedi knights obsessed about the minute details of their
favorite films. But now, it seems like every movie is dissected on
the Internet months before it even opens. Of course you expect
advance mania with ``Star Wars.'' But the Net has buzzed all summer
with feverish speculation about movies big and small, from ``Wild
Wild West'' to ``The Blair Witch Project.'' A movie isn't just a
movie anymore: It's an Event. Anticipation has become a popular
pastime, a form of entertainment in itself. Buzz is the new
buzzword, waiting the new game.
</P>
<P>
   Take Tim Doyle. Two years ago, he was an ad salesman in Toronto,
going about his business and seeing the occasional film. Today,
he's on an ``extended vacation'' in Los Angeles, putting together a
business plan for countingdown.com, the Web site that breathlessly
reports on upcoming films. ``We have mobilized anticipation in a
more organized fashion,'' Doyle, 28, says of the site, which he
launched with two other film buffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big day for Doyle and his cohorts, what with the
opening of the long-awaited Stanley Kubrick film ``Eyes Wide
Shut.'' They've been counting down to the opening for months,
dishing out the latest rumors about stars Nicole Kidman and Tom
Cruise and castigating Warner Brothers for digitally altering a
65-second orgy scene. Who cares if the film is worth the wait? The
wait is worth the wait to Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like opening presents before Christmas, sneaking a
peak,'' he explains of this Information Age obsession. ``It's like
a guilty pleasure, like being let in on some deep, dark secret.''
</P>
<P>
   And every day is Christmas Eve in cyberspace. The film industry
was slow to respond to the Internet phenomenon, but fans are now
rewriting the rules about movie premieres. Nothing is secret, and
reviews are not embargoed. Amateur sites like aint-it-cool-news.com
and darkhorizons.com publish anything they can dredge up about
upcoming films, and industry honchos are flinching about their loss
of spin control. Last month, director Barry Sonnenfeld blamed the
Internet for the tepid response to ``Wild Wild West.'' ``You can
ruin a movie through anonymous reviews on the Internet,'' he said,
failing to note that the mainstream press didn't exactly embrace
the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that can make or break a film is the film
itself,'' says Lew Harris, editor-in-chief of E! Online. But even
Harris, whose site fuels the obsession with pop culture, says the
buzz has escalated this month. ``There is an increasing mania, and
I don't know where it's going to end,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, it's not going to end. You know the line between
fact and fiction is blurring when a film becomes an urban legend in
its own right. That's what happened with ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' a mock documentary by independent filmmakers Daniel
Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. The film tells the story of three
students who disappear while making a documentary about witches in
Blair, Md. The whole thing is fiction, but you wouldn't know it
from the Web site (www.blairwitch.com). The site draws you into the
mythology, presenting ``evidence'' including photographs and
weathered documents. There isn't a single clue that the legend
isn't true, except for one link that leads to an on-line store
where you can purchase T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly an ingenious, if manipulative, marketing ploy,
since word flies on the Internet. A few weeks ago, the ``Blair
Witch Project'' appeared on www.snopes.com, a popular site that
debunks urban legends that multiply in cyberspace. David Mikkelson,
who runs the site with his wife, Barbara, says he set up the
``Blair Witch'' page as a response to numerous inquiries. ``We
still have plenty of folks who will cling to whatever beliefs fit
their world view, facts be damned,'' Mikkelson says.
</P>
<P>
   It's only a movie, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Rumors and legends about movies aren't the only
things that proliferate in cyberspace these days. An avid fan
posted the complete footage of ``Phantom Menace'' on line days
after the film opened; a streaming video version of the last
episode of ``Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,'' which had been postponed
because of the Columbine High tragedy in Colorado, appeared on line
immediately after it was aired on Canadian television.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to wait for Christmas morning anymore. So now that
the folks at countingdown.com finally get to see ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' they have something else to anticipate. Remember those 65
seconds? The scene that was altered to mask body parts in an orgy
scene? The film is being released uncensored in Europe, so it's
only a matter of time before someone sneaks a camera into a theater
and posts the original clip on line. It will happen, guaranteed.
All you have to do is wait.

   With all due respect to Marshall McLuhan, the medium is the
medium _ at least in an Internet seance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, we checked out ``Web Seance,'' the latest project
by digital artists Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell that was
commissioned by the Banff Center for the Arts in Alberta, Canada.
Two artists were hooked up to an electroencephalographic machine,
which traces electronic forces in the brain, and drawings of their
brainwaves were transmitted to the Web site. On-line participants
asked questions that scrolled across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings themselves were abstract blurs, eerie and
incandescent. The questions were amusing, a combination of mishegas
and mysticism. A sampling: ``Can I touch the medium?'' and ``Is
this a medium or a comedian?'' I logged in late, posing the query:
``Is this over?'' Alas, the medium didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   The site is at http://artists.banff.org/parkbench/seance/; the
next seance is set for July 28 at 5 p.m.

IN RUSSIA, AN ALCOHOL REVOLUTION BREWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Elvira the country singer serves up a refreshing glass
of ``Chuvash Bouquet,'' known for its apple-like aftertaste. Next
door, Igor from the Volga unleashes heavy barrages of ``Stalingrad
Strong'' to a line of willing victims. Not far away, the godmother
of Russian Beverage is doling out dark, mysterious quaffs of
``Black Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   It's cold. It's popular. And it's not vodka. Beer is on a roll
in Russia, and may even be making inroads on vodka's once
unassailable place as Russians' favorite libation.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Great Moscow Beer Festival, it is easy to see why.
Russian brewers are serving notice that they can produce quality
beers at reasonable prices and in dozens of varieties.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem surprising in a land where, just a decade ago,
beer was unloaded off the back of an unrefrigerated truck and sold
on the street in unlabeled bottles. Thirsty consumers ignored the
sour taste and the sediment to chug the warm beverage on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet brewers knew people would buy it anyway,'' said Dr.
Valeria Isayeva, laboratory chief at the Russian Research Institute
of Beer Brewing, Non-Alcoholic Beverage and Wine Producing
Industry. ``They can't get away with that now.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Muscovites still suck down brewskies on the street _
no law against that here _ but they are quality brews with
attractive labels. Consumption, which dipped in the early 1990s as
people laid off the bad old stuff, is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beer consumption is definitely growing,'' Isayeva, sort of the
godmother of the industry for her institute's control of brewing
standards, intoned as she poured a schooner of Black Prince, an
intoxicatingly heavy dark beer.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk that the beer boom is beginning to ferment unrest
in the region's alcohol hierarchy: Young Russians are shifting from
vodka to beer, and a similar shift to suds is well under way in
Poland, another former Communist country of vodka-lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now like beer for most social occasions,'' said Artur
Vasilyev, sipping a Stalingrad as he tried to explain his hop to
hops. ``Vodka is good only when you need to get stinking drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians on average drink only about 20 quarts of beer a year _
seven times less than other Europeans. But since last year's
financial collapse, demand for locally brewed beer has skyrocketed,
and industry analysts say the potential for growth is enormous.
That has lured international beermakers to Russia, forcing Russian
breweries to improve their product.
</P>
<P>
   Beer-making technology has allowed smaller breweries to pop up
all over Russia. One example is the delicious ``Chuvash Bouquet''
made in a microbrewery in the Volga River city of Cheboksary, and
served by Elvira Timofeyeva, who sang a beer-drinking song in her
native Chuvash tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Powering the brew boom are foreign companies, like the
Scandinavian consortium which in 1992 took over and refurbished a
St. Petersburg brewery and came up with Baltika, the country's
best-selling beer and the closest thing Russia has to a national
brand. An Indian-Belgian company named SUN Interbrew is challenging
Baltika's dominance. And Turkey's Efes brewery and South Africa
Breweries, the world's fourth-largest beer maker, have each
recently opened breweries in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Their brands, like Zolotaya Bochka (Golden Barrel), have scored
an instant hit among younger Russians with catchy ads. The
``Bochka'' ad shows a close up of four guys drinking beer on a
beach with Jimi Hendrix's ``Little Wing'' playing in the
background; when the camera zooms back, you see that it's not a
beach they're sitting on, but a sand-filled boxcar on a moving
train. ``We should meet more often,'' the announcer says as
Hendrix's guitar goes ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   Even though these companies are foreign-owned, Russians identify
them as national brands because they are locally produced. The
losers are imports, which appeared in the early 1990s but have been
all but muscled out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a thriving beer industry will not help Russia's
significant problems with male life-expectancy, alcoholism and
such. Or maybe it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of alcoholics in Russia,'' Mayor Yury Luzhkov,
himself a teetotaler, said at the festival's opening ceremony.
``Well, in ancient times, they cured alcoholism with beer.''

THE PROFITS OF COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ The latest edition of the twice-annual Macworld
magic show began with one marvelous bit of illusion-busting and
ended with another.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who entered stage left without any warning really did
look like Apple Computer Inc.'s own Steve Jobs. He had it all just
right, even the little Asian-looking bow with folded hands as he
acknowledged the plaudits of the crowd. Well, he didn't have it all
just right, because the real Steve Jobs came charging out with an
impromptu critique. Actor Noah Wyle, who recently played Jobs in a
TV movie, accepted the criticism in good grace and got out of
there.
</P>
<P>
   On with the show! Darn good one, too. Jobs' genius as a pitchman
came through from the start, as he danced lightly over Apple's
recent superb sales figures and excellent finances. The days of
harping on that stuff are done. Apple's back. Let's talk product.
</P>
<P>
   There were interesting offerings in the streaming multimedia
field, and a promising hint of good things to come later this year
in the next version of the Mac operating system _ not the fabled OS
X, alas. There wasn't a word about that lusty spawn of Unix. Pity,
but we can wait.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the star turn was reserved for the long-awaited
Apple consumer laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Even Apple skeptics like me had held out a lot of hope for this
one, based on fond memories of eMate, the 1996 minilaptop that
struck me as Apple's best hardware product in years. This
three-pound, $800 baby was crude, with a black-and-white screen, a
slow processor, no disk drives, and little memory. It didn't even
run the Mac OS. What it did do was let you get your e-mail, do some
primitive Web surfing, and type text for hours without even
thinking about recharging the battery. Just the thing for a writer
on the road. I didn't buy one because I knew Apple, then in
desperate straits, would kill the product.
</P>
<P>
   But when Jobs last year vowed to bring out a true consumer
laptop, my hopes rose. Sure, they'd go for something fancier than
an eMate. But if they could capture that same bare-bones esthetic,
and hit nearly the same price point, the computer world might
finally have its first peoples' laptop.
</P>
<P>
   And so when Jobs showed off Apple's gaudy new iBook laptops, a
part of me couldn't help but feel disillusioned. It was bigger than
I'd hoped for, more powerful than I'd expected, and at $1,600, much
pricier than I'd desired.
</P>
<P>
   How dare Apple make a better, hotter machine than I'd expected?
Maybe it's this odd new habit the company has recently acquired _
making money. Right now, nobody has proven there's a profitable
market for proletarian laptops. As Apple product manager Dave
Russell pointed out to me, the few there are tend to be based on
obsolete PC technology and don't sell very well. Apple has learned
well the bitter lessons of the past few years; they're not into
loss leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So the heck with a cheap, stripped machine. The iBook, to judge
by the specs and a few tentative keytaps, is a powerful machine,
with a 300-megahertz Power PC processor and an ATI Rage chip for
strong 3D graphics performance.
</P>
<P>
   Coolest of all is a $99 upgrade that turns any iBook into a
wireless network computer. Add a $299 device that looks like a
pearl-gray flying saucer, and you can have a roomful of these
things chattering away at each other with not a foot of Ethernet
cable among them. This feature alone will sell a couple hundred
thousand iBooks. Indeed, they'll sell as many of these computers as
they can make, and at a fatter profit than they'd make off some
cheap Prole-Pad.
</P>
<P>
   The iBook can stand on its own without the excesses of Jobsian
hype. He calls it the world's second-fastest laptop, exceeded only
by one of Apple's own PowerBooks. But that claim's based on
``pure'' processing speed, not real-world performance using
standard programs. Apple should give it a rest. The iBook is plenty
fast. There's no need to exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   And no need to kowtow to tightwads like me, who came expecting
cheap computers from a company that specializes in cool computers.
As Apple keeps proving, cool may not be cheap, but it's mighty
profitable.

CHRIST CRUSADERS TARGET SUN SEEKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON BEACH, N.H. _ The view from the edge of the boardwalk is
spectacular. Brilliant sunlight, clear blue horizon, inviting
sands.
</P>
<P>
   It is with awe that Katerine Vanasek, a 20-year-old Minnesotan
accustomed to more frigid surroundings, surveys the vast expanse of
multi-colored umbrellas and tanned bodies in string bikinis.
Scanning this snapshot of typical beach life through lightly tinted
sunglasses, Vanasek sees what few others see; as a member of Campus
Crusade for Christ, she sees hundreds of souls just waiting to be
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful thing. Out there you see God working,''
she said. ``I've got such a passion for those who don't know
Christ. I just want to go up to each and every one of them and tell
them he is here, that God is here.''
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, Campus Crusade for Christ, an international
network of interdenominational college ministries, has spread the
Gospel to southern New Hampshire vacationers through its Hampton
Beach Summer Project, one of 27 being held across the country this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   To newcomers, the idea of beach evangelists immediately draws
pained expressions of annoyance and a raw instinct to run. But in
this town of shanty hotels, fortune tellers, and fried dough
stands, the group of Christian college students who live at White
Gull Hotel and work in local shops and restaurants along the
boardwalk, by all accounts, blend in smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Few first-timers are aware they exist, in fact. And beach
regulars _ many with a cornucopia of tattoos, peculiar body
piercings, and multi-colored hair _ seem willing to accept a
different point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda weird to see people preaching on the beach, but
it's not a bad weird,'' 17-year-old Amy Baird of West Springfield,
Mass. said. ``Lord knows there are folks out here who need to be
saved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the group's 25 years at Hampton Beach, swimsuits have shrunk
and the Beach Boys have been replaced by the Backstreet Boys. All
the while, CCC's mission has remained the same. Project director
James Rhodes said the organization is on a quest to help change
young people's attitudes toward Christianity, one sunbather at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overarching mission is to give every student the chance to
hear the Gospel. So we chose Hampton Beach because it is a draw for
a lot of college students,'' said Rhodes. ``We want them to know
that they can develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, as
we have. We want to help show them how they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Campus Crusade for Christ's technique of ``sharing'' is simple
but seemingly effective in that its members are not immediately
turned away by those they try to reach. They spot a friendly face
and approach with ice-breaking banter, usually about the weather.
And with the temperature on one recent weekend hovering around a
stifling 100 degrees, the heat provides a lively topic for
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The target is then asked if he or she is interested in
participating in a national survey the organization is conducting,
which begins by asking about the person's life goals and ends with
an evaluation of their desire to know God.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's routine was no different.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Vanasek and 21-year-old Lorie Heersink setting out
to spread the word, pausing to pray before heading toward a
baby-faced young girl with long, blond pigtails. She looked
innocent enough, lying on a rumpled beach blanket in a sky-blue
two-piece, until a closer glance revealed rising smoke from the
last two puffs of a cigarette. The three exchanged smiles, with the
young girl looking slightly suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in God. If he existed, then why does so much
bad stuff happen?'' asked the girl, who identified herself as Lisa,
as she ground the cigarette in the sand. ``Maybe one day I'll bump
into him, but for now, I don't believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Unshaken by Lisa's disbelief, the duo talked with her for more
than 20 minutes about their own struggles with faith, and
encouraged her to discuss her early childhood religious experiences
and the point when she gave up on God. At the end of the exchange,
Lisa seemed to have softened a bit and agreed to take the group's
pamphlet citing four principles to discovering God personally. They
thanked her for her time, and left. A few feet away they stopped to
pray for Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was played out numerous times throughout the day, as
several people willingly opened up about their family's religious
practices, fears about death, and desires to become more spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   Glen French, president of the Hampton Beach Chamber of Commerce,
attributes the positive response the group gets to its approach.
``We never get a complaint about them at all. It's not like they
are out there forcing people to take pamplets and telling scare
stories about doomsday,'' said French. ``They are telling people
positive things and they have a great attitude about it. If people
are not interested in the subject matter, they don't have to
listen. They can do some of the other stuff on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Heald, 33, who works at Tates Craft and Candle on
the boardwalk, believes most people are unfazed by the group's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that most people turn a deaf ear to them, though they
have a way of having people open up to them,'' he said. ``But it's
crazy and wild around here. I'm Mormon and our missionaries
wouldn't be allowed down here, with all the half-naked people and
the drinking, because of the temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Reynolds, 58, who peddles sunglasses on the strip, added:
``It is odd. But I am not your average Christian.'' Perched atop a
stool in front of her stand, she wears a gray chauffeur's cap,
triangular-shaped fluorescent silver sunglasses and a matching
fanny pack. ``It's definitely odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sampson, 15, who is approached as she sunbathes with two
friends, said that though she doesn't mind the interruption, beach
evangelism may not be such a good idea. ``I think it is recreation
time and that people they come up to are not going to be in a
spiritual mode,'' said Sampson. ``People may not want to get into
the deep stuff while they are chilling on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ whose members apply to the program from across the
country and raise money for their own room and board _ says it
doesn't set out to recruit members or to convince people to be
``saved'' _ which, simplified, means accepting Jesus Christ as
one's personal savior and living a more righteous, Christian-like
life. Vanasek said the group operates as sort of a referral service
for God, using Matthew 28:18-20, &UR;  &LR; The Great Commission, as a
driving force.
</P>
<P>
   That commission states: ``And Jesus came and spake unto them,
saying, `All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am
with you always, even unto the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Explained Vanasek: ``Jesus tells his disciples that those who
have received him have to go out and spread that joy. It's like
when people who play sports get excited because they scored the
winning goal and want to tell the world. That's how we feel, like
winners on God's team.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its personal outreach activities, CCC stages
larger events, such as volleyball and soccer games, to attract
young people on the beach. Recently, the men in the group held a
mud wrestling match that drew a crowd of about 100 people, after
which they invited all to discuss the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   After watching a humorous tag team of Christian mud wrestlers
throw themselves around in a make-shift ring, 18-year-old Dawn
Bellows of Westfield, Mass. was amazed. ``I've never seen anything
like this,'' she said. ``Who knew Christians did stuff like this?''

 UNDATED: ... from you.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While fathers once were out of this picture, that's no longer
true. ``Many divorced dads are with a daughter when she gets her
first period. You have to lay a foundation,'' says Gillooly. An
older daughter may not want to hear from you on the subject, so
keep it simple: ``Your body is changing. You know, I know all about
menstruation; I lived with your mother, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced or not, dads should keep the focus on health, says
Stubbs. ``Congratulate her on having a normal, developing, healthy
body,'' she says. The more a father or mother is able to tell a
story _ ``My first girlfriend used to get bad cramps''; ``I
remember my first period'' _ the more likely a daughter will
listen.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs says sons should be clued in, too, whether they have
sisters or not. ``Treat it as information about the body and about
growing, but also as a matter of respect: `What happens to your
sister is a normal part of growing up, just like when your voice
changed. We didn't tease you, and we don't tease her.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the girls in the anecdotes at the beginning of the
story, the adults in their lives took the incidents in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a girl starts so young, our attitudes count for a lot,''
says Debold. ``Developmentally, she won't be as self-conscious as
an older girl unless we make her feel ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --As her time is getting closer, offer to answer questions.
Pittsburgh developmental psychologist Peggy Stubbs, a researcher on
girls' and women's development, says girls' worries revolve around
concrete issues of management, like how often to change pads and
whether people can tell. Answer these questions even if they are
unspoken: ``When I was your age, I worried everyone could tell I
was having my period. They can't, though.''
</P>
<P>
   --Once her period begins, be positive. The idea that this is
something to dread comes from the culture, says Stubbs. Talk about
how she can still do all the things she likes to do. Stubbs likes
to use Uta Pippig, the woman who ran the Boston Marathon with blood
dripping down her leg, as an example of determination and courage.
Avoid saying, ``Now you're a woman!'' ``She knows this isn't
true,'' says Stubbs.
</P>
<P>
   An early developer feels alone, but a late developer feels
abnormal. Girls who are very athletic, slight, or small tend to
have delayed onset. ``By 12, she's convinced something is wrong
with her even if she doesn't say so,'' says Debold. She may be more
reassured by a few words from a doctor, rather than from you.
</P>
<P>
   While fathers once were out of this picture, that's no longer
true. ``Many divorced dads are with a daughter when she gets her
first period. You have to lay a foundation,'' says Gillooly. An
older daughter may not want to hear from you on the subject, so
keep it simple: ``Your body is changing. You know, I know all about
menstruation; I lived with your mother, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced or not, dads should keep the focus on health, says
Stubbs. ``Congratulate her on having a normal, developing, healthy
body,'' she says. The more a father or mother is able to tell a
story _ ``My first girlfriend used to get bad cramps''; ``I
remember my first period'' _ the more likely a daughter will

</P>
<P>
   ``When a girl starts so young, our attitudes count for a lot,''
says Debold. ``Developmentally, she won't be as self-conscious as
an older girl unless we make her feel ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SOME COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Will I get cramps? How come my friends get cramps and I don't?
They are many ways to have your period. Cramps are like a
tightening in the stomach. It's normal if you get them, but not all
girls do. I did/didn't. If you do, there's medicine to help.
</P>
<P>
   --Can I have babies now? Your body is capable of having
children, yes, but the rest of you isn't ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   --What if a boy finds out I'm having it? Most boys know about
menstruation because they have moms and sisters, but usually no one
finds out you're menstruating unless you tell them. If someone
teases you, how could you handle it?
</P>
<P>
   --How can you tell it's coming? Sometimes you can feel your body
changing; maybe you feel a little more sensitive or moody. When
you're older, it's about the same time each month, but girls your
age don't always get it every month. Since you can't always know,
you can keep a pad wrapped in your backpack so you'll have it just
in case. (It's also helpful for girls to know that the blood does
not look like blood from scraping a knee, that it's normal if it's
more brown than red.)
</P>
<P>
   --I hate it when you talk about It! I can tell, and that's hard
for me because there's so much I want to share with you. How about
if we keep a journal together? I'll write the things I want to tell
you, like my memories, and you can read it and write back if you
want.
</P>

PBS CAN FLY ON ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Press reports and the tongue-lashings of assorted politicians
notwithstanding, WGBH didn't do anything wrong. Nor did WNET, WETA,
or KQED. The public television giants in Boston, New York,
Washington, and San Francisco have been catching all kinds of hell
in the wake of reports that they swapped direct-mail fund-raising
lists with political organizations. All four stations have traded
names with the Democratic National Committee; at WETA the practice
has been going on for at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than just these stations are involved. On Tuesday, the
chief of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting estimated that 30
others have obtained names from political groups. No one has
compiled a definitive list of the ideological organizations with
which the stations have exchanged donor information, but it seems
safe to assume that it's a long one. KQED has acknowledged swapping
data with Handgun Control Inc. and Planned Parenthood. In 1997 it
leased its lists to the campaign of California Senator Barbara
Boxer, a Democrat. Other politicians and other stations have made
similar deals. New Hampshire public television, for example, shared
names with Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has some Republicans in a lather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's immoral, it's unethical, and we're going to bring it to
an end,'' rages Ken Johnson, a spokesman for US Representative
Billy Tauzin, who chairs the House Telecommunications Subcommittee.
Representative Paul Gillmore of Ohio, who sits on Tauzin's
committee, calls the list-trading a ``crass abuse of listeners and
supporters.'' Michael Collins, the always quotable press secretary
of the Republican National Committee, says public broadcasting has
allowed itself to be treated ``as a branch office, as a wholly
owned subsidiary'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, the GOP is missing the point.The
significance of these direct-mail swaps is not that public
television stations prospect for donations among the financial
supporters of political groups. It is that these stations know
where the money is and know how to go after it.
</P>
<P>
   Public television has grown up. It is no babe in the broadcast
woods, struggling to air high-quality programming on a shoestring
budget. PBS stations today are sophisticated and adroit, as skilled
at fund-raising as they are at public relations. Once, perhaps,
public TV needed help in order to hold its own against the
commercial broadcasters. But that day is long past.
</P>
<P>
   What Republicans _ and Democrats _ ought to be talking about is
not whether sharing lists of contributors is incompatible with the
subsidy that PBS gets from the government, but whether any
justification exists to preserve that subsidy. Once a welfare
recipient gets a job and can support herself, she goes off the
dole. Taxpayers spend $350 million a year on what amounts to
welfare for public broadcasting. If, after all these years, public
TV has developed the savvy to raise the money it needs from willing
donors, customers, and underwriters, shouldn't it too go off the
dole?
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe analyzed WGBH's finances as part of a lengthy
1997 series. What reporter Daniel Golden found was a sleek
moneymaking machine:
</P>
<P>
   ``At WGBH, fund-raising influences every key decision _
including programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund-raising head Victoria Devlin joins five other WGBH
executives at weekly editorial meetings, crossing the traditional
divide between the business and programming sides. Sources say she
can scuttle innovative program ideas just by saying she won't be
able to raise money for them . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Devlin, 165 of WGBH's 1,186 employees (today, it's 139
of 1,022) solicit donations from viewers, foundations, and
corporations, making `development and external affairs' one of the
station's largest departments. More employees work in fund-raising
than in national programming, WGBH radio, or local television
operations. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``By far the largest number of her employees, about 100,
organize pledge drives and other events to sell memberships for $40
a year. . . . Eighteen staffers seek major gifts, and four run the
annual auction, supplemented by dozens of volunteers. Nearly 35
more employees pitch corporations and foundations to fund national
and local programs.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of this well-oiled fund-raising operation _ which
currently brings in $64 million a year _ WGBH raises additional
millions through its commercial marketing division. ``It hawks
everything from books to games, T-shirts to telescopes, and
advertises a toll-free number on air for buying home videos,''
Golden wrote. Programs that lend themselves to this sort of
merchandising are likelier to get on the air than those that don't.
WGBH and its sister stations boast that they are
``commercial-free.'' But they have learned to take commercial
advantage of their popular shows.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is PBS the one bright spot in a vast wasteland of
televised mediocrity. Viewers now enjoy a wide array of fine
broadcast offerings, from C-SPAN to Arts &AMP; Entertainment, from ESPN
to The Learning Channel. The original rationale for ``public''
television _ that the market would not support high-level programs
_ has become a highly debatable proposition. What is not debatable
is whether public TV can sustain itself financially. It can.
</P>
<P>
   Direct mail may be a bane of modern life, but it has become a
standard way to identify willing financial supporters. If Congress
wants to right a wrong, let it relieve public TV's unwilling
financial supporters _ the taxpayers who are made to subsidize PBS
whether they choose to or not. Big Bird is strong enough to fly on
his own. It's time he was told to leave the nest.

EAT, DRINK, AND BE HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would you like a coffee bean that has more caffeine? Or would
you prefer orange juice with more folic acid? How about a little
less caffeine in your coffee but more protein in your wheat bread?
</P>
<P>
   If you're a farmer, would you like to grow crops that aren't
destroyed by herbicides? How about growing corn that reduces the
risk of heart disease? Could you use plant life that repels
corn-borers and attracts pollinators?
</P>
<P>
   The science of genomics brings us to the verge of such choices.
And in a stunning development, what was once theoretical may now be
practical. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that genomic
scientists ``have figured out how to manipulate crop genes by
borrowing a technique that is used to treat genetic illnesses in
humans. The technique (known as chimeraplasty) could make it far
easier for crop researchers to do things such as modify a wheat
plant for making heartier bread, reduce the caffeine in coffee
beans. or eliminate unhealthy fatty acids in cooking oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this technological breakthrough are immense.
The chimeraplasty technique has the potential to revolutionize the
business of agriculture and, in conjunction with human genome
research, create a new industry called agriceuticals (food products
that also serve as pharmaceuticals). It may also change the
international political debate over genetically engineered (or
genetically modified) foods. In 10 years, it could transform what
we eat and how we medicate ourselves to fight disease or genetic
predisposition to illness.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact of this technological breakthrough is
political. As the Journal reported, ``up to now, it has been the
transplantation of foreign genes into corn, cotton, and soybeans
that has produced genetically modified crops. Such crops have swept
across the American farm belt, now accounting for about half of all
soybeans, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   The transplantation of foreign genes into agricultural products
carries with it significant risks. Earlier this year, an
influential study of the environmental impact of genetically
modified corn found that it was killing the monarch butterfly in
the middle of America. This finding raised alarms that every
genetically modified food product might cause inalterable harm to
the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though scientists assure us that crossing genetic boundaries is
safe in 99.99 percent of all cases, it is that one-100th of 1
percent that keeps them awake at night, fretting about the
unintended consequences of genetic transplantation. And it is that
very concern that has led to the enormous political backlash,
particularly in Europe, against genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   The British experience with ``mad cow'' disease and political
opportunism has also played a role in this backlash. Closing
markets to American products is often a popular political stance in
foreign countries, particularly when those products are
technologically advanced. But the fear that genetic transplantation
might lead to catastrophe is not confection. It is, for all of us,
an issue of overriding importance.
</P>
<P>
   Organic farmers and environmentalists argue that the risks of
genetically engineered food outweigh the rewards. This view has
resonated across the European body politic and effectively halted
distribution of genetically engineered food products in
supermarkets all across the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   The chimeraplasty technique addresses this political backlash
directly (itals)because it does not involve
transplantation(unitals). As the Journal reported, it ``allows
scientists to change or turn off genes already present in a plant.
The method makes it far simpler to discover exactly what an
individual gene does, as well as to tinker with the unique
nutritional composition of a crop.'' This in turn decreases the
possibility of an unintended genetic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of the chimeraplasty gene modification technique
may be to lessen concerns about genetically engineered foods, since
the procedure involves the enhancement or diminishment of genes
that reside in the crop. Corn would be able to fight off herbicides
through genetic enhancement. Coffee would have less caffeine by
means of genetic diminishment. But no transplantation would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the world needs more nutritious foods to
feed an ever-larger population. The world also needs a
much-expanded system of preventive health care.
</P>
<P>
   The most cost-effective way to feed more people is through
agricultural genomics. The most cost-effective way to build that
preventive health care system is to use human genome research to
better understand serial killers like high blood pressure and heart
disease. That knowledge can then be combined with agricultural
genomics to produce foods that are not only more nutritious but
have pharmaceutical applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over genetically engineered food products has cast a
long shadow over genomics, mankind's most promising scientific
technology. The chimeraplasty technique breakthrough raises the
hope that the debate will become much less acrimonious and much
more productive.

GET DOWN AND DIRTY? NO, THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN LUPO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been reading recently about colorful gardens, and I could
not help but notice that my house lot was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   It could be this is because I do not plant anything. Apparently,
when you do not plant anything, the chances of having a garden are
somewhat slim.
</P>
<P>
   There are some very good reasons why I do not plant stuff. They
include, but are not limited to, the following, which are presented
in no particular order of priority:
</P>
<P>
   First, I am too lazy to go outside with a shovel or whatever one
uses, dig up some dirt, pour seeds into the hole, and then water
the sucker. A guy up the street from me does this and, for so
doing, often wins the ``best garden'' award in the community. When
I watch him slave, in the style of a tenant farmer, over what
indeed is a beautiful garden, I have this compelling desire to give
him 40 acres and a mule.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I don't own a hose. I have lived in the same house for
31 years without a hose. Were I to live in, say, Florida, where
wildfires rampage through neighborhoods, then I would get a hose,
so I could get on television news, which would show me hosing my
roof, as if that were going to stop a 23-alarm blaze across the
road. But I don't live in Florida, so I don't own a hose. I live in
Winthrop, Mass. What am I going to water, an airport runway?
</P>
<P>
   Third, when I was a little kid during World War II, I did my
patriotic duty and planted my Victory Garden of vegetables in the 2
square feet of dirt in our landlord's otherwise paved-over back
yard. I planted radishes about 3 feet from the can where we used to
deposit our garbage, on which little white maggots would feast. My
radishes actually grew. Adults smiled, and when they thought I
wasn't looking, threw them out. Into the garbage can, where the
maggots, having no taste, ate them. I have never gardened since.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, my wife drags me every spring and fall to a farm stand
in the outback. There, she buys flowers that somebody else has
grown, for some outrageous amount of money. We fill the trunk and
back of the car with these pots and take them home, where she
replants some of them and hangs others on varous spikes protruding
from the house and the nearby utility pole. After a week or so, the
ones that haven't croaked are drooping, begging for water, which
she usually has forgotten to give them from her quaint watering
pail.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, flowers stink. I mean this in the literal sense. The
other day, here at the workplace, some well-meaning person had left
pots of lilies or something in various places. The joint smelled
like a funeral home. At my age, I get nervous when I smell that
aroma. I'm not ready yet.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth, there are too many flowers in the world already. Each one
has a different name. There's the petunia, the perennial, the
aforementioned lily, the lilac, the who-knows-what-already. I have
retention disorder. I can't remember all those names. Why don't the
people in charge of flowers just come up with one flower with one
name and let it go at that?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are vegetables and fruits, which also grow in
gardens. Please see above note on radishes. A lot of baby boomers
are into veggies and fruits, which they nag are good for me, as
opposed to, say, red meat. What these people do not understand is
that vegetables and fruit are the worst things you can eat. Why?
Because they grow in dirt, is why. And what's the first thing your
mother tells you when you are first let out of the house? ``Don't
put that dirt in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   So, meat is healthier. Because when you shoot the cow, and it
falls over, you just don't eat meat from the side that fell on the
dirt. More important, you cannot grow cows in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   For me, this is good, because did I mention that I do not
garden?

THREE FOR THE ROAD: WAGON, SUV, AND BIG-BUCK BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that in-between time in the automotive year. The 2000
models are being unveiled weekly amid lots of hype, introductory
advertising, and general interest, but there are plenty of 1999s
still around for end- of-the-year clearance selling.
</P>
<P>
   This is a day to look across the board for a final fling with
two _ a Suzuki Esteem GLX 1.8 wagon and an Infiniti Qx4 SUV _ plus
a second person's look at the future, Mercedes' top-of-the-line
S430. They represent three weeks of normal commuter driving and
pretty much span the economic rainbow. The group includes one
vehicle I wouldn't want to buy, one I might but probably wouldn't,
and one I'd love to own except that it's in the class of ``if you
have to ask the price, you can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Suzuki was a nice-looking basic car with plenty of amenities
tacked on _ air, tape deck, cruise, power windows, ABS, sunroof,
roof rack, two-tone paint _ powered by a 1.8-liter four with
four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked, there was good room in front, decent space in
back but, sizewise, this is a small vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Any time I drive a new car, there are several chores before
turning the key.
</P>
<P>
   First is a basic walk-around, looking a nothing in particular
(except tires) and everything in general (windows, paint, lights,
possible dings, styling).
</P>
<P>
   Second is the same thing inside, a
once-slowly-around-the-dashboard examination that generally
necessitates a preliminary look at the owner's manual to clarify
any questions. In this case the only question was: Who designed the
garish upholstery?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we adjust the mirrors and set some radio presets, not
the easiest of chores in this vehicle. The optional Clarion AM/FM
cassette sound system is festooned with myriad tiny buttons, almost
too small to decipher from the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. AM Radio wants his talk, sports, news, and traffic. Leaving
work at night _ actually early in the morning _ it's his habit to
check the FAN (660 AM in New York) to hear their nonpareil
overnight man, Joe Benigno, for late news, the New York view and
any brewing Boston-New York controversies.
</P>
<P>
   The Suzuki's Clarion radio does fine on the reception end, but
even my less-than-giant fingers might as well have been all thumbs
trying to find buttons. Don't even ask about trying to find the one
that switches the display from radio frequency to the time of day
(gotta check that traffic on the threes).
</P>
<P>
   So much for the radio.
</P>
<P>
   How about the suspension?
</P>
<P>
   Most cars don't like speed bumps, and you can count the Suzuki
among those that really don't like them. I tried taking my
punishment in slow motion and at speed (15-20 miles per hour). But,
otherwise, the ride was fine.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was adequate to keeping up with traffic, but you
never got the feeling there was a lot more under your foot. Fuel
economy was a bit of a payback. It's rated a respectable 26-33 with
the automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing the Esteem wagon has going for it is that
station wagons are coming back into vogue, and Suzuki is positioned
nicely price-wise at the lower end.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Door No. 2 is our Infiniti SUV.
</P>
<P>
   One of the items _ besides $8,000-$10,000 more on the sticker _
that distinguish the QX4 from its humbler cousin, the Nissan
Pathfinder, is the selectable four-wheel drive option.
</P>
<P>
   My preference would be to save money and buy an all-wheel-drive
wagon instead of an SUV, but one late-night incident endeared this
vehicle to me forever.
</P>
<P>
   Coming north on the Expressway at 1:30 a.m. fresh after a
thunderstorm had left the road slick with grease, the QX4
threatened to come unglued each time it hit one of the wet
expansion grates. Halfway up the highway my brain engaged enough to
hit the switch for four-wheel drive. The Infiniti calmed right
down.
</P>
<P>
   Enough that I convinced myself to turn around, drive back
through town, and repeat the trip in four-wheel drive. Just as it
was time to hit the aforementioned expansion grates, I spotted the
flashing blue lights ahead. A rear-wheel drive BMW had spun
backward and was hung up on the right-lane guard rail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the extra dough is worth it after all.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the QX4's looks and amenities are first-class; ride,
handling, acceleration are so-so.
</P>
<P>
   My guaranteed late-night ABS test (hitting the brakes coming to
a stop sign that's in a mine field of dew-covered manhole covers)
shows it stops OK _ but needs the extra space for its weight.
</P>
<P>
   The looks, $35,000-plus price tag, and amenities will impress
the neighbors, but you can get the same performace in a Pathfinder
for a lot less with the caveat that the selectable four-wheel drive
is a big plus.
</P>
<P>
   So what does an S-Class Mercedes have in common with these two
cars?
</P>
<P>
   Not much.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's how much chance it has of winding up in my
driveway, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a show-stopper of a car. It brought out our entire
neighborhood _ men and women _ to sit in, admire, and try to see
what Mercedes hid under the shrouded engine compartment (a
275-horsepower, 4.3-liter V8).
</P>
<P>
   The V8 made short work of my on-ramp acceleration test, merging
smoothly and effortlessly into 70 mile-per-hour traffic on
Interstate 93.
</P>
<P>
   If you like gadgetry, this is the car for you. It's got 380
pages of owner's manual, plus a separate booklet for the navigation
system.
</P>
<P>
   Said navigation system announces turns up to 900 feet in advance
to give you time to change lanes. It also impressed the family by
routing us through a maze local streets.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the cash (figure $70,000), this is a sensational
vehicle, the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the rest of us is that as the best get better,
they cause a rising tide throughout the industry and, in a few
years, our ``affordable'' vehicles will incorporate much of what
separates this car from today's pack.

A STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN OR THE ROAD TO HELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stairway to the stars. The stairway to heaven. Stairways are
often mentioned in song and story, and are usually elegant,
sweeping in a curve that makes going up or down a grand experience.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``The Spiral Staircase''? That scary movie had an
elegant stairway. And, I think there was beauty in ``GWTW.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, we take stairways for granted, but if you think about it
they are anything but simple.
</P>
<P>
   So you want to build your own stairway? With luck, you'll have a
stairway to heaven. Without it, your stairway may turn into the
road to hell.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest to build is an outdoor stairway that is made of
pressure-treated lumber and open to the sky, so you don't have to
worry about headroom. Headroom in a covered stairway is an
important consideration, to keep from banging your head.
</P>
<P>
   For any outdoor stairway, all you need is pre-cut stringers,
treads and supports, because most outdoor stairs have open risers;
that is, there is no riser board under each tread.
</P>
<P>
   The stringer can be a 2 x 12 notched sawtooth style to
accommodate each tread. Treads to use are the one-inch-thick
pressure-treated boards; two for each tread, spaced 3/8 inch apart
for drainage.
</P>
<P>
   Another stringer technique is to use two 2 x 12s and attach
steel cleats to carry each tread. Lumber stores carry these items,
with stringers ranging from two or three steps to a dozen or so.
Actaully, you can use an ordinary 2 x 4 as a cleat.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the stringers is important, and you need the proper
space for setting. The stringer must be set at a certain angle to
be sure the treads are level. Off-level treads are a distinct
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   You can set the stringer bottoms on a concrete block set on or
in the ground, but with that arrangement the stairs could rise and
fall with freezing in the ground, and if the top of the stairs is
attached to the house, eventually heaving can knock them out of
position.
</P>
<P>
   It is better to set the stringer bottoms on a foundation, a slab
of concrete set three feet into the ground. Done right, it won't
move, winter or summer.
</P>
<P>
   Craft Patterns, the company that makes plans for
do-it-yourselfers, has a plan that allows you to cut your own
stringers. (See elsewhere on this page.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether you build your own stairs or have a complete staircase
installed (usually indoors), there are certain rules to follow.
Fortunately, there are not many rules, but they are essential to
make a strong, safe, even comfortable stairway.
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule is 25. That's simple, isn't it, but it
means that the sum of two risers and one tread should equal 25
inches, give or take an inch or so. Ideal is a riser 7 to 7 1/2
inches and a tread 10 to 11 inches. Example: 7 1/2 + 7 1/2 + 10
(EQ) 25.
</P>
<P>
   The width of a stairway should be enough to accommodate two
people passing each other. Three feet is acceptable, 3 1/2 feet
much better.
</P>
<P>
   Headroom is another rule: Codes require a minimum of 6 feet 8
inches between a tread and the ceiling above. Most experts suggest
a greater headroom, from 7 feet 4 inches to 7 feet 7 inches, high
enough to swing your arm over your head without hitting anything.
</P>
<P>
   A final rule is the height of the railing. A rail of 30 inches
along the slope of the stairs and 34 inches along level stretches
is accepted as standard, but recently some codes have adopted 36
inches along the slope and 42 inches along level areas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this information is contained in the Brosco catalog,
available at lumber stores. It is published by Brockway-Smith, a
distributor of staircases, stair parts, windows, doors, cupolas,
entryways, molding, and a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Such information is clear, concise, easy to read, and simply but
nicely illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   And, just a few more rules about outdoor stairways. Treads 3
feet or wider should be supported by a third, middle stringer.
Generally, the span between stringers should not be less than two
feet.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a long run of steps, there should be middle support for
the stringers.
</P>
<P>
   An unwritten rule is consistency. All treads, no matter what
their dimensions, must be equal to each other; all risers must be
equal to each other.
</P>
<P>
   This is to make the stair user comfortable as he or she climbs
or descends the steps. If one riser and/or tread is different, the
user will go off balance, a serious hazard on stairways.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever stepped off a high curb or step or a low one
without paying attention, you know this rule is important.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor stairs are relatively easy to build, indoor ones are a
whole other story, mainly because of space restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A straight stairway is the easiest, and still not that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the height of the stairs; the distance the stairs
have to bridge from finished floor to finished floor.
</P>
<P>
   For an 8-foot ceiling, this distance is typically 106 inches;
always work in inches. This 106 inches is obviously 10 more inches
than the 96-inch ceiling height, because it includes the joists of
the second floor, plus the thickness of the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Divide 106 by the number of risers to reach the next floor,
which in the example is 14; 106 divided by 14 is 7 1/2 inches,
ideal for a riser. Well, it is not exactly 7 1/2 inches, but it is
adequate for the example. Another way to do it is to divide 7 1/2
(the riser height) into 106, and you get a shade over 14, the
number of steps needed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, figure the run (the horizontal length) of the stairs. A
tread is typically 10 inches, not counting the nosing, the part of
the tread that overhangs the riser.
</P>
<P>
   There is always one fewer tread than there are risers, so
multiply 10 times 13 to determine the total length. For a straight
run of 14 risers, the run distance is 130 inches. That is how much
floor space the stairs take up.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can set up a landing to make sure the steps are at
their proper angle. A landing can be in the middle of a straight
run but most landings allow the stair make a 90-degree turn.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy every stair part you need at lumber stores, or order
them from Brockway-Smith, through a local lumber store. Home Depot
and other chain suppliers have a pretty good inventory in stock.
</P>
<P>
   A do-it-yourself stairway might save money over a pre-fab one,
but with even a simple straight one or a curved, flying staircase,
it might be better to have it done professionally, and use cash or
card.

IS SILICON VALLEY LOSING ITS LUSTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whither Silicon Valley? The fertile high-tech
crescent? The Paris of digital culture? The heart of more wealth
creation than any economy in history?
</P>
<P>
   Every year or so, doomsayers warn the Valley will lose
high-flying companies and highly skilled workers to other regions,
such as the ``Silicon Forest'' in Seattle and the ``Silicon Alley''
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A new scary omen comes in a survey of 100 companies by Joint
Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a public policy organization in
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   If Silicon Valley doesn't watch out, it could lose its prized
workers to areas with cheaper housing, lighter traffic and
tax-cutting local governments, the survey says. Already, the
California's Silicon Valley faces a shortage of 160,000 skilled
workers this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it holds a leadership position, Silicon Valley faces
significant pressures which may threaten its status as the hub of
the Internet industry,'' said Ben Smith, a principal at A.T.
Kearney, the management consulting firm that conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like sports team owners threatening to leave town if they
don't get that new stadium or arena. It's hard to imagine the
Silicon Valley's elite work force fleeing the San Francisco Bay
Area for Seattle's rain forest or Manhattan's subway jungle.
</P>
<P>
   It's even harder to imagine them jetting to Washington, D.C., to
create software startups in the ``Silicon Dominion.''
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, Silicon Valley is the most treasured economic
base in the world. Its corporate landscape is unrivaled in dynamism
and creativity, feeding the Bay Area's $213 billion economy and
creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in California over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Santa Clara County boasts the second-highest
median income for joint tax returns among California counties, at
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, sky-high real estate values keep newcomers out. But a
whole bunch of homeowners feel awfully good about their assets now.
</P>
<P>
   Congested freeways? Compared to Los Angeles, where rush-hour
traffic on the San Diego Freeway is bumper-to-bumper for nearly 100
miles, Silicon Valley is a casual drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other regions may have some elements of Silicon Valley, but none
has all of the region's desirable traits: stunning weather,
beautiful mountains, a gorgeous ocean. World-class Stanford
University and the University of California at Berkeley. The army
of venture capital companies in Menlo Park's Sand Hill Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, the cost of living is fairly high and the traffic is
bad,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst at Giga Information Group in
San Jose who has lived here since 1984. ``But my wife and I don't
want to pull up roots. We'll miss our home, the weather _
everything, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many of the Valley's top corporations already have been
transformed into hybrid global creatures with headquarters in the
Valley and manufacturing plants elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel Corp., for one, has 8,500 employees at its corporate
offices in Santa Clara and the rest of its 65,000-strong work force
at sites in Folsom, Calif., Portland, Ore., Chandler, Ariz., and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silicon Valley's economic model has evolved and changed into a
global model,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman. ``The talent
is still here, but there also are limits to physical growth in the
Valley.''

MAKING IT IN MODELING

Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling
212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The notion of modeling conjures up visions of grandeur
and glamour. But how does one get to be a model? By hitting the
circuit. Retailers need new faces for ads, catalogs, and runway
shows. Corporations need models for brochures. But landing an good
jobs takes stamina. Here, at different stages of their careers, are
four people who are making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen her in Foot Locker. She's the poster girl
kneeing the soccer ball. Or in Talbots Kids. Her 6-foot-tall
picture greeted customers in stores last winter. Then there was the
full-page Filene's newspaper ad last month.
</P>
<P>
   Adrianna Farley is a model on the rise. Only 11 years old, she's
in demand almost every week by various clients: Ames Department
Stores, Papa Gino's, BJ's Wholesale Club, MediaOne, and Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 1/2 feet and 60 pounds, with freckles, and brown hair and
eyes, Farley has the girl-next-door look of the moment. And she's
loving it. ``It's fun,'' she says. ``I get to go to new places like
Rhode Island. . . . I've seen myself in newspapers and magazines.''
Best of all, she says, ``People do your hair and makeup for you.
It's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley has been modeling since 1997, when her family signed her
up with an agency. ``At the time, she was playing a lot of tennis
and it was getting really expensive. I thought, `If it works, she
could pay for her own lessons,' '' says her mother, Michelle. Now
Farley is so busy modeling she doesn't have time for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her schedule, Farley has maintained her life as a normal
fifth grader at an Easton, Mass. elementary school. She's still
playing soccer, still taking gymnastics, and dance lessons. But she
can't bite her nails anymore. And, in case she nicks her legs or
arms, she can't be too aggressive in sports. ``That's how I used to
be,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To attend all her shoots, Farley skips school occasionally or
leaves early. ``I make up the work,'' says the straight-A student,
who often does homework during downtime on the job. Says Michelle,
``It's all a huge balancing act. We want to make sure that nothing
gets taken too seriously on any end.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical job for Farley lasts one to two hours. In studios,
photographers sometimes direct Farley on poses but often let her do
her own thing. ``Usually it's hands on your hips or head,'' she
says. ``Always smile. Show your teeth. Nothing too wacko.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thrill for the Farley family? Walking through the
South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Mass. and coming upon the 6-foot
poster of Adriana at Talbots. ``None of us were prepared for it,''
says Michelle. ``They had photographed two girls. We warned
Adriana, `It may be you, it may not be.' We just stood there
amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley's goal is eventually to move to New York. ``It would be
kind of neat going into Seventeen or some magazine like that,'' she
says. ``Hopefully one day I can be a supermodel. To model for
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch _ that's my favorite store _ or the Gap or the
Limited, that's the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oneka LaBennett is a reluctant success story. She has modeled on
Tommy Hilfiger's runway, in TJ Maxx's ads, and in Vibe magazine.
But all that takes a backseat to the doctorate in anthropology
she's earning at Harvard. ``I'm hoping to teach someday,'' says the
25-year-old Somerville, Mass. resident.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, earning $1,200 to $1,400 a day modeling three to
five outfits for Filene's ads isn't a bad option. ``They give you
lunch too,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8 1/2, 112-pound LaBennett never even considered
modeling until three years ago. Walking down Newbury Street,
someone mistook her for a model. ``I was just a poor student. I
started thinking, `I could use the extra money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring her flexible schedule would be a plus, LaBennett took
the plunge. ``You can decide how much time you want to devote to
it,'' she says. For her, that means spending four hours a month in
shows at Saks Fifth Avenue, Macy's, and MaxMara, or doing print
campaigns for local retailers.
</P>
<P>
   LaBennett, a native of Guyana, doesn't talk about her modeling
when she's at Harvard. ``It's not a secret, but it has nothing to
do with my academic career,'' she says. But when she appeared on a
giant Marshall's poster on Boylston Street two years ago, the word
got out. ``Everyone I know saw it,'' she groans. Not that she's
ashamed, mind you. LaBennett just doesn't like to be typed as a
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of negative stereotypes about models.
People think models are anorexic, have easy lives, are very
superficial and airheaded,'' she says. ``Often times, a model is
the last person whose opinion or comfort is considered. A lot of
clients think models don't eat so they don't feed you. Or they have
you standing for hours in uncomfortable shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBennett, who eats ``like, 10 meals a day,'' has no interest in
pursuing a full-time modeling career. ``The computer I'm using this
morning was bought with modeling money. It's been a godsend. I
can't laugh at it,'' but ``I've always been a really good student.
I enjoy modeling because it's secondary to my career. It's a nice
dichotomy. As a student, everything is so cerebral. Once in a
while, I get to be glamorous.''

   When Tim O'Toole posed in a photo with a friend in 1991, he had
no idea the snapshot would lead to an international modeling
career. His friend sent the photo to a Boston modeling agency,
which liked O'Toole's look. The agency called him in.
</P>
<P>
   He was sent to Filene's ``for a look-see,'' and ``that very day
Filene's said, `Put this jacket on,' '' says O'Toole. ``They shot
me. It ran in The Boston Globe the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1987 graduate of Northeastern University, O'Toole was working
as a freelance video producer. ``I decided to model for the extra
cash,'' says the 34-year-old. ``I started traveling, doing print
work for retail stores. I went to Florida to shoot L.L. Bean in the
winter. I decided to stay because there's a big modeling scene in
Miami in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, O'Toole posed for catalogs for such department stores
as Hills and Dillard's before meeting a scout from a Tokyo modeling
agency. Just a year into the business, O'Toole _ who didn't speak a
word of Japanese _ hopped on a Tokyo-bound plane.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-tall, blue-eyed O'Toole was a hit. He modeled for
magazines, department stores, mail-order catalogs, and TV
commercials. ``They like that all-American look: blond hair, blue
eyes. . . They like Western culture, but to them, it's not American
unless a Western model is modeling it.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, O'Toole ended up in Milan doing runway work for
fashion shows and spreads for Italian magazines. ``Milan is like a
training ground. It's a mecca for modeling. There are a lot of
photographers there, a lot of magazines. The chances of getting
editorial work for your book is good.''
</P>
<P>
   But not so the pay: A typical magazine spread for a novice model
might pay $300, and a runway show $500, he says. ``There's a joke
in Milan,'' says O'Toole. ``You have to pay the magazines to be
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his experiences, O'Toole maintained a residence in
the city's Brighton neighborhood. Now he works with agencies in
four US cities, as well as one in Milan and one in Tokyo, traveling
to model for companies such as J.C. Penney and for magazines such
as Esquire and Details. ``Some clients will pay for your flight to
come down. Some won't,'' he says. ``But if I have a booking in
Atlanta for $1,300 a day and I can get a flight for $300, I can
still make $1,000 in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also found work closer to home. ``Today I'm shooting up
in Gloucester. It's a catalog thing for Northern Isles, the sweater
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Medfield, O'Toole is committed to the area. ``It
would be better for me to be in New York, but I'd rather not. I'm a
Bostonian at heart. I like the quality of life here.''

   Linda Cole was born into fashion. As the daughter of Yolanda
Cellucci, owner of Yolanda's boutique in Waltham, Cole knew major
designers such as Oscar de la Renta and Bill Blass when she was a
child. At 5-feet-9 1/2, it's no surprise that Cole _ who is also a
cousin of Gov. Paul Cellucci _ went into modeling. But in 1977,
when she started in New York, ``you had to be a very blond,
blue-eyed all-American girl to make it,'' says the brunette.
``Cybill Shepherd and Cheryl Tiegs were huge. Being dark and
Italian, I was turned down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole even changed her name from Linda Susan Nicole Cellucci to
Lynn Nicole, since it sounded ``less ethnic,'' she says. But at
castings, people kept calling out ``Lin Da Cole'' by mistake so she
adopted the name.
</P>
<P>
   At 128 pounds, Cole was considered too heavy by industry
standards. ``I dieted myself crazy,'' she says. ``I remember eating
an apple, cottage cheese, and a bran muffin a day.''
</P>
<P>
   After being rejected repeatedly by agencies in New York, Cole
took the advice of a friend and moved to Milan in 1980, where she
found success doing fashion spreads for Italian magazines and
catalogs, as well as runway shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who grew up in a Waltham house across the street from
Yolanda's, agreed to move back to Boston in 1984 after meeting her
future husband, Sebuh Petrosian, during a US visit. Petrosian was
attending Boston University. ``I went to see Saks, Lord &AMP; Taylor,
Jordan Marsh, and Neiman Marcus,'' she says. With her international
experience, she quickly developed a list of regular clients,
including Talbots, Hit or Miss, and local designers Alfred Fiandaca
and David Josef.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Cole had her first son (she has two now, ages 10 and
5). ``At the time, people said: `Oh, your career's over. What are
you going to do now?' '' she recalls. ``It turns out modeling is
perfect for moms. In the morning, I do house stuff and work out.
Then I can do a show from 11 to 1:30. Pick up my little one at 2.
Take my other son to karate at 2:30 and still get dinner on.''
</P>
<P>
   Being older has its limits, says the 36-year-old Cole. ``I have
a beautiful body for my age, but I can't compete with an
18-year-old. . . . I've become synonymous with Frugal Fannie's.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's her role as a suburban mom. ``When I pick up the
boys, people ask, `What do you do?' To say the word `model' almost
sounds conceited. I say, `I'm in fashion or retail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cole sometimes reflects on her former international career. ``I
have friends I see on TV all the time. Sometimes I think, `If I had
stayed, I might have broken through.' But I wanted to be married
and have a family. I don't have a trillion dollars, but I'm really
happy.''

A SUMMER VISITOR STOPS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm on vacation at home for the very strangest reason.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie has come to live with us for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I met Rosie in Mexico two years ago. Jack wanted
to improve his Spanish because he interviews Hispanic patients at
the Lynn Community Health Center where he works, and so he made an
agreement to speak with Rosie, who worked in the front office of
the resort where we stayed, for an hour a day for a week. The
vocabulary he was trying to master was deeply personal. They
connected and continued their friendship by mail over the winter.
When we returned to Costa Azul last year, we urged Rosie to visit
us if she ever made it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Midwinter, the phone rang. We both picked up. ``Is it OK, I am
coming to visit you at the summer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie, we'd love to have you. When are you planning to come?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I arrive Boston on July the 5th.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wonderful. How long do you plan to stay?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I return on August the 20.''
</P>
<P>
   We gulped, but only for a instant. Sometimes, when events begin
to unfold far differently than we've imagined, Jack and I feel
caught in the grasp of destiny. It's an intoxicating feeling, a
thrilling release from too much planning and sterile
predictability. Six weeks of living with a total stranger? Why not
say yes? Why not let life, with all its mischievous twists and
turns, take us for a ride?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Rosie,'' we both said in tandem. ``We can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a dark-haired, smiling girl of 24 walked toward us at
Logan Airport at midnight on July 5, I realized how little thought
I'd given to what would happen after she arrived. She'd settle into
our back bedroom and then . . . what? How would we amuse her? Where
would I find the time for her? How would I ever manage to make
three decent meals for six weeks? With my limited Spanish, what
would I say to her?
</P>
<P>
   I had absolutely no idea.
</P>
<P>
   But now that she's finally here, I realize why she was meant to
come. Time, as I usually experience it, has stopped. No more
rushing, no more feeling the pressure, when I wake up first thing
in the morning, of how much I have to accomplish before I collapse
into bed at night. I'm letting my great ambitions languish.
</P>
<P>
   The first day she was here, we went food shopping. The
experience was fascinating. ``Sorry, Rosie, Mexican food only comes
in boxes and cans.'' ``No, we don't have our big meal at
lunchtime.'' I discovered, to my amazement, that the familiar,
formerly unexceptional, man behind the deli counter was Colombian
and that Benjamin _ pronounced ``Ben-ha-meen'' _ was capable of
conversing in Spanish at top speed.
</P>
<P>
   After shopping for groceries, we went visiting. We dropped in
without warning on my friend Judith. (I can't remember the last
time I did that.) We had iced tea on my daughter Laura's porch.
(Why do I always run in and out and never sit down?) As long as I
was making dinner, I invited my daughter Julie and her husband to
join us for a long leisurely meal. In Rosie's presence, time has
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of day that I picture happening only in Provence
or Tuscany, and then only in the movies. Good food and good
company. An aimless day, interrupted only by enjoyable activities
and long relaxed conversations, full of amusing stories. It is the
kind of day we've been having day after day, ever since. My list of
things to do sits neglected on the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that my husband took this time to come home
with Rachel Ramen's book, ``Kitchen Table Wisdom,'' because this is
what she had to say to me in her introduction: ``Sitting around the
table telling stories is not just a way of passing time. It is . .
. the stuff that helps us to live a life worth remembering. Despite
the awesome powers of technology many of us still do not live very
well. We may need to listen to each other's stories once again. . .
. Real stories take time. We stopped telling stories when we
started to lose that sort of time, pausing time, reflecting time,
wondering time. Life rushes us along and few people are strong
enough to stop on their own. Most often, something unforeseen stops
us and it is only then we have the time to take a seat at life's
kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   Something unforeseen. I can now say that in Spanish. ``Rosie.''

CARPENTER ANTS PRODUCE _ SURPRISE _ SAWDUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. One of my big trees has a pile of sawdust at the base, and I
see little ants around it. Are they termites or carpenter ants? My
house still seems pretty sturdy.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL SHULMAN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Chances are that they are carpenter ants, and while carpenter
ants are normally pretty large, those little ones might be busy
babies. Carpenter ants tunnel in the wood, pushing it out of their
nest, leaving the telltale piles of sawdust. Termites, on the other
hand, eat their fill of wood from the inside out, usually not
showing any damage until the tree or house falls down.
</P>
<P>
   The carpenter ants might be quite happy in the tree, leaving the
house intact. And if there is no damp, punky wood in the house,
they may stay away. So, make a periodic examination of the house,
looking for those little piles of sawdust, anywhere in the house:
attic, basement, living quarters, even near the foundation outside.
</P>
<P>
   Also, inspect the tree; this is important to make sure it is not
all hollowed out and in imminent danger of falling. Just tap the
trunk and branches you can reach; you are checking for a hollow
sound, indicating that the trunk or branches, or both, are indeed
hollow and could fall. If you find any hollow areas, you can cut
the branches or have the tree cut down.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do I need to do to maintain a septic tank? Are some
detergents harmful to septic tanks?
</P>
<P>
   SKEPTICAL
</P>
<P>
   A. Some detergents can be harmful to septic tanks by creating
more suds than the tank can take, and a buildup of foam could
interfere with the leaching field. Other than that, if the tank and
leaching field are working (the tank fills with solids and the
leaching field allows liquids to seep into the ground), the only
maintenance is to have the tank pumped every three to five years.
The more system users there are, the more often the tank must be
pumped.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else is needed. What normally goes into the tank creates
enough bacteria to do their work. No additives needed. The baking
soda people (Arm and Hammer, naturally) suggest putting a cup of
baking soda down the drain once a month or so. But that is all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some starter fertilizer was spilled on my new concrete apron
around the pool and stained the concrete a rust color. How can I
remove it?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID LONEGRAN, Atkinson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. The rust stains will probably weather off eventually. But to
hasten their removal, try this: Mix 4 ounces oxalic acid in a quart
of hot water, and pour or brush this on the stains. Let it dry. The
oxalic acid crystals will reappear; sweep them up and throw them
away carefully; they are toxic. Repeat as necessary. You could also
try a semitransparent house stain, which would cover the stain and
provide a color other than the concrete color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'd like to paint a tree house I built for my kids. What can
I use? The house is made of plywood and pine trim. The floor of the
house is plywood. What can I treat it with?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY STEARNS, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have two choices, and paint is not one of them. Paint
needs a primer and will add an extra chore to the project. So,
instead of paint, use two thin coats of a latex solid stain. It
looks like paint and comes in all colors. It can peel, but chances
are that it will not in this application. Better yet, in my
opinion, is to apply a semitransparent stain; only one coat is
needed, every five years. It will not peel. Everything else can
peel.
</P>
<P>
   For the floor, use a semitransparent oil stain. One coat will
last three to five years and look good.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to semitransparent stains, if you want to call it a
drawback, is the limited choice of colors: barn red, blue, shades
of gray, and shades of brown. I don't call that a drawback because
it performs very well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a new steel insulated door. It is never in the sun. I
know there is a taboo for storms on a steel insulated door, but can
I put a storm door over it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, what should I check for on a new vinyl replacement sash
being installed?
</P>
<P>
   JERRY RUSSO, Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the warnings mention whether the steel door is
in the sun or not, but if it is really in the shade all day, then
go ahead. If the door breaks or warps, you know that you and I are
wrong. If the door does give you problems (peeling paint and a
hopelessly hot door), you could drill weep holes in all four
corners of the storm to try to release some of that hot air.
</P>
<P>
   What to look for in a vinyl window? If you have not bought these
windows, I suggest you buy a vinyl-clad or aluminum-clad window.
What else? Check for air leaks between the new jamb and the
vertical stud of the rough opening. This is the biggest source of
leaks, due to faulty insulation. Also, between windows and jamb,
where the sash slides up and down.

APPLICATIONS THAT ADVERTISE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker are two neat programs for creating
images to put on Web pages. But these programs also represent
fundamental change in the direction of desktop computing _ a change
that might ultimately make more software available at lower prices
for everyone, while making them more annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they could simply be momentary economic aberrations.
It's really too early to tell for sure.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker, developed by Andover.Net in South
Acton, Mass., are Web-based applications. Unlike normal
applications, which you download and run on your computer, these
two are run through a Web browser while you are connected to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks is the simpler program of the two. It can rotate
images, resize them, or apply a number of different ``effects,''
such as embossing or sharpening. The program also has a number of
features that are optimized for Web page creation: You can reduce
the number of colors, or create an animated GIF. Andover has also
put together a large collection of images that you can freely
incorporate into your own Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   3DTextMaker is a program for making buttons with text that go on
Web pages. You choose a font, a color, and effect, and add some
text. Then you click a button and the Web site creates a button or
a banner with the text that you requested. Once you make a button,
you can then save it to your computer's hard drive, or you can
click a link, take the program back into GIFWorks, and make further
changes to it there. Or you can click a menu item that says ``FTP
Transload'' and send the image to Web site using the Internet's
File Transfer Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   GIFWorks and 3DTextMaker are just two of the applications that
the folks at Andover.Net have put together for building Web sites.
Another application is ButtonMaker, which turns a GIF into a
button. There also is FontMapper, a simple utility that shows how
different characters are displayed in different fonts. And there is
HTMLWorks, a program that lets you edit the HTML code on your Web
page, save it back to your Web server, and validate _ that is, to
check it to make sure that there aren't any errors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Andover's programs are a bit buggy _ for example, I
couldn't get the ``sharpen'' feature in GIFWorks to work properly.
Others are somewhat limited. But fortunately, since these are
Web-based applications, all Andover has to do is fix the program.
Unlike a traditional software publisher, such as Microsoft, Andover
doesn't have take the time or spend the money to distribute the
fixed program to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference between the Andover Web-based
applications and traditional computer apps is the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Andover.Net is a network of advertiser-supported Web sites.
Every time you click a button on the GIFWorks or 3DTextMaker Web
page, a new banner advertisement appears at the top of the screen.
According to the company's rate card, these ads cost between $42
and $70 for every thousand impressions. Those rates may seem rather
high; Andover justifies its prices by saying that 41 percent of its
Web site visitors work in information technology, and 69 percent
are personally responsible for purchasing computer products for
their companies.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue adds up quickly for Web-based applications.
For example, a typical session with GIFWorks might involve clicking
50 menu items, which translates to roughly $2 in revenue. Use the
program to design even a small Web site and you might earn $20 or
more for the company. Use Andover's tools religiously for a few
months, and you could earn hundreds of dollars for them.
</P>
<P>
   These economics stand in stark contrast to the way traditional
application programs are sold. Consider Adobe ImageStyler, a
program that is far more sophisticated than the Web-based
applications that Andover has put together. ImageStyler has a
retail price of $130, of which Adobe probably sees less than $100.
So while Andover's programs may be ``free'' for the user, they
ultimately cost far more than the alternative. The cost is hidden
because the user doesn't pay _ the advertiser does.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this situation can be stable for very long.
Something has to give. One possibility is that Andover's
advertisements are overpriced. Andover's claims that its Web site
visitors are decision-makers may be true, but most of the
advertisements that I have seen on the 3DTextMaker Web site are for
instant-win sweepstakes, low-cost telephone cards, Web-based email
services, and the Women's World Wrestling Federation. Ultimately,
the company many not be able to justify the cost of its
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way the economics could work out. We might
start seeing advertisements in other applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, my copy of Quicken '99 shows me ads when I download
stock quotes and news stories from the Internet. (You are supposed
to be able to turn off the ads, but for some reason that feature of
Quicken '99 doesn't work for me.) Another program that comes
prewired to display advertising is the new ``G2 Player'' from
RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   A few years from now, paid advertisements might be a standard
part of most desktop applications. After all, advertising is an
untapped and potentially large source of revenue for software
publishers. This potential might be difficult for them to resist.
</P>
<P>
   There might be two versions of Adobe's ImageStyler program in
the future: a low-cost version that shows advertisements, and a
high-cost version that doesn't. Ultimately, our computer screens
might resemble the signs along a typical highway, with a few
rectangles devoted to the actual business of desktop computing, and
the rest of the rectangles devoted to the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a future that I eagerly await.

FOX CAN'T WAIT TO FIELD RACY `ACTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ After less than a year as president of
entertainment at the Fox network, Doug Herzog is clearly dying to
make some waves.
</P>
<P>
   With a scabrous new comedy titled ``Action'' that Herzog is
championing for the fall season, those waves could grow to tidal
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know `Action' is going to offend some people, no doubt about
it,'' Herzog says, appearing to relish the prospect. ``Much of the
best comedy does that.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell whether ``Action'' deserves to be considered in a
class with the late, lamented ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' the HBO
program to which Herzog compared ``Action.'' To judge by the pilot,
``Action'' does promise to be a smart, funny, well-written, and
knowing satire that lays bare the inner workings of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also unusually raunchy, even by the historically
supple standards of Fox. At a time when concerns over the racy
content of many television programs have intensified, with many
parents aghast at what their kids are exposed to, ``Action'' could
prove the latest lightning rod that crystallizes those concerns.
HBO has freely crossed the line with ``Larry Sanders'' and other
shows like ``The Sopranos'' without creating an uproar because it
is a pay-cable channel, but Fox, a broadcast network that is
available in most of the nation's 99 million TV homes, is unlikely
to escape controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Herzog, who brought ``South Park'' to Comedy Central
when he headed that cable channel, seems worried.
</P>
<P>
   As with so many ostensibly creative decisions made by TV
executives, the decision to schedule ``Action'' seems rooted at
least partly in a market strategy. ``We've pushed the envelope in a
lot of different ways,'' said Herzog. ``That's what we want to do
to differentiate ourselves. . . . We need to push the envelope. We
need to be relevant. That's what the audience expects from Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Herzog's predecessors suggested that a
calculated approach to attention-getting could backfire. Jamie
Kellner, who helped build the Fox network before moving on to found
the WB network, said of the current Fox strategy that ``as soon as
you tell people `We want to go further than anybody else,' there's
sort of an impurity to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' revolves around a venal-but-potentiallyredeemable
movie producer named Peter Dragon (played by Jay Mohr), whose
desperate search for his next blockbuster involves him with a
former child star-turned-prostitute named Wendy Ward (Illeana
Douglas) who is a shrewd judge of scripts. Peter has a young
daughter who lives with his ex-wife and her new husband, a gay
studio honcho, and is chauffered about by a former Borscht-Belt
comic played by Buddy Hackett. The show is expected to feature
numerous cameos by Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Keanu Reeves, appears in the pilot in a scene that
may raise eyebrows, with a hooker taking liberties with him from
her adjacent seat in a movie theater. Another scene shows Peter
Dragon stunned into speechlessness by the endowment of the gay
mogul as the mogul emerges from the shower. One joke revolves
around a waiter urinating in Peter's salad. Along with the
profanities TV viewers may have grown accustomed to, Dragon uses a
few _ bleeped out but easily recognizable _ that broadcast
television has not hitherto featured. ``We're clearly breaking some
new ground,'' conceded Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   The creator and stars of ``Action'' made a sometimes-combative
appearance before TV critics. Executive producer Chris Thompson
acknowledged that ``Action'' contains bleeped-out ``language you're
not usually allowed to use on television.'' But Thompson contended
that the language and the overall tone of the show is necessary to
accurately depict the ``profane world'' of Hollywood. ``It was
important to me that the people in this world . . . speak the way
they speak, at least at the meetings I go to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he claimed that ``the line always does move,'' Thompson
said the show's creators are ``extremely uncomfortable'' being
portrayed as the ``poster children'' of profanity. ``I'm not an
advocate of the coarsening of the culture,'' he maintained. ``I'm
not an advocate of the behavior in this show. I'm an observer of
it, a chronicler of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohr noted that the TV envelope has long been pushed by
characters ranging from Archie Bunker on ``All in the Family'' to
Al Bundy on ``Married . . . With Children.'' Criticizing TV writers
for putting himself, Douglas, and Thompson ``on the defensive,''
Mohr said: ``Let's not forget that we are bleeping, we're on late
at night, and we're just selling soap.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, ``Action'' underscores the migration of what
might be called a cable sensibility to the broadcast networks. As
they lose viewers to cable at a rapid pace, the networks clearly
want to tiptoe toward the cable-delineated edge whenever possible.
There is considerable two-way traffic on the executive level: Not
only does Herzog come from the cable world, but Thompson was a
producer on ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' and he originally developed
``Action'' for HBO before talks broke down over money.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Action'' is just one of several new Fox shows whose
content could raise hackles this fall. Among the others are a
family drama called ``Get Real,'' in which the parents are not much
perturbed at discovering their 17-year-old son naked in bed with a
girl. Herzog maintained that such scenes reflect ``reality,''
adding: ``I'm very comfortable with what we're putting on the
air.'' He said he ``urges (viewers) not to watch'' if they're
offended.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other networks, the Fox lineup for fall is notably
short of minority characters. Herzog said the network is ``looking
hard'' at the issue of diversity, and is adding a minority
character to the new ``Manchester Prep.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Herzog indicated that Fox will not rerun an episode of
``The Family Guy'' that contains a joke about John F. Kennedy Jr.,
who died last weekend in a plane crash. ``It's not something we
want on our air at the moment,'' he said.

CREATING WORKPLACE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICE  
 LINKING INFERTILITY TO A GENE MUTATION  
 MEDICAL JURY STILL OUT ON ALCOHOL FOR DIABETICS  
 ASSESSING WESTERN DIET AS A DEMENTIA PREVENTER

 Creating workplace healthy food choice
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of stop-smoking programs at work? Next, you may see
your company encouraging the consumption of low-fat, high-fiber
foods to cut cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Working Well Project,'' funded by the National Cancer
Institute, has found that increasing healthful food choices at work
and creating workplace taste and recipe contests can get employees
to change their eating habits _ which may ultimately reduce cancer
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the August issue of the journal Health
Education &AMP; Behavior, was led by Lois Beiner of the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, and involved more than 100 work sites and
18,000 employees around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also looked at stop-smoking programs, but,
surprisingly, found no additional benefit to workers from them.
They hypothesized that most people's attitudes toward smoking had
already changed over the years, ruling out any further improvements
from workplace programs.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; Linking infertility to a gene mutation
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A gene linked to a leading cause of infertility in women was
identified this week by Boston and Philadelphia researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Follistatin, as the gene is called, appears to be a factor in
polycystic ovary syndrome, which affects 4 percent of women of
child-bearing age and creates such symptoms as high levels of
testosterone and excessive facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issue of the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, involved an analysis of 37 genes
from pairs of sisters affected by the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The condition also increases the risk of diabetes, ovarian
cysts, and loss of menstrual periods.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Andrea Dunaif, senior author of the study and chief of
the division of women's health at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, cautioned that more research needs to be done before it is
proven that a mutation in the follistatin gene causes the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Medical jury still out on alcohol for diabetics
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People with diabetes are known to be at higher risk for heart
disease, but should they, like others, consume moderate amounts of
alcohol to prevent the disease?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, says a study in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that people who
developed diabetes as adults and also drank moderate amounts of
alcohol had about half the death rate from heart disease as
diabetics who did not drink.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate alcohol consumption was defined as one to two drinks a
day.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the American Heart Association issued a
warning about the study's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   While the report is ``interesting,'' said Dr. Robert H. Eckel,
chairman of the heart association's nutrition committee, he sounded
a ``cautionary note.'' Alcohol can affect blood sugar levels
differently in people with diabetes, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crucial for people with diabetes to work with their
health care providers to determine whether alcohol should fit into
their individualized nutrition plan,'' Eckel said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Assessing Western diet as a dementia preventer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Studies have found that traditional Asian diets, emphasizing
vegetables and complex carbohydrates, are better for the heart than
a typical Western diet filled with animal fat and protein.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study suggests that some component of the classic
Western diet better protects stroke victims from dementia than an
Asian diet.
</P>
<P>
   University of Hawaii researchers report the results of their
study in the current issue of the journal Neurology, which involved
3,500 elderly Japanese-American men.
</P>
<P>
   Dementia, or the loss of mental ability from stroke or other
causes, may result from a blockage of blood flow to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know exactly which nutrients in the Western diet may
cause a protective effect,'' said Dr. Web Ross of the Department of
Veterans Affairs and the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Singing the blues for jazz
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Jazz is alive and as well as can be expected these days.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Paris was once the home away from home for
American jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's more of a no-man's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think twice about paying $20 to hear an
orchestra, or $60 for an opera, or $30 for a musical, or $100 to
hear Bob Dylan. But ask them to pay $10 to hear jazz and their hair
stands on end.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what jazz pianist Christopher Culpo says.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't heard of Christopher Culpo?
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, that's exactly the point.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Culpo at age 38 should be famous. You should have
heard him and his trio at the little cafe cellar on the island of
the Seine, playing elegant Ellington, ``C Jam Blues,'' ``Mood
Indigo,'' ``Take the A Train.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you were like most everybody else in Paris after hours,
you would be at the ``techno bars,'' where computerized electronics
make up virtual music.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, is making a virtual nightmare for real-life
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, blame it on computers. But before that, there was TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miles Davis (legendary jazz trumpet player) said in his
autobiography that television in the 1960s is what destroyed the
nightlife of New York,'' said Culpo, a Massachusetts expatriate who
came to Paris in 1991 on a Fulbright scholarship. ``Because up
until then, people went out _ they had dinner, they went to plays,
they went to nightclubs.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and then added, ``And that was before cable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody is working until 9 p.m. All they feel like doing
when they get home is pulling a burger from the freezer, zapping it
and then falling asleep in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are less venues for all of us,'' Culpo said. ``Whether
musicians or actors or singers, we're fighting an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the big record companies are in trouble, with music being
circulated freely on the Internet and downloaded onto computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The life of the artist is not one he'd recommend for a young
American who may be looking to Paris for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   He makes ends meet, he said, ``like most musicians, by doing a
variety of things, including teaching and composing.''
</P>
<P>
   His composing may be a means to an end, he hopes, that will be
met with favor in London's West End this coming month.
</P>
<P>
   With music by Culpo and story by Australian writer Fiona Kent,
who found backing through a grant from Australia, the musical play
``Believe'' will open Aug. 3 for a three-week run at the Man in the
Moon Theatre in London.
</P>
<P>
   It's a jazzy presentation for piano and percussion, Culpo said,
all about a group of mostly young people ``who are looking quite
desperately for something to believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike some jazz musicians in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Best-case scenario: Christopher Culpo may end up famous after
all.

THREE FOR THE ROAD: WAGON, SUV, AND BIG-BUCK BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that in-between time in the automotive year. The 2000
models are being unveiled weekly amid lots of hype, introductory
advertising, and general interest, but there are plenty of 1999s
still around for end- of-the-year clearance selling.
</P>
<P>
   This is a day to look across the board for a final fling with
two _ a Suzuki Esteem GLX 1.8 wagon and an Infiniti Qx4 SUV _ plus
a second person's look at the future, Mercedes' top-of-the-line
S430. They represent three weeks of normal commuter driving and
pretty much span the economic rainbow. The group includes one
vehicle I wouldn't want to buy, one I might but probably wouldn't,
and one I'd love to own except that it's in the class of ``if you
have to ask the price, you can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Our Suzuki was a nice-looking basic car with plenty of amenities
tacked on _ air, tape deck, cruise, power windows, ABS, sunroof,
roof rack, two-tone paint _ powered by a 1.8-liter four with
four-speed automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked, there was good room in front, decent space in
back but, sizewise, this is a small vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Any time I drive a new car, there are several chores before
turning the key.
</P>
<P>
   First is a basic walk-around, looking a nothing in particular
(except tires) and everything in general (windows, paint, lights,
possible dings, styling).
</P>
<P>
   Second is the same thing inside, a
once-slowly-around-the-dashboard examination that generally
necessitates a preliminary look at the owner's manual to clarify
any questions. In this case the only question was: Who designed the
garish upholstery?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we adjust the mirrors and set some radio presets, not
the easiest of chores in this vehicle. The optional Clarion AM/FM
cassette sound system is festooned with myriad tiny buttons, almost
too small to decipher from the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. AM Radio wants his talk, sports, news, and traffic. Leaving
work at night _ actually early in the morning _ it's his habit to
check the FAN (660 AM in New York) to hear their nonpareil
overnight man, Joe Benigno, for late news, the New York view and
any brewing Boston-New York controversies.
</P>
<P>
   The Suzuki's Clarion radio does fine on the reception end, but
even my less-than-giant fingers might as well have been all thumbs
trying to find buttons. Don't even ask about trying to find the one
that switches the display from radio frequency to the time of day
(gotta check that traffic on the threes).
</P>
<P>
   So much for the radio.
</P>
<P>
   How about the suspension?
</P>
<P>
   Most cars don't like speed bumps, and you can count the Suzuki
among those that really don't like them. I tried taking my
punishment in slow motion and at speed (15-20 miles per hour). But,
otherwise, the ride was fine.
</P>
<P>
   The engine was adequate to keeping up with traffic, but you
never got the feeling there was a lot more under your foot. Fuel
economy was a bit of a payback. It's rated a respectable 26-33 with
the automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing the Esteem wagon has going for it is that
station wagons are coming back into vogue, and Suzuki is positioned
nicely price-wise at the lower end.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Door No. 2 is our Infiniti SUV.
</P>
<P>
   One of the items _ besides $8,000-$10,000 more on the sticker _
that distinguish the QX4 from its humbler cousin, the Nissan
Pathfinder, is the selectable four-wheel drive option.
</P>
<P>
   My preference would be to save money and buy an all-wheel-drive
wagon instead of an SUV, but one late-night incident endeared this
vehicle to me forever.
</P>
<P>
   Coming north on the Expressway at 1:30 a.m. fresh after a
thunderstorm had left the road slick with grease, the QX4
threatened to come unglued each time it hit one of the wet
expansion grates. Halfway up the highway my brain engaged enough to
hit the switch for four-wheel drive. The Infiniti calmed right
down.
</P>
<P>
   Enough that I convinced myself to turn around, drive back
through town, and repeat the trip in four-wheel drive. Just as it
was time to hit the aforementioned expansion grates, I spotted the
flashing blue lights ahead. A rear-wheel drive BMW had spun
backward and was hung up on the right-lane guard rail.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the extra dough is worth it after all.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the QX4's looks and amenities are first-class; ride,
handling, acceleration are so-so.
</P>
<P>
   My guaranteed late-night ABS test (hitting the brakes coming to
a stop sign that's in a mine field of dew-covered manhole covers)
shows it stops OK _ but needs the extra space for its weight.
</P>
<P>
   The looks, $35,000-plus price tag, and amenities will impress
the neighbors, but you can get the same performace in a Pathfinder
for a lot less with the caveat that the selectable four-wheel drive
is a big plus.
</P>
<P>
   So what does an S-Class Mercedes have in common with these two
cars?
</P>
<P>
   Not much.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that's how much chance it has of winding up in my
driveway, too.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a show-stopper of a car. It brought out our entire
neighborhood _ men and women _ to sit in, admire, and try to see
what Mercedes hid under the shrouded engine compartment (a
275-horsepower, 4.3-liter V8).
</P>
<P>
   The V8 made short work of my on-ramp acceleration test, merging
smoothly and effortlessly into 70 mile-per-hour traffic on
Interstate 93.
</P>
<P>
   If you like gadgetry, this is the car for you. It's got 380
pages of owner's manual, plus a separate booklet for the navigation
system.
</P>
<P>
   Said navigation system announces turns up to 900 feet in advance
to give you time to change lanes. It also impressed the family by
routing us through a maze local streets.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the cash (figure $70,000), this is a sensational
vehicle, the state of the art.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the rest of us is that as the best get better,
they cause a rising tide throughout the industry and, in a few
years, our ``affordable'' vehicles will incorporate much of what
separates this car from today's pack.

FIRM'S REMOTE-CONTROL CAMERA WAS KEY TO DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searchers found the plane and bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren _ a discovery
many had likened to finding a needle in a haystack _ using a
remote-controlled, camera-equipped vehicle made by a Falmouth,
Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   The box-like vehicle, operated from the surface and equipped
with propellers, lights, cameras, sonar, and a robotic arm, was
sent down late Tuesday night off Martha's Vineyard to investigate a
sonar target. It found an 8- to 10-foot section of Kennedy's Piper
Saratoga fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, all still inside the fuselage, were positively
identified by divers Wednesday morning, said Rear Admiral Richard
Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Several technologies were used to find the plane. Radar data
analysis helped locate where the plane went down and sonar surveys
of the seabed in that area identified items that didn't seem to
belong there.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's remote-controlled vehicle, manufactured by Benthos
Inc. of Falmouth, made it possible to explore likely sonar targets
easier and faster. Divers had been hampered by low visibility and
strong currents.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos officials said their remote-operated vehicles are
capable of generating high-quality pictures and video that can not
only help locate items on the sea bottom but aid in their salvage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer than sending a diver down and it's usually a lot
faster,'' said John Coughlin, president of Benthos.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee, who directed the search, said the vehicle was also
sent down with the divers Wednesday and its lights aided them in
their work. He declined to say how the bodies were brought to the
surface Wednesday afternoon, but said it was done in a way that
``respected the situation we were in.''
</P>
<P>
   Benthos vehicles were used in the search for wreckage from the
Swissair flight that went down off of Nova Scotia last year, and
from TWA flight 800, which fell to the sea off of Long Island in
1996. A Benthos vehicle was also used in 1994 to search the Quincy
quarries for a missing student from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are relatively small and operate much like
the robot vehicle used in the movie ``Titanic'' in the simulated
exploration of the sunken ship. The operator pilots the vehicle
using a joy stick and watching a TV monitor hooked up to the
vehicle's cameras. The vehicle is linked to its operator by a
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin said his company's vehicles are most often purchased by
oil and gas companies, underwater construction firms, and nuclear
power plants. He said the equipment is useful in monitoring
underwater equipment or construction, as well as for research and
archeological work.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos makes two models that often operate in tandem. One is
about 5 feet long, weighs 700 pounds, and is capable of carrying
lots of equipment, said company spokesman Peter Zentz. The other is
about 4 feet long, weighs about 50 pounds, and is used for quick
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy purchased its Benthos vehicles around 1993, Zentz said.
The vehicles cost anywhere from $50,000 to $1 million, depending on
what additional equipment is added. Zentz said the larger vehicle
purchased by the Navy cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Benthos vehicles are currently capable of descending to
depths of 5,000 feet, but the company is preparing to unveil one
that will dive to 10,000 feet. Kennedy's plane was found at a depth
of 116 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Benthos is a publicly traded company with 110 employees and $14
million in revenues. It was founded by Massachusetts Institute of
Technology graduate Sam Raymond.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Medical studies are like see-saws
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 25, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes about five years
ago, I have adhered to the warnings of doctors and dietitians to
steer clear of alcohol. Lots of other stuff is taboo as well, but
for the moment I'm focusing on alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   I never was a big drinker; a glass of wine occasionally at
dinner or a sip of cold beer was most enjoyable, but that was the
extent of it. Despite my doctor's warning, I didn't forgo them
completely, saved my minimal imbibing for vacation days _ and felt
guilty for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that Type 2 diabetics who have one or more
alcoholic drinks a day have a lesser chance of suffering a heart
attack than those diabetics who drink less, or none.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last week, targeted 983 diabetics for a period of up to
12 years. It resolved that diabetics who had one or two drinks a
day were up to 80 percent less likely to die of heart disease than
diabetics who abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Past studies _ not dealing with diabetics _ have shown that
consumption of alcohol can reduce the onset of a heart attack, but
the diabetes doctors held fast to their little-or-no policy.
</P>
<P>
   Plato long ago advised a young man that the passage of time will
change and even reverse many of his present opinions: ``Refrain
therefore awhile from setting yourself up as a judge of the highest
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to paraphrase Mark Twain, if you're not happy with your
authorized diet, just wait five minutes. It will change.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't even take five minutes for the alcohol study to be
questioned. An accompanying editorial in JAMA observed that
``alcohol may both induce and mask potentially severe
hypoglycemia.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it goes in the world of medicine and disease. One
well-meaning medical group will make a pronouncement regarding
health and another will shoot holes in it.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is high cholesterol, another morsel I picked up
at the buffet of afflictions. When my cholesterol was first
diagnosed almost 20 years ago, I was handed a diet program that
included the warning that I avoid shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   A lover of crabs, lobster and shrimp, I nevertheless abstained.
Later, another medical study came out that it's not so much the
crabs, lobster and shrimp that raises cholesterol levels, it's
whatever you dip it into, such as butter sauce.
</P>
<P>
   That brought me to the bookstore and ``The 8-Week Cholesterol
Cure.'' At the time, it was a New York Times bestseller. In the
book, I found what I was looking for: ``And what about those
much-maligned shellfish?'' the book asked. ``Well it turns out
that, through no fault of their own, the original compilers of
cholesterol data were in error on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment in the book not only absolved shellfish but promoted
it, saying clams, oysters and mussels are particularly low in
cholesterol. ``Lobster, once a distinct no-no for even those who
could afford it, has a bit less than 100 milligrams.'' And, it
said, while shrimp has a higher count, a serving of the delicacy
should be no problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, shellfish have moved back and forth on the
medical see-saw to a point where I no longer pay attention to them.
I have shellfish in moderation, carefully watch my cholesterol
count and continue to take cholesterol-reducing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   My doctor is aware of that and acquiesces.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way it's going to be with Type 2 diabetes.
Despite the study and despite the editorial, I'll continue to take
an occasional drink _ maybe a bit more often than I now do _ and
the results will be monitored by my doctor, whom I trust.
</P>
<P>
   Medical studies that tell you this is good for you, that is bad
for you can drive you nuts. Read them, ask questions but defer to
the person who knows your health problems best: your own physician.

 &HT;    ADMINISTRATION ACCUSED OF FAILING TO FIGHT DOCUMENT FRAUD
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ability of accused serial killer Angel Maturino
Resendez to avoid capture illustrates the dangers of the Clinton
administration's failure to combat document fraud, the chairman of
the House immigration subcommittee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two decades, Resendez used fake driver's licenses,
voter registrations and Social Security cards as he committed a
string of murders from Texas to Kentucky, law enforcement
authorities allege. He has been charged with five murders and is a
suspect in four others.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Congress has been trying to address
illegal use of the documents that Resendez and others have
exploited.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House subcommittee on
immigration and claims, criticized the Department of Health and
Human Services for failing to make birth certificates less
vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, he said, the department has failed to submit a
required report to Congress on ways to reduce the fraudulent use of
birth certificates. It refused to send a witness to Thursday's
hearing because of ``embarrassment'' over this failure, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's failure to properly carry out a law that was
passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress is a
breach of his constitutional responsibilities and an insult to all
Americans,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the administration also failed to comply with other
parts of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration
Responsibility Act:
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide funding in its fiscal year 2000 budget proposal to
hire 1,000 additional border patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enforce the immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Develop a counterfeit-resistant Social Security card.
</P>
<P>
   Another committee member, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas,
cautioned Congress to address the problem of identification fraud
fairly .
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress must take care to avoid steps that would increase
rather than diminish immigration-related discrimination that has
already become a feature of our employment system,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that it is already unlawful for aliens to engage in
document fraud for immigration-related purposes.

WATCHDOG GROUPS FEAR CREATION OF AUTONOMOUS NUKE LAB AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A U.S. Senate vote to create an agency
responsible for nuclear weapons management and security has angered
anti-nuclear activists, who see the move as a political maneuver to
shield weapons work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and
other facilities from public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship would largely sidestep the
Energy Department bureaucracy and report directly to the
department's secretary, Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Wednesday 96-1 to create the security agency as
part of a bill reauthorizing government intelligence programs. The
bill must still be approved by the House and could face a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is an outgrowth of two recent studies, one by a
presidential board and the other by a House panel, indicating that
China pilfered some of the nation's highly sensitive nuclear
secrets and that the Energy Department failed in providing adequate
security at the nation's weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   The possible impact of the Senate vote on the weapons labs
remains uncertain, but a Livermore spokesman said that facility was
prepared to accept whatever management changes Congress and the
president decided to impose.
</P>
<P>
   But nuclear watchdog activists criticized any measure that takes
away oversight authority by the Energy Department, which supervises
the laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has ``handed the fox the keys to the chicken coop,''
charged Jackie Cabasso, a leading anti-nuclear activist based at
the Western States Legal Foundation in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Another activist, Marylia Kelley of Livermore, expressed concern
that lawmakers were creating ``a rogue agency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of irony here, because if one were to draw a
logical lesson from the spy scandal, that lesson would be that the
weapons labs need even more oversight. And yet here we have a bill
that would allow for less oversight,'' Kelley said. ``It's totally
ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore and the
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, two of the nation's
three nuclear weapons laboratories, are run by the University of
California.
</P>
<P>
   While it was unclear Wednesday how the proposed change _ which
remains subject to House vote and a possible presidential veto _
would affect the University of California system's relationship
with the Livermore and Los Alamos labs, university officials were
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we can work with this kind of (new) structure,
whatever it may turn out to be, as long as it's consistent with
what we've been hearing and seeing,'' university system spokesman
Rick Malaspina said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Malaspina noted that the nation's nuclear weapons complex had
undergone a number of structural changes in the past. ``This kind
of change can be constructive,'' he added. ``We've worked with
different management structures over the last 56 years of UC
management (of the weapons labs). ... We've been adaptable, and can
be adaptable, and want to do what's in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Livermore spokesman Jeff Garberson said the lab was prepared to
accept any changes mandated by Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll respond to whatever organization the federal government
establishes ... to manage the nuclear weapons effort,'' Garberson
said.

   MEXICO-EXTRADITE _ MEXICO CITY - A Mexican judge has blocked a
U.S. request to expedite the alleged kingpin of the world's largest
methamphetamine ring, saying that Mexico can refuse to extradite
its own citizens. The decision can set alleged drug lord Luis
Amezcua free if an appeal fails or Mexican authorities fail to
rearrest him on other changes. The case is considered a litmus test
of Mexico's cooperation with the United States in the war on drugs.

 &HT;    Straying far from home, camellia finds its place
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLIJAY, Ga. _ It started as a day for viewing an unusual plant
and quickly turned into much more.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday morning, Lyn and I joined friends Laura and
Carl Edd Abernathy for an 8 o'clock breakfast at the Ducktown
(Tenn.) Basin Museum, which features memorable artifacts from the
once-thriving industry in the Georgia-Tennessee Copper Basin area.
Over pancakes and sausage, we whetted our appetite for the hunt for
mountain camellia, a small tree usually associated with the Great
Smoky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Not abiding by rules of horticulture and geography, the tree,
part of the tea family, had ventured to the Blue Ridge and been
spotted in the woods around Ellijay. We were to see it at the end
of its white-blooming glory on this early July day.
</P>
<P>
   So, off we drove, through McCaysville (Ga.), past Blue Ridge, on
to Ellijay. By the middle of the afternoon, we had visited several
gardens, had conversations ranging from the power of learning to
the art of canning to the cunning of bears that steal your corn,
driven down a street aglow with flags for the Fourth of July, eaten
much barbecue and, yes, spent time with the mountain camellia.
</P>
<P>
   In short, we had done something increasingly rare in today's
fast-paced life: slowed down long enough to follow a day wherever
it leads. In some ways this was an expanded version of the garden
visit so cherished by all who dig in the dirt _ a visit to a space
with the specific purpose of enjoying and appreciating. Alas, such
a simple and profound pleasure is becoming a luxury we adamantly
deny ourselves _ even on days off.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, real days off seem to have gone the way of whole-family
sit-down meals. Who has time, what with all the errands to run,
chores to catch up on?
</P>
<P>
   Well, on this day, we took time.
</P>
<P>
   In Ellijay, at the home of Laura's sister Opal Corbin and her
husband, Charles, we talked up a storm, solving many of the world's
problems, eventually launching a conversation about whether garlic
should be planted in July, as experts generally advise putting the
cloves in the ground in spring in cold-winter climates and in
autumn where winters are mild.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who had offered to dig up and share some of his plants,
disparaged the notion of waiting for a certain season, saying with
irrefutable logic that now's the time: ``They're already in the
ground, aren't they? Well, just put them back in.'' I did, near
sundown that same day, back at our cabin in McCaysville, noting how
much Charles sounded like my father, who often said, ``Don't plant
on no sign or no seasons. Plant in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Where had the time gone? Nearly noon, and we still had not laid
eyes on the mountain camellia. Not that we're in the habit of
counting time up here.
</P>
<P>
   But the camellia wanted to be seen, so off we went, Opal and
Charles on a four-wheeler, the rest of us by car. Not far from the
house, we all met at a spot that was lightly shaded and near a
road, joined by Opal and Charles' son, Rex Corbin; his wife, Trina;
and their 7-year-old daughter, Macy.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain camellias, also known as mountain stewartia, stood some
10 feet tall on each side of the road. Most of the blooms had faded
and fallen, but a few lovely ones were still around.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to understand why, from a distance, these trees sometimes
are mistaken for dogwoods (some even call them summer dogwoods).
But, close-up, their camellia-ness is easy to see. On this humid
July day, the white-petaled flowers, with burgundy and gold
centers, looked as beautifully fragile as any common camellia
blossom in a January freeze.
</P>
<P>
   We all savored our looks at these flowers, pulling out cameras,
posing in front of the trees, our moments frozen with a few happy
snaps.
</P>
<P>
   From trees wild and rare, we went to one found at just about
every nursery: the saucer magnolia, one of which was growing in Rex
and Trina's garden. There was something unusual about this one,
though; it was in high bud. Yes, most saucer magnolias produce a
scattering of blossoms in the summer, but this one had more than a
scattering. It was loaded.
</P>
<P>
   It does this every year, said Rex, who no longer had the tag
that tells exactly what kind of saucer magnolia this is.
</P>
<P>
   This was one more sweet mystery to savor, joining those
centering on how the mountain camellia happened to stray from home
_ and how a day of doing not much special could be so special.

 &HT;    Stretched-out flea market long on fun, and bound to offer lots
of bargains
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a gold miner eyeing a worn-out vein, Bruce Jones of
Pascagoula, Miss., suveyed the old tools, costume jewelry, battered
dishes and other wares on the lawn of the Jordan Motel near
Jamestown, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   He was seeking nuggets during last year's ``World's Longest Yard
Sale'' _ 450 miles of flotsam and jetsam stringing from Gadsden,
Ala., to Covington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for the find of a lifetime,'' he said. ``Of
course, I don't know what that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Few do. That's part of the fun of the sale, held this year on
Aug. 19-22.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an estimated 30,000 browsers abandoned the wide
highways for the narrow, rambling route that lulls these pilgrims
through lush valleys and quaint towns. This year's sale is likely
to draw as many _ some who'll travel the entire route, others
who'll shop only a portion of it.
</P>
<P>
   The event started 12 years ago in Jamestown, Tenn., as an effort
to pull travelers off nearby interstates and into the Sequatchie
River Valley of the Cumberland Plateau. It spread like kudzu up and
down the U.S. 127 corridor in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1993, the
Lookout Mountain Parkway in Alabama hooked up to the route.
</P>
<P>
   For the seller, it's an annual purging of overstuffed barns,
basements and attics _ miles and miles of stuff that brings to life
the old saw about one man's junk being another's treasure.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Esther Clemmons has boxed up the
bric-a-brac in her home and held a yard sale with her neighbors in
Signal Mountain, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours north on U.S. 127, Fadana Bramlett has taken the old
clothes from her closet and hung them from trees in her yard in
Owenton, Ky. And south, a passel of folks along Lookout Mountain
Parkway in Alabama have thrown everything from paint-by-number
masterpieces to cow skulls on their lawns to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Raring to buy, Sarah Brown of Cartersville and a group of
shopping buddies usually camp near Gadsden. ``The furthest we've
ever made it is to Fort Payne,'' said Brown, of the Alabama town
that's only about an hour or so along the route.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Jones and his wife, Ann, have traveled the whole
length of the sale more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Emilie Stevens of Pikeville, Tenn., said the sale attracts folks
from California to New York. ``Some come knowing what they are
looking for _ vintage silver, vintage dishes _ or they are just the
average Joe looking for a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   What they usually find along the way is a good time _ fellowship
with like-minded collectors, lunch of swamp cabbage or corn bread
salad under tents or in country stores and relief from big-city
road rage and rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows how much money changes hands?'' said Lloyd Wagnon,
director of the Gadsden-Etowah Tourism Board and co-ordinator for
the southern portion of the route. ``This outdoor sale has become a
tradition now. I don't think we could stop it if we tried.''

 &HT;    Shopping is heaven along 450-mile route lined with 3 states'
worth of treasures
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``World's Longest Yard Sale'' is the Grand Prix for avid
second-hand shoppers, though car speeds are more likely to putter
at 20 miles an hour rather than roar at 200. The better to spot
that vintage guitar hanging from a tree in the yard up yonder.
</P>
<P>
   The 450-mile stretch, from Gadsden, Ala., to Covington, Ky., can
be conquered in entirety or in small segments. How much you do will
depend on time (and, perhaps, money).
</P>
<P>
   The more you have of both betters your chances of scoring
how'd-I-ever-live-without-this finds during the 12th annual sale,
Aug. 19-22.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I fearlessly conquered the entire route in three
days, returning via I-75 to Atlanta on the fourth day. I shared
notes with many Georgians along the way, several who chose to stick
to portions of the route in Alabama and near Chattanooga for one-
and two-day trips.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there are a few essentials to making the trek: a
shopping buddy or two, a big vehicle, a love of living in the
material world and a wad of cash, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how our trip rolled out:
</P>
<P>
   Day 1 _ Gadsden, Ala.,
</P>
<P>
   to Pikeville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some who debate whether to travel the route north
or south, but there's no question in my mind. Gadsden may be a
latecomer to the event (the sale started in 1987, Lookout Mountain
Parkway hooked up in 1993) but it is hands down the best place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   There, a site at the Noccalula Falls Park was packed with
vendors selling everything from vintage yardsticks to antique plant
seeders. There even was a P.O.B. (Point of Beginning) sign, where
shiny, happy shoppers lined up to take snapshots to chronicle their
journey. From this site, we traveled through a Gadsden
neighborhood, where virtually every house had wares on the lawn,
before hooking up with the Lookout Mountain Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   Our beginner's enthusiasm showed when we checked the odometer
nearly three hours after arriving at the P.O.B. and had clocked
only nine miles. In that time we had seen everything for sale,
including the kitchen sink_ a whole row of used kitchen sinks, in
fact. But we figured we needed to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   The road numbers change along the Parkway and sometimes turns
are required, so following the green parkway signs was essential.
The scenery in the Little River Canyon National Preserve was
breathtaking enough to almost make us forget we were shopping. We
remembered when we reached Fort Payne (the intersection of Ala. 35
and the parkway) and at Fisher's Crossroads near the Desoto State
Park, two hot spots on the route.
</P>
<P>
   We were delighted with our lunch at Dish in Mentone (fancy
chicken salad and a spicy west African stew). We then made speed to
Lookout Mountain, and picked up U.S. 127 in downtown Chattanooga,
the official highway of the sale. The first major site is Signal
Mountain, just outside of Chattanooga. It's another good option for
Atlantans who want to take in just a bit of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Further up the road, we made a detour to see the ruins of 268
beehive coke ovens near Dunlap, which were used in the early 1900s
to convert coal into coke (industrial fuel). The walk along the
long stone wall with archways where the ovens had stood was a nice
nature break.
</P>
<P>
   The next big action was at the intersection of Tenn. 111 with
U.S. 127, just north of Dunlap, where a field was chock full of
tents and tables. Growing weary, we drove into Pikeville to pick up
snacks (cornbread salad at Sapp's Country Store) and then on to the
Fall Creek Falls Bed &AMP; Breakfast Inn, operated by Doug and Rita
Pruett, who say this weekend is one of their busiest. The inn is
just 15 minutes from the route; we were glad we had made a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Day 2 _ Pikeville, Tenn.,
</P>
<P>
   to Russell Springs, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   As a meditation before the day of shopping, we drove through
Fall Creek Falls State Resort Park, the one must detour for anyone
on the route. We took in the roaring 256-foot waterfall with awe.
</P>
<P>
   Then we drove into Pikeville, one of the friendliest stops on
the route. The churches offered their parking lots and their
restrooms, and many civic groups sold baked goodies and coffee for
breakfast. Many of the sales were in front of gorgeous historic
homes. I couldn't deny myself a pink poodle trash can, for a steal.
</P>
<P>
   The action between Pikeville and Jamestown is good all along the
way, but our favorite stop was near Clarkrange at the Cumberland
Mountain General Store. The store itself lives up to its name, and
the yard beside it boasted a huge number of vendors, many pros with
fine selections. We found vintage tablecloths, an antique popcorn
pan, and some paint-by-number paintings. And we had swamp cabbage,
a stew of cabbage, ground beef and wicked hot spices, for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown is where all this madness began; civic leaders
concocted the idea 12 years ago to attract people to the valley. So
naturally, the shopping here was great, with the No. 1 spot in our
estimation being the Jordan Motel just south of town. The lawn here
was packed with dealers, collectors and shoppers who've been
regulars since the start.
</P>
<P>
   The winding drive to the Kentucky border from Jamestown had only
a few diversions, which allowed us to rest up for the next big stop
in Albany. There were several good sites here, the best at the
Mountain View Recreational Park and Hopkins Rural School. We
noticed much lower prices and fewer professional dealers, a trend
that held true through much of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   From here, we set out for our evening's lodging _ the Indian
Hills Fishing Resort. Located on a picturesque cove of Lake
Cumberland, it's a good 45 minutes off the route. And the cabins
were spare. But we didn't care. We were ready to fall out.
</P>
<P>
   Day 3 _ Russell Springs, Ky.,
</P>
<P>
   to Covington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The interchange between the Cumberland Parkway and U.S. 127 near
Russell Springs was our first big stop, where I finally gave in and
bought a rusty farm impement (a pulley wheel). We had seen so many
rusted tools along the way, it had become a joke. Now, I was part
of the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamestown had enough action to rival its namesake in Tennessee,
and Linda's Diner proved good for breakfast. There were good sites
near Webbs Crossroads and Dunnville, too. But perhaps our best stop
for bargains during the whole trip was at Aaron's Loop, the
intersection of Ky. 910/501 with U.S. 127, between Dunnville and
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   This intersection was crammed full of flatbead trailers and
tables. The quality of goods were yard sale, not professional, so
it required a good bit of picking through. But there were some
steals. I found myself insisting to an elderly woman that she take
$1 rather than 50 cents for her 1950's cocktail nut serving set in
its original box, complete with the small wooden bowls for each
bridge player.
</P>
<P>
   We passed through Harrodsburg just in time to catch a glimpse of
the Pioneer Days parade and then arrived in Lawrenceburg, where
off-road parking was a must if you didn't want to tangle with the
Kentucky Highway Patrol. The site was large. Thankfully, so was the
parking area.
</P>
<P>
   Frankfort's riverfront sale had pretty much fizzled by the time
we reached it mid-afternoon. Owenton proved to be the route's last
good stop. Here, we met Fandana Bramblett, who makes about $900 a
year from her yard sale, which featured vintage and used clothes.
She donates the money to a local adult education effort.
</P>
<P>
   The sites along the last stretch into Covington were spread out,
and as we entered the town, a suburb of Cincinnati, we wondered if
anyone knew about the 450-mile-long yard sale. For a moment, it
didn't matter. We were just happy to check in to the Hampton Inn,
our first ``regular'' hotel.
</P>
<P>
   We then stopped by the Northern Kentucky Visitor's Center, which
is the other official starting/ending point. There were many
signatures on the guest book, some saying they were on their way,
others claiming to have ``made it all the way'' on the yard-sale
route.
</P>
<P>
   We added ours and then went in search of a nice meal with a
glass of wine in the MainStrasse Village, Covington's historic
district. We found it at Chez Nora Kitchen and Bar and afterwards,
we strolled along Sixth Street where -- lone vendor tended his
table of wares.
</P>
<P>
   He explained there had been a flea market in honor of the
450-mile-long yard sale. While most vendors packed up for the
evening, he decided to stay another day.
</P>
<P>
   He had some nice looking hats. Only 50 cents each.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't resist.

   TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The most dense portions of the route are in Tennessee; the
best bargains are in Kentucky and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big intersections and town squares make great stops, but
some of the best finds are at the lone yard sale in a stretch
between two towns.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pay attention to parking rules. If there are signs pointing to
off-road parking, obey them, especially in Kentucky, where the law
enforcement was strict last year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Drive safely and walk safe distances from the traffic. This
two-lane highway will have heavy and slow-moving traffic this
weekend. An accident involving an 18-wheeler that lost its brakes
killed two and injured 20, many of them vendors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The few lodging options directly on the route fill up quickly.
We booked ahead; others play it by ear, with the most popular
strategy being to cut over to a major interstate (I-40, I-75,
Cumberland Parkway) to search for a room. Either way, you'll
probably have to detour from the route 30-45 minutes. The numbers
listed above will help you locate lodging.

 &HT;    Express yourself with painted tiles
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to personalizing your decor, the options are
endless _ favorite collectibles, framed photographs, family
heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   One custom touch showing up in more kitchens and baths is
handpainted tile. For years, homeowners have used ceramic tile to
create patterned designs in borders and backsplashes. And now,
they're taking it a step further by accenting tiled surfaces using
the ancient art of china painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many possibilities,'' said Syra Hansen, a
tile artist who lives in Powder Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who teaches tile painting classes at the Spruill Center
for the Arts, said consumers don't have to hire an artist. ``You
don't even have to know how to draw to do it,'' she said. You can
use stencils sold in crafts stores.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said most homeowners are incorporating murals in kitchens
and baths featuring groups of tiles painted with designs such as
flowers, fruits and vegetables, birds and bunnies. ``Some are
painting a single large tile and framing it like a picture to go on
the table,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are setting painted tiles in floors and even patios.
Hansen accented her terrace with tile containing her
granddaughter's painted handprints.
</P>
<P>
   Larger tiles such as 6-by-6-inch _ 8-by-8s and 12-by-12s for
fireplaces _ are ideal for painting. She recommends white or beige
over colors; either shiny or matte finishes can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The only equipment required is a kiln for firing the painted
tiles. Don't use the kitchen oven because most heat to just 500
degrees. Instead, Hansen recommends taking painted tiles to a
pottery store, where they can be fired for just a few dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the materials for creating a handpainted design,
depending on size and intricacies, should cost less than $100, and
most will last for many projects to come.

   Step 2: Group several tiles on a flat surface.Transfer the
drawing onto the tiles by placing it on top of
</P>
<P>
   graphite paper and tracing it with a fine-point stylus, pencil
or pen. (In this case, Hansen is creating a
</P>
<P>
   24-inch-by-18-inch bathroom mural, consisting of two 12-by-12
tiles and two 6-by-12s.)
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Use oil glaze paints to paint the design.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Place the individual tiles in a kiln and fire them, in
this case, at 1,400 degrees for 90 minutes. Most pottery stores
offer firing as a service, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Finished product: Using tile glue, apply the finished tiles to
the wall. Tile can be glued to most surfaces, including wallboard,
wood and even tile, Hansen said. Finally, grout the tiles and clean
with a sponge.

 &HT;    Experts can offer sound advice on rebuilt pianos
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Canty admits he can only peck at a piano. His wife, Lynn,
does not play at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the Alpharetta couple noticed that their oldest son,
Gregory, seemed to enjoy banging out tunes at his grandmother's
house, a skill the family wanted to nurture.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old was at the perfect age to begin music lessons.
The only thing missing was a piano.
</P>
<P>
   The Cantys wanted to buy a new baby grand, but reeled from
sticker shock. Instead, they decided to venture into different
territory: the dusty workshops of piano rebuilders.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilts, after all, held special allure. Not only were good
brands considerably cheaper than new models, they often had more
character.
</P>
<P>
   After looking for several months, the family laid out $6,500 for
a 1922 French provincial baby grand Weber from American Piano
Craftsman in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the new pianos were just stark black. It was hard
to fall in love with them,'' said Greg Canty. ``But this one had a
cherry finish and a little flair in the legs. It had some style.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the music play
</P>
<P>
   Buying a rebuilt piano is similar to buying a used car, said
Larry Fine, author of one of the most respected consumer guides,
``The Piano Book: Buying &AMP; Owning a New or Used Piano'' (Brookside
Press, $16.95). If customers know what they want and what to look
for, they can find a great deal. If they don't, they're asking to
be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebuilt pianos can vary greatly,'' said Fine of Boston.
``Especially because there is no standard of what `rebuilt' means:
It could mean everything from a complete overhaul to not much more
than polishing up the brass.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is renewed interest in rebuilt pianos, a
convergence of a boomlet of kids ready for music lessons and
certain sectors of the middle class finding themselves awash in
spending cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are interested in the research that shows
music is good for kids' development,'' said Fine. ``At the same
time, they're discovering they can afford a pretty decent piano.
So, they're turning away from the excess of video games and
computers and are swinging back to more traditional values _ like
piano lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many middle- and upper-class families want to
have a piano in their home as an accent element, even if they don't
play. Rebuilders say almost half of their sales are to people who
don't play.
</P>
<P>
   Used upright pianos can be purchased for less than $1,000. Old
baby grands can be bought for as little as $2,000. And although
dealers and rebuilders bicker about what is ``junk,'' many
customers say they are happy for the variety of styles and quality
that allow them to bring home a piece of history and musical
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in love with our piano,'' said Lynn Canty. ``It's become a
treasured piece in our home.''
</P>
<P>
   For every new piano that is purchased, five to 10 used ones are
also purchased, Fine said. About two-thirds of all pianos bought
today are uprights; the remaining are grands.
</P>
<P>
   If you are considering a rebuilt piano, you should know the
basics, which include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take a qualified piano technician with you. Just as you would
have a used car checked by a mechanic you trust, it is worth it to
pay about $50 to $75 for a piano technician to check some of the
piano's 12,000 parts. And, if you don't play, it is not sufficient
to take along someone who does. A player _ no matter how good he or
she is _ usually does not have the technical skills to determine
whether the piano has been doctored merely to sound good in the
showroom.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask for references and learn how long a rebuilder has been in
business. As one Web site put it: A piano could be in your home
longer than a spouse. You want a business that's going to be around
long enough to fulfill warranties or do repairs. Ask rebuilders
about their credentials. Are they registered members of the Piano
Technicians Guild?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Outline a contract that defines what will be done and what has
been done to the piano. If you have questions, compare the work
contract with other rebuilders' standard work repairs. (For a
second or third opinion, go online to get information from
rebuilders across the country.) Also, if you are buying the piano
before it's been rebuilt, stipulate what will happen if you do not
like it when it is finished. Fine said rebuilders can rightfully
request a deposit of a few hundred dollars to secure a rebuilding
job, but they should not force a customer to buy if the piano
doesn't meet the customer's standards once the work is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also need to understand what they want from an older
instrument. Some pianos, for example, might be beautiful but hard
to salvage, others might not be fancy, but offer exceptional
musical quality.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of life left
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best deals in the used market are pianos that are
between five and 20 years old, Fine said. In those cases, they
probably are in good enough shape to still be a quality instrument
without needing major repairs and rebuilding. And they've
depreciated enough to become more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   But if customers decide to buy an instrument that's much older _
be advised that the typical lifespan of grand and upright pianos is
about four or five decades _ they will probably have to have it
rebuilt or reconditioned, a lesser form of restoration. At that
time, they must determine if the work is worth the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 100-year-old man with a face lift is still a 100-year-old
man,'' said Rick Houser, of the Piano Gallery, which sells mostly
new Steinways. ``The simple fact is, that most rebuilders are not
going to spend the time or effort needed to really bring a piano
back to prime condition. So, you need to realize you're mostly
paying for nostalgia. And, typically, you're not going to get the
performance of a new instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he said, if someone does ask the Piano Gallery to
rebuild a Steinway, the company sends it back to the factory for
the work, guaranteeing it is fitted with only Steinway parts. A
rebuilt one, however, is not cheap _ which leads some customers
back to the bottom line that maybe it would be better to shell out
the cash and get one with no miles, Houser said.
</P>
<P>
   And if a customer finds a Steinway for about half the price of a
new one, ``I can guarantee you're getting only half a piano,''
Houser said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. Local rebuilders say they absolutely can
deliver a musically solid high-quality instrument at a considerably
lower price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say our rebuilts are better than a lot of new ones,''
said Jim Scaglion, owner of Jim's Piano Shop, founded in 1959.
``It's very simple. It depends on the experience of the rebuilder
and the parts used.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers must realize the market is considerably different for
Steinways, because they're considered the Mercedes of pianos. Piano
players, rebuilders and dealers say anyone considering buying a
rebuilt Steinway should expect to pay about 60 percent to 90
percent the cost of a new one. A new 5'1'' foot grand Steinway
costs about $31,000, so a properly rebuilt one should run at least
$20,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   And buyers need to be aware of the battle between Steinway
dealers and Steinway rebuilders. Some rebuilders say, in an effort
to dampen the resale market, the New York based-company has been
buying used Steinways in its home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the biggest competitor of a new Steinway is a used
Steinway,'' Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't have tens of thousands to shell out for a
piano, experts say there are a few other tips to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, a poor quality piano new will still be a poor quality
piano rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   An example: Square grands, a type of piano built in the 1800s
(described by Fine as ``coffins on legs''), never really sounded
very good. But they often have stunningly beautiful cases that some
people adore.
</P>
<P>
   But rebuilders say unless you're planning to use it as a museum
piece or simply a piece of furniture to place family photos, the
square grands usually aren't worth the trouble. Fine said the same
thing is true of the so-called ``bird-cage'' piano, a British
instrument of the Victorian era of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of junk out there, and you don't want to buy
something that in five years isn't going to be able to hold a
tune,'' said Joe Perkinson, a partner of American Piano Craftsman
of Norcross (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   It's condition that counts
</P>
<P>
   But just because you don't recognize a brand name, doesn't mean
it's a bad piano. In 1922, considered part of the heyday of pianos,
there were almost 130 American piano manufacturers. And many
produced very nice instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is perfectly fine to buy an inexpensive piano if it is good
working condition,'' Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it's like buying a car. If all you care about is making
it to your destination, a Honda works as well as a Mercedes. And if
someone's just learning how to drive, they wouldn't appreciate a
Mercedes anyway,'' he said. ``The same is true about pianos.
Sometimes, inexpensive ones are perfect _ they look nice and your
kid can play away on them without hesitation. Like everything else,
it comes down to a lifestyle question. What will work for you?''
</P>
<P>
   And for those seeking a little bit of the past, a rebuilt piano
can fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk out with a nice piece of Americana; a lot detail work
you just don't see anymore,'' said Chuck Parris, owner of Atlanta
Piano Rebuilders of Smyrna. ``And to some people, that can't be
replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON BUYING A PIANO
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should know several key factors when purchasing pianos,
said Larry Fine, author of ``The Piano Book: Buying &AMP; Owning a New
or Used Piano'' (Brookside Press, $16.95). Fine's Web address is
www.tiac.net/users/pianobk.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When in a new-piano showroom, buyers should realize the
advertised price is usually negotiable. Most pianos can be bought
for at least 20 percent below list price. Steinways can be
negotiated down by only 5 percent to 10 percent, if at all.
Rebuilders will bargain less.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pianos between 5 and 20 years old are probably among the best
buys in the resale market. They are still young _ and don't have a
lot of the problems plaguing older models _ yet they've depreciated
enough to get a good price.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Understand university sales. Often, a piano manufacturer will
offer pianos to a university's music program in exchange for using
the school's affiliation when it later sells those pianos. The
pianos, used by the university for only a year or so, are usually
of good quality, but they're often not as much of a bargain as
advertised. Some states have demanded that companies advertising
university sales make it clear that the schools are not endorsing
the event.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you decide to buy a used or rebuilt piano, hire a piano
technician to examine it before buying. Most charge about $50 to
$75 per visit. Get a contract on what will be done if the piano is
going to be rebuilt. See what kind of warranties the rebuilder or
dealer will offer.

LECTURER DEALS IN THE REALITIES OF DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At the age of 68, after careers as a founding
director of a psychiatric center and a hospice inn, Dr. N. Michael
Murphy has embarked on a new adventure: author and international
lecturer on death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm older, but I'm not necessarily wiser,'' Murphy said. ``I'm
very much a student, a work-in-progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who lives in Greenwich, N.Y., was anticipating the
August release of his first book, ``The Wisdom of Dying: Practices
for Living'' (Element, $24.95), writing a follow-up volume and
preparing for a series of September workshops in Ireland, Belgium
and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy also teaches a course on death and dying for third-year
medical students at Albany Medical College, where he is a clinical
professor in the departments of psychiatry and family practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us, even medical students, are terrified of death and
we go to all sorts of extremes to deny it,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in providing the students with an experiential
education about dying and death,'' Murphy said. ``I want them to
imagine their own deaths and the deaths of loved ones. That sounds
kind of scary and morbid, but it can be liberating and a way to say
and do some things we might not ordinarily do until a person dies
and it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   In teaching medical students, Murphy is also studying their
responses to death in collaboration with Sheldon Solomon, a
psychology professor at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs. The
two eventually plan to publish the results of their research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research is confirming what we believe, which is that
medical students involved with dying patients are terrified by the
experience,'' Murphy said. ``The way they deal with it is to deny
it and become harder and to run away from that fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who grew up in England and got his medical degree in
psychiatry in Ireland, came to the Albany area in 1968 as the first
clinical director of the newly opened Capital District Psychiatric
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's mother had died that same year, forcing him to confront
what he called ``unfinished business between us that was not
addressed.'' His mother's death became the spur for Murphy's
involvement in a burgeoning hospice movement in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, after visiting hospices in England and attending a
workshop on death and dying by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Murphy became
a pioneer in hospice care in the Albany area and helped establish
the 10-bed hospice inn at St. Peter's Hospital the following year
as its medical director. Murphy left the hospice network in 1986 to
pursue writing and lecturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wanted to write a book about my hospice experience for
many years, but I needed to leave to get distance to articulate the
lessons I learned,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   His book tells stories of hospice patients who touched Murphy
deeply and taught him about what he calls ``living and dying
soulfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed is practical instruction for meditation, rituals,
family meetings, relationship building, self-care, grieving and
care giving. The narrative is structured around the three people
Murphy believes are essential in working toward a peaceful and
meaningful death: the storyteller, the witness and the guide.
</P>
<P>
   The common theme in Murphy's various pursuits is his commitment
to address a deeply embedded denial of death and to offer exercises
and training to overcome a fear of dying with a mind-set that
embraces life's final chapter.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His experiences on both sides of the Atlantic underscore the
universality of the fear of dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are so much on the move and rootless and we haven't
got much to sustain us as individuals when we're faced with a
terror like death,'' Murphy said.``I find Europeans have their
families nearby and they have history and tradition and seem more
stable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the personal level, they're all full of denial about
death. Except for the accents, you couldn't tell the Europeans from
the Americans when it comes to attitudes about death.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy currently is at work on a follow-up book titled ``Who
Cares: A Call to Arms on Inner Peace and World Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extension of the first book and explores what
constitutes self-care and prepares people to be caregivers, which
can mean parents or teachers or clergy or health-care workers,''
Murphy said. ``I think all of us are incredibly ill-prepared to be
caregivers. It stems from a failure in relationships. We all tend
to repeat the disasters that occur in our families because we don't
receive the proper relationship-centered education.''

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is rare for a star in a hit Broadway show to
receive an ovation from his fellow cast members. But Alton
Fitzgerald White got one Wednesday, five days after he was
mistakenly arrested on drug charges and strip-searched, then
released after the police acknowledged their error.
</P>
<P>
   The applause came Wednesday at a curtain call after the matinee
performance of the musical ``Ragtime.'' The cast joined the
audience in applauding White, who plays Coalhouse Walker, the
talented musician whose life is changed forever when he is harassed
by white firemen simply because he is black. It was White's first
performance since his arrest, and he said his real-life ordeal had
added a stark resonance to his onstage role.
</P>
<P>
   After his performance, White, who has also appeared on Broadway
in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and in the original cast of ``Miss
Saigon,'' admitted that he had been nervous at first. ``But as I
got into the show,'' he said, ``I realized how much stronger I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   The police have said that White's arrest was simply a case of
mistaken identity by officers responding to a report of drug
dealing, and have apologized to him. But White claims he was
arrested and humiliated for no reason other than his race. The
incident comes amid heightened concern over the practice known as
racial profiling, in which officers stop people solely because of
their race.
</P>
<P>
   White's co-star, LaChanze, who plays the woman Coalhouse loves,
said that she expected his performance would change after his
experience. But she added: ``Alton is a professional. He went on
with business as usual.'' His arrest hit the black members of the
cast particularly hard, she said. Earlier, White met with the
members of the production to thank them for their support.
</P>
<P>
   White offered new details Wednesday on his arrest. He said he
was in the vestibule of his apartment building at 935 St. Nicholas
Ave. in Washington Heights _ where Duke Ellington had lived, he
noted _ preparing to go to the bank and then his gym, when he
spotted a group of police officers, led by a policewoman, outside
the front door. White, 35, who was raised in Cincinnati and
attended the Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music, said his
parents had taught him to be a gentleman, so he ``stepped forward
and opened the door.'' He said he thought the police had come
because an elderly person in his building had taken ill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, White said, the officers said they were searching for
four Hispanic men in white T-shirts who were believed to have
weapons and to be dealing drugs. White saw two Hispanic men in the
lobby, one in a white T-shirt, whom he did not recognize. The
police say the officers discovered a kilogram of cocaine in the
lobby and arrested White, who was wearing a white T-shirt, along
with three other black men and the two Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors were vouching for us,'' White said. He said the
neighbors told the police, ``He's starring on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was taken with the others to the 33rd Precinct station
house.
</P>
<P>
   White said that as he waited in a cell, he became increasingly
distraught about missing his performance, and found himself weeping
from humiliation. ``I said, `Do you have any idea how hard I've
worked as a black man to be the star of a show?' The officer says,
`This is standard procedure.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two Hispanic men were charged with criminal drug possession.
White and the other men were not charged. But even after the police
realized that he was not involved, he said, he was kept in custody.
When he was finally released, White said, one officer apologized
and said, ``You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's where I live _ that's my home,''' White
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, White said, he had remained in his apartment,
except for a trip to buy a newspaper, because he was afraid to go
outside.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was ``very seriously considering'' a lawsuit
against the police. ``I'm dealing with that issue in my job,'' he
said. ``And now it's in my personal life. It's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ragtime,'' after Coalhouse is humiliated and the woman he
loves, the mother of his child, is killed, he becomes a
revolutionary and a bomber. Although he said he was still angry
about his arrest, he added, ``I can let my anger fester and make me
feel worse, or change it into confidence and fearlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the last song in ``Ragtime'' is called ``Make Them
Hear You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make them hear me,'' he said.

BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS.... MARGARET CHO TELLS ALL IN ONE-WOMAN SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By SHERRY THOMAS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get Margaret Cho offstage, and the scrunchy-faced, she-Mom
impressions disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maaaaaaw-gret. ... Are you gay? Are you gay? Pick up the
phone. If you don't pick up the phone, that means you're gay.''
</P>
<P>
   You also don't get the trademark ``straight man'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were not for gay men, I would not talk to men at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you hear Cho's flippant but funny observations about
the failure of society to recognize promiscuity as a sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's MY parade?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the serious side of Margaret Cho. Call it Margaret Cho _
unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the failure of her short-lived ABC sitcom _
four years after drugs, alcohol and diet pills nearly killed her _
Cho is finding a panacea in her punch lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all true,'' she says of her off-Broadway show, ``I'm the
One That I Want,'' playing Saturday in Houston. ``There's nothing
that's not true. It's all real, and it all happened. All of it was
out of a need to cope with some sort of painful experience in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Cho to turn tragedy into comedy. In her play (a mix
of theater and stand-up), the San Francisco comedian laces her
deadpan, often blue humor with some serious issues. Yes, her mother
(uproarious Korean accent included) is still in the act. So are the
jokes about Cho's allegiance to the homosexual community.
(``They're my tribe.'')
</P>
<P>
   What's different is that Cho, for the first time ever, talks
(er, jokes) freely about her alcohol-laden, ego-crushing experience
after the demise of her 1994 series, ``All-American Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a story about self-discovery. It follows my rise and
demise in American television and the resulting depression that I
went through,'' says Cho, 30, calling from her less-than-glamorous
temporary Greenwich Village apartment, where she lives with her
dog, Ralph (pronounced Rafe).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only now able to talk about what happened to me during my
sitcom. It was so bizarre,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Cho, who had been performing on the road since she was 16, was
elated with the idea of having her own TV show. It meant no more
living city-to-city, hotel-room-to-hotel-room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of being on the road. There I was, 23 years old,
and I felt like an old woman,'' she says. ``I was just trying to
get some sanity, get some stability.''
</P>
<P>
   What she found, however, is that the rigors of road life were
nothing compared to the politics of Hollywood. All of a sudden, she
went from being a successful national comedy sensation to a
``round-faced'' Korean actress (perhaps too round-faced and Korean,
they told her) who entered the sitcom's pilot season with extreme
paranoia and a growing addiction to diet pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was I was trying to get off the road and got
this deal to do a show, and it turned out like `Saved by the
Gong,''' she says, half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked to lose weight to play the part of myself on my
own TV show, and I did it. That is such a taboo thing to ask
somebody to do. We would all love to lose weight and be thinner,
but when somebody tells you that _ that you have to lose the weight
or you'll lose your job _ it's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   She got skinny fast, using diet pills, vitamins and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I didn't stay skinny, I wouldn't have my own
show. I lost weight so incredibly fast I was hospitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the beginning of the end. After
``All-American Girl'' was canceled in 1995, Cho drifted into a
self-destructive spiral.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, writing ``I'm the One That I Want'' was therapy,
Cho's redemption from nearly five years of drugs, alcohol and
promiscuous sex.
</P>
<P>
   Oh goodness, that ``sex'' word again. She's talks about it
plenty in her show, and her punch lines are far too R-rated for a
``family'' newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, comes the obvious question: What must Mother Cho think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maaaaaaw-gret!''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom enjoys quite a bit of fame, and she's very proud of her
stardom,'' Cho says with a laugh, admitting that her relationship
with her mom and dad these days is much more amiable than her act
might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, when I was growing up, used to really embarrass me.
I was so mortified by her,'' Cho says. ``She was so incredibly
foreign and so loud and so honest and so brutal. I was
uncomfortable, so my friends and I would make fun of her all the
time _ what she was doing, what she was saying. Then it wasn't
embarrassing. It became this wonderful connection I could have with
my friends over my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cho says she respects her Korean-immigrant mother, Young
Cho, both for her directness and her desire to give her children a
``better life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing,'' Cho says. ``I think my mother is my
inner voice of reason. And she is also the ancient part of me _ the
part that is always going to be Korean: She's my Asian-ness.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's performance marks the first time the off-Broadway
show has been seen outside New York, where it opened June 22 at the
Westbeth Theater Center.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did Houston get so lucky?
</P>
<P>
   Cho says she loves it here, and with a dedication to helping
AIDS-related charities, her work with the Montrose Clinic has made
Houston a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great city,'' she says. ``I've played there for many
years. And I just really find the audiences to be so incredibly
loving and supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's latest CD, ``Margaret Cho Live in Houston,'' was recorded
in December at the Laff Stop and benefits the Montrose Clinic.
Proceeds from Saturday's merchandise sales and VIP tickets benefit
the clinic's HIV-prevention efforts.

<P>
   Some Chinese fear ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, low wooden planks were installed beneath doors
in palaces and courtyard homes to keep out the ghosts. Inside
gateways, spirit walls were erected to deflect the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Chinese officials create propaganda to keep the ghosts at
bay. So any open discussion of Chinese extremism _ be it mass
movement or massacre _ is taboo.
</P>
<P>
   To master the past and contain it, new Chinese dynasties
routinely rewrote history. The Communists do the same. So do
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we call it spin control, or cover up. It one way to
skirt responsibility. The Chinese state sanitizes and perverts the
facts of its ugly excesses. So the massacre in Beijing a decade ago
was glossed over. Chinese troops mowed down civilians with gunfire
and killed hundreds _ perhaps many more.
</P>
<P>
   After the bloodshed, shocked and angry citizens decried Premier
Li Peng as a Hitler. Yet the official propaganda portrayed only the
few army troops who were killed as martyrs. Protesters who tried to
fight back were called hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   There was never a full official accounting of all the civilians
who died. Instead the peaceful movement that brought so many
Beijing citizens onto the streets to seek government accountability
and an end to corruption was branded as an unpatriotic rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, lies create doubts. After the brutal military
crackdown in Beijing, many people across China began to ask, ``What
really happened in 1989?'' Ten years later, and they're still
asking.
</P>
<P>
   This haunts China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   China has changed in the ten years since Tienanmen Square. Many
people are richer. But most Chinese are still poor. Many feel
aggrieved and insecure. Angry at a tide of layoffs. Abandoned by
the institutions they came to depend on. In their disenchantment
burns the seeds of backlash to an economic reform program, and
revulsion against corruption and abuse of power. Today, many
Chinese people are in a prickly mood.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect this public unease, the government nurtures the
notion that ``foreign hostile forces'' are afoot. In their
internal, semisecret propaganda, the Communists have long marked
America as a ``sensitive'' or hostile country. A dangerous ghost
over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   By habit, foreigners _ often called ``foreign ghosts'' _ are
kept at a distance. Foreign businessmen who seek to make money from
China seldom do. But why should they? The Chinese need to conserve
what little they have. Why should the greed of outsiders outstrip
the need of insiders?
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese aim to gather and glean everything they can to
improve their lot. They have appetites for hamburgers, computer
software and missile technology. They will continue to appropriate
high-technology designs or tabloid television styles and then adapt
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese people may be mesmerized by Hollywood movies or
American ideals of perfectibility. Many may envy Western wealth or
democratic values. But Western forms will ultimately be infused
with Chinese content.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are mistaken if they assume that the Chinese want to
become like us. They don't. Neither do they wish to be bullied.
Consequently, the zeal of the new Western missionary quest for
globalization makes some in China feel vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Does globalization mean interchange or is it a cover for
exploitation and interference? The specter of a world where the
right to seek justice for groups or individuals involves crossing
national borders is a new ghost. The Chinese want to exorcise it.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO attacked Serbia, the Chinese government could easily
conjure up future Western military involvement in Taiwan, Tibet or
Xinjiang _ zones Beijing regards as its sacred territory. That's
why China's propaganda created a potent anti-Western narrative
central to the war in former-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, more
new ghosts were let loose. The CIA may claim the strike was an
accident, but to the Chinese, the CIA is an organization of spooks.
In China, it is both an article of faith and a tenet of propaganda
that the bombing was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the Chinese have stewed about their history of
exploitation, occupation and pillage by foreign powers. This
history has scarred the Chinese psyche.
</P>
<P>
   So when the government lit the fuse by approving demonstrations
and sanctifying them as patriotic, a reservoir of anger poured out
on streets across China and in front of the U.S. embassy in
Beijing. Some of the outrage was shared by the more Western-leaning
citizens of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China played the xenophobia card. The three Chinese killed in
Belgrade were honored as martyrs _ very deliberately _ to send a
message to all Chinese that they were the victims of ``the U.S.-led
NATO.'' Chinese posters caricatured not Li Peng, but President
Clinton, as Hitler. It was a bizarre echo of the aftermath of the
Beijing massacre.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese press largely avoided reporting on the ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo, as it avoided reporting the protester
cleansing in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   More ghosts are floating about.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is making allegations of Chinese spying. This is
America's xenophobia card. It could create a climate of fear and
suspicion that unfairly tars some Chinese and Chinese Americans.
Yet little has been said about American espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese are busy picking up dissidents and
remaking Tiananmen Square. They are preparing to lay new paving
stones in the Square, as if such a literal cover up could tamp down
the ghosts of the massacre and forever deter any popular
demonstrations to mark it.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, however, the same people who are asking ``What
really happened in Beijing in 1989?'' may ask ``What really
happened in Kosovo in 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, to those asking ``What really happened in Belgrade?''
America has a chance and a duty to set a standard for
accountability by giving the Chinese a full and honest explanation
of how and why their embassy came to be attacked. Then expose and
punish those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   To get along and get ahead it is critical that Americans and
Chinese avoid extremism. It also is a time to be firm and
fair-minded. People in both countries require leaders who demand
accountability, act with restraint, and do not flinch from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to confront the ghosts.

   (``Worry achieves nothing and wastes valuable time.'' -- John M.
Templeton)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN M. TEMPLETON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. Templeton Foundation Press &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Distributed by N.Y. Times Special Features &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A talented young woman thought seriously of becoming a doctor.
She considered how wonderful it would be to make people feel
better. She would be given the opportunity to heal the sick and
help save lives. She fantasized about the good income she could
earn by following her deepest desire.
</P>
<P>
   Then she began to worry. She worried about the length of time it
would take to become a doctor. She worried about the cost of her
studies. She even worried about worrying so much.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her vacillating between desire and doubt, the young
woman never took the entrance exams for the school to which she
applied. Her behavior led to failure to achieve her principle goal
in life and dramatized the old adage, ``Worry is like a rocking
chair that gives you something to do, but doesn't get you
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of us know the enjoyment of the soothing activity of
rocking in a rocking chair. A frightened child can be comforted by
a gentle, rocking motion. A physically injured person may often
rock back and forth to temper sensations of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking not only soothes the body, it can also be as comforting
to the spirit as watching the ocean rise and fall in the rhythm of
the waves. However, rocking leaves us in the present place; it
doesn't move us forward.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, worrying is the same as rocking. Worrying can
become a familiar behavior and, in this sense, a comfortable one
that might trick us into believing we may be doing something to
solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once worrying becomes a habit, we may no longer be conscious of
choosing to do it. It can become automatic. Worry, like rocking,
doesn't move us forward or achieve anything. It can waste valuable
time that could be spent in finding ways to approach a challenge
creatively.
</P>
<P>
   Worry can occupy a place better given to rest and relaxation;
and rest and relaxation often allow us to approach a challenge with
refreshed and revitalized energies. There can be numerous ways to
meet life--to look at, experience, and overcome obstacles. One of
the most destructive and self-defeating ways to meet a challenge
can be worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
   If we trace the history of a word in an unabridged dictionary,
we can learn the original meaning of the word. Let's look at the
word ``worry'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   Webster's New World Dictionary describes ``worry'' as to
``strangle or choke, to annoy or bother.'' Think about this for a
moment. When we worry, we can strangle the flow of ideas that could
help us solve the problem. We can choke (or block) the life current
and keep it from flowing freely through us.
</P>
<P>
   When we worry, we often come into a state of concern and,
sometimes, anxiety. Anxiety is defined as ``worry or uneasiness
about what may happen.'' You have probably already agreed in your
mind that worry is not a particularly attractive or successful way
to meet life.
</P>
<P>
   One of the quickest ways we can free ourselves from worry is to
accept our self-responsibility, which is a marvelous option. In his
book ``Your Erroneous Zones,'' Dr. Wayne Dyer writes, ``The tragedy
of being guilty and worrying is that we immobilize ourselves in the
present moment.'' If we focus our attention on the present moment
and take responsibility for our thoughts and feelings, we can
refuse to allow worry to interfere with our success.
</P>
<P>
   A husband and wife were having a discussion about a domestic
situation. The husband spent long hours worrying about how they
would meet the month's financial responsibilities. The wife, having
listened to his discouraging remarks for a couple of days, called
him to sit with her at the kitchen table. She laid the bills on the
table, picked up a pencil and a piece of paper, and said, ``Now you
give me one good reason how worrying can help pay these bills, and
I'll sit here and worry with you for the rest of the day!
Otherwise, let's look at possible ways we can increase our income
to meet our responsibilities!''
</P>
<P>
   We can decide in the present moment to release ourself from
worry and choose more positive life options, more creative and
freeing attitudes, more enlightened states of mind and healthier
beliefs. You are a growing and unfolding creation. You can accept
your wonderful capacity for constructive actions. Most things
people worry about tend not to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Worry can be one way to meet life, but self-responsibility can
be the better way. Worry often stems from fear, but
self-responsibility and self-respect move from an attitude of faith
in God, faith in the goodness of life, faith in the universe, and
faith in our own potential.
</P>
<P>
   The ineffectiveness of worry can be humorously described in the
following story:
</P>
<P>
   A man was complaining of insomnia caused by worrying over a
situation. He said, ``Even counting sheep is no good. I counted ten
thousand, sheared them, combed the wool, had it spun into cloth,
made into suits, took them to town, sold them, and lost a thousand
dollars on the deal! I haven't slept in a week!''
</P>
<P>
   If the young woman who wanted to become a doctor had used the
time she spent worrying to study for her entrance exams and
concentrate on a positive attitude, she may have taken a positive
action, no matter how minor. It can certainly be acceptable to rest
for a while when necessary, then get up and move forward by placing
one foot in front of the other, one step at a time.

CHAKA KHAN: FUNKY (NOT A) DIVA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chaka Khan would like to get one thing straight: Although she
appeared on the recent TV special ``VH1 Divas Live,'' and although
she's touring with soul-diva supreme Patti LaBelle, La Chaka would
appreciate it if people would stop trying to pin that ubiquitous
``diva'' tag on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a positive thing to be a diva,'' Khan said
from her home in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of opera singers as divas. You know, stuck on
themselves, playing a role, as opposed to just doing your life. I
strive for humility and staying close to the earth. I'm not a diva;
I'm nothing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, LaBelle and Khan will share the revolving stage at
the Arena Theater in Houston in what is being billed nationally as
the ``Honey Nut Cheerios Sisters Soulfest.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan emphasized that there are no backstage diva trips taking
place between these soul sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a really good person, one of the few women in this
business I can work with,'' Khan said of LaBelle. ``I'm so honored
to be doing this tour with her. That's why I'm opening. It's two
high-caliber artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Khan emerged as funk's leading female vocalist,
first with the band Rufus and then on her own. Her classic hits
have been covered by some of the top female artists in contemporary
rhythm and blues: Whitney Houston (``I'm Every Woman''), Mary J.
Blige (``Sweet Thing,'' ``Everlasting Love'') and Erykah Badu
(``Stay'').
</P>
<P>
   But Khan said she's never been more satisfied with her recorded
work than she was with last year's ``Come 2 My House'' album. The
album was co-produced by Khan and the Artist Formerly Known as
Prince and features contributions from legendary bass player Larry
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The three music-business veterans have formed an alliance called
New Power for the Old School. The idea is for artists to retain
ownership and creative control of their music. ``Come 2 My House''
was released on the Artist's NPG label and can be purchased through
the Internet and at Khan's concerts, as well as at some
conventional retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very satisfied with how it's turned out,'' Khan said.
``We've sold about a million copies so far. I've already made more
money on this CD than I ever made with Warner Bros. Artists need to
establish systems for supporting each other. The big labels are
slowly becoming obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan's only disappointment is that ``Come 2 My House'' hasn't
received more exposure on radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic,'' she said. ``This album contains some of the
best singing I've ever done. So where is the support from all those
DJs who supposedly say they love me?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in her career, Khan developed a reputation for hard
living and erratic behavior. She now says she's operating with a
clean slate. Everything that happened before 1991 is sort of a
blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of life lessons, OK? And when I learn a life
lesson, it tends to be really dramatic or traumatic. But I don't
dwell on the stuff. It's done. I can't remember what it is I'm
supposed to regret, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Khan is the mother of two grown children and a
grandmother of one. A native of Chicago, she was born Yvette
Stevens and adopted the name Chaka when she joined a black-power
organization in the late '60s. Prior to signing on with Rufus, she
was briefly married to Assan Khan, a musician from India.
</P>
<P>
   Khan now divides her time between homes in Los Angeles, New
Jersey and London. She loves living in England, where she considers
the people to be better-mannered and more self-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the policemen are sweet, and you can always judge a
society by its law enforcement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Khan also maintains that European audiences have a greater
respect for black music as art than those in the United States,
where classic music forms tend to be discarded and forgotten in the
never-ending pursuit of the latest flavor of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very appreciative of the arts in general,'' Khan said
of the British. ``They love jazz, R&AMP;B and gospel. Jazz can't get
arrested in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan has flirted with jazz throughout her career. Most recently,
she recorded as a guest vocalist with Joe Henderson. She said she
is planning a full album of jazz in collaboration with the great
bebop lyricist Jon Hendricks, of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross fame.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her current favorites, Khan comes up with a surprisingly
eclectic list; Mica Paris, Robert Cray, Blues Traveler, Keith
Jarrett. But she reserves her highest praise for Joni Mitchell,
both in terms of lyrical inspiration and the soulful quality of her
voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When young singers ask me for advice, I tell them to get a
Joni Mitchell album, listen to it and learn to harmonize with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Khan professes to have forgotten much of her earlier
life, she does remember the lyrics to her old hits, and she'll be
singing them in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank my friends _ I don't call them fans _ for
hanging in there with me all these years. I just hope with all the
old songs, everyone gets their song eventually. I want to please.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call her a diva.

<P>
   Dr. Martens turn 40 this year. And for a middle-aged fashion
phenomenon, this comfortable shoe remains anything but pedestrian
to the hip and cool _ living outside the U.K., that is. For
visiting teens on the tourist trail, a trip to the four-story Dr.
Martens' flagship store in Covent Garden is as much a part of
``doing London'' as the Tower of London, Madame Tussauds and the
changing of the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-old Monica Jones has five assorted pairs of Dr.
Martens boots and shoes back home in the States. Yet she's in
Covent Garden, London, to buy a sixth. She's also buying a pair
each for her sister and a cousin in St. Louis. Her brother Brad,
18, is buying a pair ``to order'' for his girlfriend, and their
friend John Zumwalt, 21, is buying his third pair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a gaggle of American girls debates the new open-toed
sandal. Upstairs, a moody adolescent Spanish boy persuades his
mother of the virtues of what worryingly looks like a pair of
jackboots. On the top floor a stylish thirtysomething French couple
buy sensible shoes for their toddler.
</P>
<P>
   From Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to Metrojaya in Kuala Lumpur
Dr. Martens is branded as the quintessential footwear for British
youth. Dr. Martens is not selling anything as mundane as shoes _
it's flogging a slice of British youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub. At home on the streets of Britain,
plugged-in teens don't care a whit for 'Doc' Martens. It may be the
infamous shoes' 40th anniversary, but the only Brit I saw in the
flagship store was asking for directions.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Dr. Martens were everywhere, but today
they're history, sought after by foreign teens. When did Brits fall
out of love with the Doc?
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1945, not with the English, but with the
Germans. Recovering from a skiing accident, Dr. Klaus Maertens of
Munich invented the air-cushioned sole using salvaged Luftwaffe
rubber and old soldiers' uniforms. The next year he ran into an old
university friend, Dr. Herbert Funck and they mass-produced his
revolutionary sole. They sold vast numbers of the shoes _ mainly to
housewives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the Griggs family acquired the global rights to the
Maertens' sole and Anglicised the name. They spent 10 years selling
them to postmen. Then the hand of fate touched Dr. Martens. In
1968-69 during a wave of violence by football fans, the British
police declared the steel toe-capped army and miners' boots favored
by skinheads as an offensive weapon. The skins then switched to
`Docs.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Skinheads wore oxblood Dr. Martens, so the spilt blood
wouldn't show,'' says Martin Raymond, senior lecturer at the London
College of Fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The skins' interest kick-started a long and powerful association
with British pop music and youth fashion. From skins to punks,
psychobillies, mods, indie kids and travelers, each new subculture
adopted the grooved soles and made them their own. The boots
signified you were a paid-up member of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Musical stars such as Pete Townsend, Ian Dury, Sid Vicious, Joe
Strummer, Buster Bloodvessel, Suggs, Siouxsie Sioux, Morrissey,
Shane MacGowan and Sinead O'Connor didn't just wear the boots, they
embraced them. Echoes of celebrity endorsements fill the London
Hard Rock Cafe, with glass cabinets full of signed photos, boots,
guitars, Lambrettas, flags and records at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s Dr. Martens went mainstream. They were
practical, cheap and could be worn with practically anything. Women
became devotees because the shoes were so comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Docs were life-changing for me,'' says Yvonne, who was 18 when
she bought her first pair, in 1983. ``It's impossible to imagine
what it was like before because Docs changed everything, but I
hadn't had a comfy pair of shoes in my life. Suddenly you had this
whole generation of young women who wouldn't wear anything else. We
wore them everywhere, with everything. And because they were so
clumpy they made your legs look thin as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were seriously practical for our climate,'' agrees shoe
designer Oliver Sweeney. ``They were brilliant _ shoes with
attitude. Before then, shoes tended to be neat, light and
impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Dr. Martens ruled the country, but then
started the long fall from grace. These days the only
style-conscious Brits prepared to be seen dead in them are sections
of the gay community who have subverted the boot's historically
violent macho image into a gay icon.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``They started going out of fashion from 1988,'' Raymond says.
``Dr. Martens were the last things you could wear dancing in a
club. They became nonfunctional as well as unfashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravers wore trainers, so Nike and Adidas stole the Dr. Martens'
air-cushioned thunder, and the era of the trainer shoe began.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martens may have been a victim of their own success. Having
created the huge demand for practical comfort shoes, it was not
long before others followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a million competitors,'' Sweeney says. ``Dr.
Martens had the market to themselves for a long time. But nowadays
shoe design is so advanced, plus the Far East has become a major
supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martens became a victim of their own success in another way.
They were everywhere, as likely to turn up on the feet of
cardigan-wearing school teachers as smacked-out psychobillies. Even
the Pope wears Dr. Martens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a statement to wear them,'' says Dylan Jones,
editor of GQ magazine. ``I wouldn't say they're unfashionable,
they're just a different animal, a mass-market product.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave Dr. Martens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Martens are selling a very powerful adjective,'' says
fashion author Ted Polhemus, ``one that has a rich history and
vocabulary. They should view this as a liberation. They should get
out of the pigeonholing business and get postmodern; get really
funky with it, play around with the context of the brand. They've
got to defy the usual cliched expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, there's always the revival to look
forward to. Until then, happy birthday Dr. Martens.

CHEN TAKES ON CHINA IN `XIU XIU: THE SENT DOWN GIRL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Joan Chen asked permission to film ``Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down
Girl'' where it was set, in Chinese-controlled Tibet, China told
her no, she could not.
</P>
<P>
   Chen did it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, best known for her roles in ``The Last Emperor'' and TV's
``Twin Peaks,'' considered shooting the movie in the United States.
But when she visited Tibet, she knew it had to be made there.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Chen's film of a city girl sent by the communist
state to learn agricultural skills takes place mainly in remote
locales. Chen shot in an empty area on the border of China and
Tibet. The authorities never found out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was filming in an area where there were not many people,''
Chen said. ``So though I was nervous, there was no communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an uncomfortable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't do it again,'' she said of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   While Chen's film remains banned in China, pirated copies are
available there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Directing ``Xiu Xiu'' (Show Show) was a very personal experience
for Chen. She did not suffer the fate of the Chinese girl Xiu Xiu,
but she knows she could have.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1976, during China's Cultural Youth Revolution,
millions of educated Chinese youths were sent away from their homes
in the city to rural areas. Chen's film is about one of those young
people, a girl whose life and innocence were crushed by the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life story is different,'' Chen said. ``I was chosen to be
an actress in the film studio (in China), which is really one
(chance) out of a billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``But throughout my growing up, this was the most intense and
controversial and talked-about topic _ the children being `sent
down.' I thought I was going to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is so close to my heart; it is a story about my
generation. I needed to wrap up this part of my life, which was
fractured because I came to the United States. And for her (Xiu
Xiu), this person who represents a generation that needs to be
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen was born in Shanghai in 1961. In 1980, she received China's
best-actress award for her second film. At 20, with the reluctant
consent of the Chinese government, she came to the United States to
study filmmaking at California State University, Northridge, where
she graduated with honors. Thanks to her success in acting, she has
lived here ever since, sometimes returning to Shanghai to act. She
lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is close friends with Chinese-born writer Yan Geling, who
wrote the novella ``Xiu Xiu'' and co-wrote the screenplay with
Chen. At age 12, Geling became a ballerina, joining a performing
troupe of the Chinese Liberation Army. She served seven years as a
dancer and soldier, including 18 months in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The character of Xiu Xiu is based on a girl Geling knew, a
once-devoted communist who was sent to one of the remote areas of
China. That girl suffered in much the way Xiu Xiu does in the film,
although her own tragic story had a different ending from Xiu Xiu's
in the book and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty close to the true story,'' Chen said. ``Geling
moved the location (in the book), because she knew the people and
locale of Tibet better than the province the girl was sent down
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu'' is an austerely beautiful and sad film. Chen,
directing with more assurance than one might expect from a
first-timer, avoided playing to obvious and melodramatic
sentimentality, her unemotional approach letting viewers find their
own responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, time and distance have crystallized these emotions.
It's so close to me that I didn't need to make too big of an
effort, and I didn't want to. I wanted it to be more controlled,
restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film's tragic nature, Chen calls it hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopeful because she is remembered. I always felt if there is
no suffering or sometimes cruelty, there is no beauty.''

   As art exhibitions go, ``The View From Asgaard: Rockwell Kent's
Adirondack Legacy'' is a small show: just 23 paintings and some
lithographs, drawings and artifacts. But it has the makings of a
big draw nonetheless, and not just because it is on view at the
Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, N.Y., in the heart of
Adirondack State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Kent, a colorful character born in 1882, specialized in painting
rugged landscapes like those that abound in New York's north
country. Yet his views of the Adirondacks are not well known, and
the exhibition offers a chance both to see them and, for those up
for an excursion into Kent's painting grounds, to see the scenes
that inspired them. In something of a historical footnote, the show
also reunites works separated by the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   If not a towering talent in American art, Kent was a prolific
man who made a good living not only as a painter but also as a
commercial artist, muralist, designer of fabric, pottery and
jewelry, architect and Adirondack dairy farmer. In his later years,
his popularity faded as he derided abstraction and the critics who
promoted it, though many of his own works feature large, flat
shapes that are decidedly ``modern.''
</P>
<P>
   When he died in 1971, Kent's reputation rested more on his
renowned illustrations for books like ``Moby-Dick'' than on his
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kent might have gone farther had his politics not been as
radical as his art was conservative.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken, lifelong socialist and communist sympathizer, he
got caught up in McCarthy-era emotionalism. Called to testify
before Sen. Joseph McCarthy's investigations subcommittee in 1953,
Kent, ever the individualist, took shelter behind the Fifth
Amendment. Just outside the hearing room, he declared that he had
never been a member of the Communist Party, but the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   Museums and galleries shunned his work. The Farnsworth Art
Museum in Rockland, Maine, soon reversed its earlier decision to
accept Kent's gift of 80 paintings and 800 prints and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1960 Kent gave the entire trove to the Soviet Union, where
his work had been warmly received during a 1957-58 touring show.
Nothing from ``the great Kent collection'' has been seen in the
United States since.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. With the Cold War over, the Adirondack Museum decided
to seek a few of those works for ``The View From Asgaard.'' As a
small museum attempting its first international loan show, it did
not have the clout or the money to borrow from the Pushkin Museum
in Moscow or the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, where most of Kent's
works in Russia reside.
</P>
<P>
   But it did find a willing partner in Armenia, thanks to Scott
Ferris, the exhibition's guest curator. While researching
``Rockwell Kent's Forgotten Landscapes,'' a catalog of the
paintings in the former Soviet Union of which he is co-author (Down
East Books, 1998), Ferris had made friends with Shahen
Khachaturian, the director of the National Gallery of Armenia in
Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
   In an improbable coincidence, Khachaturian had a personal
connection to the artist; in 1962, when Kent visited the gallery,
he had been the tour guide. He eagerly agreed to lend two
paintings, ``Asgaard's Meadows'' and ``Oncoming Storm:
Adirondacks.'' In fact, he tried to bring them personally, but they
were left behind when he changed planes in Zurich, victims of a
bureaucratic snafu. Professional couriers had to rescue them in
time for a celebratory opening May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has one more bit of bait. Kent's artistic credo,
as written in his 1955 autobiography, was ``Go before nature, use
your eyes, and then paint what you see.'' How would his landscapes,
made between 1928 and 1965, compare with the vistas in the
``forever wild'' Adirondacks today?
</P>
<P>
   Ferris, the former director of the Rockwell Kent Legacies at
Asgaard Farm, Kent's home and dairy near Ausable Forks, N.Y., knows
the territory well. He agreed to steer me to sites depicted in
several paintings in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   One morning in late June, I rented a car and drove upstate to
Blue Mountain Lake and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Kent had preceded me by 72 years. He was well known in 1927 when
he left New York and moved with the second of his three wives to
the 200-acre Asgaard Farm, where he had a house, a studio and a
dairy.
</P>
<P>
   Life was busy. Besides farming and painting, Kent wrote (two
autobiographies and several other books), lectured, designed
buildings, campaigned for leftist causes, served as an officer of
labor organizations and in 1948 ran for Congress on the American
Labor Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was an eccentric, difficult man, he entertained
lavishly; elaborate meals, picnics, pool parties, tennis matches,
musical performances and just plain conversation were the order of
the day and, often, the night. Among the guests at Asgaard were
Pete Seeger, Paul Robeson, Louis Untermeyer and John Dos Passos.
</P>
<P>
   Nature was his subject, though, and not just in the Adirondacks.
He embarked on several painting expeditions to remote places like
Greenland, Tierra del Fuego, Alaska and Maine, where he captured on
canvas the barren scenery, the biting winds and the chilly seas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Adirondack Museum, the paintings are warmer, even the
snowy scenes. The Kent show crowds into one gallery, which chief
curator Caroline Welsh had painted the deep blue of a cloudless
summer sky for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Kent laced his works with his personal spiritualism, influenced
by the Transcendentalist belief that nature is a visible
manifestation of a deity. Robert Henri, one of Kent's teachers, is
quoted by Ferris in his catalog essay as observing: ``His painting
is a proclamation of the rights of man, of the dignity of man, of
the dignity of creation. It is his belief in God.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent's reverence for nature is clearly on view, as is his
affection for the Adirondacks region. Several paintings, especially
those like ``Gladsheim'' that depict his home, are tranquil, even
idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some works, like ``Adirondacks,'' which opens the exhibition,
simply employ generic Adirondack imagery. Others, like ``Mountain
Road,'' are close copies of what actually exists. Still others use
the Adirondacks as a backdrop for political messages, like ``Wake
Up, America!,'' from 1941, which warns that the United States is
moving close to war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Welsh, echoing other critics, said that Kent's works with a
message could seem overwrought, like florid prose. Still, Ms. Welsh
and Ferris think that Kent is underappreciated and hope that this
exhibition will elevate his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   As a painter, Kent was agile, sometimes reducing detail and
modeling the shapes; ``Winter Sunrise, Whiteface Mountain'' is
almost abstract. Other times he used an almost superrealist style.
``We wanted to show the diversity of his use of landscape,'' Ms.
Welsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see,'' she added, ``that the quality of the landscape
hasn't changed, even though the details have.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I met Ferris, and we drove northeast through
the towns of Saranac Lake and Lake Placid, past Wilmington and Jay,
toward the Ausable River.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a one-lane bridge whose wood cover had been removed
for repair and was lying off to the left, we pulled over and walked
a few yards down to the riverbank. The view across the river, west
south-west, is portrayed in ``Ausable River Rapids,'' Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   Kent usually worked en plein air, and certainly he sketched
outdoors, but I had a hard time imagining where he had pitched his
easel. Time had clearly intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and brush obscure the foreground, and the wall is more
weathered than it was in 1950, when he painted the scene. Yet the
mountains do overlap. The central tree and the rapids do, too.
After a few minutes of study, the view did seem to match the
painting pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   We walked back across the bridge and bore right, following the
river. Some yards away, Kent had painted ``Skaters.'' But we could
not get there. His vantage point lies on private property or,
improbably, in the rocky area close to the riverbed. With the
bridge cover gone temporarily, and a hot June sun indicating that
it was hardly skating weather anyway, we abandoned our quest to see
if ``Skaters'' stood up to the scene today. We drove a short
distance and pulled over onto a narrow dirt shoulder. Nothing
looked familiar until Ferris suggested I turn around. Sure enough,
``Mountain Road'' lay before me, though Kent had undoubtedly used a
painter's eye.
</P>
<P>
   He had played with perspective, bringing the mountains in closer
and accenting the road to lead the viewer straight to them. His
colors are more vibrant than they were the day I visited. His
clouds are better formed, too; indeed, Kent studied cloud
formations and made so much of them that they became a trademark,
and the subject of a New Yorker cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, we stopped on a winding unpaved road. Kent had
used the view off to the right of the Sentinel range for both
``America'' and ``Adirondacks.'' This is private property, but we
got permission from the owners to see what Kent saw. He must have
used license, though the haze hanging over the distant mountains
did not help. For again, as in ``Mountain Road,'' Kent had
sharpened the view and shrunk the space between his vantage point
and the mountain. Perhaps a telephoto lens would have helped.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of ``Cloud Shadows'' was next. Kent painted this view
of his farm buildings, looking west toward the mountains, many
times in all seasons. Whiteface Mountain, which he particularly
loved, is the high peak on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Several yards away, he painted ``Clover Fields,'' another view
of Asgaard.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the two is fascinating _ and illuminating. True, the
view is slightly different, looking to the southwest. But if Kent
had simply painted what he saw, how much difference would such a
slight distance make?
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Kent took artistic liberty to great effect.
In ``Clover Fields,'' he rearranged the mountains slightly. ``There
is no Whiteface,'' Ferris pointed out. In the foreground, Kent
painted a close-up of the flowers, instead of depicting the pattern
of fields from a distance, as he did in ``Cloud Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   His use of light may be the biggest difference between the two.
``Clover Fields'' has a bright band of light across the center that
changes the whole feeling of the picture and makes it less like the
scene in nature. ``Cloud Shadows,'' despite its puffy, dramatic
clouds, seems bland by comparison. Its blues, pinks and
chartreuse-greens pale next to those in ``Clover Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   We drove farther, through the village of Ausable Forks and up a
hill. We were now looking south toward the mountains, the scene of
``Oncoming Storm: Adirondacks,'' which Kent painted in 1946. In the
work, one of those lent by Armenia, the storm looming in the east
is a metaphor for the approaching Cold War with the Soviet Union.
Kent had preached that ``only tolerance of each other's way of
life'' would insure peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it because of its political message; we wanted to
show that Kent employed Adirondack imagery as a messenger for his
beliefs,'' Ms. Welsh had said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that political overlay, this may have been the
hardest work to envision in today's wilds. It did not help that
what would be the foreground of the work is now overgrown, or that
the painting has a bare-chested worker, walking and carrying pails,
in the foreground, which seemed highly improbable. The haze of the
day interfered, too. But only the profile of the mountains seemed
true.
</P>
<P>
   Still, throughout my excursion it was easy to see why Ferris and
Ms. Welsh said Kent's art was slowly getting a second look. After
museum shows in San Diego in 1985 and Cleveland in 1990, the
Whitney Museum of American Art last year presented ``Rockwell Kent
by Night,'' his first solo exhibition at a major New York museum.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the art museum at the State University of
New York at Plattsburgh opened ``Commercialism and Idealism: The
Advertising Art of Rockwell Kent.'' Next year, the Norman Rockwell
Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., will present ``Distant Shores,''
focusing on Kent's work in the polar regions. It will include four
paintings from the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   And there is ample time to see ``The View From Asgaard: Rockwell
Kent's Adirondack Legacy.'' It remains on view through Sept. 18 and
will be shown again in a slightly different form at the Adirondack
Museum next season, June 1 through Oct. 15, 2000.

   Finding the Sites
</P>
<P>
   ``AUSABLE RIVER RAPIDS'': From Blue Mountain Lake, take Route 30
North to Route 3, then Route 86 and Route 86 North through
Wilmington and through Jay. At the junction of Route 9N, continue
on the extension of Route 86 (Mill Hill Road) and cross a one-lane
bridge over the Ausable River. Stop at the end of the bridge; park
on the right (the south side) and descend to the riverbank. Look
across the river to see the view depicted in ``Ausable River
Rapids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``MOUNTAIN ROAD'': With the bridge behind you, go left onto
North Jay Road/County Road 64 and drive just under two miles. Turn
around to see ``Mountain Road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICA'' and ``ADIRONDACKS'': Continue on County Road 64 for
about 2.5 miles to Stickney Bridge Road and Green Street. Proceed
north on Green Street for a half-mile and make the first right,
onto Black Mountain Road. Go about half a mile. The view to the
right is ``America'' and ``Adirondacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CLOUD SHADOWS'': Retrace the route back to Stickney Bridge
Road and turn right onto it. Turn right onto Sheldrake Road/County
Route 65 and go about 1.3 miles. The view on the left is ``Cloud
Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CLOVER FIELDS'': Proceed another one-tenth of a mile on
Sheldrake Road/County Route 65 and you see ``Clover Fields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ONCOMING STORM'': Continue on Route 65 to Ausable Forks, where
it becomes Main Street and then North Main Street. At a stop sign,
where a sign says ``Fernlake'' and ``Black Brook,'' turn left onto
Silver Lake Road. Go 0.8 mile; at the first fork, bear right onto
Palmer Hill Road. Go a half-mile and turn left onto a dead-end road
(which soon becomes a dirt road). Go one mile and park. Walk past
the gate on the right and proceed about a third of a mile up the
dirt path. You will see an old fire tower with a clearing on the
right. The view from the clearing is the background for ``Oncoming
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting There
</P>
<P>
   BY CAR: From New York City, take the Major Deegan Expressway to
the Thomas E. Dewey Thruway (Interstate 87); continue on I-87 to
Exit 23; from there, pick up Route 9 North and continue on Route 9
North through Warrensburg, N.Y., to Route 28. Take Route 28
straight to Blue Mountain Lake. (It becomes Route 30 just before
Blue Mountain Lake.)

`THE HAUNTING': THINGS THAT GO BUMP, AND WORSE, IN THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' shows what happens when four visitors disturb
the equilibrium of Hill House, a colossal, chokingly ornate
hideaway where no inch is left unadorned and the prevailing style
is Gothic Nouveau Riche. Under the circumstances, ``The Flaunting''
would have made a better title. This latest special-effects
free-for-all from Jan De Bont (``Speed,'' ``Twister'') is a lavish
illustration of how to take a fairly modest black-and-white horror
film from 1963 and amplify it so relentlessly that the sight of the
``Twister'' flying cow would not be all that amiss.
</P>
<P>
   This lavish and at times scary movie (set in a place that
Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, Theo, calls ``sort of Charles
Foster Kane meets the Munsters'') is firmly committed to the notion
that more is more. That goes not only for decor but for the ghost
story itself, ``The Haunting of Hill House'' by Shirley Jackson,
which in Robert Wise's earlier version was allowed to suggest more
than it spelled out. Incidentally, that film contains the
remarkable line: ``For the past 11 years, I've been walled up alive
on a desert island.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is Nell, the lonely spinster played by Lili Taylor
here with the same hothouse intensity that Julie Harris brought to
the role. She is the pivotal figure in what David Self's screenplay
makes a four-character spooky tale. Having been dominated for years
by her family, Nell turns over a new leaf by deciding to
participate in a scientific experiment led by Dr. David Marrow
(Liam Neeson). The doctor's apparently unlimited research budget
makes Hill House a fine site for investigating the nature of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The film is sufficiently aware of other instincts to cast Ms.
Zeta-Jones as catty Theo, whose flirtation with Nell was more
flagrant when Claire Bloom played the role. Here, Ms. Zeta-Jones
flirts with everything, which in Hill House could keep her busy a
long time. Completing the principal cast is Owen Wilson, co-writer
of ``Rushmore,'' who shambles through the house in pajama bottoms
and baseball mitt, definitely giving the film some fresh air and
humor. Wilson spends much of the story in an azure-blue sweater
that stands out from the ornate gloom in ways that say ``I'd rather
be surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor and his recruits have not been on the premises long
(let in by Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes as sinister caretakers)
before they arrive at the one scientifically demonstrable
conclusion: Hill House has a mind of its own. Walls turn flexible,
gothic windows wink, a wraith morphs into the bedsheets and every
face carved into the woodwork stands a chance of coming alive;
don't even ask about the gryphon statues lining the humongous grand
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Things really do go bump in the night, and De Bont keeps them
coming with diabolical effectiveness for a while. However, by the
time it begins raining skulls and bones in the grandiose entrance
hall, the effects go a wee bit over the top.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the horror is supposedly the house's builder,
Hugh Crain, whose evil-looking likeness is prominently placed to
give visitors chills. Credits list Charles Gunning as Crain, so the
film's spirited actors wisely steer clear of the picture for as
long as they can. But the film's spooky tricks are actually
orchestrated by top-notch behind-the-scenes talent, who augment De
Bont's tireless efforts to keep things moving.
</P>
<P>
   Especially notable is the work of Phil Tippett and Craig Hayes,
visual effects supervisors from ``Jurassic Park'' and the sound
designer Gary Rydstrom, the seven-time Academy Award winner with
``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``Titanic'' to his credit. The very
busy production designer is Eugenio Zanetti, who showed an affinity
for high kitsch with ``Restoration'' and ``What Dreams May Come.''
He does not disappoint this time.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
will be in Cooperstown this weekend, and one of the items on the
Texas governor's schedule is a private meeting and sleepover with
New York Gov. George E. Pataki, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who recently became the 17th Republican governor to
endorse Bush for the party's nomination, has occasionally been
mentioned as a potential vice presidential candidate, or perhaps
Cabinet member if the son of former President George Bush wins the
2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to be in Cooperstown to attend a fund-raiser
on his behalf at the home of businessman Walter Rich. He is also
slated to attend the induction of pitcher Nolan Ryan, a former
Texas Ranger, into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Bush is a former
owner of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to hold a 1:30 p.m. news conference Saturday
with Ryan at Cooperstown High School. Aides to Bush said the news
conference would deal only with baseball, not politics. Pataki is
not scheduled to attend that event.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said the two governors will spend
the night at the home of a ``top Republican fund-raiser.'' On
Sunday, Pataki and Bush are scheduled to attend a brunch in Ryan's
honor, after which New York's governor will open the ceremony at
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Pataki may be chosen as a candidate to run for
vice president on the Bush ticket has helped raise money in a
heavily Democratic state, said Lee Miringoff of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign took in a record $37 million nationally from
March to the end of June, according to Federal Election Commission
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he will ultimately carry New York remains to be seen.
At this stage, with the blessings of Pataki, the fund raising is
going very well for him,'' Miringoff said. ``I get the message that
when Pataki endorsed him, what he was telling Bush was that `New
York could provide money, media and maybe me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Texas Lt. Gov. Rick Perry will be featured at a
fund-raiser in Albany hosted by Pataki's lieutenant governor, Mary
Donohue, and state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fund raising in the world won't change the fact that
the state Republican Party is bankrupt on ideas,'' state Democratic
Party spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said.

 &HT;    ENCRYPTION BILL HEADS FOR HOUSE SHOWDOWN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a private meeting with House Democrats last
month, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said his top public policy
priority was to have Congress lift controls on the export of
encryption products, which protect computer files and
communications with powerful codes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, top House Republicans are expected to begin working
on a deal that would clear the way for a floor vote on an
encryption measure before mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they must reconcile deep divisions between the
high-tech industry, which believes action is needed soon to sustain
the growth of electronic commerce, and law enforcement leaders, who
fear universal access to powerful encryption software would deter
their ability to pursue suspected criminals and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   These issues loom so large that in recent weeks, five House
committees claimed jurisdiction and voted out widely differing
drafts of an encryption bill. It will now be up to a sixth panel,
the Rules Committee, to meld the work already done by Armed
Services, Commerce, Intelligence, International Relations and
Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., supports a
version of the bill that would make legal to export encryption
software currently widely available in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier's quiet backing, along with that of Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., has changed the House chemistry from the prior
Congress. Then, leadership divisions and implacable opposition from
the Clinton administration resulted in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the House leadership reaches a compromise on a bill
to send to the floor for a vote, the battle will hardly be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, there's a solid bipartisan majority behind
relaxing export controls in a way that would do no harm to national
security,'' said David Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based research group that
specializes in studying free speech issues in cyberspace. ``But I'm
not so sure that it will hold after (FBI Director Louis) Freeh
makes the rounds on Capitol Hill, talking privately to the
members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will harm law enforcement,'' Freeh told the Armed
Services Committee on July 13. After hearing from the FBI chief,
the panel moved to substantially weaken the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Attorney General Janet Reno, appearing before the
Senate Select Committee on Encryption and Export Security, issued a
similar warning. ``Many of us use the Internet frequently,'' she
said. ``We bank on line, shop on line, and file our taxes on line.
Encryption helps make all of these transactions more secure, but it
can also make crimes far harder to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, by a 47-6 vote, the Armed Services committee, the
last of the five House panels to act, amended the so-called
Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Act to allow the
president to deny the export of any encryption product on national
security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm greatly troubled by the rapid rush to push through
legislation that would in a very wholesale way eliminate almost
overnight the ability for our intelligence community, our defense
community and our law enforcement community to keep up with the
rapid changes that are occurring in this information revolution,''
said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a chief sponsor of the restrictive
clause.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates and other software industry figures have apparently
been effective in persuading many lawmakers that since the
encryption ``barn door'' has been wide open for some time, the sole
loser in this prolonged struggle has been the American software
industry's drive to make Internet commerce more secure.
</P>
<P>
   That is the view of Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the
ranking Democrat on the International Relations Committee, who
noted that ``experts tell us that a computer's shelf life is as
little as six to nine months. In that kind of era, believing that
you can somehow keep technology under a shroud in a free society
frankly is counterintuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson concluded: ``We need to protect our intelligence
information. We cannot do it by blocking the sale of what is
generally available in this country and globally as software.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, privacy advocates have voiced concerns that the White
House might broker a deal that in return for opening new markets
abroad, would require the industry to provide ``back-door keys''
that would let U.S. authorities decode information encrypted by
programs sold abroad. ``That would be a step in the wrong
direction,'' Sobel said.

`DROP DEAD GORGEOUS': PRETTY IS AS PRETTY DOES, AND WHAT IT DOES IS
NOT PRETTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the guise of sending up beauty pageants (now
(italics)there's(end italics) a new one!) ``Drop Dead Gorgeous''
manages to load up on stereotypes, sneer smugly at Minnesota, stage
a scene in which beauty contestants vomit en masse and make its
audience wince through what may be a record number of miserably
unfunny jokes. Under these circumstances, putting the words ``drop
dead'' in the title really is tempting fate.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing briefly in theaters before it sends home video
enthusiasts reaching for the rewind button, this would-be comedy
takes the form of a bogus documentary, one that seems patently fake
even by bogus documentary standards. It purports to look behind the
scenes at a small-town beauty pageant that is run by a cosmetics
company.
</P>
<P>
   With Kirstie Alley bulldozing her way through the role of a
pushy pageant organizer, the film trots out a series of contestants
who have each been allotted precisely one personality trait.
</P>
<P>
   There is a nyphomaniac. There's somebody threatening to sing and
dance to ``New York, New York.'' There are smiling, dimpled Kirsten
Dunst as the nice girl from a trailer park and exotic, sultry
Denise Richards as the spoiled rich girl who looks like a shoo-in.
(After all, the pageant organizer is her mother.)
</P>
<P>
   These actresses are conspicuously more appealing than their
roles. The same might be said for Ellen Barkin, who plays Ms.
Dunst's boozy mother, if she didn't sink so enthusiastically to the
lame level of these proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   She is last seen here opening a beer can with a hook. As her
best friend, Allison Janney is one of the few players in the film
to emerge reasonably unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   With highlights including a masturbating pageant judge who is
nicknamed ``the retard'' and a scene making fun of not one but two
maimed characters in wheelchairs, ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' need not
fear accusations of being politically correct. Nor need it worry
about being accused of undue wit, what with lines like: ``The
family's steamin' like a cow pat in July.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay is by Lona Williams, who was once a beauty
contestant herself and clearly knows how they feel about Diane
Sawyer. As directed by Michael Patrick Jann of various commercials
and the MTV comedy ``The State,'' the film seems to have been a
shade or two funnier on the page than it is limping across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

`CABARET BALKAN': WHERE LIFE IS BRUTAL, HUMILIATION BECOMES SPORT

   (editors: production notes at end of review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a character in Goran Paskaljevic's film ``Cabaret Balkan''
declares Belgrade to be ``a hemorrhoid'' on the anatomy of the
world, it is one of the nicer descriptions of a city that this
almost unbearably vicious movie depicts as hell on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Paskaljevic, a Serbian filmmaker passionately opposed to
Slobodan Milosevic, has called his movie a black comedy. Maybe so.
But the only laughs to be gotten from this acerbic, powerfully
acted ``La Ronde'' of cruelty, torture and unrestrained anger come
from the mouths of enraged characters as they gleefully inflict
excruciating pain and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1995 and completed well before the NATO bombing of
Serbia, ``Cabaret Balkan'' is a loosely connected series of
nightmarish, stylized vignettes, all set in Belgrade on a bleak
winter night when the temperature is 12 degrees. The stylization is
established in a brief opening nightclub scene. An androgynous MC,
Boris (Nikola Ristanovski), wearing heavy black eye shadow and a
feather boa and twirling a cigarette, sneers into the camera that
he is going to play with our minds. When we see him again at the
end of the movie, he is without makeup and falling-down drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Boris and an unnamed chain-smoking taxi driver (Neobojsa
Glogovac), who is periodically shown cruising through the city
streets, are the cynical observers of the movie's horrors, which
follow one another like numbers in a series of realistic
street-theater sketches. Although the vignettes vary in intensity,
most involve expressions of unfettered sadistic rage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most searing involves two longtime best friends
meeting at a gym for their regular workout as sparring partners.
One (Lazar Ristovkski) half-joshingly tells his partner that he had
sex with the other man's wife while he was away in the army. Oh
well, she's only a woman, the betrayed friend replies with a grin.
Between friendly punches, the pair begin swapping confessions of
mutual betrayals that span many years. One poisoned the other's
dog. One admits he's the father of the other's son. The punches
escalate in fury, with the conflict ending in the shower as one
attacks the other with a broken beer bottle and slashes him to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Later we meet the surviving boxer on a train where he menaces a
beautiful young woman (Ana Sofrenovic) who is distraught over the
death of her boyfriend, a soldier. When the boxer impulsively tells
her that he just killed his best friend, she rummages through her
bag, pulls out a hand grenade and gives it to him. Very slowly he
removes the pin and the two cling to each other as the train car
explodes.
</P>
<P>
   In another sketch a crazed young man (Ivan Bekjarev) gets on a
bus that is 15 minutes late because the driver, a former professor
in Sarajevo reduced to living with his Bosnian Serb family in a
garage, is lingering over his coffee. In a rage the young man
brandishes a knife and begins verbally harassing the passengers.
Hijacking the vehicle, he takes them on a lurching joy ride that
ends in a crash. As the terrorized passengers flee, the bus driver,
who has chased after his stolen vehicle, storms aboard, rushes down
the aisle and smashes the head of the hijacker with a wrench.
</P>
<P>
   One of those escaping passengers, Ana (Mariana Jokovic), flees
into the arms of her boyfriend, George (Toni Mihajovoksi), who
furiously accuses her of flirting with the hijacker. The couple
barely have time to make up before they are waylaid and held
prisoner by Topi (Vojislav Brajovic), a former revolutionary who is
now a cocaine dealer, and his younger sidekick. While Topi,
laughing wildly, bites Ana's face and breaks her fingers one by
one, his cohort holds a gun to George's head and forces him to sing
a Macedonian folk song.
</P>
<P>
   There is much, much more of a similarly brutal nature in
``Cabaret Balkan,'' which has broken box-office records in both
Sarajevo and Belgrade and won several international film festival
awards. One problem with the film is that the characters' ethnic
and national differences and their political ramifications are not
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``Cabaret Balkan'' presents a devastating vision of a
war-torn country in which the basic laws of civilized behavior have
eroded in a climate of all-consuming suspicion, hatred and
vengeance.

`INSPECTOR GADGET': THE ADVENTURES OF A JUSTICE-SEEKING GIZMO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once in a while, junkyards yield up a gem, but most of the time
they are only a lode of trash.
</P>
<P>
   Now the midmorning midden of children's cartoons that proved a
source of comedic cinematic gold a couple of years ago with
``George of the Jungle'' has been mined for a clinker called
``Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes a lot of good talent,
from stars like Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett and Joely Fisher
to supporting players like Dabney Coleman and Michelle Trachtenberg
to the armies of technical wizards enlisted to make convincing its
tale of a bumbling bionic policeman.
</P>
<P>
   But truth to tell, watching ``Inspector Gadget'' is like
watching a human Swiss Army knife for nearly an hour and a half.
It's a remarkable gizmo, but do you really want to spend a whole
lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store Frankstein
creation that can light cigars with his thumb, pick locks with
other fingers, extend his legs and neck, shoot a grappling hook to
the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter from his head?
</P>
<P>
   Most of what passes for attitude and sass in ``Inspector
Gadget,'' directed by David Kellog, whose credits include Jerry
Seinfeld commercials for American Express, comes from the
Gadgetmobile, with the voice of D.L. Hughley. This vehicle is
equipped with eyes, a mind of its own, a stock of brand-name sodas,
burgers and candy and a willingness to let Inspector Gadget
(Broderick) know that as sleuths, go he is strictly a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Broderick brings an endearing combination of
intelligence, wit and naivete to his portrayal of John Brown, a
security guard eager for a job on the Riverton police force who is
transformed into Inspector Gadget after being blown up in an effort
to capture the evil magnate Sanford Scolex (Everett). But even
Broderick can go only so far with the film's noisy, childish
material.
</P>
<P>
   Scolex, accompanied by his hulking henchman Sikes (Michael G.
Hagerty) and abetted by robotic devices, has invaded the laboratory
of kindly Artemus Bradford (Rene Auberjonois), killed the old
scientist and made off with the mind-controlled robotic foot he has
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Brown, who lives with his bright niece, Penny (Ms.
Trachtenberg), is all but killed trying to thwart Scolex's getaway,
but with the help of the woman of his dreams, Artemus' scholarly
daughter, Brenda (Ms. Fisher), Brown is restored to function as a
robocop.
</P>
<P>
   The surly police chief (Coleman), who regards the new Inspector
Gadget as a cross between Columbo and Nintendo, is not amused and
assigns him to school crossing guard duties and rescuing cats from
trees with his extended arms.
</P>
<P>
   But Inspector Gadget has vowed to bring the killer of Artemus
Bradford to justice, and so he will, even if it means doing battle
with his nasty doppelganger Robogadget (Broderick again), a
creation of the megalomaniacal Scolex, who plans world domination
with an army of androids who need no food or sleep and never say
no.
</P>
<P>
   The outcomes of ``Inspector Gadget,'' in terms of justice and
romance, are never for a moment in doubt. The material is familiar,
and a few genuine jokes, including a Minion Recovery Group filled
with henchmen from other films like T, Odd Job and Jaws, are tossed
to the adults like raw meat to starving lions.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end the elaborate gimmickry of ``Inspector Gadget''
cannot conceal its very ordinary storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Inspector Gadget' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It
includes a few mild sexual innuendos and jokes and violence that
should not unhinge regular moviegoers.

`MY LIFE SO FAR': GLOWING REMEMBRANCES OF A SCOTTISH CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far,'' a winsome childhood reverie of family life
in Argyll, Scotland, in the late 1920s, offers such a muted,
smoothly textured swatch of British nostalgia that you feel no
qualms about languishing in its ``Masterpiece Theater'' vision of a
safer, saner, more shining past.
</P>
<P>
   With its soft-focus portrait of a mildly troubled family viewed
through the adoring eyes of a frisky little boy, it suggests Ingmar
Bergman's ``Fanny and Alexander'' with all its demons comfortably
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the prevailing serenity, of course, there are some ruffles.
They include a simmering rivalry between brothers-in-law, sexual
jealousy and pre-adolescent prurience. A beloved matriarch dies.
And there is an embarrassing public spat between the boy's parents.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most upsetting events never undermine the film's
glowing, child's-eye vision of life unfolding in a stately
procession of lovely, adventure-filled days.
</P>
<P>
   The film, based on Denis Forman's childhood memoir, ``Son of
Adam,'' reunites the director Hugh Hudson with the producer David
Puttnam for the first time since their 1981 blockbuster, ``Chariots
of Fire.'' Without turning cloyingly inspirational, the newer film
expresses the same quietly optimistic faith in humanity's nobler
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far'' follows a year in the life of Fraser
Pettigrew (Robert Norman), a 10-year-old boy growing up in Kiloran
House, the sprawling castlelike home of the Macintosh clan in the
Scottish highlands. Presiding over the property is Fraser's benign,
widowed grandmother Gamma Macintosh (Rosemary Harris), whose
daughter Moira (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) has married Edward
Pettigrew (Colin Firth), a handsome eccentric gentleman inventor.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most complex character, Edward is a passionate,
fiery-eyed nonconformist who worships Beethoven (whose music he
tells his son is the sound of God talking in his sleep) and is
obsessed with aviation. When not tinkering with new gadgets, Edward
oversees a marginally profitable moss factory that he has
established on the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his inventions work. His most notable dud is a
subterranean chimney system that leaks so profusely that smoke that
was supposed to have been piped underground billows up through the
lawn in spectacular plumes.
</P>
<P>
   Firth's deep, quietly tempestuous performance portrays Edward as
both a caring father who delights in being a heroic role model for
Fraser, and a petulant, self-absorbed visionary.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's central drama, observed by Fraser without his fully
comprehending what is happening, is the continuing power struggle
between his father and his uncle (Moira's brother) Morris Macintosh
(Malcolm McDowell). A hard-headed businessman, who hopes one day to
inherit the estate, Uncle Morris, as Fraser calls him, disapproves
of Edward's silly schemes.
</P>
<P>
   When Morris brings home his new wife, Heloise (Irene Jacob), a
beautiful, charming, much younger French woman and amateur cellist,
Edward becomes instantly besotted and begins recklessly pursuing
her right under his wife's nose. Relations between the
brothers-in-law, which heretofore have been courteous, are strained
to the breaking point, as is Edward and Moira's marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Life So Far'' observes all this through the eyes of the
curious Fraser, who also falls under Heloise's spell in the
innocent way children do with adults who pay attention to them. At
the same time, the boy makes secret sojourns into the attic, where
he has discovered his grandfather's books, some of which contain
erotic illustrations and definitions of sexual practices.
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most amusing moments, Fraser, unaware of what he's
saying, naively regales his Puritanical family with the details of
his sexual education.
</P>
<P>
   The film is peppered with small, colorful incidents that loom
large in Fraser's memory: the landing on the property of a plane
whose dashing pilot (Tcheky Karyo) sweeps his older sister Elspeth
(Kelly MacDonald) off her feet; a joyous skating carnival that ends
with a tragic accident, and the appearance in the house (through
Heloise) of early jazz records, whose music Edward ominously
declares to be the sound of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the film the flow of a good novel is its consistency
of tone. Sparingly narrated by Fraser, the movie finds a perfect
middle ground between the world as seen through Fraser's eyes and a
more worldly wise authorial omniscience. It's good old-fashioned
storytelling done with panache.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES

`TRICK': THE NIGHT IS YOUNG BUT FULL OF DETOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Trick'' is a tenderhearted boy-meets-boy story that manages to
incorporate the courtship-interruptus style of the Doris Day era
into a Greenwich Village one-night stand.
</P>
<P>
   Its two doe-eyed principals are likable and shy, despite the
steamy circumstances under which they meet. Lonely Gabriel
(Christian Campbell, Neve's angelic-looking brother) ventures into
a gay bar where the go-go dancer is sensationally hunky, and finds
the whole experience so unsettling that he leaves in a daze. Then,
on the subway home, who should appear but the dancer himself, Mark
(John Paul Pitoc). Mark makes it clear to Gabriel that the night is
still young.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film hangs on the slender premise that Gabe and
Mark won't easily find a place to be alone, and that Gabe's
Day-like sexual reticence will be a hurdle wherever they go. It
happens that Campbell and Pitoc (making an attention-getting
feature film debut) are able to make this seem sweetly affecting.
But unfortunately they have company.
</P>
<P>
   The film's idea of a witty third wheel is Tori Spelling, giving
a toxic performance as Gabriel's noisy, tap-dancing best friend,
whose every entrance here is cause for regret. When Ms. Spelling
garishly performs a musical number early in the film, it's not easy
to tell whether she's doing it dreadfully for real or by design.
</P>
<P>
   With that small-town New York coziness that exists chiefly in
Neil Simon comedies, Mark and Gabe go through a whole night's worth
of detours, some a lot more plausible than others.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fall, who directed the easygoing ``Trick'' from a screenplay
by Jason Schafer, makes Gabe's living situation incomprehensible;
mild as he is, he doesn't seem masochist enough for a belligerent
straight roommate who keeps him locked out of the apartment and
cowering in the hall. A weak Marilyn Monroe imitation from the
roommate's girlfriend doesn't make the setting any more plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The film is more comfortable in the piano bar that is one stop
on the nighttime odyssey, along with a disco in TriBeCa. It is
while out on the town that Gabe meets the drag queen (Clinton
Leupp), who bears a faint resemblance to Ms. Spelling, and who
warns about Mark: ``Let's face it, Gabe. You're just another phone
number on a dirty cocktail napkin shoved into the bottom of his
pocket.'' But ``Trick'' isn't a movie in which anything so cruel
could be true.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It includes profanity, partial nudity and go-go
dancing in a G-string.

`ROSIE': ADOLESCENT ANGST GOES AWRY IN ANTWERP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(yn) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosie (Aranka Coppens) is an adolescent Belgian girl with a Mona
Lisa smile, something she badly needs for dealing with the volatile
adults in her life. Growing up in a gloomy, semi-industrial Antwerp
setting, she lives with a woman named Irene (Sara de Roo), who
becomes furious if Rosie tries to call her ``Mummy.'' She fends off
Irene's boyfriends, of whom there are apparently quite a few. And
as Patrice Toye's film soon makes clear, her closest relatives are
not any help to her. The film first finds Rosie in an institution
for delinquent girls, with the question ``Are you sorry you did
it?'' hanging ominously in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The film is structured so that the details of Rosie's
transgression are not revealed until its final moments. That tactic
adds suspense, and eventually chills, to what would otherwise be a
familiar tale of domestic dysfunction. Much of what Rosie does can
be seen as a search for identity in a family that won't allow her
one, as she tries out increasingly risky ways of making her
presence known. The film's all-too-appropriate subtitle is ``The
Devil in My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing letters from the institution to an indispensable
boyfriend named Jimi (Joost Wijnant), Rosie expresses her desire to
put the past behind her. Meanwhile, the film flashes backward in
fragmented style (Ms. Toye greatly admired the work of Krzysztof
Kieslowski) to the story of an oddly affectless teenager going
wrong (the filmmaker also counts ``Badlands'' as an influence).
</P>
<P>
   Rosie is drawn to any simulation of adult behavior that she can
manage, whether it's trying out makeup and a precociously brazen
manner or pretending to be a mother by appropriating a baby. She
shares most of these activities with Jimi, who becomes her willing
accomplice. Jimi is kind to Rosie, appreciates her wild streak and
seems remarkably libido-free for an adolescent boy. Rosie develops
her own ideas about romance from reading bodice-rippers (``the
czarina trembled under his gentle caresses'') and warily observing
the adult world.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie's life takes a dangerous turn when Irene, who is indeed
her real mother, invites Rosie's no-good uncle Michel (Frank
Vercruyssen) into the household and boots Rosie out of her bedroom
in the process. One look at Michel and Irene, and it's clear this
is no ordinary brother-sister relationship. Michel's presence is
the catalyst that finally undoes Rosie, though Ms. Toye succeeds in
making the film's climactic events somewhat unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coppens carries the film with a touching, credible
performance that captures girlish adolescence, with all its turmoil
and contradictions. It's a performance that can be fully understood
only after Rosie's little secret is wrenchingly revealed.
</P>

 &HT;    HARM FROM 'Y2K BUG' WILL BE WIDESPREAD, STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The computer software flaw known as the Y2K bug is
so widespread that every country, including the United States, will
almost certainly be harmed by it to some degree, with a few nations
even experiencing ``economic havoc,'' a top State Department
official told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assessments suggest that the global community is likely to
experience varying degrees of Y2K-related failures in every sector,
in every region and at every economic level,'' said Jacquelyn
Williams-Bridgers, the State Department's inspector general. The
impact will range from ``mere annoyance'' in some developed
countries to near catastrophe in unprepared ones, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In many Eastern bloc, Latin American, Asian and African
countries, ``there is a clear risk that electricity,
telecommunications and other key systems will fail, perhaps
creating economic havoc and social unrest,'' she said in testimony
to the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology
Problem.
</P>
<P>
   If Y2K-related disruptions are prolonged, they could interfere
with global trade, causing many U.S. companies to lose business
overseas and U.S. consumers to lose access to many foods, medicines
and other goods, Williams-Bridgers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug will cause some older computers to interpret dates
ending in ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. That simple
misunderstanding has the potential to shut down the computerized
systems that control power generators, telecommunications systems,
financial markets and more.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of Y2K preparations are consistent in their findings:
Wealthy countries, such as the United States, Canada and Britain,
have made significant progress in fixing the software flaws, but
poorer nations are far from being ready for Jan. 1. Among the least
prepared countries are six of the seven most populous: China,
India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many unprepared countries are important U.S.
trading partners, providing Americans with oil, sugar, fruit,
coffee and many pharmaceutical products. U.S. manufacturers often
depend on foreign factories for parts, while multinational
companies rely heavily on foreign consumers to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Bridgers said Y2K-related disruptions are likely to
interrupt this international flow of goods and services, adding
that ``a breakdown in any part of the supply chain would have a
serious impact on the U.S. and world economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that computer programmers are rapidly running out of time
to fix the Y2K bug, governments and businesses should be making
contingency plans, she said. For example, companies operating
overseas might want to stock up on parts or buy generators to keep
plants running.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about half of the 161 countries assessed by U.S.
officials were at medium to high risk of Y2K-related failures in
their telecommunications, energy or transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Also providing Y2K updates were executives from several large
U.S. corporations, including Ahold USA Inc., the Atlanta-based
company that owns several supermarket chains. Senior Vice President
Patrick Roberts said the great majority of food products in Ahold
stores come from domestic sources.
</P>
<P>
   Still, company officials are concerned about Y2K because they
depend on foreign sources for rice, coffee, sugar, spices,
pharmaceuticals and other products. ``Our strategy is to find
alternate product sources to minimize our dependence'' on
unprepared countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the focus of Thursday's hearing was on foreign
preparations for Y2K, the news was not entirely reassuring about
U.S. companies. Nearly one in 10 large multinational companies say
they will not have their computer systems ready for Y2K by Dec. 31,
according to a survey prepared by CIO Magazine, a publication aimed
at information officers.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, submitted to the Senate committee, found that 33
percent of the firms polled were behind schedule to fix Y2K
problems, and another 8 percent said they won't finish in time to
avoid problems. The poll, conducted via e-mail, was based on the
answers of 892 respondents.

`A CORNER OF THE VEIL': PROOF OF GOD IN A SMALL BROWN ENVELOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD EDER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the members of the Casuist religious order in France, a
hastily scrawled brown envelope brings revolutionary upset. The
Casuists _ they are the Jesuits, of course, in Laurence Cosse's
metaphysical fable _ are known for their brainy logic. It is
appropriate, therefore, that what the envelope contains is an idea,
one with a disruptive power equivalent to what you would get by
blending anthrax bacillus with powdered Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, the fable tells us, is an irrefutable, unparseable,
unconditional proof of the existence of God. Imparted to a retired
priest after a lifetime of failed cogitation and six weeks of
fasting and bare-kneed prayer, it would render mankind incapable of
war, anger, cruelty, striving and greed. In short, an earthly
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of the Casuists' high-brow and controversial journal
falls on the floor in a mix of joy and fear when he opens the
envelope. A colleague who successively punctures cosmological,
teleological and ontological proofs of God to expound the
impossibility of using reason to reach Him, goes dancing through
the streets. Two eminent Casuist theologians, brought in from
Belgium and Switzerland to demonstrate the proof's flaws, burst
into tears and fall to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the head of the Casuist Order in France, Father Le
Dangeolet, enjoins secrecy and informs the order's superior-general
in Rome. The archbishop of Paris also panics. What need of the
Church when God is as apparent and incontrovertible as one and one
equals two?
</P>
<P>
   The danger, at least as sustained in Ms. Cosse's imagining, goes
well beyond the religious. When France's prime minister, having
forced Le Dangeolet to let him read the proof, billows rapturously
off to devote himself to rose cultivation and travel by bus, his
four principal aides take radical action to conceal the discovery.
What use is a justice minister without crime or lawsuits, or an
interior minister with no need of a police force, or a foreign
minister devoid of armed might to negotiate from, or a finance
minister in an economy of pastoral barter? Furthermore, as one
bureaucrat puts it, an absolute proof of God would disrupt France's
hard-won and still irritable civic balance in such matters:
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of proof of God's existence obliges respect for
unbelievers; but the absence of proof of the nonexistence of God
obliges respect for believers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a witty thought in a novel, unfortunately, that aspires to
a good deal more wit than it possesses. Both as philosophical game
and as playful fantasy, ``A Corner of the Veil'' is fast-food, a
quick-frozen  &UR; amuse-gueule &LR; . It was nominated for several literary
prizes, but in France even more than elsewhere literary nominations
are often easy, and an act of favor more than of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual dilemma posed in ``Veil'' is a flimsy
reflection of the tragic question in Dostoyevksy's Grand Inquisitor
scene and the tragicomic question in Shaw's ``St. Joan.'' Christ in
the former, a saint in the latter, appear and are rejected by the
ministers of religion. Humanity, they argue, is not ready or
capable of receiving them. In this case, though, it is not God but
the proof of God that perilously threatens the world with virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I am playing into a cliche, but it seems a caricature of
a French intellectual inclination to find reality in the reason for
a thing, more than in the thing itself.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the reader struggles from the start and all the way
through with a premise that nobody questions until near the end.
Whole civilizations have firmly believed in God over the
millenniums without becoming noticeably saintly, except here and
there and in short bursts. Furthermore, there have been a number of
proofs, successively accepted and disputed but failing, even when
accepted, to produce any particular millennial fervor. Why should a
new proof, however compelling, have a different effect? The point
is made by the Casuist superior-general who seems, at least on and
off, the only sensible one in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cosse tangles up the question of God's existence with the
problem of evil. They are related, of course: briefly, if God
exists, He must be either impotent or wicked to allow the pain and
wickedness that go on in the world. But to take away the ``if''
(i.e., God definitely exists) does not solve the problem. If
anything, it makes it worse, and this is another factor that
creates reader resistance as the author goes about portraying
characters dissolving ecstatically or putting up a panicked
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the ecstasy goes, Ms. Cosse hardly tries to make it
fictionally believable. Her Casuists go off like firecrackers when
she touches them with her match; we have seen no previous sign of
gunpowder being loaded. She is better at the panic.
</P>
<P>
   There is the elaborate play of egos among the cabinet members
who take over from the besotted prime minister. There is the
clerical maneuvering. The archbishop dismisses reports of the proof
until he is told that the Casuists have it, whereupon he springs to
action. Le Dangeolet plays a cautious middle game, keeping the
proof locked up but, in case he should be blamed for sitting upon a
miracle, calling in the theologians. A prudent bureaucrat, he
accepts their authentication as reason to argue for the proof to
his superior in Rome, while cautiously refusing to read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to keep a cool head and a free mind,'' he explains.
``The people who have read the proof are immediately possessed by
it. They no longer have the slightest objectivity. I've seen four
of our colleagues topple over, one after the other. We can't have
our whole Casuist province in France slipping into a way of life
that is positively Franciscan, and the  &UR; ecstatic &LR;  branch at that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the cause of all this, Ms. Cosse reveals it only at the
end. It would be unfair to disclose it, except to say that it is
not a proof of God but a description, and one related to a
tradition going back to the Manichaeans nearly 1,000 years ago. The
main problem, though, is not what it is but that Ms. Cosse has been
unable all along to make us really care.

`DON'T LOOK BEHIND YOU': FAMILY OF FOOLS RUNS FROM A DRUG KINGPIN 
</HEADLINE>

   Some days the witness protection program sounds like a good
idea. Walk out of your house with nothing but the clothes on your
back; leave behind the stress-filled job, the debts, the
complicated relationships (with the notable exception of those
within the immediate family), all those appointments, all those
calls to return. Someone hands you a plane ticket and new
identification, and you fly away to a new city, where a house, a
car and a whole new life await.
</P>
<P>
   On most days, though, going into the program _ leaving behind
everything and almost everyone you love _ sounds like the nightmare
that it must be. That's how it strikes the all-American Corrigans
of Seattle in ``Don't Look Behind You,'' a two-hour film Sunday at
8 on the Fox Family Channel. Unfortunately, this potentially
interesting but ultimately wimpy movie could easily be retitled
``America's Stupidest Family.''
</P>
<P>
   How dumb are they? Well, Jeff Corrigan (Patrick Duffy, looking
rumpled and as if he just woke up throughout the film), who has
been secretly working with the F.B.I. for a year to investigate his
drug-smuggling boss, lets his wife, Liz (Pam Dawber), believe that
the attractive, young blond agent he's working with is his
girlfriend, so she won't suspect the truth. Liz reacts as you might
expect, and by the time the investigation comes to a head the
couple are living apart.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the boss discovers Jeff wearing a wire, things move
fast. The Corrigans are hustled out of their homes (one way to
force a marital reconciliation) and into a heavily guarded hotel
suite. ``What do you mean I can't go to the prom?'' cries April
(Tanja Reichert), the teenage daughter, in an understandable
reaction. The prom is the next evening, and she already has her
dress and a cute, attentive boyfriend, Stefan (Ryan Northcott).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of April's reactions are understandable because
she's barely out of childhood. When she's told that the situation
is not temporary, that she can never see or speak to Stefan again,
she becomes hysterical. (Meanwhile, her little brother seems to be
OK with the transition. Apparently, as long as they have video
games and computers wherever they're going, he'll be fine.) April
leaves Stefan a note in her bedroom, letting him know where they're
staying, including the room number at the hotel. He immediately
calls her from her bedroom telephone, which, of course, is tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Richmond, the family's new location, April cuts and
dyes her hair, as instructed, but she happens to be a budding
tennis champion and just can't resist showing off her skills on the
court. That puts the whole family one step closer to being
discovered. But she makes a good point when she confronts her
mother, who has criticized April's lack of enthusiasm for the move,
saying: ``Let me take away the one thing you're good at and the one
person you love. Then you can lecture me.''
</P>
<P>
   What's less forgivable is the behavior of Liz, who is an adult.
She starts sending e-mail to her old office! Does she think drug
smuggling rings don't have computer experts? Eventually there's a
showdown in the Baltimore Public Library and a gun battle back in
Seattle. There are, in fact, several shootouts in the movie, some
of the dullest ever filmed.

ANTIQUES: PREDICTING A DEFINING MOMENT IN COLONIAL NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The newspaper accounts of the time would not have been so
different from the kind we read today.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night raid in late February. The attackers came
silently through the snowy meadows. The village watchman had fallen
asleep. The enemies penetrated the palisades and were already in
before anyone discovered them. They broke open doors and windows
with hatchets, killing 48 of the 300 residents. In the melee,
nearly half of the people escaped; 111 others were taken hostage,
mostly women and children. When dawn broke, the attackers set the
houses and barns on fire and slaughtered the livestock. The
captives were forced to march north in the snow, leaving with only
the clothes on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo? No, Deerfield, Mass., on Feb. 29, 1704.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Deerfield village was two miles west of the
Connecticut River and 20 miles south of what is now the Vermont
border; it was the northernmost settlement on the British frontier.
The massacre followed a surprise ambush by French colonists and
American Indians on the British settlers.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the French and the English in Europe were fighting
Queen Anne's War. The attack on Deerfield was a brutal example of
how that conflict affected the colonies. The French did not want
the English to settle northern New England; moving south from
Quebec, they planned to occupy it themselves. A French company of
48 men teamed up with 200 Indians to mount the attack. After the
raid, they marched their Deerfield captives to a French fort in
Canada, and they were ransomed to the British.
</P>
<P>
   All of this history is known.
</P>
<P>
   But some unknown details surfaced at the auction Printed Books
and Manuscripts at Christie's in New York on June 9. Lot 182 was a
letter dated Aug. 10, 1703, that anticipated the massacre by six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was bought for $7,475 by Historic Deerfield, a
museum of early American history at the colonial site, was written
in haste by Col. Samuel Partridge to Connecticut Gov. John
Winthrop. Partridge was the military commander of the Connecticut
Valley, and wrote that he had learned that a company of some 300
Indians and French soldiers had left Quebec ``in order to come upon
New England.'' He had not seen the enemy, he wrote, but feared the
worst, ``there being Usually Litl or no tyme betwixt the discovery
of the Enemy &AMP; their striking their blow.''
</P>
<P>
   He requested 50 or 60 dragoons to protect the settlements,
explaining that people were living in ``dayly &AMP; hourely fear of the
Enemys approach especially at Derefd.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Friary, the executive director of Historic Deerfield,
said the letter was ``certainly one of the most important documents
in the history of Deerfield and of early New England.'' He
explained, ``The French and Indian attack is the pivotal event in
Deerfield's history, the one that put the infant settlement
securely on the historical map of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``We now know that six months before the great
attack the valley settlements were on the alert that something
dreadful was going to happen, and that the Indians were strategic
enough to wait. It's easier to move over snow when the rivers are
frozen. The natives were shrewd. They came through the meadows in
spurts, so their movements sounded like wind. They climbed
snowbanks to get over the stockade walls and were inside before
anyone knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Melvoin, the author of ``New England Outpost: War and
Society in Colonial Deerfield,'' said: ``The letter is not the only
evidence of trouble coming, but it's a valuable confirmation of
what's to come. In fact, the massacre was not a complete shock.
There were a series of attacks going on all over the frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   John Demos, a professor of American history at Yale University,
said: ``Normally Indian attacks didn't come in midwinter. The
letter reaffirms that it was an enormously scary time for people in
outposts like Deerfield.'' Demos is the author of ``The Unredeemed
Captive'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1994), a story that was nominated for a
National Book Award. It is based on the life of Eunice Williams, a
7-year-old Deerfield girl who was taken hostage, survived the trek
to Canada and chose to remain with the Mohawks _ one of three
attacking Indian nations _ rather than rejoin the British. (The
other nations were Hurons and Abenakis, said Suzanne Flynt, the
granddaughter of the founders of Historic Deerfield and an expert
on local tribes who is the curator of Deerfield's Memorial Hall
Museum.)
</P>
<P>
   The real Eunice Williams lived until 1785 as a Mohawk; indeed,
she forgot her English and dressed as an Indian. On the night of
the massacre, flames from the burning village were spotted by
Partridge, Friary said. He and his troops rushed to the rescue,
arriving in Deerfield at dawn. But he was too late. That day he
wrote ``An Account of the Destruction of Deerfield,'' listing
people killed on site and those who escaped or were captured. He
inventoried the lost property. Nearly everything was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Deerfield was soon resettled. Eunice's father,
Deerfield's minister, the Rev. John Williams, survived the attack
and snowshoe march to Canada, though his wife, who had recently
given birth, did not. In 1706, he was ransomed. In 1707, he was
persuaded to return to Deerfield after being promised a huge new
house. The Indians' side of the story is less documented, but a new
book, ``North American Indian Jewelry and Adornment'' (Harry N.
Abrams, $75), by Lois Sherr Dubin, describes how they might have
looked. In the book, Ms. Dubin explains the sacredness of shell
bits in wampum belts, the efficacy of carved necklace amulets and
the use of seeds and berries for beads.
</P>
<P>
   Her book neatly dovetails with written accounts in Deerfield's
Memorial Hall Museum. In 1724, the Rev. Joseph Lafitau, a Jesuit
priest at a mission in Canada, wrote, ``Young Iroquois men cut
their hair on one side about an inch and let the other side grow
full-length, grease and comb it, arranging the long hair into two
or three topknots and braids.'' He continued: ``Ears are pierced in
three places and decorated with beads hung from long ribbons. Paint
covers face, hair and exposed body.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not describe the war paint, but in his account of the
attack, Reverend Williams recalled waking up as 20 screaming
Indians were kicking in his door ``with painted faces and hideous
acclamations and I asked God for mercy, expecting to die.'' But he
survived, and Deerfield soon prospered. The town is a repository of
great Connecticut River Valley antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Friary said Historic Deerfield will display the new letter this
fall at the Flynt Center of Early New England Life in Deerfield.
The letter will also be part of an exhibition in 2004 commemorating
the 300th anniversary of the attack.

SPOTLIGHTING A NEW ALBUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   VARIOUS ARTISTS ``Onda Sonora: Red Hot &AMP; Lisbon'' (Bar/None)
</P>
<P>
   The idea of world music _ a utopian vision of different cultures
swimming in the same direction in the name of entertainment _ has
hardly ever been better served than on ``Onda Sonora,'' a record
made by various voices from around the Portuguese-speaking diaspora
and masterminded by the producers Beco Dranoff and Andres Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Studio-constructed in Lisbon, Bahia, Rio and New York, and
sometimes combining bits of what was gathered in different cities,
it's a strikingly intelligent record, using some cultural
connections that were already there and inventing others;
tape-edited collages are salted in as interludes.
</P>
<P>
   A few tracks are throwaway delights, a few are solid
contributions by bands that most Americans will know nothing about,
and a few such fortuitous bolts from the blue that much larger
projects could be spun off from them. And a major thread throughout
is Levin's production style, which gives a sharp, electronic-age
bite to music as varied in age and style as African-Brazilian
drumming and Mozambiquan rapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dukeles,'' a track bringing together the Spanish gypsy group
Ketama, the Brazilian pop star Djavan and the all-female carnival
drum corps from Bahia, Banda Feminina Dida, is a typical of the
record: it uses thundering Bahian street drums to fill in the
background spaces of flamenco-guitar music.
</P>
<P>
   On other tracks, K.D. Lang sings a Portuguese fado, with a
startling reverence; David Byrne and Caetano Veloso sing alternate
verses of a lovely pop song written by both of them; the group
Ekvat, from Goa, India, sing a folk song that sounds almost like an
old cowboy tune, with an acoustic guitar and three close-harmony
singers.
</P>
<P>
   Like all projects emanating from the Red Hot Organization, the
proceeds of the record finance AIDS prevention and relief.

TV WEEKEND SPOTLIGHT: BOOTLEGGING, MURDER AND OTHER FAMILY VALUES 
</HEADLINE>

 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Here's an offer you can refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is asking you to spend more than five hours, over two
evenings, meandering through the life of Joseph Bonanno: loyal
countryman, faithful family man, levelheaded businessman. And one
tough Mafioso, man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' which begins on Sunday night,
is a curious film. Always respectful, never hurrying, hardly ever
igniting even a spark of dramatic tension, it comes across as a
sterile paean to a vanished tradition that just happened to include
a bit of technically illegal behavior, including murder (but only
when it's (italics)really(end italics) necessary).
</P>
<P>
   Tradition, tradition. ``I've always believed,'' the Joe Bonanno
character says in the ponderous narration, ``that tradition teaches
us what is right and what is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What is this, ``Fiddler on the Roof of La Cosa Nostra''?
</P>
<P>
   No. It bills itself as a rare inside look at organized crime,
based on memoirs by Bonanno, now 94, and his son Bill, 66, who is
listed as executive producer. So you're not expecting objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonannos, both of whom have been imprisoned for their
activities, are entitled to tell their story if someone chooses to
listen. And a television film, even one about real people, need not
be a history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   But you are expecting interesting, three-dimensional characters:
heroes, antiheroes, villains; somebody not made of stone and
platitudes. On this score the film seriously misfires.
</P>
<P>
   The project's heroes are not the somber mobsters but the
production designer, Guy Lalande; the costume designer, Mario
D'Avignon; the cinematographer, Serge Ladouceur, and their
colleagues. They have packed the hours with visual details that
speak of the passage of dark-blue nights and bright-yellow days.
</P>
<P>
   The characters hardly seem to change from year to year, but
memories are stirred by their clothes and shoes, their cars and
furniture, the streets through which they move.
</P>
<P>
   The story itself, as rendered in a script by Thomas Michael
Donnelly, may hold a few surprises. You may not have known that the
mob assured Franklin D. Roosevelt's election, was instrumental in
winning World War II, handed John F. Kennedy the Democratic
presidential nomination (after ordering him to choose Lyndon B.
Johnson as his running mate) then soured on Kennedy and killed him
in Dallas. Then again, maybe you knew all that.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, most of the story is predictable. It unfolds as one
long ((italics)very(end italics) long) flashback, the memories of
the old Joe Bonanno (Martin Landau) as he pads around his native
village, Castellammare, Sicily. ``It was my fate to be born in
turbulent times,'' he narrates. From here, it's back to his birth,
followed quickly by the death of his noble father.
</P>
<P>
   Gallant young Joe (Bruce Ramsay) is smuggled into the United
States. (``New York was an exciting and complicated world in
1924.'') After failing as a barber, he decides to try another
occupation, bootlegging. ``Although it was illegal, I didn't
consider it to be wrong.'' Right. And while Joe is seen driving a
``milk'' truck full of booze and paying off the police, you are
told, ``My whole history had prepared me to be a man of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the second night, gallant middle-aged Joe (Tony Nardi) is a
family man living on Long Island and later in Arizona. But even
though his gallant son Bill (Zachary Bennett) has entered the
family enterprise, Joe is growing weary of the changes in the mob
and in society that make it impossible for him to conduct his
business with honor and all that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Michel Poulette, most of the actors seem
to be doing what they can with what they've been given. In
supporting roles Edward James Olmos and Philip Bosco manage to rise
refreshingly above the proceedings, but Patti LuPone and Robert
Loggia, in cameos, seem to be doing broad impersonations of
themselves. Maybe it was a coping mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Who gets the blame here? Will someone finger the Bonannos? No
prosecutor will go after them for operating a mini-series without a
dramatic license. But no viewer will be satisfied with a
presentation in which the only memorable moments are the killings,
with their slow-motion gun bursts followed by oozing red pools.
</P>
<P>
   This is a film with buckets of blood but no heart.

(Judith Dunford, a writer and critic, is working on her second
novel.) 
 By JUDITH DUNFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a beautiful sunny day this June, just a shade over
a year after the writer and critic Alfred Kazin died, his ashes
were consigned to the East River in the shadow of the Brooklyn
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A very few of us were present at the northern end of the South
Street Seaport: Alfred's son, Michael, and his family; one beloved
Kazin friend, and me, Alfred's widow. A year had passed, somehow.
It was about the time that observant Jews would have unveiled a
headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred was not an observant Jew and always insisted that ``a
dead body is of no interest.'' He wanted to be cremated, and
checked with me regularly to make sure this responsibility hadn't
somehow slipped my mind. When the time came I remembered, and I
kept my promise.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything connected to living with Alfred, dealing with
what I discovered were called ``cremains'' by death professionals
came packaged with comic relief (starting with the word
``cremains'').
</P>
<P>
   About a week after his death at age 83 on June 5, 1998, I got a
notice of registered mail waiting for me at the post office. When
the clerk pushed at me a cardboard box about the size and shape of
a package for a replacement vacuum cleaner part, I was astonished
to see that it came from the crematorium. Alfred would have been
delighted; if anything ever expressed a lack of interest in a dead
body, that cardboard box was it.
</P>
<P>
   For a year it reposed in our linen closet, wrapped _
appropriately, I thought _ in a blue recycling bag. It was oddly
comforting to have the box there. From time to time I would fling
the closet door open and admit (to the box): ``Alfred, you were
right and I was wrong.'' This too would have delighted him, as he
rarely heard anything like that from me in life.
</P>
<P>
   Getting his ashes from home (the Upper West Side) to the water's
edge (the Lower East Side) required that I pick out a suitable
carrier for the box. I looked through my tote bags. Eileen Fisher
was too frivolous, The New York Times too mundane. I finally
settled on Harvard University Press _ it had published one of
Alfred's late masterpieces, ``Writing Was Everything,'' so that bag
seemed to have the right seriousness and decorum.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the place was easy. Alfred loved the bridge. He wrote
about it, lectured on it, even appeared in a film about it. The
bridge had a vast aesthetic appeal for him: its towers like
cathedrals, its beautiful web of cables that inspired the poet Hart
Crane's rapturous ``O harp and altar, of the fury fused, (How could
mere toil align thy choiring strings!).''
</P>
<P>
   But even more than that, he felt the bridge was the needle that
had stitched him to America. Alfred was the first American-born
child of poor Jews from Russia who settled in Brownsville,
Brooklyn. When he came to write his growing-up memoir, ``A Walker
in the City,'' he would call his neighborhood the rawest, remotest,
cheapest ghetto, at the end of the line at the city's back door.
</P>
<P>
   The ``city'' (let alone ``America the Golden'') to his timid
parents, as to poor, bewildered, hard-working immigrants before and
since, always seemed to be in quotation marks, and always lay in
what Alfred called ``Beyond! Beyond!'' It was a land east of the
sun and west of the moon that, he discovered, could be reached by
crossing the Brooklyn Bridge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, summer by summer, ... when I stopped in the Brooklyn
Museum to look at the Ryders; or in front of the library at Fifth
and 42nd, waiting for the light to change, I laughed right out loud
because I had just sat my first exultant hour in those long
sun-filled reading rooms on the third floor; or floundered and
gawked my way past Cleopatra's Needle to the back door of the
Metropolitan, to take in, now, Winslow Homer's `The Gulf Stream'
and Thomas Eakins' portrait of Walt Whitman in a lace collar; ...
now, when I stopped to catch my breath under the shepherd's-crook
lamp pole in Brooklyn, the streets themselves reeled for joy, and
whenever I humbly retired into the subway for the long ride home,
something would automatically pull me out at Brooklyn Bridge for
one last good walk across the promenade before I fell into the
subway again.''
</P>
<P>
   His feeling for the bridge quickly extended to its builders, the
two Roeblings, father and son, geniuses and visionaries, themselves
immigrants or children of immigrants, manufacturers of braided
cable that embodied the 19th-century German philosophy that Alfred
had studied at City College. He was fascinated by their history
with its mythic streak that could have been pulled from the great
Norse fables: mighty deeds and the gods' revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As Alfred loved to recount, the senior Roebling, John Augustus,
was killed in a freak accident long before his bridge was finished.
It was as if the river wanted revenge for being mastered: a ferry
crashed into the pier where Roebling was standing, crushing his
foot. The toes were amputated, but Roebling died of tetanus, and
the work passed to his 33-year-old son, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Then another catastrophe: after working in one of the bridge's
caissons below the river, young Roebling got the bends. Disabled
for life but refusing to give up, he directed construction from a
window in Brooklyn Heights by shouting orders to his wife below.
</P>
<P>
   Although ashes are always said to be scattered, we, the
mourners, never actually scattered a thing. We had a little
memorial ceremony. First we took turns reading from the dazzling
Brooklyn Bridge portion of ``A Walker in the City'':
</P>
<P>
   ``A painter's scaffold dangled down one side of the tower over a
spattered canvas. Never again would I walk Brooklyn Bridge without
smelling the paint on that canvas. The trolley car clanged,
clanged, clanged taking me home that day from the bridge. Papa,
where are they taking me? Where in this beyond are they taking
me?''
</P>
<P>
   As the widow, I read Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead.
Then, finally, we heaved the unopened little box _ it suddenly
seemed very small _ over the railing to melt into the river. All
our eyes were fixed on it as it bobbed on the river's wavelets and
the wakes of passing boats, heading north on the tide.
</P>
<P>
   The sun danced on the water; it was as though Alfred were going
out in showers of brilliants. Every moment made it harder to see,
lower in the water. But shading our eyes, we watched it struggle
its way to a spot directly under the bridge and halfway from each
shore, Brownsville on the right, ``Beyond'' on the left. Then it
went down. Just where he wanted to be. The year was over.
</P>
<P>
   But wait! There's a postscript. For the last many years of his
life, Alfred fretted over the dissertation of his last and all-time
favorite graduate student, Marybeth, on Willa Cather. Life kept
intruding on the process, slowing it down to a crawl, and Alfred (a
world-class, black-belt worrier) was convinced Marybeth would never
finish.
</P>
<P>
   She had a baby, she had a job, she moved _ it stretched on and
on. Finally, about a month ago, Marybeth called me: she had
finished it, defended it. She was a Ph.D. fair and square, and was
sending me a copy of the precious document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marybeth,'' I said, ``this may sound weird, but would you also
burn a copy and send me the ashes? On the off chance that Alfred is
still fretting in Eternity, I want to ease his mind.'' So she did,
and the ashes of her dissertation on Willa Cather followed Alfred's
into the river.
</P>
<P>
   And say ye, amen.

SHORT NEWS ITEMS ON THE ART WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Often when a museum closes for renovations,
highlights from its collection go on view elsewhere around the
world. While the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam was undergoing an
architectural face lift last year, for example, highlights from its
collection traveled to the National Gallery of Art in Washington
and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   When the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon closes for six
months of renovations on Oct. 2, works from its collection will go
on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, from Nov. 16 through
Feb. 27. The exhibition, ``Only the Best: Masterpieces of the
Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Lisbon,'' will include about 80 items
from the institution's 5,000-piece collection.
</P>
<P>
   The museum was named after a self-made Armenian oil millionaire
who died in 1955. Gulbenkian bequeathed his estate, which included
his vast collection of fine and decorative arts, to a foundation,
which built and runs the 30-year-old museum.
</P>
<P>
   He was an extraordinary collector with a taste for only the
rarest, most outstanding examples of every collecting category,
from ancient Greek art to illuminated manuscripts to Impressionist
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   James David Draper, a curator of European sculpture and
decorative arts at the Metropolitan, helped organize the show with
the Lisbon museum. ``Gulbenkian was such a discerning and demanding
collector that everything has great punch and merit,'' Draper said.
</P>
<P>
   The show will chronicle Gulbenkian's collecting, beginning with
several Egyptian sculptures, like the bronze ``Torso of King
Petoubastis'' from the 23d Dynasty. There will also be textiles
from many periods and cultures, along with Islamic art, Chinese
ceramics and 18th-century French furniture and silver.
</P>
<P>
   Gulbenkian's collection of paintings will be highlighted, too,
including works by Guardi, Rubens, Fragonard, Manet, Monet and
Degas. The final section of the show will be devoted to jewelry by
Rene Lalique, including gold, diamond and enamel pieces. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whitney on Tour &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum of American Art is looking for ways to put
part of its permanent collection to good use. Even with the
museum's most recent expansion, which created about 8,000 square
feet of gallery space for its holdings, only about 10 percent of
its collection can be exhibited at once.
</P>
<P>
   What about the rest? The museum announced this week that it was
beginning a touring exhibitions program, in which shows organized
by the Whitney from its permanent collection will travel to museums
in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fall I told the board I wanted the Whitney to break out
of its insularity, that we should think about having a national and
international reach,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, the director of
the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the museum would assemble focused exhibitions that
small and medium-sized museums could afford. Shows are to cost in
the tens of thousands of dollars, he said, adding that it would be
unusual if a loan fee reached six figures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 the Whitney joined with the San Jose Museum of Art in
California to provide the smaller museum with four exhibitions,
each lasting 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Jose was a specific agreement with one museum on a
long-term basis,'' Anderson said. ``Here we are working with a
variety of institutions and the program is more open and free.''
</P>
<P>
   Making money, Anderson said, is not the museum's primary motive.
In fact, the Whitney is investing about $250,000 a year in
organizational costs, art handling, staffing and salaries. Money
made from the touring exhibitions will go back into the program and
into the museum's operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   A staff dedicated to these shows will be led by Beth Venn, a
curator and director of the branch museums, and Shamim Momim, an
assistant curator at the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   One exhibition already in the works is ``Pop Impact: From Johns
to Warhol,'' with works by artists like Rauschenberg, Rosenquist,
Oldenburg, Johns and Warhol. It will open on Sept. 9 at the
Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art. Some other exhibitions,
which have not been placed in museums yet, are ``Collage in
America,'' a survey of the collage form, and ``Correspondences:
Isamu Noguchi and Ellsworth Kelly,'' which will examine the shared
esthetics of the artists.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was so excited about heralding the new venture that
earlier this week he described it in detail through an e-mail that
he sent to members of the Association of Art Museum Directors. The
``program has been met with much enthusiasm by Philip Morris and
they are prepared to fund its tour, pending the identification of
appropriate venues,'' Anderson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This presents us with a unique opportunity to make the show
available at a very reasonable cost,'' he continued, referring to
the ``Pop Impact'' exhibition. ``We do, however, need to have
commitments very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Goodale, manager of cultural programs at Philip Morris,
said, ``We have shown enthusiasm about the program and have had
discussions with Max about it, but we wouldn't like to make a
commitment until we have details.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Interview &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A two-year search for a new director at the Detroit Institute of
Arts may be ending. Graham W.J. Beal, who has been director of the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art for three years, is the leading
candidate. If he gets the job, he would replace Samuel Sachs II,
who became director of the Frick Collection two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Manoogian, president of the institute's board, confirmed
that Beal is being considered and that he was meeting with the
search committee, the museum's board and its staff this week. ``I
can't comment further,'' Manoogian said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles and Detroit institutions are government-run and
have faced financial difficulties because of their reliance on
public support.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea L. Rich, president of the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, said that if Beal went to Detroit, her museum would not rush
to form a search committee. ``We're in great shape and we have a
strong curatorial schedule,'' she said. ``We'll look inside the
museum first and get a lot of input from our curators.''

   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the scent of blood in the water, the media swarmed the
crash site of John F. Kennedy Jr. While pedestrian reporters
investigated the disaster, pundits debated the more entertaining
question: Why does this keep happening to the Kennedys?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the whole family is ``reckless.'' Others argue that the
Kennedys are admirably bold and that it's unseemly to criticize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Each camp oversimplifies the truth. There are two Kennedy
traditions: courage, gravity and martyrdom on one side;
recklessness, frivolity and mayhem on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The ``recklessness'' spin, fueled by talk radio and the
Internet, says the Kennedys seek ``adventure,'' ``live close to the
edge,'' are ``wild'' and ``addicted to risk,'' and have a
``dangerous streak.''
</P>
<P>
   This spin laughably equates all dangerous behavior. ``Taking
physical risks is a Kennedy family tradition,'' says Newsweek.
``During World War II, the oldest son, Joe Jr., ... died on a
virtual suicide mission. ... Jack Kennedy chose PT boats, rickety
crafts whose crews boasted that 'they were expendable.' Bobby
Kennedy's children always seemed to be falling out of trees.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that young John Kennedy was reckless, these spinners
paste together weak bits of evidence. As a boy, he used to evade
his Secret Service agents. He once took a survival course. Another
time, he went to Africa and was charged by a rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned through all these experiences to make light of
danger,'' asserts Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he enjoyed rock climbing, paragliding, scuba diving,
kayaking and Rollerblading. He asked permission to rappel down
Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a magazine--demonstrating, according to Reuters,
that ``like other members of his legendary family, Kennedy had a
taste for danger and took risks.'' He invited Larry Flynt to a
black-tie dinner. He even lived ``in an edgy warehouse district.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``courage'' spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of
nobility on the family's escapades. As questions about recklessness
bounced around the Sunday talk shows, Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley
argued that ``John Jr. and the Kennedy family [are] 'in the arena,'
and they're living a vigorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bold,'' agreed Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ``They have
always had courage. They've always wanted to live to the fullest.''
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen admonished critics, ``It is
an active family, an achieving family, and so its members have
taken some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times boasted that ``the Kennedys have always been
risk-takers, in play, politics and war. At its best, there is a
certain nobility to the Kennedys' refusal to let life intimidate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the family's risk-taking has been ``bold'' or
``wild.'' Some Kennedys have been far more reckless than others.
Was John Kennedy's death reckless? Let's consider the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who caused the tragedy? Most of the coverage depicts John as
the victim of a family ``curse.'' The Kennedys are ``stalked by
tragedy,'' suffering ``bad luck'' or a ``near-biblical blight''
that has been inflicted, according to Mario Cuomo, by ``gods.'' Not
only were Jack and Bobby assassinated, but ``the younger generation
of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well,'' says the
Post--''as if fate were picking them off,'' laments Time.
</P>
<P>
   This passive language obscures an important distinction. Whereas
Jack and Bobby were murdered, the ``younger generation,'' far from
being ``haunted'' or ``picked off,'' caused its own grief. Joe
overturned a jeep, leaving his brother's girlfriend paralyzed.
Bobby Jr. introduced mescaline to his 13-year-old brother David,
who eventually died of a drug overdose. Michael slept with his
kids' teen-age baby sitter and later skied into a tree. William
Kennedy Smith, their cousin, went out on the town with Uncle Teddy,
brought home a woman, and ended up being tried unsuccessfully for
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these traditions does John Kennedy belong to? The Times
argued that like Jack and Bobby, John was ``cut down far too
early.'' Again, passive language distorts the facts. John was at
the controls when his vehicle crashed--just like Cousin Joe and
Uncle Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who's the victim? On ``Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert played
the 30-year-old video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to
the nation why, having driven his car off a bridge after a party on
Chappaquiddick Island--and having swum to safety while his young
campaign aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned in the car--he had failed
to report the accident to police. In the clip, Kennedy raised the
question ``whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the
Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt
what had happened and to delay my report.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert offered the clip as an omen of the ``curse'' that would
strike John Kennedy 30 years later. Russert's guest, columnist Mike
Barnicle, heaped praise and sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having
``borne so many'' family tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pointed out that at Chappaquiddick, unlike Dallas and Los
Angeles, the person most responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy,
whereas the victim was not--and that Ted Kennedy's invocation of
the family ``curse'' was a clever way of papering over these
differences. Thanks to this blurring of the victim-perpetrator
distinction, Ted's nephew Joe was able to get elected to Congress
despite his own car accident, which likewise devastated his
passenger, four years after Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John Kennedy belong to? Most pundits,
recalling Jack's and Bobby's assassinations, have cast his family
as the ultimate victim of his crash. ``Stop blaming John. It is
enough that tragedy once again punished the Kennedys,'' wrote
Cohen. But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessette family,
whose daughters were passengers on John's plane. The Chappaquiddick
analogies can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. For what purpose was the risk taken? To illustrate the
Kennedys' penchant for ``adventure,'' ``recklessness'' and
``disaster,'' the Post compares John's crash to the death of Joe
Kennedy Jr., in a World War II bombing mission and to Michael
Kennedy's fatal ``crash'' into a tree while playing football on
skis.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Jonathan Alter likens John's flying to his father's
piloting of a PT boat in the war: ``They both grabbed life by the
lapels.'' These comparisons obscure the difference between risking
one's life in war, as Jack and Joe did, and risking it playing
football.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John belong to? He was flying to a
wedding--a more commendable pursuit than the one that killed
Michael, but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe.
</P>
<P>
   4. What precautions were taken? Critics point out that John
Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot, took off after sunset, wasn't
licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday, flew
the more dangerous route over water, and never contacted air
traffic controllers for assistance. His defenders point out that he
was trained at a top-flight facility and usually brought along a
flight instructor but that Friday's weather reports offered no
warning of poor visibility. Barnicle, like Cohen, argued that to
accuse Kennedy of ``poor judgment is way out of bounds,'' because
``he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident.''
</P>
<P>
   By enumerating Kennedy's usual precautions, his defenders show
that he was more careful than many of his cousins. But against that
background--and comments from other pilots who say they decided the
weather was too dangerous for flying--his decisions last Friday
appear all the more unwise. John Kennedy would be alive today if he
had taken his usual precautions--and certainly if he had taken a
train instead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was the protagonist morally reckless? Recklessness theorists
associate John Kennedy's ``lack of judgment'' with his cousins'
debauchery. According to the Post, the family's ``fearless
adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal: for example, the
drug problems of Robert Jr., Patrick and David ... or Michael's
notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Time says of John, ``If he was less reckless than his cousins,
it was not saying much; there were friends who turned down the
invitation to take to the skies with him.'' The magazine quotes one
family member who said, ``The Kennedy story is really about karma,
about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This critique confuses different dimensions of ``judgment'' and
``breaking the rules.'' To err in assessing the weather is human;
to sleep with the baby sitter is depraved. John Kennedy knew the
difference: In 1997, he observed in George that his cousin Michael
had ``surrendered his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek--which casually
associated John's ``succession of stunning girlfriends'' as a
bachelor with his father's ``sexual snacking'' as a married
man--show far worse judgment than John ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders, however, gloss over the
same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with
Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of ``another Kennedy'' instead of
``assessing judgment.'' Judgment is precisely what should be
assessed. John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday. The
risk was unnecessary, and two people who entrusted him with their
lives are dead because he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a
pattern of decadence. John Kennedy's death was far less noble than
the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family--and far less
blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst.

<P>
   4. What precautions were taken? Critics point out that John
Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot, took off after sunset, wasn't
licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday, flew
the more dangerous route over water, and never contacted air
traffic controllers for assistance. His defenders point out that he
was trained at a top-flight facility and usually brought along a
flight instructor but that Friday's weather reports offered no
warning of poor visibility. Barnicle, like Cohen, argued that to
accuse Kennedy of ``poor judgment is way out of bounds,'' because
``he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident.''
</P>
<P>
   By enumerating Kennedy's usual precautions, his defenders show
that he was more careful than many of his cousins. But against that
background--and comments from other pilots who say they decided the
weather was too dangerous for flying--his decisions last Friday
appear all the more unwise. John Kennedy would be alive today if he
had taken his usual precautions--and certainly if he had taken a
train instead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was the protagonist morally reckless? Recklessness theorists
associate John Kennedy's ``lack of judgment'' with his cousins'
debauchery. According to the Post, the family's ``fearless
adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal: for example, the
drug problems of Robert Jr., Patrick and David ... or Michael's
notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Time says of John, ``If he was less reckless than his cousins,
it was not saying much; there were friends who turned down the
invitation to take to the skies with him.'' The magazine quotes one
family member who said, ``The Kennedy story is really about karma,
about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This critique confuses different dimensions of ``judgment'' and
``breaking the rules.'' To err in assessing the weather is human;
to sleep with the baby sitter is depraved. John Kennedy knew the
difference: In 1997, he observed in George that his cousin Michael
had ``surrendered his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek--which casually
associated John's ``succession of stunning girlfriends'' as a
bachelor with his father's ``sexual snacking'' as a married
man--show far worse judgment than John ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders, however, gloss over the
same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with
Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of ``another Kennedy'' instead of
``assessing judgment.'' Judgment is precisely what should be
assessed. John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday. The
risk was unnecessary, and two people who entrusted him with their
lives are dead because he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a
pattern of decadence. John Kennedy's death was far less noble than
the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family--and far less
blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst.

   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the scent of blood in the water, the media swarmed the
crash site of John F. Kennedy Jr. While pedestrian reporters
investigated the disaster, pundits debated the more entertaining
question: Why does this keep happening to the Kennedys?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the whole family is ``reckless.'' Others argue that the
Kennedys are admirably bold and that it's unseemly to criticize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Each camp oversimplifies the truth. There are two Kennedy
traditions: courage, gravity and martyrdom on one side;
recklessness, frivolity and mayhem on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The ``recklessness'' spin, fueled by talk radio and the
Internet, says the Kennedys seek ``adventure,'' ``live close to the
edge,'' are ``wild'' and ``addicted to risk,'' and have a
``dangerous streak.''
</P>
<P>
   This spin laughably equates all dangerous behavior. ``Taking
physical risks is a Kennedy family tradition,'' says Newsweek.
``During World War II, the oldest son, Joe Jr., ... died on a
virtual suicide mission. ... Jack Kennedy chose PT boats, rickety
crafts whose crews boasted that 'they were expendable.' Bobby
Kennedy's children always seemed to be falling out of trees.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that young John Kennedy was reckless, these spinners
paste together weak bits of evidence. As a boy, he used to evade
his Secret Service agents. He once took a survival course. Another
time, he went to Africa and was charged by a rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned through all these experiences to make light of
danger,'' asserts Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he enjoyed rock climbing, paragliding, scuba diving,
kayaking and Rollerblading. He asked permission to rappel down
Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a magazine--demonstrating, according to Reuters,
that ``like other members of his legendary family, Kennedy had a
taste for danger and took risks.'' He invited Larry Flynt to a
black-tie dinner. He even lived ``in an edgy warehouse district.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``courage'' spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of
nobility on the family's escapades. As questions about recklessness
bounced around the Sunday talk shows, Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley
argued that ``John Jr. and the Kennedy family [are] 'in the arena,'
and they're living a vigorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bold,'' agreed Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ``They have
always had courage. They've always wanted to live to the fullest.''
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen admonished critics, ``It is
an active family, an achieving family, and so its members have
taken some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times boasted that ``the Kennedys have always been
risk-takers, in play, politics and war. At its best, there is a
certain nobility to the Kennedys' refusal to let life intimidate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the family's risk-taking has been ``bold'' or
``wild.'' Some Kennedys have been far more reckless than others.
Was John Kennedy's death reckless? Let's consider the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who caused the tragedy? Most of the coverage depicts John as
the victim of a family ``curse.'' The Kennedys are ``stalked by
tragedy,'' suffering ``bad luck'' or a ``near-biblical blight''
that has been inflicted, according to Mario Cuomo, by ``gods.'' Not
only were Jack and Bobby assassinated, but ``the younger generation
of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well,'' says the
Post--''as if fate were picking them off,'' laments Time.
</P>
<P>
   This passive language obscures an important distinction. Whereas
Jack and Bobby were murdered, the ``younger generation,'' far from
being ``haunted'' or ``picked off,'' caused its own grief. Joe
overturned a jeep, leaving his brother's girlfriend paralyzed.
Bobby Jr. introduced mescaline to his 13-year-old brother David,
who eventually died of a drug overdose. Michael slept with his
kids' teen-age baby sitter and later skied into a tree. William
Kennedy Smith, their cousin, went out on the town with Uncle Teddy,
brought home a woman, and ended up being tried unsuccessfully for
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these traditions does John Kennedy belong to? The Times
argued that like Jack and Bobby, John was ``cut down far too
early.'' Again, passive language distorts the facts. John was at
the controls when his vehicle crashed--just like Cousin Joe and
Uncle Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who's the victim? On ``Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert played
the 30-year-old video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to
the nation why, having driven his car off a bridge after a party on
Chappaquiddick Island--and having swum to safety while his young
campaign aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned in the car--he had failed
to report the accident to police. In the clip, Kennedy raised the
question ``whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the
Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt
what had happened and to delay my report.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert offered the clip as an omen of the ``curse'' that would
strike John Kennedy 30 years later. Russert's guest, columnist Mike
Barnicle, heaped praise and sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having
``borne so many'' family tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pointed out that at Chappaquiddick, unlike Dallas and Los
Angeles, the person most responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy,
whereas the victim was not--and that Ted Kennedy's invocation of
the family ``curse'' was a clever way of papering over these
differences. Thanks to this blurring of the victim-perpetrator
distinction, Ted's nephew Joe was able to get elected to Congress
despite his own car accident, which likewise devastated his
passenger, four years after Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John Kennedy belong to? Most pundits,
recalling Jack's and Bobby's assassinations, have cast his family
as the ultimate victim of his crash. ``Stop blaming John. It is
enough that tragedy once again punished the Kennedys,'' wrote
Cohen. But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessette family,
whose daughters were passengers on John's plane. The Chappaquiddick
analogies can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. For what purpose was the risk taken? To illustrate the
Kennedys' penchant for ``adventure,'' ``recklessness'' and
``disaster,'' the Post compares John's crash to the death of Joe
Kennedy Jr., in a World War II bombing mission and to Michael
Kennedy's fatal ``crash'' into a tree while playing football on
skis.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Jonathan Alter likens John's flying to his father's
piloting of a PT boat in the war: ``They both grabbed life by the
lapels.'' These comparisons obscure the difference between risking
one's life in war, as Jack and Joe did, and risking it playing
football.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John belong to? He was flying to a
wedding--a more commendable pursuit than the one that killed
Michael, but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe.
</P>
<P>
   4. What precautions were taken? Critics point out that John
Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot, took off after sunset, wasn't
licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday, flew
the more dangerous route over water, and never contacted air
traffic controllers for assistance. His defenders point out that he
was trained at a top-flight facility and usually brought along a
flight instructor but that Friday's weather reports offered no
warning of poor visibility. Barnicle, like Cohen, argued that to
accuse Kennedy of ``poor judgment is way out of bounds,'' because
``he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident.''
</P>
<P>
   By enumerating Kennedy's usual precautions, his defenders show
that he was more careful than many of his cousins. But against that
background--and comments from other pilots who say they decided the
weather was too dangerous for flying--his decisions last Friday
appear all the more unwise. John Kennedy would be alive today if he
had taken his usual precautions--and certainly if he had taken a
train instead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was the protagonist morally reckless? Recklessness theorists
associate John Kennedy's ``lack of judgment'' with his cousins'
debauchery. According to the Post, the family's ``fearless
adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal: for example, the
drug problems of Robert Jr., Patrick and David ... or Michael's
notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Time says of John, ``If he was less reckless than his cousins,
it was not saying much; there were friends who turned down the
invitation to take to the skies with him.'' The magazine quotes one
family member who said, ``The Kennedy story is really about karma,
about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This critique confuses different dimensions of ``judgment'' and
``breaking the rules.'' To err in assessing the weather is human;
to sleep with the baby sitter is depraved. John Kennedy knew the
difference: In 1997, he observed in George that his cousin Michael
had ``surrendered his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek--which casually
associated John's ``succession of stunning girlfriends'' as a
bachelor with his father's ``sexual snacking'' as a married
man--show far worse judgment than John ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders, however, gloss over the
same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with
Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of ``another Kennedy'' instead of
``assessing judgment.'' Judgment is precisely what should be
assessed. John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday. The
risk was unnecessary, and two people who entrusted him with their
lives are dead because he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a
pattern of decadence. John Kennedy's death was far less noble than
the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family--and far less
blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst.

NAVY AND NASA WORK ON VEST TO PREVENT PILOT'S DISORIENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Navy are developing a high-tech vest
to protect pilots from becoming dangerously disoriented while in
the cockpit, the predicament that may have doomed John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s flight to Martha's Vineyard, a NASA researcher said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The vest is fitted with 96 electronic motors that vibrate if the
aircraft's instruments detect that the plane is departing from
straight and level flight.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Capt. Angus Rupert, a scientist with NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston, said the vest helps ``tell pilots where down
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Disorientation occurs when a pilot, having lost sight of the
horizon either at night or in bad weather, incorrectly perceives
the position, motion or attitude of the aircraft relative to the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   During disorientation, the pilot's brain still receives balance
data from the inner ear and the skin-muscle-joint system, but this
data is distorted by the plane's acceleration. Pilots often will
perceive the aircraft to be climbing when it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The vest is designed to prevent that. For example, if a plane
were flying upside down, the pilot would feel a vibration in the
back. A roll to the right would elicit a vibration on the pilot's
right side. A roll to the left would result in a vibration on the
left. The more a plane rolled to the left, the more the vibration
would move up the pilot's side.
</P>
<P>
   The device is dubbed TSAS, for the Tactical Situational
Awareness System, and is a joint development between NASA and the
Navy Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory in Pensacola, Fla. It
has been under development since 1995 and is being flight tested on
military pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert said the vest also is being developed for space shuttle
pilots, who undergo a form of spatial disorientation when
reentering the earth's gravitational pull, and for Navy SEAL
commandos, who can become disoriented when in miniature submarines.
</P>
<P>
   In the military alone, disorientation annually claims the lives
of about 30 pilots and crew members and about $360 million in
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem,'' said Rupert.
</P>
<P>
   A deadly example occurred in 1996 when a Navy F-14 Tomcat took
off in Nashville, Tenn., and flew almost straight up. Seconds after
takeoff, the pilot became disoriented in a cloud and the jet
plummeted, killing three people on the ground, as well as the pilot
and his crew member.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot disorientation is a prevailing theory behind the deadly
crash that killed Kennedy, 38, his 33-year-old wife, Carolyn, and
her sister Lauren Bessette, 34, last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Radar records showed that Kennedy's plane dropped precipitously
after he took a right turn, leading aviation experts to speculate
that the prevailing haze and darkness may have caused him to lose
sight of the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Disorientation is a costly problem throughout aviation.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 article in the scholarly publication Journal of
Vestibular Research found that ``when one considers the number of
air forces in the world and the magnitude of commercial and general
aviation activity, it is easy to arrive at an estimate that spatial
disorientation wastes billions of dollars worth of resources every
year.''

   Later, he enjoyed rock climbing, paragliding, scuba diving,
kayaking and Rollerblading. He asked permission to rappel down
Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a magazine--demonstrating, according to Reuters,
that ``like other members of his legendary family, Kennedy had a
taste for danger and took risks.'' He invited Larry Flynt to a
black-tie dinner. He even lived ``in an edgy warehouse district.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``courage'' spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of
nobility on the family's escapades. As questions about recklessness
bounced around the Sunday talk shows, Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley
argued that ``John Jr. and the Kennedy family [are] 'in the arena,'
and they're living a vigorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bold,'' agreed Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ``They have
always had courage. They've always wanted to live to the fullest.''
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen admonished critics, ``It is
an active family, an achieving family, and so its members have
taken some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times boasted that ``the Kennedys have always been
risk-takers, in play, politics and war. At its best, there is a
certain nobility to the Kennedys' refusal to let life intimidate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the family's risk-taking has been ``bold'' or
``wild.'' Some Kennedys have been far more reckless than others.
Was John Kennedy's death reckless? Let's consider the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who caused the tragedy? Most of the coverage depicts John as
the victim of a family ``curse.'' The Kennedys are ``stalked by
tragedy,'' suffering ``bad luck'' or a ``near-biblical blight''
that has been inflicted, according to Mario Cuomo, by ``gods.'' Not
only were Jack and Bobby assassinated, but ``the younger generation
of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well,'' says the
Post--''as if fate were picking them off,'' laments Time.
</P>
<P>
   This passive language obscures an important distinction. Whereas
Jack and Bobby were murdered, the ``younger generation,'' far from
being ``haunted'' or ``picked off,'' caused its own grief. Joe
overturned a jeep, leaving his brother's girlfriend paralyzed.
Bobby Jr. introduced mescaline to his 13-year-old brother David,
who eventually died of a drug overdose. Michael slept with his
kids' teen-age baby sitter and later skied into a tree. William
Kennedy Smith, their cousin, went out on the town with Uncle Teddy,
brought home a woman, and ended up being tried unsuccessfully for
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these traditions does John Kennedy belong to? The Times
argued that like Jack and Bobby, John was ``cut down far too
early.'' Again, passive language distorts the facts. John was at
the controls when his vehicle crashed--just like Cousin Joe and
Uncle Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who's the victim? On ``Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert played
the 30-year-old video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to
the nation why, having driven his car off a bridge after a party on
Chappaquiddick Island--and having swum to safety while his young
campaign aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned in the car--he had failed
to report the accident to police. In the clip, Kennedy raised the
question ``whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the
Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt
what had happened and to delay my report.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert offered the clip as an omen of the ``curse'' that would
strike John Kennedy 30 years later. Russert's guest, columnist Mike
Barnicle, heaped praise and sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having
``borne so many'' family tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pointed out that at Chappaquiddick, unlike Dallas and Los
Angeles, the person most responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy,
whereas the victim was not--and that Ted Kennedy's invocation of
the family ``curse'' was a clever way of papering over these
differences. Thanks to this blurring of the victim-perpetrator
distinction, Ted's nephew Joe was able to get elected to Congress
despite his own car accident, which likewise devastated his
passenger, four years after Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John Kennedy belong to? Most pundits,
recalling Jack's and Bobby's assassinations, have cast his family
as the ultimate victim of his crash. ``Stop blaming John. It is
enough that tragedy once again punished the Kennedys,'' wrote
Cohen. But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessette family,
whose daughters were passengers on John's plane. The Chappaquiddick
analogies can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. For what purpose was the risk taken? To illustrate the
Kennedys' penchant for ``adventure,'' ``recklessness'' and
``disaster,'' the Post compares John's crash to the death of Joe
Kennedy Jr., in a World War II bombing mission and to Michael
Kennedy's fatal ``crash'' into a tree while playing football on
skis.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Jonathan Alter likens John's flying to his father's
piloting of a PT boat in the war: ``They both grabbed life by the
lapels.'' These comparisons obscure the difference between risking
one's life in war, as Jack and Joe did, and risking it playing
football.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John belong to? He was flying to a
wedding--a more commendable pursuit than the one that killed
Michael, but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe.
</P>
<P>
   4. What precautions were taken? Critics point out that John
Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot, took off after sunset, wasn't
licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday, flew
the more dangerous route over water, and never contacted air
traffic controllers for assistance. His defenders point out that he
was trained at a top-flight facility and usually brought along a
flight instructor but that Friday's weather reports offered no
warning of poor visibility. Barnicle, like Cohen, argued that to
accuse Kennedy of ``poor judgment is way out of bounds,'' because
``he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident.''
</P>
<P>
   By enumerating Kennedy's usual precautions, his defenders show
that he was more careful than many of his cousins. But against that
background--and comments from other pilots who say they decided the
weather was too dangerous for flying--his decisions last Friday
appear all the more unwise. John Kennedy would be alive today if he
had taken his usual precautions--and certainly if he had taken a
train instead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was the protagonist morally reckless? Recklessness theorists
associate John Kennedy's ``lack of judgment'' with his cousins'
debauchery. According to the Post, the family's ``fearless
adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal: for example, the
drug problems of Robert Jr., Patrick and David ... or Michael's
notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Time says of John, ``If he was less reckless than his cousins,
it was not saying much; there were friends who turned down the
invitation to take to the skies with him.'' The magazine quotes one
family member who said, ``The Kennedy story is really about karma,
about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This critique confuses different dimensions of ``judgment'' and
``breaking the rules.'' To err in assessing the weather is human;
to sleep with the baby sitter is depraved. John Kennedy knew the
difference: In 1997, he observed in George that his cousin Michael
had ``surrendered his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek--which casually
associated John's ``succession of stunning girlfriends'' as a
bachelor with his father's ``sexual snacking'' as a married
man--show far worse judgment than John ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders, however, gloss over the
same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with
Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of ``another Kennedy'' instead of
``assessing judgment.'' Judgment is precisely what should be
assessed. John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday. The
risk was unnecessary, and two people who entrusted him with their
lives are dead because he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a
pattern of decadence. John Kennedy's death was far less noble than
the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family--and far less
blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst.

   As the jet stream retreats to the border states, an influx of
hot, humid air will be noticed into the Great Lakes and parts of
the Northeast. The boundary of a warm, but less-humid air mass over
Quebec will be the focus of thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The storms will be more active and widespread Friday morning in
Michigan and northern Ohio as a stream of sultry winds at 5,000
feet advances across the upper Ohio Valley. A few strong storms
will develop Friday afternoon in the northern Appalachians as humid
air is pushed eastward.
</P>
<P>
   A westward extension of the Bermuda high will assist in
circulating tropical air from the southern Plains into the rest of
the nation east of the Rockies. Maximum temperatures will soar into
the middle to upper 90s in most places. The interaction of the sea
breeze from the Gulf of Mexico with steamy air inland will trigger
afternoon thunderstorms from Florida to northeast Texas. A few
storms will also grow over the southern Appalachians and near the
western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a noticeable decrease in the number of
thundershowers over the southern and central Rockies, but some rain
is still expected. A push of hot, dry air from the desert Southwest
into the central Rockies will be accompanied by blazing sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   A surge of cool, moist air from the North Pacific will reach the
Cascades by midday. Low clouds and patches of drizzle will envelop
the coast. Isolated thundershowers are possible as the front moves
into eastern Washington and Oregon. Most of California will be
sunny and a bit cooler in northern sections.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SHUTTLE SHOWERS
</P>
<P>
   The early-Thursday showers and thunderstorms that rumbled inland
from the Atlantic and forced the postponement of the launching of
the space shuttle were not in usual summertime character. On summer
nights, thunderstorms often form off coastal waters along the
leading edge of an offshore land breeze, which forms in response to
the uneven nocturnal cooling of land and sea. Early Thursday,
land-breeze thunderstorms erupted like clockwork, but steering
winds from the northeast around an expansive high pressure system
over the Ohio Valley forced the storms back toward the coast. &QL;

NASCAR: AND NOW A WORD ABOUT OUR SPONSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.C. ``Junie'' Donlavey has been fielding cars for Winston Cup
races since long before it was called Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Donlavey entered his first race in 1950, just a year after Bill
France Sr. founded NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   But the sport has passed Donlavey by. In recent years, he has
had trouble securing sponsors to provide the money necessary to
continue running, and he is in danger of dropping by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't be the first. Bud Moore, another longtime fixture,
lost his sponsor a few years back and, unable to put anything solid
together, has dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Moore started racing in 1961 and has fielded entries for some of
the sport's biggest names, Joe Weatherly, Bobby Allison and Dale
Earnhardt among them.
</P>
<P>
   As Winston Cup has become more high profile and more and more
money has been pumped into the sport, sponsorship has become
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it go a long way toward determining how
competitive a team can be, it also determines whether or not you
can even race.
</P>
<P>
   When a sponsor decides to drop a team or car owner, it can
literally be the end for that operation, as in Moore's case.
</P>
<P>
   Some in NASCAR don't think that's right. They feel that people
like Moore, who were loyal through the sport's growth period,
should have some kind of protection.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, many are urging that NASCAR work out some kind of
franchising arrangement to protect current owners.
</P>
<P>
   In its simplest form, that would mean that the only way for
somebody new to get into the sport would be to buy an existing
Winston Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, who might soon find himself in a situation
similar to Moore's, has long been an advocate of this. As have some
owners like Richard Childress, who doesn't have sponsorship
problems now, but would like to see changes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has popped up again in recent weeks with Tide's
announcement that it is ending a long-term relationship with Ricky
Rudd to sponsor Cal Wells' new team.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has competed in open-wheel racing but never in NASCAR.
Earlier, he picked off McDonald's, which dropped Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   This has left Rudd and Elliott both looking for sponsors,
although Elliott still has another year left with McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's done a good job of selling,'' Elliott said
about Wells. ``If that's where McDonald's wants to go, that's
perfectly fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not performed well in my own eyes and I need to be better
on the race track. That's pretty much McDonald's prerogative,''
Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor entering into McDonald's thinking was the belief that
Elliott will retire after next season, something he has not
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a complex issue for NASCAR, which, on the one hand,
doesn't want to do anything to keep potential sponsors out and, at
the same time, would like to protect individuals who have remained
committed to Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   There probably isn't a lot NASCAR can do. A few years ago, Joe
Gibbs was just like Cal Wells, and Gibbs getting into the sport has
definitely made it better.
</P>
<P>
   That helps NASCAR. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much for Junie
Donlavey.

THE GREAT AND NOT-SO-TERRIBLE OZ ON `STAR WARS,' YODA AND JAR JAR
BINKS 
</HEADLINE>

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Yoda with
Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ``Star Wars: The Phantom
Menace.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Miff Frank Oz it does not. Confuse him does it.
 &HT;    ``I get people saying `You're the voice of Yoda!''' Oz says.
``And I'm thinking, `Yeah, but that's not all I'm doing.''
 &HT;    Beyond providing the syntax-challenged croak of The Force's
guiding light in ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' Oz also
manipulated the Yoda puppet, with assistance from three fellow
puppeteers, just as he had in the 1980s for ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi.''
 &HT;    ``What confuses me is if they think I'm only doing the voice,
what do they think about the actual guys who handle Yoda?'' asks
Oz, who honed his puppeteering skills under Muppetmaster Jim Henson
and is still the voice and hands behind ``Sesame Street'' and
Muppet favorites such as Miss Piggy, Bert, Cookie Monster and
Fozzie Bear. ``If they think someone else does Yoda and I only do
the voice, then they're impressed just with the voice, which is the
easiest part of the whole thing.
 &HT;    ``The challenge is taking myself and the other people working
the character and rehearsing-rehearsing-rehearsing for days before
we shoot, to get all of our movements right,'' he adds. ``It's
physically hard, and you have do it over and over again to get it
right. We averaged two days of rehearsal for every one day of
shooting.''
 &HT;    Post-``Empire,'' Oz established himself as an A-list director,
steering ``The Dark Crystal,'' ``What About Bob?'' and, more
recently, ``In and Out.'' Next up is the Steve Martin-Eddie Murphy
comedy ``Bowfinger,'' which opens on Aug. 13.
 &HT;    Oz is a busy, busy man _ he also performs in the current sci-fi
epic ``Muppets from Space'' _ but he jumped at the chance to
reprise Yoda in ``The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    Actually, he says, he was surprised that writer/director George
Lucas chose to continue doing Yoda as a puppet, instead of taking
advantage of 16 years of advances in computer graphics.
 &HT;    ``I thought they'd go with CG,'' Oz says, ``but George intimated
that there's something about Yoda as he is now that's more organic,
that worked somehow.
 &HT;    ``I'm comfortable with CG if it's used properly,'' he adds,
``but I don't think you could make Yoda entirely CG. You can't,
because he's so known as what he is, as he looks.''
 &HT;    Though ``The Phantom Menace'' unfolds several decades prior to
``Empire'' and ``Jedi,'' Oz made only minor changes to his
interpretation of the Jedi master.
 &HT;    ``In `Jedi' he was near death,'' he says. ``He walked with a
cane a lot, and he breathed more heavily. We had no need to play
that this time _ he's still an old man, but he's by no means
disabled and ill.
 &HT;    ``In `Empire' he was not ill either, but he was feisty,'' Oz
adds. ``In `The Phantom Menace,' the only thing I missed doing was
the feistiness, but there was no room for it. It was too serious a
time, with the bad guys encroaching.''
 &HT;    After three times around the block as Yoda, Oz thinks he's
pretty tuned into his diminutive, wizened alter ego and what he's
all about.
 &HT;    ``My interpretation _ and George is the key, because he wrote
it, as did Larry Kasdan _ is that Yoda has a strong belief in the
good side of The Force being good, not only for himself, but for
everyone,'' Oz says. ``He thinks it's important to the progress of
everybody's humanity, even those who are not human.
 &HT;    ``That's why he does what he does,'' he says. ``It's why, I'd
imagine, the Pope does what he does: He's trying to bring the
lighter side of life to people.''
 &HT;    Yoda isn't the alien being that has provoked the most discussion
among ``Phantom Menace'' audiences, however. Oz insists that he
loved the script for the movie, and volunteers that he's crazy
about the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks.
 &HT;    ``I thought it was magnificent,'' he says. ``And I loved Jar
Jar. I don't know what the whole flak was about _ when I read the
script, I thought `Oh, Jar Jar is going to be a terrific
character.'
 &HT;    ``I was surprised at the bizarre reaction to him,'' he adds. ``I
love Jar Jar! I think he's hysterical.''
 &HT;    As ``The Phantom Menace'' nears the end of its lucrative
theatrical run, ``Star Wars'' fans are turning to thoughts of the
saga's next installment. But Oz has other ideas.
 &HT;    ``I've got a project that may or may not happen, and if it
doesn't I'll just take a long vacation,'' he says. ``I haven't
talked to George yet about `Episode II,' but it's very possible
that he's thinking about doing Yoda in CG next time, if Yoda's even
there next time.
 &HT;    ``And if it is CG, I'll be fine with that,'' Oz says. ``Whatever
helps the character, scenes and the movie is fine with me.''

   NEW YORK _ Eighty years young, Merce Cunningham speaks to
audiences wordlessly, surprisingly and directly through his
choreography and his dancers. The brief celebratory season of his
work presented by Lincoln Center Festival '99 through this weekend
captures this spirit and features the spectacular new ``Biped,'' as
well as guest appearances by the New York City Ballet and Mikhail
Baryshnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly last and certainly not least, Cunningham appears onstage
as well. In mind and spirit, he is always a dancer first. ``This is
my 60th year of performing,'' he told the audience, which gave him
a standing ovation at the New York State Theater on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham had just received the Handel Medallion, New York
City's highest arts award, from Cultural Affairs Commissioner
Schuyler Chapin at the end of the performance. It is not
Cunningham's wont to address his public in the theater. But here he
spoke of ``how warmly I feel for your interest in our work and in
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The medallion was a springboard to recall the place the city had
played in his life. Born in Centralia, Wash., Cunningham studied
dance at the Cornish School in Seattle and in California at Mills
College, where Martha Graham invited him to join her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to New York in September 1939 and in December performed
on Broadway with Martha Graham,'' Cunningham said. ``From the first
day I have regarded New York as my home.'' The Merce Cunningham
Dance Company is frequently on tour, he said, ``but it is here I
look forward to returning.'' The evening was, he added, ``a
memorable occasion for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was for all. The festival is billing his company's
programs as ``Merce Cunningham: A Lifetime of Dance,'' and they
have been conceived as a mini-retrospective and tribute to his 80th
birthday (April 16). This first of four evenings opened with the
1958 ``Summerspace,'' created for the Cunningham troupe but also
danced in 1966 by City Ballet and now revived for that company with
both its pointillist decor by Robert Rauschenberg and its fugitive
beauty still intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biped,'' a New York premiere, experiments on a large
theatrical scale with the interaction between live dancers and
computerized animated figures and designs projected on a scrim. In
``Occasion Piece,'' Cunningham and Baryshnikov in effect dance two
simultaneous solos around the plastic boxes that Jasper Johns
designed in tribute to Marcel Duchamp. ``Sounddance,'' arguably one
of Cunningham's best pieces, ends the evening in a whirlwind blast
of energy.
</P>
<P>
   It might be tempting to focus on the technology of ``Biped,''
with its suggestion of virtual reality, as huge animated figures
seem to move in front and behind the live dancers. But it is the
wonderful real dancers, all 14 of them in their red-and-blue
silvery swimsuits designed by Suzanne Gallo, who dominate the work.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case when Cunningham's choreography turns to
multimedia devices, the technology is at the service of a creative
process and an artistic purpose. You don't have to know how Shelley
Eshkar and Paul Kaiser created the striking animated designs to
sense the potent theatrical atmosphere of the piece as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biped,'' like all Cunningham works, will evoke a variety of
response. There is nonetheless a haunted-house texture to the score
commissioned from the experimental British composer Gavin Bryars.
Partly recorded but also performed live in the pit on conventional
instruments (by John Kennedy, Takehisa Kosugi, Jim O'Rourke, Peter
Weitzner and Anja Wood), the music drifts along in multi-layered
textures.
</P>
<P>
   If there are melodic elements, the impression is that the
dancers plow through the musical haze. To dance ``to'' music is
outside the Cunningham esthetic. Yet sound, image and movement can
come together and coincide on a thematic level. The piece is not
haunted so much as it is haunting. The design figures have a
ghostly tinge, especially when a figure in three-dimensional volume
is abstracted into a blur of multiple exposure or into a series of
dots and strips on the front scrim.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Cunningham choreographed the basic movement
for the piece with three dancers (Jared Phillips, Jeannie Steele
and Robert Swinston). All wore knoblike sensors on their joints,
and their movement was transformed digitally by Eshkar and Kaiser
through ``motion capture'' technology. They then created the
animated designs that are seen on the transparent scrim and that
also appear behind the dancers. The illusion is of constantly
changing space.
</P>
<P>
   The equivalent of filmed choreography in this case is not
strictly in the virtual-reality category because it was derived
from movement of real dancers. All the more fascinating to decode
were the cartwheels and leaps once performed by humans and now seen
as prancing, tumbling dots on a screen. Unlike Yeats, we can, in
this instance, separate the dancer from the dance.
</P>
<P>
   The cast makes its collective presence strongly felt and
consists of Lisa Boudreau, Thomas Caley, Holley Farmer, Maydelle
Fason, Jean Freebury, David Kulick, Matthew Mohr, Banu Ogan, Glen
Rumsey, Daniel Squire, Ms. Steele, Derry Swan, Swinston and Cheryl
Therrien.
</P>
<P>
   From their first bare-legged entry, usually as soloists or in
small groups, the dancers announce the powerful carved shape of the
choreography. Heads are thrown back, arms bent up but not quite
curved, legs shoot out or are pushed into the ground with
surprising force.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally there is the expected stream of seemingly unrelated
movements. As Bryars' music suddenly rumbles out, Swinston faces
the audience, thrusts one hip out and sinks to a knee. Yet this
highly visible isolation of body parts is unusual. More often
Cunningham's collage of movements suggests an assemblage of parts
that through its lack of logic conjures up a strange logic of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics here are emphatic, even when a line of six dancers
breaks its horizontal unity. Each dancer suddenly twists a torso
while in a plie. There are images of unity and disunity as well of
fragmentary solos suddenly replaced by unison dancing. The activity
quickens. Four couples dance and disperse. Throughout, the drama is
in the sharpness of the gesture, although non sequiturs add a light
touch (six men hopping through). There are six simultaneous duets,
and at the end the animated figures are banished, leaving the live
dancers onstage in clusters.
</P>
<P>
   As choreography, ``Biped'' is remarkable in its unison impact.
When the women line up and sink into ballet's fourth position, they
recall bathing beauties of the 1930s. Again, with head back and
with Aaron Copp's lighting on their bodies, they radiate a hint of
decadence and angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biped'' is a piece that troubles through its beauty. The live
dancers onstage are not quite surrounded by cyberspace. But their
animated counterparts, often skeletal or blurred, suggest an
evaporation that is both exciting and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   In a change of pace, ``Occasion Piece'' is reassuring.
Cunningham, still magnificent in his stage projection and with his
whimsy in full gear, is seen in contrast to a serious Baryshnikov,
who executes the sharp and occasional twitchy, disjointed movements
Cunningham has recently created for him.
</P>
<P>
   The decor consists of the seven transparent boxes that Johns
designed for Cunningham's 1968 ``Walkaround Time.'' Cunningham, now
restricted to a few steps but still unpredictable in a wave of an
arm or a glance to the heavens when he is not looking penetratingly
at the audience, edged around the boxes. Baryshnikov darted around
them and the sense was that they met without an encounter.
</P>
<P>
   With Stephen Drury onstage at the piano, playing the dropped
notes of John Cage's ``Music for Marcel Duchamp, 1947,'' the
seven-minute piece becomes a tribute to Cage, the company's
longtime music director; Cunningham, and one of their chief
mentors, Duchamp: an ethos in summary.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened late because tickets for patrons who were to
attend a benefit dinner after the performance were not distributed
on time. The peaceable kingdom of ``Summerspace,'' the first piece,
served as soothing balm.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's springboard here was apparently an experiment in
transient movement. Rauschenberg's backdrop and costumes, with
colored dots, enhance the idea of choreography with no specific
central point. In 1966 the City Ballet performed this work on toe,
but in the fine new staging by Carolyn Brown, Swinston and
Cunningham, the women are in soft ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   The City Ballet's Jenifer Ringer, Kathleen Tracey, Zippora Karz,
Stacey Calvert, Kipling Houston and Alexander Ritter belong to a
generation that takes naturally to unorthodox phrasing. The pace is
gentle with leaps and sudden alightings. Ms. Ringer, dropping
repeatedly to the knee with one leg extended, and Ritter, in
Cunningham's original role, were outstanding. Kennedy conducted
members of the City Ballet orchestra with Drury at the piano.
Morton Feldman's score, with its birdlike melange of flutes, was
refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said, in a different dimension of
``Sounddance,'' a turbulent work to a turbulent score by David
Tudor. On a formal level, the choreography blasts 10 dancers (Koji
Minato is the newcomer) from a curtained area, to which they
eventually whirl or dive back. Yet images abound. Swinston, in a
sensationally committed performance, is everyman in this life
cycle: metaphor through energy.

THE CASE OF THE RETIRING POLICE DOG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By SCOTT HADLY   
 Santa Barbara (Calif.) News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ ``R is for Ruff, Ruff'' doesn't cut it
in the hard-boiled detective genre as defined by local resident and
national best-selling author Sue Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   But nevertheless, Grafton felt the Santa Barbara Police
Department's K-9 force was important enough to receive $8,000 of
her money. This week she was formally thanked for covering the cost
of buying and training a new German shepherd for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the perfect gift,'' said Grafton, flanked by
two burly officers and their dogs, Apache, the veteran, and Wiley,
the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley was recruited after the recent retirement of Moritz, a
6-year-old police dog. Grafton read about Moritz and the need to
raise money to buy and train another dog. She stuffed a cashier's
check for $8,000 into an envelope and sent it to the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could have seen their faces when they opened that
envelope,'' Grafton said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Richard Breza called her the day the envelope
arrived to thank her and at a City Council meeting Tuesday he gave
her a plaque commemorating the gift.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton said she made the gift to show her appreciation for the
officers and detectives who have helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Technical books on forensics, toxicology and ballistics are
fine, but when Grafton has questions she talks to detectives.
``They've always been gracious with information,'' said Grafton.
``I can ask anything and they are very patient with me.''
</P>
<P>
   She's spent time at the county morgue, in police cars on
ride-alongs with officers, and now plans to watch some K-9 training
sessions, all in the name of book authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   In the preface of most of her novels, Grafton acknowledges local
police and sheriff's detectives and officers who have answered her
questions over the years.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the now-retired Santa Barbara Police Capt.
William Christensen, whom she talked to while working on her first
novel ``A is for Alibi,'' which was finished in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she's gone through a slow burn of the alphabet _ ``B
is for Burglary,'' ``C is for Corpse,'' and so on _ until now, 15
books later, she'll publish her latest, ``O is for Outlaw,'' in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled with murder, intrigue and a little violence, Grafton's
books have caught the imagination of mystery fans.
</P>
<P>
   Grafton sets her books in the fictional Santa Teresa, a thinly
veiled Santa Barbara. The town is the pristine backdrop in which
main character Kinsey Millhone muses in one book, ``It's all oddly
unsettling _ so lush and refined that it ruins you for anyplace
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Grafton said she shares those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Harriet Miller thanked the author for her descriptions of
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud to have you write about our city,'' Miller
said.

   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN PIE,'' starring Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Natasha
Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari and Eugene
Levy. Directed by Paul Weitz (R, 100 minutes). The snickering
teen-age comedy about four boys, all seniors in the same Michigan
high school, who swear a pact to lose their virginity by the end of
the school year, serves up a new gross-out joke every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie obviously wants to outdo ``There's Something About
Mary'' in raunchy guffaws, but it lacks the antic spirit of its
forerunner. More like an upper middle class ``Porky's,'' it parades
its dirty jokes as crassly as an old-time burlesque show (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ARLINGTON ROAD,'' starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins,
Hope Davis, Robert Gossett and Joan Cusack. Directed by Mark
Pellington (R, 117 minutes). In a smart, stylish thriller that
recalls the paranoid classics of the '70s, Bridges plays a history
professor who begins to suspect that his smiling suburban neighbors
are not what they seem. Tracking down clues to an anti-government
terrorist network, he also engages in a battle of wits with
Robbins' cryptic character, and these fine actors square off to
gripping effect.
</P>
<P>
   Swift and pulse-quickening, this thriller has more than its
share of surprising twists, including a whopper at the finale. All
in all, a welcome change of pace from the season's dopey
blockbusters (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,'' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!'' But it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' neo-Sellers multiple-personality act is fine even when
the material is less so, and this sequel makes the most of Dr.
Evil, his most inspired creation. A scatological Scotsman, the
film's walking id and bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste.
Costumes and pop references are still a hoot, as is the adorably
benighted Austin. Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy but doesn't
share Ms. Hurley's quick-witted air of being in on the joke
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``AUTUMN TALE,'' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere,
Didier Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric
Rohmer (PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The
final chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand).
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the adventures of this wiry and vital but
lonely widowed mother of two after she allows two friends to play
matchmaker. The film's plot, like that of other Rohmer movies, is
mathematically schematic as the characters indulge in exquisitely
verbalized soul-searching. As sensuously gratifying as it is
civilized, with a wonderful central performance by Ms. Romand, it
reaches a happy ending that feels entirely earned (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG DADDY,'' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse and
Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by Dennis Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes).
It's awfully early in the career of Adam Sandler to find him
sharing the screen with a scene-stealing 6-year-old (actually the
Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in Sandler's movies is
usually the star himself. But he's in a position to do whatever he
likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental comedy with more product
plugs and fewer laughs than might have been hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Having greatly expanded his following with the romantic comedy
and 80's kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to mention the
inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls back on much
less inventive material this time. And the barrage of brand-name
junk food is enough to make skin break out in the audience
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,'' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination, and a game plan so enterprising
it should elevate its creators to pin-up status at film schools
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate fake witch
mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi Channel and much
more, this clever little indie is at the center of a new form of
synergy, and an inspired multimedia blitz (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``EYES WIDE SHUT,'' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman. Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last
cryptic, spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a
stunning epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a
dead-serious film about eros and mortality, one that flirts with
the ridiculous but sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise, as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of
strange, dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks
his jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,'' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige.
</P>
<P>
   So the title character, a pretty young officer who the film
thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``LAKE PLACID,'' starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver
Platt and Brendan Gleeson. Written by David E. Kelley and directed
by Steve Miner (R, 88 minutes). Despite the DOA nature of the genre
it tacitly sends up, this ``Jaws''-minded demon crocodile movie
finds a fair amount to work with in newly reptile-plagued Maine. A
good cast is given the challenge of keeping straight faces. (``Any
recent bear attacks?'' ``This was no bear. Bears don't attack
people underwater.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the horror effects can be divinely cheesy, like the apparent
underwater sprinkler hose whose churning effect is described as
``scared perch.'' Trouble is, this story also has to go through the
motions of a totally familiar monster plot. There's no way to make
that seem anything but tired (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RED VIOLIN,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie's narrative energy is undermined by a plodding
screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by John
Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonia
Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,'' with the voices
of Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker
(R, 88 minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy
Central cartoon series following the adventures of some
potty-mouthed third-grade boys in the Colorado town of South Park
is extremely funny and jubilantly obscene, with several sewers'
worth of bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a smart, pointed satire that demolishes the hypocrisy
of a conservative culture that allows almost unlimited violence and
gore in movies and on television but goes ballistic at the prospect
of children being exposed to dirty language and sexual
explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into a Canadian movie
filled with obscenities and come home spewing smut, their parents
raise such a ruckus that the United States declares war on Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has been having a troubled
affair with the recently deceased Saddam Hussein, decides to put in
an appearance. Contributing to the madness are 15 clever songs
spoofing everything from Rodgers and Hammerstein to ``Les
Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``SUMMER OF SAM,'' starring John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody
and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 145 minutes). This raw,
enthralling evocation of a Bronx neighborhood gone mad in 1977
plunges its audience headlong into a pre-AIDS libidinous frenzy. It
also summons an atmosphere of macho posturing and mounting
prejudice reminiscent of ``Do the Right Thing'' a decade ago,
though the locals this time are white Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree of David Berkowitz is used as a catalyst,
joining disco, punk, drugs, a heat wave and the Yankees to summon
the crazed spirit of that time. The characters are thin, but a fine
cast brings them to life. Leguizamo (in high ``Saturday Night
Fever'' style) and Brody (with hair in spikes) are outstanding as
the film's two most visible signs of the times (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,'' starring
Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd.
Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and
breathless expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy
surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the
series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating
illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding
raptors of ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action
figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of
crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is
given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier and
scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``TARZAN,'' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie
Driver and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck
(G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan movie
could improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney animation
turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the apes talk
to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings with exultant
agility.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways that are hard
to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly kinetic
animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the background.
Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WILD WILD WEST,'' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Salma
Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG-13, 107 minutes). Another
big, lavish movie with no there there. This post-Civil War James
Bondish contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard to categorize a
quality not to be confused with originality.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Sonnenfeld without the deadpan-alien sensibility
that worked for ``Men in Black,'' this stylistic grab bag is
similarly kinky but a lot more chaotic, however heroically Smith,
as a newly hunky and debonair action hero, tries to save the day.
Good-looking but dopey, with an emphasis on toylike but vaguely
ghoulish special effects. A movie with that much potential kiddie
appeal didn't have to start in a bordello, either (Maslin). &QL;

   ``JUST BEFORE NIGHTFALL ... THE CINEMA OF CLAUDE CHABROL.'' One
of the true fathers of the French New Wave, Claude Chabrol will be
celebrated by the Film Society of Lincoln Center with a 20-film
retrospective spanning the years from 1958 to 1995 and beginning
Friday with ``La Femme Infidele'' (1968). Starring Michel Bouquet,
Maurice Ronet and Stephane Audran, for many years Chabrol's wife
and leading lady, this film focuses, as do so many others by
Chabrol, on the bourgeoisie, where relationships pivot on marital
faithlessness and the upshot is murder. Friday and Saturday also
feature screenings of ``Juste Avant la Nuit'' (``Just Before
Nightfall''), a 1971 variation on ``La Femme Infidele.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other highlights of the retrospective are Chabrol's '70s
genteel bourgeois murder films ``Le Boucher,'' ``La Rupture'' and
``Les Noces Rouges'' (``Wedding in Blood''). A new 35-mm print of
``Les Bonnes Femmes'' (1960), a New Wave classic about the
yearnings of four shopgirls, will be shown Aug. 13 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   The series continues through Aug. 19 at the Walter Reade Theater
at Lincoln Center. Admission: $8.50; $5 for Film Society members;
$4.50 for the elderly at weekday matinees. Information: (212)
875-5600 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

RUMORS SWIRL AROUND `THE ICE MAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can trace Terry Labonte's troubles back to Oct. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That's the day Gary DeHart, who had been Labonte's crew chief
from the time Labonte joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1994, suddenly
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   DeHart had guided Labonte and his team to a Winston Cup
championship in 1996. But Labonte started slowly in 1997 and the
pressure got to DeHart, who quit after a confrontation with one of
his crew.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Labonte, a quiet Texan known as ``The Ice Man'' for
his cool demeanor, has been in a steady slide.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has remained in the top 10 in points and won a race
after DeHart left and again last year and in 1999, but the fact is,
Labonte is no longer consistently competitive.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk this year that Labonte, at 42 still considered
one of the best in Winston Cup, would leave Hendrick after this
year. An incident that fueled speculation was when Labonte became
furious when his team went against his wishes and brought a car he
didn't want to Daytona for the Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   Were he to consider making a change, Labonte would be a prime
choice for any top team looking for a driver. A number of reports
had him moving to Robert Yates to replace Kenny Irwin, but Labonte
said he and Yates have never talked. Yates, however, holds Labonte
in high regard and might make a run at him if he was available.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, however, recently confirmed he is staying with Hendrick
Motorsports at least through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, sometimes rumors do get started like that.
There's really no fact to 'em,'' said Labonte, one of several Chevy
drivers who tested at Indy this week. He said he has one more year
on his contract with Hendrick and one more year with Kellogg's, his
primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're actually negotiating to extend our contract,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is kind of a little distraction,'' Labonte
continued. ``I really try to ignore it, but you can't help it
because people ask you about it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no truth to it,'' Labonte said, referring
to the rumors about Yates and then adding, ``he has an excellent
race team, there's no question about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel we have a great team here, and if we get this thing
back on track, we've got an excellent chance for another
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, though.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jeff Gordon came of age in 1995, Hendrick's three-car
team, which also includes the entry driven by Wally Dallenbach, has
run at three sharply defined and different levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the top has been Gordon, who, although he has struggled at
times this year, still sets the mark that most Winston Cup teams
aim for.
</P>
<P>
   Below him has been Labonte, and then comes Dallenbach's car,
which has not been competitive sinae Hendrick went to a three-car
operation in 1993. That car will have a new driver and sponsor in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   For Labonte, the problem has been that over the last two years,
instead of moving closer to Gordon, he is running more like
Dallenbach.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his win at the Primestar 500 in Texas back in March,
this year has been abysmal by Labonte's standards, with Texas
really the only race in which he has been competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents like the one at Daytona have created strains in
Labonte's team, and Gordon and his crew chief, Ray Evernham, seem
to have separated themselves from the rest of Hendrick's operation,
leaving the other two cars to struggle by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of went in separate directions a few years ago, and I
think it's going to benefit all of Hendrick Motorsports if we can
get it going back in the same direction and the teams working
closer together,'' Labonte said. ``We've made big steps in that
direction recently, and we're going to continue to do that.''

THE BEST PREVIEWS SELL THE MOVIE WITHOUT GIVING AWAY THE PLOT
(Accompanied by TRAILERS-GOOD&AMP;BAD 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although DreamWorks SKG is releasing its haunted-house movie The
Haunting in theaters on Friday, the studio has been trying to scare
up business for it for months. The real haunting started in
January, when the studio released its cerebral thriller In Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The coming-attractions reel before In Dreams gave audiences
their first peek at The Haunting, and a tantalizing peek it was.
The preview showed no actors; it merely featured images of a creepy
mansion, with the voice of an older woman reading a
nursery-rhyme-style poem about an old house.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the woman's voice deepened to something more
sinister-sounding, and the house took on an evil-looking face,
leading up to the preview's closing words, written in blood-red
script: ``Sleep tight.''
</P>
<P>
   In movie-industry terminology, a short preview like this is
called a teaser, and it eventually was replaced by a more explicit
trailer featuring actors and effects. Too bad, because the first
Haunting teaser was a textbook example of a good movie trailer _
one that arouses your interest without revealing too much and is
attached to a main attraction from a similar genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one rule for trailering in commercial play, and that's
anything goes, as long as it's appropriate for the audience,'' says
Michael H. Price, director of the Gourmet Cinema program at Fort
Worth's AMC Sundance 11. ``The trailering I encourage is the type
where you do want to stroke the audience with similar subject
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But movie trailers aren't an exact science. Trailers are sales
tools, of course, commercials that few people seem to mind
watching. The trick for studios and theater chains is putting the
commercials in front of the right buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as far as going to the movies, seeing trailers is
part of the experience,'' says Brian Caldwell, vice president of
marketing for Fine Line Pictures. ``Trailers are sort of
mini-movies, if you do them right.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some excellent teasers and trailers during the
past few weeks, such as the cryptic ones for The Blair Witch
Project and Eyes Wide Shut, both box-office successes. There have
been some misfires, too, such as the tell-all trailer for Arlington
Road, a box-office disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a crash course in how trailers work: Studios work with a
theater circuit _ for example, AMC Theatres or UA Theatres _ to
place trailers for their upcoming movies in individual theaters.
The theaters then have a choice of what to attach to feature
presentations. Some theater chains control trailer content more
than others, and some trailers come attached to the main attraction
(usually if they come from the same studio). In the end, it's
usually the theater managers who decide which trailers should go
with what features.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that trailers are an opening act, though one
theater chain has taken to running a coming-attractions reel that
calls trailers and attached commercials ``pre-show entertainment.''
In fact, instead of setting a mood for a feature, too many trailers
can detract from a feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in playing more than three trailers before a
film, because the audience stops paying attention,'' says Tearlach
Hutcheson, manager of Landmark's Inwood Theatre in Dallas. ``I get
upset when I go to a movie and have to sit through a half-dozen
trailers, along with the commercials they play before them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the Inwood has been doing sellout business
with The Blair Witch Project, an offbeat horror movie that was
hyped with some of the year's best teasers. Witch's teasers went in
steps: The first one featured a stark title card about the
disappearance of three student filmmakers in 1994, followed by the
tear-streaked eyes of one of the filmmakers filming a terrified
apology to her parents and her crew's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The second featured outtakes from what looked like documentary
footage, followed by a screaming woman running through the woods.
The third featured quotes from many of the glowing reviews of the
film.
</P>
<P>
   As striking as Witch's trailers are, though, Hutcheson says that
they're not the reason the film is a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trailers themselves don't bring people in,'' he says.
``Connected with something else, they bring people in. In this
case, there was a lot about the movie on the Internet, and that
combined with the teasers helped bring in a younger audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has become one of the best places to see trailers,
letting movie buffs watch them whenever they want instead of being
at the mercy of theater managers and television-commercial
programmers. Most studios include trailers on their official Web
sites, and a rudimentary search revealed about a half-dozen sites
devoted at least in part to trailers. The tradeoff for the
convenience is that Web-surfers have to be willing to put up with
poor sound and resolution, and often the trailer image is only
slightly larger than a postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The increased accessibility of trailers has made more movie
buffs sensitive to ``spoilers,'' or scenes that reveal too much of
what's in a movie. The trailer for Arlington Road, for example,
revealed the movie's villain, even though he's portrayed
ambiguously for at least half the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good movies are good stories well told, and that's their
job,'' says Barrett Travis of UA Theatres distributor-relations
branch. ``A good trailer, in my mind, is one that doesn't give away
the whole story.''
</P>
<P>
   Because theaters try to program trailers for target audiences,
some trailers run more infrequently than others. An ``event'' film
such as The Phantom Menace, whose trailer had so much buzz that
fans allegedly paid just to see it and then left before the feature
attraction, or Wild Wild West, is likely to be ubiquitous because
of its crossover appeal. But it might be more difficult to see a
trailer for an African-American-oriented feature like Miramax's
upcoming In Too Deep, or for a gay-oriented feature like Strand
Releasing's upcoming Edge of Seventeen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to the exhibitor,'' says Marcus Hu, co-president of
Strand Releasing. ``We can suggest what we want to run with a
movie, but ultimately it's up to the exhibitor.'' Hu says that
though gay-themed trailers often play before gay-themed movies, he
has seen some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the market,'' he says. ``In Los Angeles, Edge of
Seventeen trailered before 10 Things I Hate About You,'' a teen
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth-Dallas, that kind of cross-genre trailer package
is most likely to occur at the Inwood, a three-screen theater
best-known for offbeat fare. Witch, despite being an independent
film, is an unusual choice for the Inwood, which doesn't normally
show horror movies. That has helped bring in a younger crowd, which
is seeing trailers for films it might not ordinarily see, such as
the upcoming gay-oriented comedy Get Real.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, the Blair Witch audience is responding
more to the jokes in the Get Real trailer than our usual
audience,'' Hutcheson says. ``Whether they'll come back and see the
movie is another matter.''

COMING OUT WITH AN AMERICAN `EDGE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just your typical boy-meets-boy, boy-falls-in-love-with
boy,
boy-experiences-angst-fueled-drama-as-he-comes-out-of-the-closet
story.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. The premise of the new ``Edge of Seventeen''
_ an outcast high-schooler struggles with his own sexuality while
caught in the undertow of the '80s New Wave movement _ is hardly
typical, especially among mainstream (read ``straight'') movies.
But within the realm of gay culture, the teen-age coming-out story
has become almost passe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay literature is full of it,'' says ``Edge'' director David
Moreton. ``But in the movies, I'm not really sure it's been handled
in a way that speaks to, say, Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay-themed independent cinema has dealt with the material
plenty, from feature films such as ``Beautiful Thing,'' ``Wild
Reeds,'' ``Lilies'' and the new-to-video ``Like It Is,'' to short
films like those collected in ``Boys Life 1 &AMP; 2,'' including the
Oscar-winning ``Trevor.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of these films have been imports, and a majority of
them British. Yet another UK effort arrives Aug. 6: ``Get Real,''
an unlikely love story between a young geek and hunky high school
jock. ``Get Real'' should appeal to teens, in spite of its
controversial and undeserved R rating, but it remains decidedly
British.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Edge of Seventeen,'' ``we really wanted to tell a story
that could be very American in its flavor or tone,'' Moreton says.
``We were also big fans of '80s films like ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High'' and the John Hughes movies. We kind of used those
as starting points, sort of retelling those stories from a gay
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge'' centers on 17-year-old Eric (Chris Stafford), a high
school senior who finds himself attracted to an openly gay
co-worker while busing tables at an amusement park restaurant.
Seduced by the androgynous allure of '80s pop music acts like
Bronski Beat, Eric nurtures his new-found individuality with hair
dye and colorful clothing. When he finally ventures to the local
gay bar, he encounters his former boss, a wiseacre lesbian named
Angie (Lea DeLaria). But as Eric experiments with gay dating, what
does all this mean to his companion Maggie? Is she his girlfriend,
or just a girl friend?
</P>
<P>
   The film is based largely on screenwriter Todd Stephens' own
experiences with coming out, but everyone connected with the film
says they feel a kinship with the material.
</P>
<P>
   Moreton claims to relate most to Eric's doomed relationship with
Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of girlfriends when I was younger,'' Moreton
recalls. ``And I think women get hurt in those situations and gay
men kind of hide in those relationships. So for me it was very
important to tell that part of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally my youth,'' says DeLaria, whose outspoken Angie
is one of the film's most endearing characters. ``I grew up in a
small town, which is the reason I agreed to do the film. I mean the
last thing I wanted to do was another lesbian role, but after
reading the script I felt like that part was practically written
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But for 21-year-old Stafford, Eric was a character he had to get
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little more shy and tended more for the mainstream,''
Stafford says. ``Not that I necessarily wanted to dye my hair and
wear outrageous clothing or get anything pierced _ I didn't _
nonetheless, if I'd wanted to, I probably wouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford says Eric's courage drew him to the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, Eric did come to grips with who he was at 17 and in
high school, which is a hell of a feat,'' Stafford says. ``However,
today you have kids that are very out in high school, and that
certainly was not the case for Eric. I mean it was the '80s _ he
wasn't carrying around a pride flag on his backpack walking through
the halls of school.''
</P>
<P>
   And the filmmakers go to great pains to show that Eric's coming
out isn't all cocktails and kisses. As Ellen DeGeneres said on her
show, ``No one gives you a cake that says, `Good for you, you're
gay.' '' Eric encounters a lot of hurdles _ lousy one-night stands,
romantic turmoil with his would-be girlfriend, parental
disapproval, and taunting from classmates. But he also overcomes
his challenges without wallowing in self-loathing or suicidal
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message Moreton says he hopes gay youth will embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you go through it, you're different,'' Moreton says. ``I
think we say that coming out doesn't make life rosy and perfect.
You lose things. You lose friends. You lose family perhaps. But in
the balance, it's much better than living a lie.''

CHINA BANS BUDDHIST LAW MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China intensified its offensive against the Buddhist
Law spiritual movement Thursday, announcing a ban on the
organization and unleashing a barrage of charges against its
founder that revealed how seriously the government takes the sect
as a challenge to its rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ban on the group, known in Chinese as Falun
Gong, had been rumored since the police rounded up more than 100
leaders of the sect in several Chinese cities earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the ferocity of Beijing's campaign, aimed at a group of
mainly middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing
exercises and meditation, suggests that it regards Falun Gong as
more than a movement of physical and moral uplift. At a time when
China's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising, officials
here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous
political force.
</P>
<P>
   After Beijing handed down its edict Thursday afternoon, it began
an extraordinary public-relations assault on the group and its
founder, Li Hongzhi, through state-run television and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Civil Affairs accused Falun Gong of ``inciting
and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability.'' In
an editorial scheduled for publication on Friday, the Communist
Party newspaper People's Daily said Li was pursuing a hidden
political agenda that posed a ``massive threat'' to Chinese
society.
</P>
<P>
   State media also accused Li of misleading followers about his
birth date, so that he could claim to be a reincarnation of
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism and of accepting payments for
supposedly miraculous cures.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk who left China for the
United States last year, fashioned his sect from an eclectic blend
of traditional breathing exercises, as well as elements of Buddhism
and Taoism. His followers say they disavow politics and embrace
Li's teachings for their physical and spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   But Falun Gong deeply unsettled China's rulers when 10,000 of
its adherents materialized on April 25 in front of the compound
that houses President Jiang Zemin and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, held to demand official recognition for the group,
demonstrated that this obscure spiritual sect was in fact a highly
organized movement with an international network capable of
mobilizing thousands of people and putting them under the noses of
China's top leaders without a whisper of warning.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the detentions spread this week, thousands of Falun
Gong followers massed in front of government offices in Dalian,
Guangzhou and 28 other cities to protest the government's
crackdown, according to members of the group and a human rights
organization in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The wall-to-wall coverage of the ban in the state-run media
underscores that the government is determined to stamp out Falun
Gong. But with a large and rapidly growing membership _ estimates
range from the government's figure of 2 million to the group's
claim of 100 million followers worldwide _ a fluid structure, and
an appreciation of the power of the Internet to pass information,
Falun Gong could prove an elusive quarry for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to make us stronger,'' said Sophie Xiao,
a spokeswoman for Falun Gong in Hong Kong. ``People are not
simple-minded. Educated people will hear about this group and check
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of protests following Thursday's
announcement. Late Thursday afternoon, hundreds of police and
troops still circled Zhongnanhai, the leaders' compound, which has
been a fortress since the crackdown began on Monday night. The
police continued to stop traffic on the western edge of the
complex, where Falun Gong members held their rally in April.
</P>
<P>
   A former Chinese official said police in Beijing had released
several hundred people _ most of them women _ who had been detained
as they massed near Zhongnanhai on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials were clearly concerned about how the ban would
be received abroad. Shortly before the announcement was made
public, a high-ranking government official briefed foreign
correspondents here on why the government felt it necessary to take
such Draconian action.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Beijing
had moved against Falun Gong because of ``the danger it posed to
our country and our people. Any responsible government would do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   He said members of the group had harassed government offices and
pro-Beijing news organizations. And he said the government had
evidence that Li had been in Beijing for the three days prior to
the April rally in front of Zhongnanhai. Li, he said, had been
instrumental in planning it.
</P>
<P>
   The strident tone and sheer volume of the denunciations of Falun
Gong baffled some experts in Chinese politics. Why, they asked,
would the government pour so much energy into fighting a group
which, by its estimates, has 2 million members _ far fewer than the
100 million the group claims?
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, a few months ago hardly anyone had heard of it, and
no one was saying it was a threat to the state,'' said one
political scholar in Beijing, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``I think the party leaders felt personally insulted by the Falun
Gong protest. It made them look like fools.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A former government official said Thursday that the unexpected
demonstration last April particularly unnerved Jiang. In briefings
with government officials earlier this week, this person said, a
senior leader quoted Jiang as harshly criticizing Li and the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said there were plenty of reasons for Beijing to worry
about this kind of group. With its mixture of martial arts and
mysticism, Falun Gong appeals to people who have felt adrift since
Deng Xioaping began reforming the Chinese economy and relaxing
social controls in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Popular groups like Falun Gong played a profoundly disruptive
role in the final decades of the last imperial dynasty. And as the
communist government approaches the 50th anniversary of its rule,
on Oct. 1, China's economic engine is sputtering. With China
embarking on an ambitious campaign to overhaul its state sector _
one that has already resulting in huge layoffs _ Beijing is bracing

   Signs that the government may feel vulnerable abounded in the
flood of official denunciations Thursday.

   ``We must fully recognize the massive threat that the rampant
spread of the Falun Gong organization is to the party, government,

   In a 70-minute documentary that has been rerun almost nonstop
Thursday on state television, Falun Gong was portrayed as a
pernicious cult that leads members to mental instability, madness,

PLEASING TEASERS AND TRASHY TRAILERS
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanies FILM-TRAILERS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes a good trailer? Well, it should make you want to see
the movie without making you feel like you've already seen the
movie. Here are some of the best and worst trailers and teasers of
1999:
</P>
<P>
   THE BEST
</P>
<P>
   1. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me: The original teaser
for this presented itself as a preview for the Star Wars sequel
until Mike Myers' Dr. Evil whirled around in a chair, saying, ``You
were expecting someone else?'' It ended with a great tag line: ``If
you see only one movie this summer, see Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace. But if you see two, see Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   2. The Blair Witch Project: The first of the movie's three
teasers, featuring Heather Donahue's tear-stained eyes as she
recorded a terrified apology to her crew's parents, is almost as
unsettling as the movie itself.
</P>
<P>
   3. Eyes Wide Shut: Set to the tune of Chris Isaak's Baby Did a
Bad Thing, this featured Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in
increasingly provocative situations that were intriguing, even
though they revealed almost nothing about the film's plot.
</P>
<P>
   4. Summer of Sam: The use of increasingly flashy editing, '70s
culture and The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again made for a preview
that was much more coherent than the movie.
</P>
<P>
   5. South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut: After a pompous
announcement about the latest advance in animation, we saw a goofy
dance number from Park's noxious Eric Cartman. It was enough to
make fans of the TV show break into applause.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORST
</P>
<P>
   1. Arlington Road: The epitome of a preview telling you far too
much about a movie, removing important elements of ambiguity. To
make matters worse, the movie's release was delayed twice, giving
the trailer that much more time to spoil things.
</P>
<P>
   2. Instinct: The movie was no great shakes, but the trailer made
it look like The Silence of the Apes, with Anthony Hopkins doing
another one of his patented madman numbers.
</P>
<P>
   3. A Midsummer Night's Dream: Once you saw Calista Flockhart
making an Ally McBeal face, you knew this wouldn't exactly be
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Mod Squad: Trying to create a preview for this movie must
have been a no-win situation, considering that the movie was a bad
idea and badly miscast. Claire Danes as a cop?
</P>
<P>
   5. True Crime: Once reporter Clint Eastwood wrote the note ``BLV
JC'' when a prisoner told him he believed in Jesus Christ, it was
obvious that this was a strong candidate for Most Absurd Movie of
the Year.

schoolchildren have relied on the federal government for certain

 &HT;    MEXICAN JUDGE THROWS U.S. CASE AGAINST ALLEGED DRUG KINGPIN INTO
QUESTION
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY The United States' attempts to try the suspected
kingpin of the world's largest methamphetamine ring were thrown
into jeopardy this week when a Mexican judge blocked the suspect's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe methamphetamine, or ``speed,'' is one of the
fastest-growing drug problems in the United States. American
anti-drug officials believe that Luis Amezcua leads a gang that has
smuggled precursor chemicals into the United States, mixed them
into speed in secret labs in California and distributed the drug
throughout the United States, especially Texas and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Amezcua, who was detained earlier this year in Mexico, could be
released as soon as next month if Mexican prosecutors cooperating
with the United States do not appeal the decision. Mexican
authorities confirmed Thursday that they are appealing and also
said they may have the option of re-arresting Amezcua on other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in the worst case scenario, we lose the appeal, Mexican
authorities have the ability to try (Luis Amezcua) in Mexico on
crimes committed abroad. So in our opinion he won't be set free,''
said Assistant Attorney General for International Affairs Eduardo
Ibarrola at a news conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Amezcua currently faces no charges in Mexico, Ibarrola
said the U.S. extradition request contains evidence of crimes in
the United States that could form the basis of a case that Amezcua
has engaged in criminal activity abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition requests are a frequent source of tension between
the United States and Mexico, especially when they involve
suspected Mexican drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has fruitlessly tried to extradite a number of
alleged drug lords, including Luis Amezcua and his brother, Jesus,
who have both been indicted by U.S. prosecutors in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mexican judges cleared the Amezcua brothers on
money-laundering charges. Earlier this year, U.S. officials were
pleased that Mexican authorities would seek the brothers'
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   In May, however, a judge issued an injunction against the
request to ship Jesus to the United States for trial. The judge
argued that penalties for Amezcua's accused crimes would be harsher
than those in Mexico, including the possibility of a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and the United States have an extradition treaty, but
Mexican judges frequently have issued rulings that extradition
requests would violate the constitutional rights of Mexican
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Luis Amezcua's case, the judge questioned the language of the
extradition treaty and suggested that a statute of limitations had
expired in the U.S. charges against Amezcua.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarrola said that Mexican prosecutors share U.S. prosecutors'
frustration with judges' decisions in many extradition requests. He
said Mexican prosecutors have been working to sharpen the arguments
of their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Other suspected drug lords who have received injunctions against
extradition to the United States include Oscar Malherbe, alleged
leader of a cocaine-smuggling ring known as the Gulf of Mexico
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also requested the extradition of a United
States national, Gilberto Salinas of Texas, who is believed to be a
key player in a cocaine-trafficking ring based in Cancun, Mexico,
and Ciudad Juarez, on the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas has been charged in Mexico. Officials here say he must
first stand trial in Mexico before he can be extradited.

 Amazon.com Becomes a New Outlet for Indie Films  
 `Brazil,' Fully Loaded on Three Discs 
New Releases of Video Cassettes: Reviews by New York Times
Critics  
 
(yn) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMAZON.COM BECOMES A NEW OUTLET FOR INDIE FILMS: For moviemakers
who can't find distribution for their work, a lifeline of sorts has
been thrown by the on-line retailer Amazon.com. Abide by a few
regulations, and a film that might have played a festival or two
but was never bought, or a student film, or a pick-up production
financed by friend, parent and credit card could be just as
available as ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, which calls its new program Amazon.com Advantage for
Video, began doing the same thing last year for unpublished books.
Instructions for filmmakers interested in the program are provided
at www.amazon.com/advantage. Basically, one submits a tape or disk
for a review of production quality (too raw is not acceptable) and
appropriateness of content for children. If the production is
accepted (the process takes one to two weeks), Amazon will order a
``conservative number'' (usually between two and five copies) and
store them in its warehouse. The title is then listed by genre with
all the other movies.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers get no money up front. They set their own list price
and receive 45 percent of the proceeds after the copies are sold.
In return, Amazon provides a promotional display page for the
title, which can include a description, photographs, reviews and
the like.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, the filmmaker must own all distribution rights
and put a UPC (uniform price code) or ISBN (international standard
book numbering) sticker on the product. Instructions on how to go
about that are also provided at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Zoi, director of Amazon's Advantage programs, said that
there had been several hundred applications since the service was
announced on July 8. The first two titles on line are ``Cameras on
Campus,'' five shorts by film students at the University of
Southern California, and ``There's No Such Thing as a Chanukah
Bush, Sandy Goldstein,'' an Emmy-award winning film that did fine
on television but has no video distribution. Customers can add
their own reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the first two videos carry ratings, nor will other
Advantage titles because they probably won't have been evaluated by
the Motion Picture Association of America. Amazon.com listings
normally range all the way to NC-17 and so, if informally, will
Advantage submissions. If a film is unsuitable for children, Ms.
Zoi said, it will be so stated on the display page.
</P>
<P>
   `BRAZIL,' FULLY LOADED ON THREE DISCS: New DVD releases
continually pride themselves on a profusion of extra features, but
can anybody top the Criterion Collection's new edition of Terry
Gilliam's ``Brazil,'' released last week by Home Vision?
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, discs hold a lot of information and this release
requires three of them. On the first is Gilliam's 142-minute,
finally approved version of his futuristic, extremely black comedy
exactly the way he wanted it, along with a ``shot-by-shot''
director's commentary.
</P>
<P>
   The second disc packs in all manner of documentaries and
information about the film and Gilliam's battles with Universal
over its length and efforts to lighten up the ending. The third
disc has the film in the ``love-conquers-all'' version, with all
the changes he refused to make. That's a lot of ``Brazil'' and the
price is $59.95.

   Surviving near-fatal gunshot wounds inflicted by his
double-crossing partner, a career criminal named Porter (Mel
Gibson, left) sets out to recover the $70,000 stolen from him and
gain a measure of vengeance. On the other side of the question is
the Outfit, a criminal organization that rules a dank no man's land
that might be called Film Noir Manque. Shackled to ludicrous,
hard-boiled dialogue, Gibson makes the guttural best of it in a
film that regards itself as a hip descendant of ``Pulp Fiction''
but, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, that is ``utterly
devoid of narrative ingenuity and visual and dramatic flair.'' &QL;

   ``I'm gonna build a rocket like Sputnik!'' says Homer Hickham
(Jake Gyllenhaal), a not inconsiderable goal circa 1957 for a high
school boy from a West Virginia coal mining town _ or anybody else.
But in the Horatio Alger-Norman Rockwell school of movie making,
anything is possible and soon Homer and his pals are sending tiny
handmade missiles looping into the skies to the cheers of
townspeople ready to dive for cover at every unpredictable
maneuver. Only Homer's father (Chris Cooper), a hard-driving mining
man, holds fast to his determination that the boy follow him down
the shaft in an earnest film that ``has a way of seeming too good
to be true'' (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LA SENTINELLE

   1992. Fox Lorber. $89.98. 144 minutes. French with English

<P>
   Proving that Americans have no monopoly on conspiracy theories,
the French director Arnaud Desplechin concocts what might be called
a medical thriller about a student, Mathias (Emmanuel Salinger),
who investigates the origins of a shrunken head that mysteriously
shows up in his luggage. From there the story grows into an
examination of Cold War mentality and makes analogies to the
tangled relationships between Mathias and his associates. If the
thriller aspects don't add up, ``the film is still an absorbing,
psychologically resonant portrait of French student life''
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REACH THE ROCK
</P>
<P>
   1998. Universal. $99.36. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

   Release date: July 27.
</P>
<P>
   The night before his former girlfriend, daughter of the richest
man in a small Illinois town, moves to New York, Robin (Alessandro
Nivola) deliberately gets himself locked up for vandalism and other
petty crimes that annoy the police sergeant (William Sadler), who
is no friend of Robin's. The idea is to have the girlfriend (Brooke
Langton) come to bail him out, which she finally does while
bringing along some good advice, too, in ``an intriguing but
slightly off-balance film written by John Hughes and directed by
his 29-year-old protege, William Ryan'' (Anita Gates). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions:
</P>
<P>
   THE INDOMITABLE TEDDY ROOSEVELT
</P>
<P>
   1986. Image. Videocassette, $19.98; DVD, $24.98. 95 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed at locations in seven states, Harrison Engle's docudrama
includes 35-millimeter material from Roosevelt's own archive as
well as dramatic re-creations of events in the life of the 26th
president. George C. Scott narrates, and the music of John Philip
Sousa provides the oompahs. ``It is nice to see a program about
American history,'' John Corry wrote in The New York Times. ``It is
a bonus when it turns out to be well done.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMORROW
</P>
<P>
   1972. Anchor Bay. $14.98. 102 minutes. PG.
</P>
<P>
   Release date: July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a William Faulkner story and written by Horton Foote,
Joseph Anthony's film about a Mississippi sawmill worker (Robert
Duvall) who comes to the aid of a pregnant woman (Olga Bellin) has
been out of video distribution for a while.
</P>
<P>
   THE TRAVELING PLAYERS (O Thiassos)
</P>
<P>
   1976. New Yorker. $89.98. 230 minutes. Greek with English
subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1939 and ending in 1952, Theodoros Angelopoulos'
complex film attempts to tell the story of modern Greece through
the wanderings of an unskilled band of actors. It is a film of
``startling beauty and originality _ that is for the first two
hours or so,'' Richard Eder wrote in The New York Times. The
problem is that it lasts almost four hours, but this is video,
where several sittings are possible, making for an interesting
experience and especially so in light of Angelopoulos' most recent
film, ``Eternity and a Day,'' which opened in theaters in May.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first it struck an off-key chord.
</P>
<P>
   There on television was Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Orrin Hatch, one of the chamber's most conservative leaders and a
Republican presidential hopeful, paying homage to the family values
and inner strength of Edward Kennedy, one of the Senate's most
liberal legislators.
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkable thing is that Hatch clearly meant it.
</P>
<P>
   This was a rare moment of comity in today's nasty partisan
atmosphere, which has poisoned not only presidential politics but
every effort to pass worthy domestic legislation on Capitol Hill.
Hatch and Kennedy are dedicated public servants who are ideological
and behavioral opposites _ but rather good friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, R-Idaho, said he greatly admired the way Kennedy, D-Mass,
had been an active, responsible surrogate parent the past three
decades to the fatherless John F. Kennedy Jr., his sister Caroline
and the children of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. ``He's a good family
man,'' Hatch declared.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch was careful not to let this chummy bipartisan sentiment
get too far out of hand. ``I came to the Senate principally to
fight Ted Kennedy and I spend a lot of time doing that,'' he
observed pointedly. ``He fights for what he believes. Sometimes I
think,`how can he believe that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hatch deliberately stepped forward to praise Uncle
Ted at a terrible time _ after the deaths of JFK Jr., his wife
Carolyn and her sister Lauren Bessette _ when the Kennedy patriarch
was once again sadly in charge of consoling his large family and
organizing a funeral. ``Everybody (in the family) has looked to
Ted,'' Hatch said. ``I have a great admiration for him.''
</P>
<P>
   This was very decent and honorable of Hatch. As fellow members
of the Judiciary Committee, he and Kennedy have often worked
together on domestic measures such as those aimed at helping young
mothers by establishing standards for day care centers and helping
AIDS sufferers by providing support for research. ``We get a big
kick out of each other,'' Hatch smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, a teetotaling Mormon, had the courage to lecture Kennedy
about excessive drinking after the 1991 late-night partying in Palm
Beach, Fla., that led to a woman's charge of rape on the family
estate against a Kennedy nephew, William Kennedy Smith. Smith was
acquitted, and by most accounts Kennedy took Hatch's well-meaning
advice seriously.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying Victoria Reggie a year later, Kennedy seems to
have considerably cleaned up his personal act and grown closer to
Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet perhaps it was not politically wise for a conservative
seeking the GOP presidential nomination to remind right-wing
activists who dominate the primaries that he has strayed from the
rigid confines of party orthodoxy. When Hatch announced his
candidacy, in fact, spokesmen for the unforgiving right promptly
hooted that his penchant for deal-making made him insufficiently
loyal to their causes.
</P>
<P>
   This is silly, but then politics is often silly.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is plenty conservative by any rational standard. Anyone
who remembers his arrogant dismissal of Anita Hill's claims of
sexual harassment during the 1991 Senate hearings on Clarence
Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court is not going to be
confused about his basic philosophical orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's belated entry in the White House sweepstakes has not
exactly taken the country by storm. He is the first choice of only
1 percent of GOP voters in a Pew Research Center poll this week,
tied at the bottom of the list with former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander and only 1 percent behind anti-abortion zealot Gary
Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch himself acknowledges that ``a lot of people tell me I'm
nuts. Why would I do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Ego aside, the underlying answer is that the pending coronation
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush as the next Republican nominee strikes
many partisans as just too easy, too preordained. Hatch is
campaigning against the power of what he calls the party's ``elite
establishment'' to anoint a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dubious strategy. But none of the other candidates has
caught the public fancy. Hatch wants to be standing there to pick
up the pieces in case Bush falters.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch stresses his 23 years of experience in the Senate and says
immodestly that he feels more qualified to be president than his
GOP rivals, including Bush. This might work if we elected
presidents on the basis of their political experience and proven
wisdom in public policy. But we don't.
</P>
<P>
   We pick guys we like. Personality matters. Witty, wry John F.
Kennedy over dour Vice President Richard Nixon. Smiling Jimmy
Carter over clumsy Gerald Ford. Sunny Ronald Reagan over a
no-longer-smiling Carter. Earnest George Bush over dopey Michael
Dukakis. Energetic, youthful Bill Clinton over a tired Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hatch more likable than Bush? That will take some pondering,
but his affection for Kennedy is an unexpectedly interesting
dimension.

   How green is your Volvo? Its manufacturer is happy to tell you,
in its recently published Environmental Product Declaration, a
cradle-to-grave look at the pollution generated by the
manufacturing, use and eventual dismantling of its S80 luxury
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our judgment that consumers have a right to this kind of
information,'' said Hans-Olov Olsson, president and chief executive
of Volvo Cars of North America. ``It lets people know about the
environmental processes that are ongoing within the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Volvo's categories are familiar, like exhaust emissions
(the company gives itself various scores from 9 to 90 percent,
depending on pollutant) and parts recyclability (50 to 100
percent). But the product declaration also looks at a process not
often discussed _ the actual manufacturing of the car in Torslanda,
Sweden _ and it admits there is room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volvo has made big gains in cleaning up emissions from
the paint shop, generally the dirtiest part of any car plant (Volvo
gave itself a 91 percent score), and has little material waste (86
percent), it scolds itself for using too much energy to build the
S80 (46 percent).
</P>
<P>
   No other auto company offers such a holistic look at the
environmental impact of its operations, but all of them care about
the image they project. So they promote everything from
air-conditioning refrigerants free of chlorofluorocarbons to brake
pedals made from recycled tires.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that when the Council on Economic
Priorities, a nonprofit research institution in New York that
advocates responsible corporate behavior, rated 56 U.S. auto
plants, there was an outcry from the carmakers that rated poorly.
Mitsubishi came in last of eight manufacturers in the council's
reckoning, with Honda next to last. The top scorer in the weighted
ratings was DaimlerChrysler, followed, in descending order, by
General Motors, BMW, Ford, Nissan and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was particularly wounded, since it plans soon to introduce
the Insight, a very clean, fuel-efficient hybrid-power car and its
president, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, said last year that the company was
willing to put ``everything on the table'' to fight global warming
and reduce greenhouse gases. Mitsubishi, which had recently
successfully negotiated an end to a long-running boycott organized
by the Rainforest Action Network over the company's forestry
operations, and which offers several cars with excellent fuel
economy, saw the bad publicity as not only unfair, but also
particularly ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the mood was more sanguine at DaimlerChrysler,
the top-scoring company. James Carlson, director of pollution
prevention and remediation, said that the results were ``a positive
acknowledgment that we've been pro-active in dealing with plant
environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Honda and Mitsubishi questioned the process by which the
Council on Economic Priorities had scored the companies. Only 70
percent of the score was derived from the companies' actual
environmental performance; 10 percent was based on an evaluation of
their annual environmental reports. (Only Nissan failed to publish
one.) The other 20 percent came from a ranking of environmental
management systems. Honda and Mitsubishi were penalized for failing
to return the council's detailed questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fundamentally disagree with CEP's conclusions, which are,
frankly, unsupportable,'' said Roger Lambert, senior manager of
company communications for Honda. ``They said they downgraded us
because we didn't complete their survey form, but we shared with
them extensive information that showed that even as our plants in
Marysville and East Liberty, Ohio, were increasing production by 30
percent from 1994 to 1997, they were also decreasing per-unit
chemical emissions by 71 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said that starting in 1990, Honda was an ``aggressive''
participant in an Environmental Protection Agency program to reduce
emissions of 33 chemicals by 50 percent over five years. The East
Liberty plant, he said, was the first in the nation to switch to
cleaner water-based paint, in 1989, and was the first to use
returnable containers for parts delivery. Honda also pioneered the
salvage of auto-body stamping scrap for use in brake and engine
parts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Council on Economic Priorities, Romi Gottfrid, an
environmental research associate who was a principal author of the
report, disagreed with Honda about the data the company provided.
``They sent us nothing,'' she said. ``We didn't even get the glossy
public relations handouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi accused the council of misreading toxic-emissions
data that manufacturers report annually. A spokeswoman, Gael
O'Brien, said: ``Mitsubishi performs all functions such as
stamping, welding, painting and assembly in one facility, while
most other automakers have separate sites for these operations. And
those other facilities report their emissions separately.'' She
added that the council had failed to give the company full credit
for recycling. ``Less than 6 percent of the emissions we generate
are actually released,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Judged solely on its generation of pollutants, as measured by
1996 toxic-emissions data, the Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Ill., is
unquestionably the nation's dirtiest, producing 21.6 pounds of
toxic chemicals per vehicle. But EPA data indicate that Mitsubishi
has an 85 percent recycling and recovery rate. And the agency
offers caveats about drawing conclusions from raw data.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Mitsubishi's complaints, Ms. Gottfrid said the
council stressed reducing pollution at the source. In response to a
letter from Mitsubishi, the council said, ``Controlling pollution
is the old way of looking at the problem, versus the new way, which
is pollution prevention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If reports like the Council on Economic Priorities' are a stick
to goad corporations into building cleaner plants, the voluntary
principles outlined by another group, the Council for
Environmentally Responsible Economies, are a carrot to move them
forward gently. Among auto companies, only General Motors is a
signatory, but corporations outside the industry, including
Polaroid and the Body Shop, have signed on. The nonspecific
principles call on manufacturers to, among other things, ``reduce
and where possible eliminate waste through source reduction and
recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the public care about dirty auto plants? The 1999 edition
of ``The Green Guide to Cars and Trucks'' by John DeCicco and
Martin Thomas (American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy,
$8.95) notes, ``Most of the environmental impact associated with
motor vehicles occurs when they are used.'' Manufacturing accounts
for 9 percent of the energy used by a typical car, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Economic Priorities has tried to bring plant
emissions to the forefront by enlisting a public relations firm and
providing bulk copies of postcards that are pre-addressed to the
president of Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing, Michino Yamashita.
``Your Normal facility yields four times the toxic emissions of the
best auto manufacturer in the USA,'' the card says.
</P>
<P>
   Bad publicity hurts, but do cleaner companies benefit from high
scores? ``Consumers aren't yet demanding environmentally friendly
products, and they're definitely not prepared to pay for them,''
Olsson of Volvo conceded.

AT THE MOVIES: WES CRAVEN; RENE RUSSO; `INSPECTOR GADGET' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ A funny thing happened to Wes Craven 15 years ago.
Craven has a master's degree in philosophy, taught at a college and
plays classical guitar, but in 1984 he put most of that aside and
all but reinvented the horror film genre with ``A Nightmare on Elm
Street.'' The heart became not a repository of warm feelings but a
prop to be slashed and splattered across his movie sets, as he went
on to direct, among other classic horror movies, ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven became so well known in the newly energized genre that
his name has become synonymous with gory, irreverent movies, which
only underscores why it was so difficult for him to get a studio to
back his latest movie, ``Music of the Heart.'' The film, based on a
true story, is about a single mother who moves to East Harlem to
teach children how to play the violin.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, to be released by Miramax in the fall, stars Meryl
Streep as Roberta Guaspari, the teacher. Also in the film are
Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn and Cloris Leachman. The original story
was told in a documentary, ``Small Wonders.'' And in the film drama
there is no blood, no supernatural murders, no screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a classic case of someone getting pigeonholed very quickly
in their careers,'' said Craven, in a telephone interview from the
set of his next movie, ``Scream 3.'' ``I'd made it known to a lot
of studios that I was interested in other projects like this one,
but I couldn't get anything off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he finally got his chance to direct a non-horror movie
when he was approached by Harvey Weinstein of Miramax, who said, as
Craven recalled, ``I hear you want to make one of those petticoat
movies.'' By that he meant a serious drama, and they eventually cut
a deal for Craven to do three movies, perhaps one or two of which
will be horror films. The key, Craven said, was re-exploring more
cerebral parts of his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I'd sort of come home,'' Craven said. ``I always
felt like I was so confined in the horror genre. It felt good to
stretch. I was ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie was not easy to make. Initially, Madonna was
signed to play the lead role, but that fell through because of
``creative differences,'' Craven said. He said he then had to
struggle to persuade Ms. Streep to take the part and succeeded only
by demonstrating how passionate he was about the story.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was pleased with how the movie ended up looking,
and that he felt satisfied he had expanded his image and his
repertory. But he admitted that he feared that a failure could harm
his prospects of doing more such pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it was a modest fear,'' Craven said. ``It was a
huge fear.''
</P>
<P>
   However the film does at the box office, Craven said he felt he
would be connecting with a different sort of audience than his
films usually draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for people who have had their hearts broken,'' said
Craven, adding that he meant it figuratively, not literally.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   45 and Naked
</P>
<P>
   There is a moment in ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' a remake of
the steamy 1968 suspense movie, that speaks volumes about what the
filmmakers did differently this time around. Yes, there are obvious
changes, like the background of Thomas Crown _ here he's a
self-made Scotsman instead of a Boston Brahmin _ and the fact that
the heist involves art from a museum rather than cash from a bank.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the bigger if subtler shifts is hinted at in an
exchange when the lead character, played by Rene Russo, storms into
the bedroom of Crown, played by Pierce Brosnan, and encounters a
sultry young beauty in a black leather sheath, played by fashion
model Esther Canadas. The young beauty shoots her a contemptuous,
condescending look, but the one who remains in the room, and wins
Crown's heart, is Ms. Russo's character.
</P>
<P>
   In a way the real loser in this metaphorical moment is an old
but durable Hollywood cliche: that the femme fatale is always a
young babe. Ms. Russo is 45 and the mother of a 6-year-old girl.
But in the film, which is scheduled for release Aug. 6, she does
nude love scenes, dances provocatively in a gown that is all but
invisible and is shown sunbathing while wearing a hat and a grin.
</P>
<P>
   In middle age, she pulls off a part that in the original film 30
years ago was played by a hot young starlet named Faye Dunaway
(who, in the remake, plays a smirking therapist), opposite Steve
McQueen. This new casting is, to put it mildly, a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry, for all its self-congratulatory rhetoric
about its adaptability and willingness to experiment and change,
has clung tenaciously to the idea that sexy roles are for 20-ish
women, and that ``older'' women play moms or teachers or burnt-out
types. Ms. Russo, who plays an ultra-confident insurance inspector,
Catherine Banning, in this cat-and-mouse drama, is not only overtly
sexy and middle aged, but she gets the (slightly younger) guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is really so conventional,'' said Ms. Russo, a
onetime model who now often plays comic roles, as she did in ``Get
Shorty.'' ``I'm so tired of the double standard, where an older man
can be with a younger woman, but you can't have an older woman win
the younger guy, ever. I just wish we could mix it up a little more
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russo said the real issue in making the movie was less her
age than her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio was concerned because they didn't think I had a
sexy enough image,'' she said. ``I know what I have, and I know I'm
not an actress who leads with her sexuality. When I first met the
director, he said, `I think you've neutered yourself in your
films.'''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the director, John McTiernan, also asked whether
her religious beliefs precluded her from doing nude scenes. (Ms.
Russo is outspoken about her Christianity.) She said that she felt
no religious impediments, just her own personal sense of modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt less is more,'' she said. ``That's what I
like. And I said I wasn't going to sit on top of Pierce Brosnan
doing it. But I've done love scenes and I didn't feel uncomfortable
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``When I'm nervous, I lead with humor. And I couldn't
do that. I had to stop a couple of times while we were filming and
just say, `Hey, I'm nude,' and collect myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Costly Gadgets
</P>
<P>
   Making children's movies is not what it used to be. Such films
have always required elements like deft storytelling, a touch of
humor and plenty of visual interest. But the bar has risen higher
and higher for this lucrative niche of the market, a fact
underscored by the latest entry, ``Inspector Gadget,'' released by
Disney on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action movie, which stars Matthew Broderick, Rupert
Everett, Joely Fisher and Michelle Trachtenberg, is based on the
animated television series of the same name. The cartoon followed
the good-natured antics of a security officer who, after suffering
an accident, is rebuilt with 14,000 handy devices stuffed into his
body.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a prequel, showing how he began his second career
as a human Swiss army knife, and how he protects the world from the
evil Sanford Scolex.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple perhaps, but Jorden Kerner, one of the producers,
said that even a young audience was so demanding that hugely
expensive computerized special effects were required to make
Inspector Gadget's devices look convincing but not, as he put it,
``icky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are much more sophisticated these days,'' said Kerner,
who has also produced ``George of the Jungle,'' ``The Mighty
Ducks'' and ``Fried Green Tomatoes.'' ``They tend to poke fun at
everything they are supposed to revere. And in a movie like this
they want the special effects. But the guy can't be a freak. He
can't be grotesque.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, the movie cost about $80 million, a hefty
price tag for a PG rated movie. But, Kerner said, there was little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used techniques that weren't available even two years
ago,'' he said. ``But to make something like this work, it has to
be a special-effects movie that kids don't experience as a
special-effects movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Inspector Gadget has an arm that can stretch and stretch
and stretch. A helicopter rotor pops out of the top of his head for
quick getaways, and he can run in great leaps on giant legs. And,
in another sign of the times, he has to have a sly edge, with lots
of references to popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, Kerner said, has references to everything from
``Mission: Impossible'' and ``The Lion King,'' to ``Roots'' and
12-step drug rehabilitation programs. Some of references are for
adults and some for the children that will have to see the movie
over and over for it to earn a big profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the kid movies we have made have required more
slyness,'' Kerner said. ``That's what the audience generally
wants.''

its own citizens. The decision can set alleged drug lord Luis
Amezcua free if an appeal fails or Mexican authorities fail to

   F22 _ WASHINGTON _ The F-22, a superstealth plane designed to
replace the F-15, is the oldest plane in development. The total
cost of the F-22 program is now estimated at around $62 billion.
Some critics say the plane is unnecessary considering the change in
geopolitical realities, and that the U.S. is in an arms war with
itself. The House vote may be delayed since the taxcut vote was

since the late 1970s, the ARHC will have cost about $20 million _
which has been split by the federal government and the state of

unique facility, which is designed to accommodate animal species of

first glance, the proposed Caribbean Basin Parity Trade Initiative
winding its way through Congress looks like small beans. But the
measure, being pushed by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., as well as
President Clinton, merits attention for several reasons. First, the
region is the United States' sixth-largest export market. Second,
the measure would eliminate tariffs on a variety of items including
clothes and watches, meaning the prices for those items in U.S.
stores should go down. And the measure could boost economies in the
Caribbean, which would hopefully stem immigration that has
skyrocketed since last year's hurricanes. We look at the impact of
CBI on the average Joe, and in particular on states such as
Florida, Georgia and Texas. Measure should come up for passage by

Mexico is creeping toward democracy, and elections are hotter than

transparent election systems and rules. The PRI, which still
controls most of Mexican political life, will be tested in July by
opposition candidates who have mustered unprecedented strength,
especially the brash Vicente Fox of Mexico's conservative
opposition. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, on the left, has fallen behind in
polls but is still a likely contender. But first, four candidates
within the ruling PRI will battle for their party's nomination in

education will be on the top of the list. Texas is being touted as
a shining example of improvement, no small feat in the country's
second largest state, which used to rank near the bottom in most
academic indicators. Bush has made education a top priority, from
ending social promotion to increasing accountability and testing to
increasing state funding of public schools. But he's been unable to
deliver on vouchers, and some critics say he cannot take credit for
the recent rise. The seeds of Texas'success waere sown ini the
mid-1980s, with laws to create smaller classes, give more money to
poor school districts and increase academic standards. (Brooks,

HEART PLACE JUST AROUND THE CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 29)  
(rk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are places that speak to the heart, a personal comfort
zone that may be as close as the neighbor's eucalyptus grove or a
beach on the flip side of the world. A high school teacher I know
calls such a place ``querencia,'' a Spanish word meaning a spot
that compels you. And draws you back like a haunting.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably why some people are mountain people and some are
desert people and some have trouble breathing if they get too far
from a large body of water.
</P>
<P>
   For example, my friend Jane who lives in Indiana keeps returning
to Antarctica, although she points out, ``I really hate the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   She went there the first time to see the penguins and the place
simply got to her. ``It is the coldest, highest, driest, windiest
place on earth,'' she says, delightedly.
</P>
<P>
   Not every place of the heart is off the beaten track. One
Californian starts smiling as soon as she hits a certain street in
New York's Lower East Side. It feels like home to her, even though
she'll probably never live there.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the heart doesn't care if its place is beautiful or
plain, glitzy or stone silent. Or that there is no nearby spot to
get good coffee. It's an individual appeal. Something is whispering
``sit down and stay a while,'' but your companion wants to push on
to Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Rebecca Latimer, who lives in Sonoma and has been all
over the world with her diplomat husband, to name her spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lapland, she said, without a pause. It's the region that fans
across the northern parts of Norway, Finland and Sweden. Where you
have to brake for reindeer and the sun never sets in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt an immediate attachment to the place, but no one else
did,'' says Rebecca. ``They all thought it was so primitive, that
everything looked simple, like a child's drawing. It felt wild to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca, who wrote the book ``You're Not Old Until You're 90''
and is in her 90s, says if you keep looking and live long enough
you find at least one place that beckons you like no other and
makes you feel like you belong.
</P>
<P>
   Another of hers is Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrived there on the Orient Express. We had been living in
Finland where in winter it's dark when you go to work and dark when
you come home and people talk about sealing up for the winter, like
we were wasps in a wall. But in Istanbul the sun was so brilliant
it was as if it exploded in front of us. There were flowers and
food and people selling their wares and honking horns. Across the
water was Asia. It was so romantic I could hardly bear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane, the Antarctica lover, was smitten also by Bhutan. ``I had
this overpowering feeling that I was safe there. Maybe it IS
Shangri-la. The entire time I was there I felt that way, like being
in a cradle or something. I actually got heebie-jeebie feelings.
I'm beginning to think we do have past lives and places you are
comfortable with are places you lived in before.''
</P>
<P>
   Writer Alison Lurie has a character in her book ``The Last
Resort'' who thinks that travelers are drawn to landscapes that
match their mind's internal geography. Calm people like clear lakes
or the plains. Active types are drawn to rolling hills and lively
streams. Intense people respond to cliffs and deep ravines.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to a friend who's real keen on the idea that each
person has one spot in the world that wraps itself around us the
first time we see it and feels like home even though we might never
want to buy a condo there.
</P>
<P>
   I said I still wasn't sure where mine is, but it's likely
somewhere between Chicago and Budapest and she said that some of us
are meant to wander the world until we find the place that chooses
us. She made it sound like a religious experience, which it may be
in some ways . Or maybe it's a dream walking. Or a place where your
ancestors or your former incarnation lived.
</P>
<P>
   A Norwegian fellow insisted to Rebecca that there had to be a
Lap somewhere in her ancestry and she said no. She's Swiss and
French but she is absolutely mad for reindeer.

   NORFOLK-SOUTHERN - ATLANTA _ Norfolk Southern acknowledges the
opening of the new, expanded system using Conrail lines between
Atlanta and the Northeast has been marred by delays, congestion and
confusion but pledged to take steps to improve operations before
the summer lull ends. The Norfolk-based railroad, clearly trying to
quell fears of a severe, lasting service tie-up such as ensued in
1997 in the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger, said it had
poured new resources into its operations. Backups and confusion
occurred when NS had trouble combining computer systems, found
difficulty in notifying crews of assignments, and last-minute
changes in service orders by customers. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   SWBELL_ AUSTIN, Texas _ PUC to receive report on how well
Southwestern Bell is linking its computer systems to its rivals' --
a key element to getting the PUC's recommendation that the phone
giant be allowed into the long-distance business. PUC won't take
action today, but rivals are expected to complain that (a) the
tests showed that Bell isn't doing well enough or (b) the test
isn't rigorous enough or (c) both. Southwestern Bell has openly
said it expects to be in the long-distance business by the end of
the year. (Hight, Austin American-Statesman)

   NORFOLK-SOUTHERN - ATLANTA _ Norfolk Southern acknowledges the
opening of the new, expanded system using Conrail lines between
Atlanta and the Northeast has been marred by delays, congestion and
confusion but pledged to take steps to improve operations before
the summer lull ends. The Norfolk-based railroad, clearly trying to
quell fears of a severe, lasting service tie-up such as ensued in
1997 in the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger, said it had
poured new resources into its operations. Backups and confusion
occurred when NS had trouble combining computer systems, found
difficulty in notifying crews of assignments, and last-minute

U.N. CONFIRMATION DELAYED FOR `SECOND LOOK' AT CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (yn) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, has ordered
his staff to take a ``second look'' at the nomination of Richard C.
Holbrooke to be the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations to
determine if the veteran diplomat is fit for the post, the
senator's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ``second look'' by the Mississippi Republican could mean
additional delays in the long-stalled nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And while the senator's staff said again that Lott expected
Holbrooke to be confirmed eventually, the statement Thursday
carried an implicit threat that the senator might still use his
powers as majority leader to kill the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said through a spokesman that he had ordered a thorough
review of Holbrooke's fitness for the U.N. post because he was
``suspicious'' of efforts by other senators and the Clinton
administration to ``rush this nomination through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we being asked to overlook by moving this quickly?''
the spokesman, John Czwartacki, asked. ``It's suspicious. The rush
itself _ this outcry to get him through _ is suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said that despite the review, Lott still believed
that Holbrooke would be confirmed ``eventually, that ultimately we
will have a vote, but first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``second look'' would be broad _ ``it's A to Z'' _
and would include a review both of Holbrooke's leading role in the
Clinton administration's Balkan policy and of the findings of a
Justice Department ethics investigation of Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Thursday that the Senate should end what it
has described as politically inspired delays on the nomination and
vote quickly to confirm Holbrooke, the former American ambassador
to Germany and the architect of the 1995 peace agreement that ended
the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an expeditious vote on Ambassador Holbrooke's
nomination,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the National
Security Council. ``If there's any question about why we need to
have his vast skills at the United Nations, look around the world,
from Iraq to China to Kosovo.'' A spokeswoman for Holbrooke had no
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say that at least four Republican
senators, including Lott, have exercised their right to place
``holds'' to block a final vote on Holbrooke's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott has not confirmed that he is responsible for one of
the holds, officials say that he and Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky blocked a vote on Holbrooke in an effort to persuade the
White House to appoint a conservative Ohio law professor to the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced the nomination of Holbrooke in June of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination was forwarded to the Senate in February. Last
month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the
nomination on a unanimous voice vote.

AN ARRANGEMENT THAT COULD REAP BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson did not attempt to dazzle the League of United
Latin American Citizens with utterances in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore in recent linguistically embarrassing visits
to gatherings of Hispanics, Jackson, who is not running this time,
spoke a different language to the delegates to the recent LULAC
Convention in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As keynote speaker, Jackson went to the convention to talk
``common purpose,'' a language Hispanics and African-Americans
could benefit enormously from if they used it better and more
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Jacksonian exhortation, the great emancipator of
American captives from Middle Eastern and Balkans hellholes spoke
of the need for African-Americans and Hispanics to work together to
accomplish their social, political and economic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the interests of the two groups ``on the human
rights agenda are fundamentally converged.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts were echoed by LULAC President Rick Dovalina, who
called for unity between African-Americans and Hispanics on issues
instead of division by race.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Dovalina achieved unity on a 10-point agreement
between LULAC and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. That agreement
focuses upon voting rights, affirmative action, public education,
the 2000 census, free trade, immigration, media portrayals and
corporate inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter, Jackson said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are aiming at the Hispanic and black markets, but there
is no person of color on their boards. We will begin to challenge
corporate America, company by company, to let your boards and
investment portfolios look like your markets.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not just ear-wash. It is potentially political dynamite.
If African-Americans and Hispanics succeed in overcoming their
mutual distrust and really cooperate to confront the obstacles that
limit their opportunities and dilute their rights, they could
become an irresistible political force.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, however, the two groups cannot allow
themselves to be pitted against each other, as some would do.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis politicians like Bush and some of his fellow
travelers have placed on trying to speak Spanish before certain
audiences promotes, in a not very subtle way, divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is nothing wrong with saying a few words in Spanish to
audiences with large numbers of Spanish speakers. It can be seen as
a matter of common courtesy. The gesture most often will elicit
politely appreciative responses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are Hispanics who interpret that as
patronizing, particularly if it is done by persons who don't speak
Spanish very well. For them a few stumbling phrases in Spanish is
no substitute for policies that would address the needs and
aspirations of the majority of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Some African-Americans see the Republicans' infatuation with
Spanish (which flies in the face of the Republican-dominated
English-only movement) as a way of signalling to Hispanics that the
GOP really wants them and that the party has by and large written
off African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's politically smart. Bush knows that he stands
little chance of corralling very many African-American votes. After
all, there just aren't a heck of a lot of African-Americans who
think like or can identify with the likes of J.C. Watts, Ward
Connerly or Bush's father's appointee to the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also knows that Hispanics are the nation's fastest growing
political constituency. But if he's going to pick up votes there,
he'll have to bring more to the table than his blessing in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have felt compelled to mangle some Spanish just because
Bush does it. And he may want to reconsider the practice, seeing
how he does it about as well as he dances the macarena.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's apparent success in speaking the language of
cooperation to LULAC could help offset Gore's ineptitude at
Spanish. Such a joint effort, if it holds together and gets
results, could make Hispanics less susceptible to the cosmetic
politics of feigned cultural sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   And that could translate into a bigger combined African-American
and Hispanic vote for the Democrats next November.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Rainbow/PUSH/LULAC really lives up to its
potential, both parties would be compelled to make some meaningful
commitments to African-Americans and Hispanics. And that would be
exceedingly good for the campaign and for America.

GERONIMO'S CELL IN FORT SILL IS OPEN FOR TOURS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Some years ago when I lived in Lawton, Okla., Fort Sill
had an underground dungeon where Geronimo was held. Is it still
there? _ L.R., North Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The basement cell where Geronimo was held is still open
for tours. He was held there for a few days, said Towana Spivey,
director of the Fort Sill Museum. ``He was initially put in it when
he arrived, and later, on about two weekend occasions when he had
too much to drink,'' Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Geronimo surrendered in October 1894 with 300 other Apache and
lived at the fort for many years as a prisoner of war, although he
occasionally left without supervision. He died in 1909 and is
buried in the Apache Cemetery at Fort Sill.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has an exhibit debunking several myths about
Geronimo, including the tale that he paced so much he left a path
in the cell's floor. ``The original stone floor is still there,''
Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on tours, call (580) 442-5123 or visit the
World Wide Web site sill-www.army.mil/Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What is the origin of the expression ``ball of wax,''
as in the statement ``that's a whole different ball of wax''? _
D.W., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The expression started out as ``big ball of wax,'' and
it appears to have been coined by someone in the advertising
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the ``ball of wax'' is referred to, it means
``everything.'' Shepherd Mead, who worked for 20 years in
advertising, wrote a science fiction book titled ``The Big Ball of
Wax'' in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to the guitarist Chet Atkins? _ E.A.,
Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to him in care of the Chet Atkins Appreciation
Society, 3716 Timberlake Road, Knoxville, TN 37920.
</P>
<P>
   The society, an 800-member club that costs $15 to join, holds a
yearly convention in Nashville that features a performance by
Atkins. Members also receive a quarterly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins turned 75 on June 20, a few days after leading a parade
to celebrate the groundbreaking of a $37 million Country Music Hall
of Fame in Nashville.  &QL;

AN ARRANGEMENT THAT COULD REAP BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson did not attempt to dazzle the League of United
Latin American Citizens with utterances in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike presidential candidates Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore in recent linguistically embarrassing visits
to gatherings of Hispanics, Jackson, who is not running this time,
spoke a different language to the delegates to the recent LULAC
Convention in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As keynote speaker, Jackson went to the convention to talk
``common purpose,'' a language Hispanics and African-Americans
could benefit enormously from if they used it better and more
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Jacksonian exhortation, the great emancipator of
American captives from Middle Eastern and Balkans hellholes spoke
of the need for African-Americans and Hispanics to work together to
accomplish their social, political and economic objectives.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the interests of the two groups ``on the human
rights agenda are fundamentally converged.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts were echoed by LULAC President Rick Dovalina, who
called for unity between African-Americans and Hispanics on issues
instead of division by race.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Dovalina achieved unity on a 10-point agreement
between LULAC and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. That agreement
focuses upon voting rights, affirmative action, public education,
the 2000 census, free trade, immigration, media portrayals and
corporate inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter, Jackson said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are aiming at the Hispanic and black markets, but there
is no person of color on their boards. We will begin to challenge
corporate America, company by company, to let your boards and
investment portfolios look like your markets.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not just ear-wash. It is potentially political dynamite.
If African-Americans and Hispanics succeed in overcoming their
mutual distrust and really cooperate to confront the obstacles that
limit their opportunities and dilute their rights, they could
become an irresistible political force.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, however, the two groups cannot allow
themselves to be pitted against each other, as some would do.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis politicians like Bush and some of his fellow
travelers have placed on trying to speak Spanish before certain
audiences promotes, in a not very subtle way, divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is nothing wrong with saying a few words in Spanish to
audiences with large numbers of Spanish speakers. It can be seen as
a matter of common courtesy. The gesture most often will elicit
politely appreciative responses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are Hispanics who interpret that as
patronizing, particularly if it is done by persons who don't speak
Spanish very well. For them a few stumbling phrases in Spanish is
no substitute for policies that would address the needs and
aspirations of the majority of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Some African-Americans see the Republicans' infatuation with
Spanish (which flies in the face of the Republican-dominated
English-only movement) as a way of signalling to Hispanics that the
GOP really wants them and that the party has by and large written
off African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's politically smart. Bush knows that he stands
little chance of corralling very many African-American votes. After
all, there just aren't a heck of a lot of African-Americans who
think like or can identify with the likes of J.C. Watts, Ward
Connerly or Bush's father's appointee to the Supreme Court,
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also knows that Hispanics are the nation's fastest growing
political constituency. But if he's going to pick up votes there,
he'll have to bring more to the table than his blessing in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may have felt compelled to mangle some Spanish just because
Bush does it. And he may want to reconsider the practice, seeing
how he does it about as well as he dances the macarena.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's apparent success in speaking the language of
cooperation to LULAC could help offset Gore's ineptitude at
Spanish. Such a joint effort, if it holds together and gets
results, could make Hispanics less susceptible to the cosmetic
politics of feigned cultural sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   And that could translate into a bigger combined African-American
and Hispanic vote for the Democrats next November.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Rainbow/PUSH/LULAC really lives up to its
potential, both parties would be compelled to make some meaningful
commitments to African-Americans and Hispanics. And that would be
exceedingly good for the campaign and for America.

UNWANTED AT HOME OR IN U.S., IMMIGRANTS HELD
</HEADLINE>
 (Originally budgeted as Aliens-In Limbo), (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For 20 months, Qui Ngoc Nguyen has been locked in
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   The former Fort Worth, Texas, resident served time at 17 for a
burglary in nearby Grand Prairie, was convicted of theft at 24 for
losing three rented videos, and again arrested for failing to meet
his parole officer during a marital crisis, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, under a 1996 immigration law, he was ordered deported as
an aggravated felon.
</P>
<P>
   But like 3,500 other immigrants whose native countries won't
take them back, the Vietnamese-born Nguyen was detained
indefinitely. He became one of what federal officials call
``lifers.''
</P>
<P>
   They include stateless Palestinians and people from Somalia,
Ethiopia, Cuba, Honduras, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Laos, Cambodia and
former Soviet republics in Central Asia, which have no extradition
treaty with the United States, have no functioning government or
simply refuse to issue travel documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just picked us up and destroyed our families,'' Nguyen,
27, said during an interview at a Dallas County jail, one of five
lockups where he has spent time since Oct. 31, 1997. ``We are not
criminals, killers. I want the world to know how we are being held.
Some of us are crying all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my wife,'' said the 5-foot-5 detainee, who had worked
as a cashier at a Dallas/Fort Worth Airport restaurant. ``I told
her I'm never getting out and she should find another guy to take
care of her and our two children.'' She did.
</P>
<P>
   Held in county jails and detention centers in Fort Worth,
Denton, Dallas and around the country at a cost of $24,000 each per
year, the indefinite detainees have attracted relatively scant
sympathy because of criminal pasts, their small numbers, lack of
resources and language difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But there are people working for their release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I give a talk, people are appalled, many cry,'' said
D'Ann Johnson, a San Antonio attorney working without pay to free a
dozen indefinite detainees. ``They think, `This is America. This
doesn't happen here.' But it does. When you have a criminal
sentence, you can count the days. With these people, there's no
light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, a Washington-based group that normally
condemns torture and other abuses in Third World countries,
condemned the U.S. practice last year, saying ``arbitrary detention
is clearly prohibited by international law.''
</P>
<P>
   A 47-day hunger strike this spring by relatives of detained
Cubans in Krome, Fla., aroused the large Cuban community in nearby
Miami and prompted a review by immigration officials that led to
the release of five.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of ``long-term unremovable'' detainees
increasing seven-fold since 1996 and stretching her agencies'
resources, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Doris Meissner on April 30 ordered periodic, six-month reviews of
each case. But she said no violent offenders would be released.
Immigrants rights advocates say the reviews can be slow and highly
subjective.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Nguyen and 60 other frustrated detainees took part in a
four-day hunger strike at a low-risk INS detention center in
Denison in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving little notice beyond the local newspaper, the
Herald-Democrat, the protest prompted a grassroots effort by the
Rev. Henry Bucher, the campus chaplain at Austin College in nearby
Sherman, who has organized student volunteers to help the
``unremovables.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's an outrage,'' Bucher said. ``Until the hunger
strike, I didn't know we had people from all over the world
incarcerated just down the road and held indefinitely after serving
time for smoking marijuana or having traffic violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cannot afford a lawyer but Nguyen hired Dallas attorney
Paul Zoltan with family help and managed to draw attention to his
plight this summer.
</P>
<P>
   INS District Director William G. Harrington, citing the new INS
review guidelines, told the Star-Telegram on July 14 that his staff
has recommended Nguyen's release. A week later, neither Nguyen nor
his attorney has been informed of the date of the release.
</P>
<P>
   More than one INS official has said the agency's ``hands have
been tied'' by a 1990 law that permitted indefinite detention,
which was expanded in 1996 to include far broader categories of
deportable felons _ including those who committed repeated DWIs,
theft, burglary or drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write two checks on an empty account, be found guilty and
you're deportable,'' said Zoltan, Nguyen's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, whose district includes all of Oklahoma and 123
counties in North Texas, said the 1996 law was designed to remove
criminal foreigners as a threat to American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought this might be a deterrent,'' he said. ``The
law had a good intention but we saw how soon it would clog the
system by taking up every bit of our detention space.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, whose
subcommittee spearheaded the bill, said INS officials always had
discretion to release detainees and blamed ``gross mismanagement''
for the mushrooming number of lifers, from 750 to 3,500 in less
than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's notable that the INS took an overly narrow view,'' said
Judy Rabinovitz, New York-based senior counsel of the ACLU
immigrants rights project. ``They're saying their `hands are tied'
and the courts are saying they've misapplied the statute. I don't
think Congress specifically authorized them to detain people who
cannot be removed to Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU attorney said the government has lost 15 U.S. district
court cases on the constitionality of indefinitely detaining
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Five federal judges in Seattle found that the immigration laws
could not be applied to some immigrants whose crimes were committed
before the laws had been passed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the July 9 decision applies only to Washington state
and was immediately appealed by the government, ``hopefully it's
going to influence other courts,'' Rabinovitz said. At most, 120
detainees would be affected. A ruling in a similar case is pending
at a U.S. district court in Austin, she added.

   ``People can't believe this is happening in our country, that
we're sentencing people to life in prison because their countries
won't take them back,'' the ACLU attorney said. ``Our argument is
that the statute doesn't automatically demand indefinite
detention.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is Amerasian, the offspring of a Vietnamese mother and an
American civilian employee of the Navy, whom he never met.
</P>
<P>
   His mixed heritage made him an object of ridicule and prejudice
in Vietnam's racially homogeneous society during his first 12 years
in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. Schools refused to advance him
beyond the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I lived on the street and tried to help my
mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being an Amerasian finally helped him immigrate to the United
States in 1984. He and his mother lived first in Fort Worth, then
moved to nearby Arlington and Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Texas state prisons, county lockups afford few
recreational amenities and no educational opportunities, Nguyen
said. He said he has endured beatings by fellow inmates. Fights
often broke out over viewing English or Spanish TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between Hispanic and African American gangs, who viewed
him as Asian, Nguyen said he also has faced open enmity from
Cambodian and Laotion detainees who see him as Anglo _ with Anglos
representing the despised American authority that put them away.
</P>
<P>
   He has been detained in Denison, Corsicana, Dallas and Fort
Worth during the past 20 months. The frequent moves and far-flung
locations have made it impossible for his impoverished family to
visit him more than a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Nguyen traces his biological father and wins citizenship
through virtue of being an American's son, he would face
deportation to Vietnam after his eventual release if an extradition
treaty is signed with Hanoi, INS officials said.

 &HT;    Our curse: Kennedy family woes turned into national tragedy
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has happened often enough to become ritual. The
Kennedy family suffers a tragedy, and the nation grieves. And each
time _ out of sympathy, disbelief or morbid fascination _ the
question is asked: Is the Kennedy family cursed?
</P>
<P>
   Blaming a curse for a family's misfortunes is little more of an
explanation than what the witch-hunting folks of Salem, Mass., came
up with to explain crops failing and milk cows going dry. It
amounts to no more than applying a word to what we don't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But whether ``curse'' is an explanation or merely a label,
should we apply it to the Kennedy family? Do all the bad things
that have happened to them distinguish them from many other
families that suffer loss?
</P>
<P>
   I have known of families in which cancer or some other deadly
disease has returned to strike generation after generation;
families for whom suicide seems to be a birthright; families in
which it is rare for menfolk to reach middle age; families in which
the last branch of the ancestral tree is suddenly sawed off in a
single mishap.
</P>
<P>
   I have seldom heard anyone say those families were cursed. Of
course, they suffer in obscurity. Their grief creates a tightening
circle where they can seek solace. In doing so, they ask, ``Why?''
But they do not answer, ``Because our family is cursed.'' They may
not answer at all, knowing that having to ask the question is pain
enough.
</P>
<P>
   But some insist on answering the ``Why?'' of the Kennedy
tragedies. Believing that the Kennedy name is so much larger than
life, that the loss of a Kennedy is such a great loss, they cast
aside the small answers. It can't be bad luck or tragic
coincidence. Larger forces must be at work. The hand that strikes a
Kennedy down must be powerful; it must be supernatural or even
divine.
</P>
<P>
   What else can you say about a family that, among other things,
lost a president to an assassin's bullet; that lost a senator who
also was assassinated; that now has lost the son of the president
before he reached his prime? Wouldn't you say that family has been
cursed?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can say that there are few families that have produced
a president, senators, congressmen and other public servants. You
can say that few families have so many members who are born to
wealth and privilege, yet work so hard on behalf of the have-nots _
the downtrodden and disadvantaged. You can say that family has been
blessed.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a curse that haunts the Kennedy family, the
thing it suffers that most other families don't, is the flip side
of that blessing. They have the public's adoration and curiosity.
The media focus on and magnify their every mishap. We seize their
family tragedy and make it our national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Every detail is sought. Nothing is too private. We are told,
bit-by-bit, of the debris that washes up and gives us an idea of
how an airplane slammed into the ocean and disintegrated, killing
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister. They have found
luggage, we are told. They have found a medicine bottle. They have
found a wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Not even that tightening circle of grief is beyond penetration.
I cringed when a television camera's telephoto lens showed family
members gathered for what the reporter called _betraying not a hint
of irony _ a ``private mass.'' They prayed for a miracle that would
not come. They crossed themselves as a sign of faith. We watched.
</P>
<P>
   They are the objects of our voyeurism in the time of their
deepest pain. That must be awful to endure. But that's no curse.
That's just us.

GORE, BUSH USING SIMILAR FUND-RAISING SYSTEMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presidential campaign fund-raising system used by the
Democratic front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, mirrors the one
that has become controversial for the Republican front-runner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Both have a team of fund-raising captains who raise at least
$100,000 from individual donors, who are prohibited from giving
more than $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   And both teams include executives who have a direct interest in
federal government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's 25 top fund-raisers include, for example, Boston nursing
home executive Alan Solomont, who successfully lobbied the Clinton
administration for regulatory changes favorable to his industry
while raising more than $1 million for the Democratic Party,
according to Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Gore and Bush say the contributions, while
gratefully accepted, do not affect their public policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's fund-raising team of at least 115 people, called the
Pioneers, has drawn criticism while helping him collect a record
$37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest groups such as Common Cause and Texans for
Public Justice said that the bundling of $1,000 contributions gives
each $100,000 fund-raiser excessive clout with potential future
presidents, violating the spirit of the limits on individual
donations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, leaders of those organizations said the practice is
suspect regardless of whether it is carried out by Gore, Bush or
other candidates. But they still reserved special scrutiny for the
Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having a relatively small group of super fund-raisers go
out and package contributions into very large blocks of money,
these fund-raisers are the ones who then have call on the
candidates because of their ability to bring huge amounts into the
campaign.'' Common Cause acting president Donald J. Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon added that Bush's campaign ``has raised the practice
to a new level, both in terms of the amount of money and the level
of sort of organization that it has brought to the practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Texans for Public Justice director Craig McDonald said the
bundling of contributions should be outlawed. Failing that, the
campaigns should be required to disclose the names of their
fund-raising captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign has done it more successfully, and it seems
more sophisticated than other campaigns,'' McDonald said of the
fund-raising system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush initially refused to release the Pioneers' names, and
released 115 names only after pressure from the media and Texans
for Public Justice. Gore, who has raised about $19 million,
followed suit Wednesday night by disclosing his 25 fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The only Texan on Gore's roster is Dallas plaintiffs' lawyer
Fred Baron, who specializes in asbestos cases. Baron is a top donor
to the Democratic Party and hosted President Clinton at his house
in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore list includes several lawyers and executives of
entertainment and telecommunication companies. There is Haim Saban,
chairman of Saban Entertainment, which produces live-action
children's entertainment such as the Power Rangers; Sumner
Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc.; and Black Entertainment
Television executive Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosello and New Jersey State Sen. Ray
Lesniak are also on the Gore team. Another notable member is Denver
lawyer Norm Brownstein, who represented key players in the
Silverado Savings and Loan Association scandal that engulfed Bush's
brother, Neil Bush. Brownstein once contributed campaign money to
the Texas governor's father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, linked to a series of Democratic Party fund-raising
scandals, does not alter his policies based on the activities of
his top fund-raisers, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is a man of principle and integrity and
whatever policies he pursues and focuses on are going to be with
the American people in mind, not individuals or corporations,''
Roger Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign official made a similar statement about the
governor this week after Bush's Pioneer list came out.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised by Bush and Gore runs in similar patterns,
according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., New York and Los Angeles are the top
money-raising locations for Gore. For Bush, it's Dallas and Houston
first, then Washington, Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates, the top categories of contributors by
career is the same: lawyers, retirees and executives in real estate
and securities and investments.

THE SLOW EMERGENCE OF MEXICO'S FIRST LADIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
(mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The official reaction to Sara Sefchovich's modest
initial attempt at a book about Mexico's first ladies, a 1982 photo
collection accompanied by a few biographical details, was immediate
and draconian.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the book an intolerable breach of the proper
separation between public and private lives, the secretary of
education ordered all 3,000 copies seized and quarantined in a
government warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   So the publication this month of Ms. Sefchovich's second, more
ambitious book about the wives of the country's rulers through five
centuries marks a rapid evolution in the country's
self-consciousness. This time around, the book includes rich
details about some of the women, a compendium that had been taboo.
There has been no censorship, and the book is a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico has changed not only in what you can say, but in what
things are important to us,'' Ms. Sefchovich said. ``There's a new
interest in women's lives and in private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes here tend to creep, not sprint. Authorities still work
to keep large spheres of Mexican life secret. But a slow-motion
glasnost has allowed some themes, including the family lives of the
political elite, to receive new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe Loaeza, a columnist for the newspaper Reforma, said
that when she began her career in the early 1980s, four themes
could be discussed only in a reverential tone: the flag, the Virgin
of Guadalupe, the army and the president's family. Journalists were
occasionally fired for poking fun at the first lady, even
obliquely, Ms. Loaez said. ``But now things are opening up, and
Sara's book is a watershed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book is not the only evidence of new attitudes. It has
appeared in bookstores as Mexico's first full-blown presidential
primary campaign is under way, and the campaign has brought
unprecedented attention to the wives and former wives of the seven
aspirants, five of whom are divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent interview, Rosa Elena Gomez, the former wife of
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, a former interior minister who is said
to be President Ernesto Zedillo's choice for the governing party's
nomination, described candidly how her husband of 25 years divorced
her to marry a younger woman in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In another interview, the former wife of Vicente Fox, the
leading opposition candidate, announced that she hoped for a
reconciliation. But Fox campaigns with his 19-year-old daughter,
Ana Cristina, and she told another magazine earlier this month that
she hoped he would let her act as first lady rather than marry any
of the numerous pretenders courting his affections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many out there stalking him,'' Ms. Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Such candid statements are especially startling to Mexicans
because through the centuries politicians' families have mostly
been kept out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women just haven't existed in our history,'' Ms.
Sefchovich said in an interview in her apartment, with a window
overlooking an orchid-draped patio in the Coyoacan district.
</P>
<P>
   A sociology professor, Ms. Sefchovich worked for nearly two
decades to assemble her 470-page study, ``The Fate of the
Consort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's hardly any information on these women,'' she said. The
author was unable even to identify by name the wives of several
dozen of the 79 Spanish viceroys who ruled Mexico from the 1519
conquest until independence three centuries later, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the more recent first ladies, Ms. Sefchovich said, ``It's
considered a state secret if you want to know when they married, or
how many children they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's current first lady, Nilda Zedillo, never gives
interviews, Ms. Sefchovich said, because of criticism she received
after her husband became the official candidate in 1994 and she
spoke about Mexican women who work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many work just to be able to spend their money on stockings,''
she told reporters. ``They're never at home, and when they arrive
there's no food, so they take the children to eat at McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   The angry response by feminists stunned Mrs. Zedillo, and she
has made few public statements since. Although she frequently
travels with Zedillo, she prefers to quietly tend her five
children.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's 1998 visit to Mexico, Mrs. Zedillo
and Hillary Rodham Clinton held a luncheon for 30 prominent women.
Mrs. Clinton offered a toast to the challenges faced by women
everywhere. Mrs. Zedillo sipped her wine in silence, although she
spoke up later to defend her husband's economic policies, Ms.
Sefchovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The Zedillos project an image of family harmony, which has
become a requirement of modern Mexican politics, in vivid contrast
with a not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family life of whatever Mexican president earlier in this
century was a wife at home with children and him out publicly with
other women, with actresses, begetting children outside of
marriage,'' the writer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no longer accepted. If a president has mistresses, they
must be hidden. On the other hand, our society now accepts that a
couple can divorce, and that a divorced man can be a good leader.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until recently, presidents' wives were often subjected to
stunning humiliation, but divorce was a taboo. Laura Mantecon, the
wife of a general who occupied the presidency from 1880 through
1884, is remembered mainly for her rare divorce petition. In it she
described how her husband had beaten her, causing a miscarriage,
and had surrounded himself with concubines in the presidential
palace. The president responded by amending the divorce laws to
strip her of all resources, Ms. Sefchovich said.
</P>
<P>
   During this century, many first ladies have taken on social
welfare activities, distributing groceries to poor families. A
pioneer was Eva Samano, the wife of Adolfo Lopez Mateos, president
from 1958 to 1964. Shortly before her husband left office, the
Congress honored her generous work, but by that time, although she
was still living in the presidential mansion, she was no longer the
president's wife: Lopez had married a twenty-something woman he had
met on the street, according to Ms. Sefchovich's book.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Lopez Portillo, president from 1976 to 1982, was equally
indiscreet, installing one of his mistresses in his Cabinet as
tourism secretary. His wife, Carmen, nonetheless cut a high
profile: Among other extravagances, she insisted on taking her
favorite grand piano with her on frequent international travels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when Mrs. Lopez learned that Ms. Sefchovich was
preparing her first book, she sent word that she wanted to be
included, along with a favorite photo for publication. But when the
author arrived at the palace to interview Mrs. Lopez, aides to the
president ``said she would not be speaking to me,'' Ms. Sefchovich
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then came the censorship, and the book was never
distributed,'' she added.

IRA CALLS HOPES FOR ACCORD `SUBSTANTIALLY DIMINISHED' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Irish Republican Army on Thursday blamed the
British government for last week's breakdown of the Northern
Ireland peace settlement, saying hopes for the accord were now
``substantially diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the IRA, though much anticipated in the climate
of efforts to keep the peace effort moving forward, gave no
encouragement that the clandestine paramilitary group was ready to
meet widespread demands that it begin turning in weapons. But it
did not rule out future disarmament as categorically as it once
had.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not explicitly threaten the abandonment of the
current cease-fire, now two years old, but it included a chilling
reminder that the last IRA truce came to an end after two years in
1996 when commanders made a similar judgment that the British
government was not applying enough ``political will'' to reach a
settlement. On that occasion the IRA set off a bomb in the Canary
Wharf business district of London, killing two people, wounding 100
and causing $240 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   The group complained of pressure on it to disarm as a condition
for allowing its political representatives, Sinn Fein, a role in
negotiating peace, a demand that the IRA says it considers an order
to surrender. ``Those who demand the decommissioning of IRA weapons
lend themselves, in the current political context, inadvertently or
otherwise, to the failed agenda which seeks the defeat of the
IRA,'' said the statement, published Thursday in An Phoblacht, the
weekly organ of Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair was holding meetings in London with
the two major combatants in the failed talks, David Trimble, head
of the Ulster Unionists, and Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   A British spokesman said: ``Our position has not changed. It is
to try to get the two sides closer together, and that is what we
will continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If we were to overreact to this statement or that
statement, we would do nothing else. We have to stick to the course
we have set.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Secretary for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, visiting
Washington, told the BBC that the IRA statement was ``unhelpful.''
She lamented that it ``shows the degree of mistrust that exists and
probably fuels that mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at 10 Downing St., Trimble said he found the commentary
``menacing.'' Parts of the statement that blamed Unionist
intransigence for the breakdown were ``offensive'' and ``wholly
inaccurate,'' he said. The Unionists contend that it is the IRA's
insistence on keeping its weapons and explosives that is the cause
of the stall in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said it proved that the IRA had no intention of
disarming and showed that Adams had led Blair ``up the garden
path'' during talks in Belfast this month. At that time the British
asked the Ulster Unionists to accept assurances that disarmament
would begin quickly after a start-up of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Adams and Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, Martin
McGuinness, saw Blair and emerged to say that whether the IRA
disarmed depended not on them but on Trimble and Blair. ``They will
have much more influence on the IRA than Gerry Adams and I ever
would,'' McGuinness said.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in putting the agreement in place halted last week when
Trimble and his party refused to sit in a planned provincial
cabinet with Sinn Fein until IRA guerrillas began dismantling their
arsenal of weapons. The accord, which is known as the Good Friday
Agreement for the day it was signed in April 1998 and which sought
to put an end to sectarian violence, embodies a series of measures
and political institutions aimed at balancing power among the
province's majority Protestants and minority Catholics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister and a co-sponsor along
with Blair of the peace effort, had repeatedly called upon the IRA
to move the process forward by stating that it was now willing to
begin disarming. On Thursday in Dublin he refused to react to the
new statement other than to say, ``We were neither encouraged nor
discouraged about what we heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Docherty, Sinn Fein's vice president, said his party
remained committed to the Good Friday Agreement and blamed the
Unionists for balking at going forward. ``It is clear now that they
do not intend to share power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast Thursday, George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator who
was chairman of the talks that produced the original settlement,
said he thought it could still succeed. After two days of talks
with party leaders, he set a Sept. 6 date for the formal start of a
review of the accord that he has been asked to conduct.
</P>
<P>
   He confessed that he had not wanted to have to return to
Northern Ireland after having spent four years in the preparation
of the Good Friday Agreement. ``I make no bones about the fact that
I would have preferred not to come back,'' he said. ``I am not
surprised, but I am disappointed.''

 &HT;    Curses make complex seem simple
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The notion that the Kennedy family is
cursed is ludicrous, primitive, pre-enlightenment, we tell
ourselves. John F. Kennedy Jr. didn't die with his wife and
sister-in-law because his karma ran out or his family is fated. He
died because he flew at night in a plane he didn't know how to
pilot in poor weather.
</P>
<P>
   Curses are simplistic. Self-determination is real. Cause and
effect we understand, sorcery we left behind with the wizard of the
royal court. And then another Kennedy dies violently and
prematurely, like some 20th-century biblical parable, and despite
the pragmatism of our modern age, we ask ourselves again, who, or
what is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Darrell Whiteman, a professor of cultural anthropology
at the nondenominational Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore,
Ky., defines a curse as a mechanical process practiced by unevolved
people seeking answers to the unanswerable. ''It alleviates one
from having to take the responsibility to think about things in a
deeper way,'' Whiteman said. ''It provides a simple answer to a
complex question.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Whiteman admits he would never invoke a curse
himself.
</P>
<P>
   God asks us to invoke his name to bless people, Whiteman said.
And while it is socially acceptable to believe in blessings, it is
not acceptable to believe in the converse of that. Could it hold
power? ``I think there is a possibility,'' Whiteman said. ''I would
be very hesitant to curse someone.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition is found in virtually every culture, according to
Linda Degh, a professor of folklore at Indiana University, who
characterizes herself as a ``scholar, not a believer'' in curses.
Nonetheless, she argues that curses are difficult to repudiate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has tragedy assumes that someone put a curse on
them,'' Degh says. ''Have I seen evidence that it works? Yes _ in
cases where people believe in them. We can't say, 'No, it's
impossible,' because we are ambiguous. We are all afraid to die. No
matter how enlightened someone is, part of them may believe a curse
has power and that may lend it power.''
</P>
<P>
   What the geneticist may perceive as nature and the psychologist
understands as nurture, Rabbi Meir Yeshurun of the Kabbalah Center
in Boca Raton has a broader view. ''It is a negative force,''
Yeshurun said. And though he doesn't use the term curse, he thinks
the concept applies.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something there, there is negativity there, there is
no doubt about it. Otherwise, why are these things happening,''
Yeshurun says. ''If people would like to call it a curse, they can.
I wouldn't call it a curse. It's not a spiritual term, but it's a
negative energy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing in the universe is a coincidence,'' Yeshurun said.
''Somebody in the family did something to open up the family to
this negative energy, and that has been plaguing the Kennedys for
four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Curses in the Jewish tradition run back to the Garden of Eden.
God condemned the snake to forever slither on its belly for
offering Eve the apple from the tree of knowledge. Eve was plagued
with the pain of childbirth and Adam with a life of toil.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Judaism generally dismisses the practice, but curses are
still employed by rabbis on the fringes. In Israel, a set of
ultra-orthodox rabbis have reportedly invoked the ''pulsa dinura''
_ or lashes of fire _ against archaeologists, developers and even
against Yitzhak Rabin not long before his assassination. The curse
calls for death within a month. Thirty-three days after the curse
was reported, the prime minister was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   In the Wiccan tradition, the power of a curse extends beyond
metaphor. Baird Stafford, a 52-year-old computer security
consultant from Melbourne, is a Wiccan high priest and a believer
in the power of the occult. ''The first thing they taught me was
that those who cannot curse cannot cure,'' he said. ''They are the
same energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford isn't at all convinced the Kennedys are cursed, but he
doesn't doubt the phenomena _ though rare _ exist. ''Curses are the
reverse of the healing energies, and I know that they work because
I have seen them work,'' he said. ''A group of six or eight of us
did a long-distance healing for a lady in California a few years
ago who had a bad case of sciatica. She hadn't gotten out of bed in
months. Twenty-four hours after the healing, she was walking
around.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, that sort of anecdotal evidence was dismissed out of
hand by the scientific community. Not anymore. In the 1970s,
doctors began to study seriously the mind's ability to heal the
body. Today, there are hundreds of ongoing experiments looking into
the healing power of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dossey, an internist in Dallas for 20 years and now the
editor of the Journal of Alternative Therapies in Santa Fe, N.M.,
predicts Western medicine will soon come to accept the idea of
helpful and harmful energy being transmitted between people at
great distances.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 Gallup Poll about the prayer habits of Americans
convinced him to investigate the subject. The poll reported that 5
percent of Americans have prayed for harm to come to others _
essentially cursing them. That statistic, which shocked Dossey, led
to ``Be Careful What You Pray For,'' a study of the power of
negative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how you would separate this from what you would
call a curse, so I think the cautious thing to do would be to take
seriously the possibility,'' he said. ''I think the Kennedy death
could be explained by a great many factors and we may never know,
but among all the possibilities, (the notion of a curse) is one we
have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the Kennedy family curse was widely accepted when
Jacqueline Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis. According to Phyllis
Karas, the co-author of ``The Onassis Women: An Eyewitness
Account,'' many Greeks felt that Jackie brought the curse with her
when she married Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Karas interviewed Kiki Feroudi Moutsatsos, an assistant first to
Onassis and then to Jackie from 1968 to 1990. The argument among
some was that when the young widow met Onassis, he was healthy, his
son was healthy and his business was thriving. Seven years later,
both Aristotle Onassis and his son were dead and the family fortune
had dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she walked into his funeral there were sounds of Atyhya,
(unlucky) especially from his daughter,'' Karas said. ''They felt
Jackie carried the curse that had been part of her husband's life
and she carried that to Aristotle.''
</P>
<P>
   Moutsatsos, who now runs a hotel in Greece, was very close to
Jackie. ''She would never say Jackie was cursed,'' Karas said.
''She would just say Jackie had bad kismet, Jackie had very bad
kismet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ted Kennedy _ the patriarch who has survived the deaths of
three brothers, numerous other family members and now his famous
nephew _ wonders what role fate plays in the Kennedy family
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, after having driven his car off a bridge on
Chappaquiddick Island and killing his passenger, the senator asked:
``Does some evil curse hang over us?''

STATE-TO-STATE TALKS ONLY, TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT TELLS BEIJING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Defying pressure to soften his stance,
President Lee Teng-hui reaffirmed Thursday that Taiwan will only
talk to China as a separate state, and he predicted that China
would eventually accept Taiwan's new position. Lee called his new
diplomatic tack ``friendly and positive,'' and not provocative, as
Beijing has termed it.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's remarks appeared to be directed at Washington, as well as
at Beijing, the two governments he most upset by dropping the
bombshell on July 9 that from now on Taiwan will only negotiate
with China in a ``special state-to-state relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   A special envoy from the United States, Richard Bush, arrived in
Taipei Thursday and is expected to urge Lee to find a way to reopen
talks between Taiwan and China. Yet Lee's stance appears to have
scuttled any chance for a visit by a senior Chinese official, Wang
Daohan, that was scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, as Taiwan's call-in radio shows juggled
competing opinions about the significance of President Clinton's
remarks about Taiwan at a news conference on Wednesday, Lee issued
a statement that signaled, in a gentle way, his unwillingness to
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will not be easy for the Communist Party to accept
this view right away,'' Lee told visiting legislators from the
Philippines, according to a statement made public by his office.
``But if they can remain cool and think this over, they will
understand what I am saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's remarks did not seem to allow any room for concessions to
China, which has been angered by what it sees as a betrayal of the
earlier framework for negotiations between Taipei and Beijing. When
those talks began in 1993, Taipei and Beijing essentially agreed
that they had separate governments but were part of the same
Chinese country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a senior aide to Lee tried to explain, Taiwan's
government has changed its mind because it feels that the previous
formula unfairly favored Beijing. Yet in talking about the issue,
the aide had to weave his way through a semantical jungle that has
grown up around the notion of ``one China'' _ a relic of a civil
war that ended 50 years ago, when Taipei and Beijing both claimed
to be the one legitimate government of all of China.
</P>
<P>
   Washington deferred to this ``one China'' principle as it
normalized relations with Beijing in the 1970s. In the 1972
Shanghai Communique, the United States acknowledged that Chinese on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait held that there was only one China,
and that Taiwan was part of China. But after it switched diplomatic
relations to Beijing in 1979, the United States also committed
itself to Taiwan's defense, to prevent reunification by force.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Su Chi, chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council,
said Beijing's formula of ``one China'' exists in the present
tense, whereas Taipei's only exists in the future. Taipei still
supports the idea that the Chinese mainland and Taiwan will reunite
some day, he argued, and only then will there be ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a concept, it's all right,'' said Su in an interview. ``Our
problem is that there is no `one China' right now. There's a
divided China.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Su insisted at one moment that Taiwan was making
``a major step'' in its new policy. A moment later, he countered
that there is ``no fundamental change,'' in Taiwan's position,
since it has always sought reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Taiwan officials, Su would not say what seems obvious
to any visitor to Taiwan: that the government is trying to distance
itself from Beijing without going so far as to declare outright
independence, a move that would risk military conflict. China has
never renounced the use of force to achieve reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that we are moving away, it is that the PRC's
policies are so heavy-handed that they are forcing us away,'' he
said, referring to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, a stream of anti-Lee invective continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Teng-hui is doomed to failure,'' said a front-page
commentary in the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily. ``Those
who follow him should understand they are heading into a blind
alley from which there is no escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth arrived in Beijing
Thursday to discuss the crisis, and his trip appeared to be timed
to coincide with the special envoy's visit to Taipei. Roth is
expected to echo Clinton's comments that Washington still supports
a ``one China'' policy but would view any military action with
grave concern.

IN A COUP FOR CABLE, HBO'S `SOPRANOS' RECEIVES 16 EMMY
NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ HBO's acclaimed drama ``The Sopranos'' Thursday
became the first cable-network series to be nominated for an Emmy
Award for best drama, and also earned more Emmy nominations _ 16 _
than any show, broadcast or cable.
</P>
<P>
   Three shows received 13 nominations, two regular series created
by David E. Kelley _ ``The Practice'' (ABC) and ``Ally McBeal''
(Fox) _ and the CBS mini-series ``Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO placed second to NBC in total nominations, with 74 to NBC's
82, while ABC had 58, CBS 46 and Fox 33.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Sopranos'' was widely praised by critics and, for
an HBO show, widely watched, nonetheless HBO reaches only about 25
million homes (broadcasters reach 99.4 million), and the show made
its debut only in January. For both reasons, many in the television
industry were surprised that the tradition-minded Television
Academy of Arts and Sciences, which awards the Emmys, gave it so
many nominations.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano, the head of a
turbulent household and an organized-crime family in northern New
Jersey, earned a nomination, his first, as best actor in a drama,
and all three female leads earned nominations. Edie Falco, who
plays Tony's wife, Carmela, and Lorraine Bracco, who plays his
psychiatrist, were nominated for best actress in a drama, and Nancy
Marchand was nominated for best supporting actress for her
portrayal of Tony's scheming mother, Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five nominees for best writing for a drama were
``Sopranos'' episodes, including the pilot, written by the series'
creator, David Chase.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sopranos'' windfall underscores two issues that have been
increasingly troubling broadcast television executives: the
defection of many viewers to cable-network programming, and cable
networks' freedom to create shows without restraints on foul
language or on depictions of sex and violence because they, unlike
broadcasters, are not regulated by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did that show, you guys would jump all over us,'' said
Doug Herzog, president of the Fox network's entertainment division,
referring to reporters and television critics. ``When they do it,
they get lauded and applauded for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he called ``The Sopranos'' ``one of the premier shows on
television, of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Also nominated for best drama were ``E.R.'' (which also was
nominated for that award in its first year, 1995, and won it in
1996) and ``Law and Order,'' both on NBC, and two ABC dramas, ``The
Practice'' and ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' (also a first-year nominee in 1994
and a winner in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Among comedies, CBS's ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' which many
critics felt had been overlooked in its first two seasons, finally
got nominated in its third season, and Ray Romano, its star, was
nominated for best actor in a comedy. HBO's ``Sex in the City'' got
a surprise nomination for comedy, as did its star, Sarah Jessica
Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees for best comedy were ``Ally McBeal,'' ``Frasier''
and ``Friends.'' Joining Romano as nominees for best actor in a
comedy are Michael J. Fox of ABC's ``Spin City,'' and three NBC
stars, Kelsey Grammer of ``Frasier,'' Paul Reiser of ``Mad About
You'' and John Lithgow of ``Third Rock from the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The other comedy actress nominees were Calista Flockhart (``Ally
McBeal''), Patricia Heaton (``Everybody Loves Raymond''), Helen
Hunt (``Mad About You'') and Jenna Elfman (ABC's ``Dharma and
Greg'').
</P>
<P>
   Along with Gandolfini, Dylan McDermott, star of ``The
Practice,'' also received his first nomination, joining three
oft-nominated stars: Dennis Franz and Jimmy Smits of ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue'' and Sam Waterston of ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Falco and Ms. Bracco joined a veteran group among the
nominees for best actress in a drama: Gillian Anderson of Fox's
``The X-Files,'' Christine Lahti of CBS's ``Chicago Hope'' and
Julianna Margulies of ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of nominations surprised me, but only the number,''
Meryl Marshall, president of the Television Academy, said of the
success of ``The Sopranos.'' ``Everywhere I go, on airplanes,
wherever, people inside and outside the business were talking about
that show. It had the buzz.''

CONGRESSMAN SEEKS NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ability of suspected serial killer Angel
Maturino Resendiz to avoid capture with phony identification cards
illustrates the need for a more secure Social Security document, a
U.S. congressman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all U.S. citizens are vulnerable to identity theft
because our basic identity documents, such as driver's licenses and
Social Security cards, are so easy to forge and because no adequate
verification mechanisms are in place,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, R-Texas, said steps must be taken in the United States
``to protect our identity documents from fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   One civil rights group advised Congress to avoid creating a
``national ID card'' that could infringe on the privacy of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, who surrendered to a Texas Ranger on July 13
in El Paso, used forged or stolen documents to elude law
enforcement officials in several states. He was indicted in Houston
Thursday in connection with the December slaying of a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 39, has either been charged with or linked to
at least eight other slayings in Kentucky, Illinois and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During a congressional oversight hearing, Smith said Maturino
Resendiz:
</P>
<P>
   _ Used a fraudulent driver's license in Vermont in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bought or stole a voter registration card in 1987 from a
homeless man in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had three Social Security cards and a false U.S. passport when
arrested in 1988 by Immigration and Naturalization Service
officers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Possessed a forged Social Security card when arrested for
trespassing on railroad property in Pulaski County, Ky., in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a decade, Congress has been trying to address
the vulnerabilities in the documents that (he) was able to
exploit,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the Clinton administration for failing to implement
parts of immigration bills in 1990 and 1996 to curb fraud and abuse
of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services have
said part of the problem lies with the lack of set standards used
by states to issue birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration, meanwhile, has estimated it
would cost the government as much as $9.2 billion to issue
counterfeit-resistant Social Security cards to 277 million eligible
cardholders.
</P>
<P>
   And states oppose federal efforts to print Social Security
numbers on a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver's license is an authorizing document for driving
motorized vehicles, not a document intended to be used as an
identifier of U.S. citizenship,'' said state Rep. Brian Flaherty,
R-Conn., a vice chairman for federal issues with the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, U.S. lawmakers are considering measures that would
make it more difficult for illegal immigrants from cobbling
together identification cards to obtain legal status falsely. Those
measures also are aimed at protecting Americans from theft and
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Nojeim, legislative counsel with the American Civil
Liberties Union, warned that lawmakers are creeping toward a
national identity card, which he called ``one of the greatest
threats to personal privacy in the United States today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If mandated by Congress for one purpose, we know from
experience that a national ID card would eventually be required for
engaging in even the most routine transactions, from opening a bank
account to boarding an airplane to entering a building,'' Nojeim
said.

 &HT;    The Pokemon phenomenon deconstructed
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kids who play Pokemon, the insanely
popular card and video games derived from the Japanese cartoon,
speak in a language all their own. Call it Pokemonics.
</P>
<P>
   They talk HPs and evolutions and monsters named Magneton,
Snorlax and Vulpix with a speed and assurance that leaves adults in
a daze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chess I can play,'' says Cathy Hayes, whose son Shane Kelsey
is a fan of Pokemon (pronounced Poke-ee-mahn, Poke-ay-mahn and
Poke-uh-mahn). But the strategies, statistics and foreign-sounding
Pokemon names are another matter. ``There are so many things to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   What parents do understand is Pokemon's ability to bleed a piggy
bank dry.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon (short for pocket monster) is set in an imaginary land
inhabited by 150 creatures called _ as you may have guessed _
Pokemon. The humans act as Pokemon ``trainers,'' attempting to
catch as many of the creatures as they can. Once captured and
tamed, the creatures help nab other Pokemon so that their human
friend can earn badges and become a Pokemon Master.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon plotline is played out in a Japanese cartoon as well
as comic books, Game Boy cartridges, a Nintendo 64 game and now an
elusive, ever-expanding deck of cards that is at once tradable,
collectible and playable. Since debuting in January, more than 1
million cards have been sold in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting the cards and playing the game are ``just
addicting,'' says 11-year-old Ryan Jackson of West Palm Beach, who
owns a binder full of carefully arranged cards. ``It makes time
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yen and dollars, too. ``In terms of marketing, it's genius,''
says Jim Brogan, assistant manager at Past Present Future, a West
Palm Beach comics store that plays host to a weekly Pokemon card
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo has teamed up with Oscar Mayer to pack Pokemon trading
cards in Lunchables this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids will actually get in fights over those,'' says recreation
specialist Debbie Colson of Greenacres Leisure Services, which runs
summer camps. ``They will dig through the garbage to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Palm Beach Gardens Community Center, summer campers are
allowed to bring Pokemon cards only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and
then only to take them out at certain times and never when
listening to instructions.
</P>
<P>
   While Palm Beach County schools maintain a general ban on all
toys and games, some schools have fingered Pokemon as a particular
troublemaker. Poinciana Elementary in Boynton Beach, for example,
sent home notes midyear banning a triumvirate of trendy toys _
Pokemon, yo-yos and laser pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Say 'sayonara' to your Pokemon ignorance with this handy guide:
</P>
<P>
   Most lower-level Pokemon ``evolve'' into higher-level creatures,
which is when Pokemon wordplay starts to sound like Latin
declensions.
</P>
<P>
   Charmander evolves into Charmeleon, Charmeleon evolves into
Charizard (remember him?). If Nidoran is female, she becomes
Nidorina and then Nidoqueen. If Nidoran is male, he evolves into
Nidorino and then Nidoking.
</P>
<P>
   A few more examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pidgey ... Pidgeotto ... Pidgeot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poliwag ... Poliwhirl ... Poliwrath.
</P>
<P>
   _ Machop ... Machoke ... Machamp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Huey ... Dewey ... Louie. (Just wanted to see if you were
paying attention!)
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu! (Gesundheit!)
</P>
<P>
   If you know only one Pokemon, let it be Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   A Mouse Pokemon that looks nothing like a mouse, Pikachu is sort
of the phenomenon's mascot. His yellow, bloated form decorates
everything Pokemon, from pencils to packets of Lunchables.
</P>
<P>
   Pikachu even graces a VW Beetle that makes stops at special
events hosted by Nintendo, the company that brings you Pokemon
video games.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Pikachu so special? Well, in Episode 1 of the Pokemon
cartoon, the young hero Ash selects the mustard-colored rodent as
his first trained pocket monster.
</P>
<P>
   His exalted status is further celebrated in a special Pikachu
edition for Game ... Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Pikachu
</P>
<P>
   There are actually 150 Pokemon, and each possesses a quirky name
and special powers.
</P>
<P>
   The hip parent can name at least a few Pokemon beyond the
ubiquitous Pikachu. Demonstrate how cool you really are by tossing
these names around:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charizard _ Flame Pokemon that spits fire hot enough to melt
boulders. A trading card bearing his coveted image can fetch up to
$90.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meowth _ Cat Pokemon. Nonchalantly refer to your family's
feline friend as ``Meowth'' and prepare for astonished, admiring
glances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jigglypuff _ Perhaps the most ridiculously named Pokemon.
Coming in a close second: Wigglypuff. How monstrous are these
monikers?
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon connection
</P>
<P>
   The whole Pokemon phenomenon is based on a Japanese cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that a special effect in a 1997 Pokemon episode
caused seizures and nausea in almost 700 Japanese children. The
strobing light effect was removed from the cartoon before it was
broadcast in America.
</P>
<P>
   Total media penetration is imminent: A CD of the cartoon's
soundtrack, including the theme song and a Poke rap, was released
late last month, and a major motion picture, ``Pokemon the Movie:
Mewtwo Strikes Back,'' will hit multiplexes Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   You are getting sleepy...
</P>
<P>
   This is the part that parents love.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon is nonviolent in the same way that professional
wrestling is nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the monsters Water Gun, Tail Whip and Seismic Toss one
another, but no monster really gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon victims only go to sleep, become paralyzed or act
confused. (Similar reactions have been known to occur among adults
who try to learn the card game.)

GREENSPAN READY TO PUT BRAKES ON THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks after raising interest rates a notch, Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday that he stood ready
to raise rates again if signs of inflation appear in the booming US
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in testimony before Congress about monetary policy,
said he was uncertain of how long productivity gains and low
commodity prices, both of which have held inflation in check, would
continue to do so. But, the Fed chairman reassured Congress that he
would act immediately if signs of inflation flare.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and
price increases will be picking up,'' the Fed would ``have to act
promptly and forcefully'' to preclude the need for stronger
measures down the road, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Greenspan's comments were harsher than they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately the market did not like what he had to say,''
said Bryan Piskorowski, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``It's
fairly hawkish. We were expecting more of a feel-good type
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 33.56
points, an insignificant move that put the index at 10,969.22. The
technology-heavy Nasdaq, which is viewed as more sensitive to
interest rates, dropped 77.29 points, or 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Greenspan's remarks carried more impact, driving the
German, French, and British bourses down further. Europe, which has
suffered from a weak euro, would be hit harder by any signals of
inflationary fears leading to higher US interest rates, which would
further erode its currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 296 companies in 11 countries
that use the currency, ended down 2.98 points, or 0.9 percent, at
322.18.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's comments were viewed in the context of the Federal
Open Market Committee's move on June 30 to increase interest rates
a quarter of a point, to 5 percent. At the same time, the committee
also lifted its bias toward further rate increases in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Interpreting Greenspan's remarks, Carol Stone, deputy chief
economist for Nomura Securities International in New York, said
Greenspan seemed to say the June rate hike was not ``necessarily
all they would need to do _ that one rate hike would not completely
erase the risks of inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief risks, according to Greenspan, lay in a strong global
economy and a tight US labor market.
</P>
<P>
   With US unemployment at 30-year lows, economists said pressure
could increase on wages, especially if strong productivity gains do
not continue. Rising wages could, in turn, fuel inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan also talked about the influences of a world economy on
US prosperity and US inflation. As nations in Asia emerge from
recession and Latin American countries grow stronger, with demand
for commodities picking up, price pressures could result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improving global prospects also mean that the US economy will
no longer be experiencing declines in basic commodity and import
prices that held down inflation in recent years,'' Greenspan warned
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked of the potential for a ``bubble'' in US financial
markets but remained more concerned about the impact of high stock
prices on US consumer spending, which may cause the economy to
overheat. High stock valuations have fueled spending and cut into
savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity
prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future
become relatively small,'' he said. ``Such straying above
fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the
inevitable adjustment occurs.''

NATO COMMANDERS EXTEND DEADLINE FOR KOSOVO REBELS TO TURN IN HEAVY
WEAPONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ A failure by the Kosovo Liberation Army to
turn in a sufficient number of its heavy weapons, including mortars
and antitank and antiaircraft guns, has forced NATO commanders to
extend the deadline for compliance with a disarmament agreement to
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that it was apparent that the rebel
commanders had hidden large stockpiles, and that the peacekeepers
fear growing divisions among the rebels could lead to factional
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned by continuing attacks against Serbian
civilians who remain in Kosovo. An estimated 80,000 of the 200,000
Serbian residents have left the province since the NATO force was
deployed in June.
</P>
<P>
   The force commander, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, sought to play
down the inability of the rebel army to meet the deadline _
midnight Wednesday _ that was set in the disarmament agreement,
which was signed June 21. He said he had agreed to a request from a
rebel general, Agim Ceku, to postpone the deadline until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged by the quantity of weapons that have been
handed in over the past few days,'' the British general said.
``What is needed is the time to insure that the accounting process
is completed correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior NATO officials said the equipment turned in so far by
the KLA to the 14 designated sites was broken, in poor repair or
useless. They said rebel commanders were arguing about what
military hardware had to be turned over, and in some areas had
failed to cooperate with peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had stuff turn up that was captured from the Serbs at
the end of the war,'' said one NATO officer, who refused to be
identified. ``We have had boxes of unopened equipment from Albania,
as well as hardware that is so old that it would be risky to use.
The KLA is holding back a lot of stuff and we want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remain two problems: we are unsure of the quantity of
these weapons and do not yet have the will to go hunt them down. As
long as this much material remains in their hands, we have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 21 agreement gave the rebels 30 days to hand in all
weapons with a caliber of 12.7 millimeters or more, as well as
antitank weapons, antiaircraft guns, grenades, land mines and
explosives. NATO officials said it was especially disturbing that
large numbers of mines believed to be held by the rebel group have
not been turned over.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are also supposed to turn in 30 percent of their
long-barreled assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 60 days, the remaining light weapons and all
uniforms are to be turned over. ``One of our problems has been
simply finding civilian clothes for the fighters who turn in their
uniforms,'' said a NATO officer involved in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson stressed that he did not regard the delay as a lack of
good will on the part of the fighters. ``I do not regard this as
noncompliance but rather as an indication of the seriousness with
which General Ceku is taking this important issue,'' the general
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because weapons dribbled into the province from Albania,
Montenegro, Macedonia and even Serbia during the war, it is
impossible to get an accurate estimate of what is in the rebel
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officers said the weapons turned in so far were clearly
a fraction of what the guerrilla army must have had to support its
yearlong fight against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because most weapons are being brought in by pack horse,
there were not many heavy weapons, with few mortars above 81
millimeter.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they were willing to give the KLA some
flexibility, especially since the Serbian forces were unable to
meet the deadlines for withdrawal from Kosovo in June. They also
said that they did not want to antagonize rebel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a lot of problems here, but it is too early to
assume that the problems have already begun,'' said a British
officer. ``For now we will look, to a certain extent, the other
way, but if things keep up like this, we will not be encouraged.''

   Nguyen is Amerasian, the offspring of a Vietnamese mother and an
American civilian employee of the Navy, whom he never met.
</P>
<P>
   His mixed heritage made him an object of ridicule and prejudice
in Vietnam's racially homogeneous society during his first 12 years
in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City. Schools refused to advance him
beyond the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I lived on the street and tried to help my

</P>
<P>
   Being an Amerasian finally helped him immigrate to the United

moved to nearby Arlington and Grand Prairie.

   Unlike Texas state prisons, county lockups afford few
recreational amenities and no educational opportunities, Nguyen
said. He said he has endured beatings by fellow inmates. Fights
often broke out over viewing English or Spanish TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Caught between Hispanic and African American gangs, who viewed
him as Asian, Nguyen said he also has faced open enmity from
Cambodian and Laotion detainees who see him as Anglo _ with Anglos
representing the despised American authority that put them away.
</P>
<P>
   He has been detained in Denison, Corsicana, Dallas and Fort
Worth during the past 20 months. The frequent moves and far-flung
locations have made it impossible for his impoverished family to
visit him more than a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Nguyen traces his biological father and wins citizenship
through virtue of being an American's son, he would face
deportation to Vietnam after his eventual release if an extradition
treaty is signed with Hanoi, INS officials said.

SATURN'S SCOPE AND CARS GET BIGGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturn, General Motors' heretofore small-car company, is moving
into the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Well, bigger, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since GM, rolled out the subcompact Saturn
coupe, sedan and wagon in 1990, consumers have a couple of midsize
Saturns they can trade up to, the new 2000 L-series.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time coming _ too long for some Saturn dealers and
customers. People tend to buy small, inexpensive cars for their
first new vehicles. But as their incomes and their families grow,
they often want to move up to bigger and more expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's very loyal owners have been trapped. Many of them have
reluctantly abandoned the brand out of necessity. You can hang onto
a subcompact just so long as the kids get bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, then, the new Saturn LS sedan and LW wagon, midsize
entries that begin rolling out of the factory this week. Built at a
GM plant in Wilmington, Del., these cars represent another
departure from the norm for Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, all Saturns were built in quaint little Spring Hill,
Tenn., in a factory designed and built for the new GM subsidiary
whose goal was to build a small car to compete with the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Another departure from the norm is that the LS and LW aren't
original all-Saturn designs, as the smaller Saturns were. These new
midsize cars are built on the chassis of the GM German Opel Vectra,
which is the same platform that Saab is using for its new 9-5
luxury-car.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their similar size, the comparisons between the Saturn
and the 9-5 are few. Saturn designed the bodies for the LS and LW,
and the vehicles use new engines that are exclusive to the Saturn
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are roomy and somewhat more luxurious than one would
expect for the price, which is half that of a Saab 9-5. This isn't
to say that with the Saturn, you're getting a Saab for half-price.
But the relationship does bring the Saturn into a higher class
without a premium price.
</P>
<P>
   Both the sedan and wagon drive smoothly, quietly and with more
pep than any Saturn before them; the difference is astounding.
Whereas the small Saturns are nice econoboxes, the LS and LW are
vehicles that put Saturn in a whole new class, right alongside the
stiff competition from the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan
Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are more than competitive. The base model sedan, called
simply the LS, lists for $15,450 (plus $440 transportation),
equipped with the 137-horsepower, 2.2-liter, twin- cam
four-cylinder engine, a five-speed manual transmission and
air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The midlevel LS1, with a list price of $18,050, comes with the
four-cylinder engine, four-speed automatic transmission,
air-conditioning, power windows and door locks, and an
AM/FM/compact-disc stereo with eight speakers. The similarly
equipped LW1 wagon is priced at $19,275.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want even more, there are the LS2 sedan at $20,575
and the LW2 wagon at $21,800. The primary difference is the engine:
These models are equipped with Saturn's new 3.0-liter four-cam V-6,
rated at 182 horsepower and 190 foot-pounds of torque. Automatic
transmission is standard on these.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn President Cynthia Trudell, who spent part of a day
recently riding in the right front seat with me as I test drove
both the sedans and the wagons, said she has high hopes for the new
cars, as well as for a new sport-utility that Saturn will introduce
in a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got final approval for the sport-utility,'' she told
me.
</P>
<P>
   Trudell knows that making conquests among Camry and Accord
owners will be tough for Saturn, but the midsize vehicle market is
huge _ more than two million cars annually _ and she firmly
believes that there is room for Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Initial sales will probably come from owners of smaller Saturns
who want to move up, and that's OK, Trudell said. That will keep
those consumers from abandoning the Saturn brand. But Saturn
officials also hope to gain significant sales from outside the
Saturn family, particularly among those who want Japanese-style
quality in an all-American vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The L-series sedan, which measures 190.4 inches long and carries
a 106.5-inch wheelbase, is about two inches longer than the Camry,
the nation's top-selling car for the past three years. The Camry's
base four-cylinder engine is less powerful than the Saturn's, but
the Camry's V-6 _ the top choice of consumers _ is a bit more
powerful than Saturn's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Saturn V-6 is no slouch. It takes the car from zero
to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds. Even the four-cylinder offers more than
adequate power for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling is Japanese-like. As with smaller Saturns, the
sides of the L-series bodies are made of composite plastic, which
is extremely durable and ding-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   The wagons are expected to be a big hit for Saturn. Dealers and
focus groups have gone nuts over the wagons. Dealers have told
Saturn that they expect to sell one wagon for every three sedans.
If that's so, Saturn will have to increase wagon output from the
planned 20 percent to 25 percent of total production, Trudell said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the sedan and wagon are identical from the front to the
back of the rear seat, and interior ergonomics are excellent. It's
obvious that great attention has been paid to the details. The
L-series seats five comfortably _ two in the front bucket seats and
three in the rear/bench. For safety's sake, no third seat is
offered in the wagons.
</P>
<P>
   The L cars are as roomy as anything in the class, and roomier
than most. The sedans have huge 17.5-cubic-foot trunks. The wagon
has a whopping 29.4 cubic feet of cargo space. That expands to more
than 71 feet with the back seat folded down.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is an astounding 24 miles per gallon in the city
and 32 mpg on the highway for the four-cylinder models with manual
transmission. It drops slightly to 23/32 with the automatic. The
V-6 engine, available only with automatic, is EPA rated at 20 mpg
city/26 highway.
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   2000 Saturn L-series sedan, wagon
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, four-door, five-passenger, four-cylinder
or V-6 powered, front-drive sedan or wagon, a completely new model
for 2000. Highlights: Saturn opens a new chapter in its history by
rolling out its first midsize vehicle, giving dealers a second
vehicle to sell along with the subcompact S-series. Styling, inside
and out, is Japanese-like, and performance is excellent with the
optional V-6 engine. Prices are competitive with both U.S. and
import competitors.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: No complaints.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Taurus, Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Malibu,
Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Nissan Maxima, Mazda 626.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 24 miles per gallon city, 32 highway (four
cylinder, manual); 20 city/26 highway (V-6, automatic).
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE: $15,549 plus $440 transportation (four-cylinder,
manual sedan); $19,275 (four- cylinder, automatic wagon); $20,575
(V-6, automatic sedan);
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus.

Monkeying around inside the computer 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I lost the jewel case my Windows CD came in. I
want to reinstall Windows, but I know I'm going to need the
registration key that's on the back of the case. _ Pain by Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Dear Pain: As long as your current installation is still
running, you can find that key buried deep within the Registry, but
I really hate telling people how to poke around in there. It's like
leaving a monkey alone in your house with a jackhammer and a fifth
of bourbon: Even though Bobo means well, you can bet your Elvis
commemorative plate is going to wind up in several million pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But, if you absolutely have to know that key, here goes. All you
software-bootlegger wannabes, please go read Hints From Heloise for
about 10 minutes. It's not that I don't trust you not to churn out
several thousand copies of Windows with your brand new CD burners,
but I hear Heloise has some really cool advice about what to do
with old coffee grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Geez, those guys were gullible! Now that we've gotten rid of
them, put your jackhammer down, pick Run from the Start menu and
type in Regedit.
</P>
<P>
   In the left pane, you have an Explorerlike list of folders.
Double-click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to open it, then open the
following subfolders in this sequence: Software, Microsoft,
Windows, CurrentVersion. Now in the right panel look for ProductKey
and you'll see the magic number next to it.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're here, there a few harmless things you can play
with, but if you break something, I'm going to deny I told you how.
In fact, you might want to practice on your boss's computer. Try
changing RegisteredOwner and RegisteredOrganization by
right-clicking on them, selecting Modify, then typing in new
values, like ``Boneheaded Jerk'' and ``Two-Bit Operation.'' I'm
sure the boss will get as much of a kick out of that little
surprise as you will.
</P>
<P>
   Ooops! The bootleggers are finished with Heloise. And that is
why even attempting to open the Registry will send simultaneous
alerts to Microsoft and the FBI, resulting in your arrest and
prosecution. Glad to help!
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: My Programs menu isn't alphabetized anymore.
Can't Microsoft get anything right? _ A to Z
</P>
<P>
   Dear A: Eventually they do, but it takes a while. I'm still
waiting for them to finish debugging Windows 2.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, stuff should be alphabetized in your Programs and
Favorites menus, but unruly installation programs have a tendency
to goof up the Registry settings that take care of that. Please
don't go barging into the Registry like that last guy, unless you
know what you're doing, and believe me, you probably don't.
</P>
<P>
   Go download Internet Explorer 5 from Microsoft even if you hate
using IE. You're not only downloading a browser, you're also
getting several system enhancements, including the ability to
right-click on an open menu and alphabetize it.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're absolutely dead-set against IE, Windows 98 allows
you to drag Program menu items around so you can put them in order
yourself. Put your cursor on the item, hold the left mouse button
down and drag to your heart's content. Of course, this assumes that
you have at least a passing familiarity with the alphabet.
Considering where you've come for help, I find that entirely
unlikely.
</P>
<P>

Registry this week. Are you really going to take advice from this
idiot? Send taunting limericks to drbombay(AT)star-telegram.com or

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With the new movie ``Inspector Gadget,''
we look at our favorite movie gizmos _ from cool copters to
exploding gum.
</P>
<P>
   The movie: ``Men in Black''
</P>
<P>
   The gadget: Memory eraser
</P>
<P>
   Why it's cool: It looks like a ballpoint pen with a red laser on
top. Hold it up to somebody's face and, poof, memories are gone. If
only life were that easy.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up gizmos: The upside-down car, the big alien stun gun,
those ``I make this look good'' Ray-Bans.
</P>
<P>
   The movie: ``You Only Live Twice''
</P>
<P>
   The gadget: Little Nellie
</P>
<P>
   Why it's cool: It's 007's very own fold-up, flying helicopter!
With flame-throwers, land mines and missiles! It's called ``Little
Nellie!'' (OK, we're not so sure about that one.)
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up gizmos: From James Bond movies? The jet pack, the
underwater car, the fully armed briefcase, the ... We don't have
enough space.
</P>
<P>
   The movie: ``Wild Wild West''
</P>
<P>
   The gadget: Dr. Loveless' wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Why it's cool: Because it's so goofy. Can't beat that steam
engine in the back. With a ham on top (that being Kenneth Branagh's
performance.)
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up gizmos: A billiard ball that emits sleeping gas, a
belt buckle with a derringer inside, that big old tarantula.
</P>
<P>
   The movie: ``Mission: Impossible''
</P>
<P>
   The gadget: Gum.

 &HT;    `Inspector Gadget:' No character, no plot, just doohickeys
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Don't think of ``Inspector Gadget'' as a
movie. Think of it as a toy with a thousand moving parts,
doohickeys and gizmos. A great big gadget, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   This will make it much easier to enjoy what small bits of
entertainment it throws your way and ignore the fact there's really
no movie there.
</P>
<P>
   As long as studios persist with the idea there's a live-action
film to be made from every cartoon, we're bound to endure mishaps
such as ``Inspector Gadget,'' based on the animated series. What
little joy the TV version offers _ and I stress little _ the movie
can't match. There's nothing to flesh out here: It's a cartoon, for
Pete's sake.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, ``Inspector Gadget'' is a cop with more
than an ample number of tricks up his sleeve. Or hidden under his
hat, as is often the case. With a simple command of ``Go, go,'' he
can release an arsenal of ``weapons'' (toothpaste included) or turn
his headgear into a helicopter. As one character describes him,
he's Columbo meets Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all very interesting, except the movie has such a thin
story _ and such one-note acting _ behind it, the gadget wears
thin. Instead, it plays like a cinematic catalog for the Sharper
Image, which is actually one of several companies to receive a
prominent plug during the picture.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet ``Inspector Gadget'' (a stiff but likable
Matthew Broderick), he's John Brown, a security guard at a research
facility, where scientist Brenda Bradford (a bland Joely Fisher) is
exploring the latest in robotic technology. When the evil Sanford
Scolex (an insufferably cartoonish Rupert Everett) steals
Bradford's secrets, Brown tries to intervene, only to be blown up
in a car wreck. Through extensive surgery, he's given a new lease
on life by Bradford, who reincarnates him as ``Inspector Gadget,''
a goofy but potent crime-fighting machine. His chief mission? To
bring down Scolex.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to the flick. The rest is just sight gags, a
couple of which are reasonably clever and funny. I like Gadget's
car, which comes with its own candy and soda dispenser (yet another
opportunity for product plugging). But director David Kellogg falls
into the trap of trying to coexist in two worlds, the drama of
live-action and the absurdity of animation. But we can't believe
Gadget is a real person as long as an umbrella is capable of
popping out of his head.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line? Your kids will probably get a kick out of some
of the visuals and you may too. But as a movie, ``Inspector
Gadget'' is like a toy destined for a clearance sale.

ADMINISTRATION BACKS SOUTH AFRICAN AIDS DRUG LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. trade official said Thursday that the
Clinton administration supports a South Africa's controversial
effort to circumvent patent laws by producing low-cost versions of
U.S. AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government took the action because nearly 3.3
million of its 43 million citizens are infected with the virus that
causes AIDS, and the cost of the drugs _ about $12,000 annually per
person _ is out of reach for most.
</P>
<P>
   The South African law would allow companies in that country to
manufacture generic classes of drugs to treat the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome over the objections of the U.S. companies that
hold the patents.
</P>
<P>
   The law would institute what is known as ``compulsory
licensing'' and ``parallel importing,'' in effect allowing the
South African health minister to issue manufacturing licenses for
the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The law is being challenged in South African courts by U.S. and
European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Papovich, an assistant U.S. Trade Representative who
specializes in intellectual property issues, told a House
subcommittee on drug policy that South Africa is undergoing a
``serious health care crisis,'' pitting the administration's desire
to protect patent rights of American companies against the needs of
a developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that AIDS is a special case which may require
special measures,'' Papovich said, adding that ``contrary to our
general approach, we raise no objection to compulsory licensing or
parallel importing of pharmaceuticals on the part of South
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, South Africa and the administration are in
negotiations over amending the law so that it better protects the
intellectual property rights of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to chart a course that assists in improving access
to affordable medicines while not freezing the financial incentives
that field continued research and production of new drugs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS deaths have dramatically declined in the West because of
advances in treatments, but they are rising in Africa, where the
disease is the leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. pharmaceutical makers complain that the South African
law violates World Trade Organization patent rules and will stifle
industry innovation because it would rob companies of revenues that
are plowed back into research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The law and subsequent amendments ``seriously undermine the
terms of intellectual property and patent protection for
pharmaceuticals in South Africa,'' the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``presents a serious threat to the viability of American
pharmaceutical investment in South Africa,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   John Siegfried, the senior medical officer at the trade group,
told the House panel Thursday that the $2 billion in annual AIDS
research the industry spends is contingent on secure worldwide
patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property protection and market pricing are the
keystones of, and are essential to, this research effort,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ The ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., a
reluctant celebrity who had found snatches of privacy aboard kayaks
and yachts, were committed to the deep Thursday afternoon during a
Roman Catholic ceremony carried out beyond the reach of long-range
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   His final rest came within sight of the beaches where he had
spent childhood summers hunting for pirate wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Three wreaths of red, yellow and white blooms trailed a Navy
destroyer, the USS Briscoe, after the committal of Kennedy, 38; his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette, 34, to the Atlantic Ocean, about 3 miles from the spot
where Kennedy's plane crashed Friday night as they approached
Martha's Vineyard Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The prayerful gathering of 15 family members on the Briscoe's
stern followed the wishes of Kennedy, who pulled off a private
wedding three years ago and had been schooled to avoid prying
lenses by his mother, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tanned vacationers lined docks and breakwaters all
around Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Out of earshot and unable to
see the ceremony, they joined in the salute by doing what so many
had done all of Kennedy's life: They peered silently.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps a fitting send-off for a man whose public face was
the sum of so many fleeting images, Mario Piaggio, 45, rode in a
moving car as he videotaped the backs of people lining a road as
they tried to spot Kennedys a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, people viewed the son of the former president as
public property. Andrea Sciarretta, 13, said she had been dismayed
that Kennedy would not be buried with his parents at the eternal
flame in Arlington National Cemetery. ``But then I remembered how
much he loved the ocean,'' she said. ``So it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Navy for the commitment at sea was possible only
because of a special dispensation from Secretary of Defense William
Cohen in response to a request from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, John
Kennedy's uncle. Usually such ceremonies are reserved for active or
retired military members, their spouses and dependent children. A
Defense Department official said the service itself did not follow
military protocol, but instead was a religious service designed by
the family.
</P>
<P>
   The big ship steamed past the clanging buoys of Vineyard Sound,
then paused on the eastern edge of the crash site, just west of a
beach in the Aquinnah (formerly Gay Head) area of Martha's Vineyard
that Mrs. Onassis had willed to her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those on shore said that they found burial at sea, as
the committal ceremony is usually called, to be a comforting finale
for this dashing risk-taker who seemed more eager to rappel solo
down a cliff than to hang out with the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming to Martha's Vineyard, and now they're here,''
said Joan M. Tessier, 68, who was digging in the sand with three of
her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle F. Henley, 32, a crossing guard watching from shore,
said she was glad Kennedy has no gravesite that could become a
shrine for tourists. ``It would have been like Graceland,'' she
said. ``Now, no one can bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The committal at sea, which is rare for an American public
figure, reflected the close connection to the water that is held by
this political family, so often photographed on piers and beaches.
Kennedy's father, President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated
before his son turned 3, had spoken of humans' ancient connection
with the sea, noting in a 1962 speech that ``we have salt in our
blood, in our sweat, in our tears.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A larger, though still intimate, memorial service for Kennedy
and his wife is planned for Friday in New York City at the Church
of St. Thomas More, which seats 350. Edward Kennedy is scheduled to
deliver the eulogy. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette, an
investment banker, is to be held Saturday in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, though, was just for the families, with Edward Kennedy
carrying his nephew's remains aboard the destroyer. The Federal
Aviation Administration closed air space for 10 nautical miles
around the Briscoe, and any boats that tried to approach were met
by a Coast Guard crew and the barked instruction, ``One mile,
captain!'' A boatload of photographers wielding fishing poles
failed to fool the Coast Guard. So all that was seen of the
ceremony during the hours-long live coverage on local and
cable-news stations was a long-distance shot of the Briscoe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bessette family arrived early Thursday morning at the
Kennedy family compound here. At about 8:30 a.m., the two families
boarded a motorcade of sport-utility vehicles for the 22-mile trip
to the Coast Guard station at Woods Hole, on the Vineyard Sound.
The families mingled beneath three sea-blue pavilions, then a Coast
Guard cutter ferried the mourners out to the Briscoe. It was moored
about three miles away, giving the impression of a military
occupation of the tiny harbor at Woods Hole.
</P>
<P>
   The cutter tarried on the starboard side until a loudspeaker on
the Briscoe boomed a formal welcome that included the command:
``Approach!''
</P>
<P>
   The cutter, Sanibel, pulled aside the ship, steep stairs were
lowered, and mourners scrambled up. Black smoke puffed into a
cloud-specked sky as the Briscoe fired its engines.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, mourners in dark clothes joined Navy
officers in dress whites on the fantail, or back deck. The ashes
were released from the stern. A billowing flag, lowered to
half-mast, was raised as the ceremony ended and the Briscoe began
returning to harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The families, who mingled at a reception aboard the Briscoe
after it had returned to the Vineyard Sound, were on the water for
close to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Two Navy chaplains and a Catholic priest presided. Until 1963,
cremation was not permitted by the Catholic church, because of its
belief that the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, according to
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The rule was relaxed
by the Vatican in part because of the scarcity of cemetery space in
some countries with large Catholic populations, according to a
spokeswoman for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, did not attend
the service and was seen leaving the compound with a priest late
Thursday afternoon. It was the wedding of one of her daughters,
Rory Kennedy, that was John Kennedy's destination when his plane
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a note that could comfort relatives, yet came as a reminder
of an investigation that is expected to continue for many months,
the Massachusetts medical examiner's office announced Thursday that
autopsies overnight had shown that all three victims had died
instantaneously. The official cause of death was ``multiple
traumatic injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy requested that the customary photographs not be
taken during the autopsy so they could not be leaked to tabloids,
according to a family source.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Thursday's ceremony, the USS Grasp, the Navy salvage
ship that retrieved the body's, remained moored over the wreckage
as divers continued to recover chunks of the mangled craft.
Investigators said the plane was found upside down, with the roof
and wings sheared off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But these details all seemed very far off Thursday, as people
thronged lighthouses and drawbridges to peek at the Briscoe. Four
youngsters on their way home from summer school gathered daisies
and roses from residents' flower beds and tossed them under the
wheels of the family motorcade as it left Woods Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Friedman, 9, talked about all the good things Kennedy
might have done if he had lived. Daniel Walker, 10, thinks he would
have been president. But Kennedy surely would smile at the
assessment of Alex Fraenkel, 13, who declared, ``He would have made
it, even without being a Kennedy.''

BARAK PICKS UP DIPLOMATIC PACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A top aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
Thursday that Israel is prepared to resume talks with Syria at the
point they broke off three years ago, accepting a formula demanded
by Syria as a basis for renewed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also moved to calm Palestinian and Egyptian concerns that
he was trying to avoid the troop withdrawals from the West Bank
that are called for by the Wye River accords with the Palestinians
last October, by announcing that he would meet this weekend with
both Yasser Arafat and President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the diplomacy gathered steam, there was a fresh
warning of violence. A statement signed by the armed wing of the
militant Islamic group Hamas warned that the group, which is
virulently opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian accords, would renew
its attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli signal to Damascus followed Syrian criticism of
Barak for failing to declare during his recent trip to Washington
that he was willing to resume talks from the point where they broke
off in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria disagree on what that point is.
</P>
<P>
   Syria maintains that it received a commitment from Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin that in return for peace, Israel would be
prepared to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials emphatically deny that any such commitment was
made, and Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected the
formula, insisting that negotiations resume without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's chief of staff, Danny Yatom, said Thursday that the
formula demanded by Syria was acceptable to Israel, although its
interpretation was in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are familiar with the Syrian demand to declare that the
process will continue from the place where the talks stopped at the
start of 1996,'' Yatom said in remarks broadcast on Channel 2
television. ``We have no objection to that. It seems to me that
that the main problem is the interpretation by each one of the two
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Yatom's remarks came after the newspaper of the ruling Baath
party in Damascus demanded that Barak accept the Syrian formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talks could never resume without a declaration by Barak
accepting what was achieved when the talks broke off in February
1996,'' wrote the newspaper's chief editor, Terkey Saqr, in a
front-page commentary Thursday. ``This means acceptance of the
resumption of talks from the point where they left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak received more messages from Damascus in discussions
Thursday with Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, who met
with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria on Monday as part of a
Middle East tour. Aznar said the Syrian had asked him to convey
``some specific issues'' to Barak, but he declined to elaborate,
saying only that he had found ``an active will to reach peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to allay Palestinian concerns that he might give
priority to peace efforts with Syria while delaying Israeli
withdrawals in the West Bank, Barak scheduled meetings over the
weekend with both Arafat and President Mubarak to discuss carrying
out the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement by Barak's office said he would meet Arafat on
Saturday night at the Erez crossing between the Gaza Strip and
Israel, and travel to Egypt on Sunday to meet Mubarak, who often
counsels the Palestinian leader on his talks with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians and Egyptians have balked at proposals by Barak
to delay the last phase of troop withdrawals under the Wye accord
and combine it with talks on a permanent peace. Arafat insisted
this week that the accord, suspended in December by Netanyahu,
should be carried out immediately and fully, a position echoed by
Foreign Minister Amr Mousa of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to provoke political resistance at home by further
piecemeal withdrawals before a final peace settlement, Barak is
expected to offer Arafat movement on nonterritorial elements of the
Wye agreement, like a release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications Thursday that the release could be more
generous than in the past. Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said
Israel could no longer rule out freeing prisoners ``with blood on
their hands'' who had killed or wounded Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you negotiate with those who sent them,'' Beilin
said, ``and four Israeli prime ministers have shaken hands with
Yasser Arafat, you can't treat those they sent as people that
cannot be freed.'' But Beilin said he opposed freeing Palestinians
jailed for attacks committed after the 1993 Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
   The militant Hamas group, whose suicide bombers have killed

ADMINISTRATION BACKS SOUTH AFRICAN AIDS DRUG LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A U.S. trade official said Thursday that the
Clinton administration supports South Africa's controversial effort
to circumvent patent laws by producing low-cost versions of U.S.
AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The South African government took the action because nearly 3.3
million of its 43 million citizens are infected with the virus that
causes AIDS, and the cost of the drugs _ about $12,000 annually per
person _ is out of reach for most.
</P>
<P>
   The South African law would allow companies in that country to
manufacture generic classes of drugs to treat the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome over the objections of the U.S. companies that
hold the patents.
</P>
<P>
   The law would institute what is known as ``compulsory
licensing'' and ``parallel importing,'' in effect allowing the
South African health minister to issue manufacturing licenses for
the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The law is being challenged in South African courts by U.S. and
European companies.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Papovich, an assistant U.S. Trade Representative who
specializes in intellectual property issues, told a House
subcommittee on drug policy that South Africa is undergoing a
``serious health care crisis,'' pitting the administration's desire
to protect patent rights of American companies against the needs of
a developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that AIDS is a special case which may require
special measures,'' Papovich said, adding that ``contrary to our
general approach, we raise no objection to compulsory licensing or
parallel importing of pharmaceuticals on the part of South
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, South Africa and the administration are in
negotiations over amending the law so that it better protects the
intellectual property rights of foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to chart a course that assists in improving access
to affordable medicines while not freezing the financial incentives
that field continued research and production of new drugs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS deaths have dramatically declined in the West because of
advances in treatments, but they are rising in Africa, where the
disease is the leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. pharmaceutical makers complain that the South African
law violates World Trade Organization patent rules and will stifle
industry innovation because it would rob companies of revenues that
are plowed back into research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The law and subsequent amendments ``seriously undermine the
terms of intellectual property and patent protection for
pharmaceuticals in South Africa,'' the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The law ``presents a serious threat to the viability of American
pharmaceutical investment in South Africa,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   John Siegfried, the senior medical officer at the trade group,
told the House panel Thursday that the $2 billion in annual AIDS
research the industry spends is contingent on secure worldwide
patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property protection and market pricing are the
keystones of, and are essential to, this research effort,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV, weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.

PUBLIC HAS BETTER WEATHER INFORMATION THAN AIRLINE PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Television viewers often have more accurate
information about nearby storms than airline pilots trying to land
at many U.S. airports, the top official from the National
Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB, said severe weather warnings
issued to the public by the federal government's National Weather
Service are not provided to the federal government's Federal
Aviation Administration for relay to cockpit crews.
</P>
<P>
   Hall made his comments during a House aviation subcommittee
hearing on commercial airline operations during severe weather. The
hearing was convened in the wake of last month's American Airlines
crash in Little Rock, Ark., which killed 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the panel said greater efforts should be made to
ensure that air traffic controllers and pilots get up-to-date
weather information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, technology exists today that can detect severe
weather,'' said Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., chairman of the panel.
``The information is only helpful if it reaches the right people at
the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   The NWS was using a doppler weather radar six miles from the
airport to issue severe thunderstorm warning to the public, Hall
said. But this information ``was not available in real time to the
flight crew, air traffic controllers, or approach control,'' he
said. ``Safety board investigators are looking into this issue as
part of its investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the NTSB may recommend that the NWS give airports the
same severe weather warnings that are provided to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Doppler weather radar is the most sophisticated severe weather
detection system. This technology provides up-to-the minute
information on a storm's development and movement and allows air
traffic controllers at those airports to continually monitor storms
and notify pilots of the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   While the National Weather Service has enough doppler radar
systems to blanket the nation, the FAA has doppler radar at only 39
of the nation's busier airports. But dozens of small and medium
sized airports _ like the one in Little Rock _ are not equipped
with doppler radar.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that media outlets with NWS doppler weather
information are better informed than FAA-operated control towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``An airline passenger seated in the back of an aircraft
equipped with a satellite digital cell phone and a laptop
(computer) with a modem can receive real-time weather updates that
the crew flying the airplane cannot receive in the cockpit,'' Paul
McCarthy, the air safety chairman of the Air Line Pilots
Association, complained to the House panel.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather is the cause of 24 percent of accidents in
commercial and general aviation, according to the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   John E. Jones, the NWS deputy assistant administrator,
acknowledged that the NWS does not provide the FAA with the same
severe weather warnings that the public receives.
</P>
<P>
   The NWS weather information is delivered via computer ``almost
exclusively in small text files with very limited graphic
capability,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Loeb, director of NTSB's aviation safety office, said
the technology is available to provide real-time doppler weather
radar information offered by the NWS to all air traffic controllers
and pilots. But it would require better communications systems for
use between the NWS and the air traffic control tower and the tower
to the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The government's General Accounting Office last year found that
the FAA was not adequately coordinating weather activities with the
NWS and questioned the agency's commitment to adequately fund
aviation weather equipment.

 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an undercover operation last year, Chicago police officers
posed as local gang members and went shopping for firearms. Their
targets: the suburban gun stores that had sold the largest number
of guns recovered from city crime scenes or seized by police from
people carrying them illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In store after store, clerks sold guns to the undercover
officers, even as they boasted that they were going to take the
guns back to Chicago, where possessing a new handgun is illegal, or
that they needed new guns because they had lost theirs in running
from police. In many cases, the clerks gave the undercover officers
advice on how to get around federal and state gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, based on evidence from the sting operation, the
city of Chicago filed a $433 million lawsuit charging 12 suburban
stores, along with several gun makers and wholesaler gun dealers,
with creating a public nuisance by selling thousands of guns a year
to people who illegally took them into Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress debates the fine-tuning of laws governing who can
buy guns, Chicago and at least 20 other cities and counties have
begun a broad legal assault on the gun industry similar to the one
started by states five years ago against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   In lawsuits challenging the gun industry's marketing practices,
the cities are seeking to make the manufacturers responsible for
gun control, charging that they and the distributors and dealers do
too little to keep guns out of the hands of criminals in their
eagerness to make sales.
</P>
<P>
   The cities say they are taking steps against an industry that
federal officials have been unwilling or unable to challenge. One
example: Chicago got the names of the dealers it chose as targets
for its undercover investigation from the dusty records of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the federal agency that
regulates the sale of guns.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said of his
decision to sue the firearms industry, ``It was out of frustration
with the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATF has long pursued people who buy weapons to resell them
illegally. But its stance toward gun makers, distributors and
legitimate dealers is that of a partner dependent on their
cooperation for its criminal investigations, even as the bureau's
own system of tracing guns used in crimes or seized by police shows
that tens of thousands of the firearms are sold by licensed
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the ATF, an arm of the Treasury Department, said
that large numbers of guns traced to one dealer may reveal nothing
more than a store with high volume. Though ATF consultants
recommended in 1995 that the agency closely monitor the relatively
small number of dealers with high numbers of guns traced to them,
its Chicago office began doing so only in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago mounted its sting operation against gun dealers on
the basis of gun-tracing data collected in recent years. That
investigation, as well as a sting operation in Detroit, have taken
undercover undercover officers in those cities inside the sometimes
murky world of the firearms industry, where ATF agents rarely
venture without first announcing their presence.
</P>
<P>
   When ATF inspections of gun dealers are conducted, the agents
check gun-sale forms and inventory records to make sure they are
complete. But the sting operations point to troubling practices by
dealers, some of them possibly illegal, which paper records might
never suggest.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, for example, the authorities in Detroit and
surrounding Wayne County conducted an undercover operation against
10 stores and gun-show dealers. In each case, two undercover
officers went together to a dealer, one of them acting the part of
someone barred by law from buying a gun _ for example, a felon, or
someone under age. Nine of the 10 dealers sold a gun to the other
undercover officer, standing in as a straw purchaser for the
prohibited buyer, according to a lawsuit filed this year by the
city and county against the dealers as well as against
manufacturers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   In one videotaped transaction, a dealer at a gun show told one
officer that if he wanted to buy a gun for his friend, he had to
sign a required federal form and take the risk if the firearms
bureau discovered the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to tell me you are buying the gun and you want to lie
on the sheet, I don't care,'' the dealer said. ``This question here
says, `Are you buying this gun for yourself?' All of us know you
are not.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the dealers and companies sued by Chicago and Detroit
have denied any wrongdoing, though one dealer from the Chicago
area, Robert Taborden, settled with the city in April without
acknowledging fault and agreed to testify against gun producers and
sellers. Taborden has since closed his store, said his lawyer,
Stanley Jakala.
</P>
<P>
   The other cities and counties that have sued the gun industry
include Boston, Bridgeport, Conn., Newark, N.J., Camden, N.J.,
Atlanta, Miami-Dade County, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, St.
Louis, San Francisco, Sacramento, Calif., Berkeley, Calif.,
Compton, Calif., West Hollywood, Calif., Alameda County, Calif.,
and San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said that he would
soon file suit against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   THE DISCORD: Common Goals, Different Routes
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the cities' lawsuits is to establish a line of
responsibility for guns used in crimes from dealers up through
distributors to gun makers. Manufacturers, they argue, should know
that some dealers are selling far more guns than a local population
warrants. And by assisting the firearms agency in tracing guns,
they say, both makers and distributors should become aware of
dealers with large numbers of guns used illegally traced to them.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers respond that the ATF does not reveal the names of
such dealers to them, and lawyers for the manufacturers say they
are not liable for the actions of those dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly regulated market and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms has said very clearly who can buy guns and who
can't,'' said Anne Kimball, a lawyer in Chicago who represents gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   ATF officials point out that the vast majority of gun dealers
are honest and provide essential cooperation in tracing guns used
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share common goals with the firearms industry,'' said ATF
Director John Magaw in a prepared statement, ``to insure a
legitimate firearms industry and to keep firearms out of the hands
of criminals who prey on our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agency also works within severe legal constraints,
especially the provisions of the Firearms Owners Protection Act of
1986, a law championed by the National Rifle Association, which
limited the bureau's inspections of gun dealers, reduced penalties
for keeping false records of gun sales and raised the burden of
proof for violations by dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, as early as the 1970s, court decisions limited
sting operations by ruling that a dealer could not be convicted of
selling to a prohibited buyer, a felon, for example, unless the
undercover agent buying the gun was in fact a felon.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has also adopted its own limits. The bureau's head
agent in Chicago, Kathleen Kiernan, said it was highly unlikely
that the agency would conduct a sting operation to test whether gun
stores were bending the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be a natural strategy to employ unless there was
information to suggest an investigation'' of crimes like gun
trafficking, Ms. Kiernan said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the sting operation by Chicago police, however, the
U.S. attorney in Chicago has started an investigation of the
practices of gun dealers, said a federal official. A Justice
Department spokesman would not confirm or deny such an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Detroit and Chicago are using evidence of lax or
illegal gun-sale practices as the basis for their civil lawsuits,
rather than prosecuting the dealers in criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the Sports Authority gun store in Dearborn, Mich., for
example, a clerk was secretly videotaped telling two undercover
agents posing as buyers not to alert the outlet's manager that one
was buying a gun for the other, who had told the clerk he had a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is called a straw purchase,'' the clerk explained. ``It's
highly illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in April, the Sports Authority said it had
dismissed the clerk involved, saying he had violated company
policy. Lawyers for Detroit said that other clerks at the same
store had rejected the efforts of two other straw buyers to make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago authorities say that suburban gun dealers allowed
straw purchases and told officers posing as gang members that they
could buy several guns at one time without the store notifying the
bureau if they waited a week before claiming each gun.
</P>
<P>
   ATF spokesman Jeffrey Roehm said that for a store clerk to
explain the rule does not violate the law. But at least one gun
producer said that such store practices defeat the purpose of the
reports, which is to help the bureau identity people who buy
numerous guns for illegal resale.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be arrested and put in jail,'' said Paul Jannuzzo,
vice president and general counsel for the gun maker, Glock Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the agency's stance shows it is out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can merrily go along in this fantasy that you have secured
voluntary compliance with the firearms industry,'' said Julius
Wachtel, a bureau agent for 23 years until he recently retired,
``when in fact you've got no idea what you have.''

   THE DISCOVERY: Going to Records For Lawsuit Data
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents have long known from tracing guns seized in crimes
that people bent on mayhem often obtain weapons where it is
easiest: from places with lax firearm laws or at venues such as gun
shows where buyers can legally avoid a background check.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, lawyers for gunshot victims and those
working on behalf of cities have discovered the bureau's
gun-tracing data and have begun using it their lawsuits to accuse
gun makers of oversupplying dealers in areas with lax rules. The
suits charge that the defendants know that the guns end up in the
hands of criminals in cities like New York and Chicago where
handguns are tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   This year a Manhattan lawyer, Eliza Barnes, won the first
judgment in a lawsuit that charged gun producers with negligently
distributing firearms, using the bureau as ``the structural
foundation for everything that followed in our case,'' Ms. Barnes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers say that lawyers like Ms. Barnes are misusing
the data, which is collected to help solve crimes, to make sweeping
generalizations about firearms distribution. But the lawsuits by
Ms. Barnes and cities like Chicago might not have been filed but
for recent changes in how the bureau collects and analyzes data on
tracing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The history of tracing gun used in crimes and seized by police
from people carrying them illegally has been a tortured one. In
1978, the bureau proposed requiring that gun dealers report all
firearm sales directly to the bureau. But the National Rifle
Association, which opposes any step toward toward gun registration,
successfully backed legislation blocking the bureau from
``consolidating or centralizing'' any data on gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the bureau did not computerize any data for nearly
15 years. As recently as 1991, law-enforcement agencies sent the
serial numbers of only 42,000 guns to the bureau for tracing, with
the average trace taking 30 to 45 days. Only about 50 percent of
the traces were successful, as many of the guns were too old to be
traced.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, many of the 225 employees at the bureau's National
Tracing Center in Falling Waters, W.Va., microfilm the serial
numbers of guns sold by dealers that have gone out of business,
rather than entering the data into computers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-'90s, as a result of Clinton administration
initiatives to fight juvenile crime, the number of seized guns
traced by the bureau soared.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the bureau mainly traced guns to help police solve
crimes. But to gather information about juveniles' use of guns, the
ATF enlisted a growing number of cities to send the tracing center
the serial numbers of all guns seized in crimes. In 1998, the
bureau was sent the serial numbers of 200,000 firearms for tracing,
with the success rate remaining at about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also hired researchers at Northeastern University and
Harvard University to analyze the growing data. Some of their
initial findings were striking.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 report, Northeastern researchers found that less than
1 percent of the nation's gun dealers accounted for most of the
guns used in crimes or seized illegally. Other studies have found
that many of the guns were recovered from crime scenes relatively
soon after being sold at a gun store and that some buyers had
bought several handguns at once.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 report noted that the data did not mean the stores were
doing anything wrong. But it recommended that the bureau conduct
``more frequent compliance inspections'' of dealers whose sales
exhibited such patterns.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen. This April, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
released a report based on bureau data that listed the sites of
stores nationwide with the highest number of guns traced to them.
One of them, in Riverdale, Ill., a Chicago suburb, ranked second,
having sold 1,176 guns sent to the bureau for tracing 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF does not publicly disclose dealers' names because it
believes that doing so could compromise its criminal investigations
and jeopardize agent safety. But John Riggio Jr., the president of
Chuck's Gun Shop &AMP; Pistol Range in Riverdale Ill., said his store
was the dealership in question.
</P>
<P>
   Before last summer, ATF inspectors had not thoroughly checked
the records of Chuck's Gun Shop for four years, said Ms. Kiernan,
the chief ATF agent in Chicago. But agency officials said Riggio's
store, which is a defendant in the Chicago lawsuit, passed a recent
inspection and Riggio said that he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that anyone who buys a gun from his store must have
a state-issued license and pass a background check. When asked
about the results of the Chicago sting, he said that it was not up
to him to discriminate against any approved buyer based on what the
buyer looked like.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone walks in the door and they have a heartbeat,'' he
said, ``it's show time. It's time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   (The store that sold more seized guns than any other in the
three-year period was Badger Guns &AMP; Ammo in West Milwaukee,
according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The number was 1,195.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes, the lawyer who filed the successful New York suit,
says she learned about the bureau's gun-tracing records through a
chance conversation in 1995 with an outside contractor of the
agency. She said the contractor told her that he could sell her
three computer tapes of bureau gun-tracing data from 1989 to 1994
for $750.
</P>
<P>
   ``For $750, it sounded like a bargain,'' Ms. Barnes said. ``I
figured that at the worst, I could use it for foot rests.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In her civil suit, which she brought in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn on behalf of the families of seven New Yorkers killed in
shootings, she used the data to argue that gun manufacturers acted
negligently by oversupplying dealers in Southern states that have
weaker gun laws, knowing the guns would wind up in the hands of
criminals in New York. Industry lawyers disputed the argument, but
it convinced the federal judge to let a jury hear the case. The
jury's verdict in favor of the families is is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Chicago followed in the footsteps of Ms. Barnes, and
bureau officials quickly found themselves in a new and awkward
position: caught between the industry it regulated and cities suing
gun companies.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Chicago highlighted the agency's unease.
Initially, bureau officials refused to give lawyers for the cities
the names of local dealers with the highest number of guns traced
to them, citing legal restrictions on such disclosures, agency
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lawyers for Chicago, in preparing the sting
operation, drew up their own list of dealers to target by going
through long-neglected bureau gun-tracing reports themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Chicago police had annually sent thousands of
individual requests to the bureau to trace seized weapons, but they
had reviewed only the results for guns involved in high-profile
crimes like murders, said Sgt. Ken Barnas. Thousands of other
reports, each showing a gun dealer's name, remained at the bureau's
offices here, gathering dust.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Barnas and other officers were sorting the records by
hand. ``It was like you were going through the traces and it was
`Boom, Chuck's _ Boom, Chuck's _ Boom, Chuck's,''' said Sergeant
Barnas, referring to the Riverdale store.
</P>
<P>
   Roehm, the bureau spokesman, said that names were not released
to Chicago officials when they sought them under the Freedom of
Information Act because the agency did not want to set a precedent
that could make those names publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, four months after Chicago filed its suit, the
bureau released the dealers' names after Chicago officials
requested them under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the federal law
that created firearms tracing and encourages cooperation between
federal and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Detroit and Wayne County also used ATF data to
select some targets for their sting operation, said Cy V. Weiner, a
lawyer working with the city and the county. Other gun dealers were
chosen at random or suggested by former gang members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not matter whether they were dealers with high numbers
of traces or not,'' Weiner said of the results. ``They all fell for
the sting.''
</P>
<P>
   THE OUTLOOK: From New Records, The Winners
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits filed by cities like Chicago and Detroit must overcome
significant legal hurdles before they come to trial, and the rifle
association and gun makers have been lobbying state legislatures to
pass laws barring such actions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some industry lawyers like Ms. Kimball in Chicago
believe that the cities' legal efforts will eventually be undercut
by the same information they are using to mount their offensive:
the bureau's gun-tracing data.
</P>
<P>
   For example, plaintiffs' lawyers like Ms. Barnes argue that gun
makers know their guns end up in criminal hands quickly because
bureau data show that about one out of every three guns seized is
relatively new. But some former bureau employees dispute that data.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Crispino, who worked until recently at the bureau tracing
center, said in a 1998 report prepared for the defendants in Ms.
Barnes' case that newer guns were over-represented in the data
because they were easier to trace than older guns and so there
tended to be more requests for tracing them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimball says that she believes that as the ATF database
grows it will show that most crime guns are used or stolen, rather
than new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that ATF will get the universal traces it wants,'' she
said, ``because then people will get the truth and it will be very
hard for other people to distort it as they are doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   But more bureau data might only confirm the emerging patterns,
leaving gun makers unable to claim they are unaware of such
information. For example, Ms. Kiernan, the bureau agent in Chicago,
said that of 10,000 guns recovered in the city in recent years,
only 97 had been reported stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Jannuzzo, the lawyer for Glock, the handgun producer, said his
company had asked distributors to follow up with retailers who are
publicly identified as having a large number of guns traced back to
them, to see if they have any problems that might account for the
traces. He said that even though the bureau begins its traces with
the manufacturer, to identify the distributor that took the gun,
manufacturers often do not know why the agency is asking about a
gun or where the trace leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea who the stores are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In pretrial testimony in the Brooklyn case, several gun makers
said they did not compile the ATF's gun-tracing requests but threw
them out soon after suppling the agency with the name of the
distributor to whom they had shipped a gun that the police had
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Wednesday, Robert Delfay, president of the
National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group in Newtown,
Conn., said he believed it could be helpful if the ATF released the
names of dealers and distributors with high numbers of guns traced
to them. Gun makers could then see where problems might exist, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a system in place where they could be this
free exchange of information,'' Delfay said.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Delfay's comments, Roehm, the ATF spokesman, said
Thursday that the agency would be happy to meet with gun makers to
discuss the issue and see whether such information could be
provided to them.

<P>
   In an undercover operation last year, Chicago police officers
posing as gang members went shopping for firearms at suburban gun
stores that had sold the largest number of guns recovered from city
crime scenes or seized by police from people carrying them
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   In store after store, clerks sold guns to the undercover
officers, even as they boasted that they were going to take the
guns back to Chicago, where possessing a new handgun is illegal, or
that they needed new guns because they had lost theirs in running
from police. In many cases, the clerks gave the undercover officers
advice on how to get around federal and state gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, based on evidence from the sting operation, the
city of Chicago filed a $433 million lawsuit charging 12 suburban
stores, along with several gun makers and wholesaler gun dealers,
with creating a public nuisance by selling thousands of guns a year
to people who illegally took them into Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress debates the fine-tuning of laws governing who can
buy guns, Chicago and at least 20 other cities and counties have
begun a broad legal assault on the gun industry similar to the one
started by states five years ago against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   In lawsuits challenging the gun industry's marketing practices,
the cities are seeking to make the manufacturers responsible for
gun control, charging that they and the distributors and dealers do
too little to keep guns out of the hands of criminals in their
eagerness to make sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Chicago and Detroit are using evidence of lax or
illegal gun-sale practices as the basis for their civil lawsuits,
rather than prosecuting the dealers in criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   The cities say they are taking steps against an industry that
federal officials have been unwilling or unable to challenge. One
example: Chicago got the names of the dealers it chose as targets
for its undercover investigation from the dusty records of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the federal agency that
regulates the sale of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said he decided to sue the
firearms industry ``out of frustration with the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The ATF has long pursued people who buy weapons to resell them
illegally. But its stance toward gun makers, distributors and
legitimate dealers is that of a partner dependent on their
cooperation for its criminal investigations, even as the bureau's
own system of tracing guns used in crimes or seized by police shows
that tens of thousands of the firearms are sold by licensed
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the ATF, an arm of the Treasury Department, said
that large numbers of guns traced to one dealer may reveal nothing
more than a store with high volume. Though ATF consultants
recommended in 1995 that the agency closely monitor the relatively
small number of dealers with high numbers of guns traced to them,
its Chicago office began doing so only in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago mounted its sting operation against gun dealers on
the basis of gun-tracing data collected in recent years. That
investigation, as well as a sting operation in Detroit, have taken
undercover undercover officers in those cities inside the sometimes
murky world of the firearms industry, where ATF agents rarely
venture without first announcing their presence.
</P>
<P>
   When ATF inspections of gun dealers are conducted, the agents
check gun-sale forms and inventory records to make sure they are
complete. But the sting operations point to troubling practices by
dealers, some of them possibly illegal, which paper records might
never suggest.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, for example, the authorities in Detroit and
surrounding Wayne County conducted an undercover operation against
10 stores and gun-show dealers. In each case, two undercover
officers went together to a dealer, one of them acting the part of
someone barred by law from buying a gun _ for example, a felon, or
someone under age. Nine of the 10 dealers sold a gun to the other
undercover officer, standing in as a straw purchaser for the
prohibited buyer, according to a lawsuit filed this year by the
city and county against the dealers as well as against
manufacturers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   All of the dealers and companies sued by Chicago and Detroit
have denied any wrongdoing, though one dealer from the Chicago
area, Robert Taborden, settled with the city in April without
acknowledging fault and agreed to testify against gun producers and
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ATF agents have long known from tracing guns seized in crimes
that people bent on mayhem often obtain weapons where it is
easiest: from places with lax firearm laws or at venues such as gun
shows where buyers can legally avoid a background check.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, lawyers for gunshot victims and those
working on behalf of cities have discovered the bureau's
gun-tracing data and have begun using it their lawsuits to accuse
gun makers of oversupplying dealers in areas with lax rules. The
suits charge that the defendants know that the guns end up in the
hands of criminals in cities like New York and Chicago where
handguns are tightly controlled.
</P>
<P>
   One aim of the cities' lawsuits is to establish a line of
responsibility for guns used in crimes from dealers up through
distributors to gun makers. Manufacturers, they argue, should know
that some dealers are selling far more guns than a local population
warrants. And by assisting the firearms agency in tracing guns,
they say, both makers and distributors should become aware of
dealers with large numbers of guns used illegally traced to them.
</P>
<P>
   Gun makers respond that the ATF does not reveal the names of
such dealers to them, and lawyers for the manufacturers say they
are not liable for the actions of those dealers.

SPECIAL EFFECTS OF `HAUNTING' SMOTHER ANY REAL PSYCHOLOGICAL
TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1963 version of ``The Haunting'' is simply the best haunted
house movie ever made _ a masterpiece of ghostly suspense and
psychological horror that scores its points by suggestion,
directorial skill and strong performances. (You never actually see
any ghosts.)
</P>
<P>
   The inevitable 1999 remake follows roughly the same plot line
but, not surprisingly, goes in the other direction. Its haunted
house sets are gargantuan, nothing is left to the imagination and
the special-effects ghosts are all over the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It may pay off at the global box office (where bloated excess
always seems to count), but _ one or two quick shocks aside _ it's
not very scary. Anyone in the market for a chill would be better
off renting the video of the original, or going back to see the
``The Blair Witch Project'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Shirley Jackson's ``The Haunting of Hill House,'' the
much-altered new story is about an unethical psychologist (Liam
Neeson) who cons a group of insomniacs to a New England mansion
under the guise of helping them sleep while secretly conducting an
experiment on the nature of fear.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner is this group _ meek and vulnerable Nell (Lili
Taylor), bisexual bombshell Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and
wisecracky Luke (Owen Wilson) _ settled in the house than all heck
breaks out: noises, moving objects, Casper-like ghosts flitting
about, with Nell getting most of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before we're out of Act 1, the action escalates into a
full-scale blitzkrieg on the cast _ statues morph into life and
grab at them, the walls twist into human shapes and close in,
ghosts zoom around the screen like heavenly mosquitoes, and ...
well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, some of the effects are imaginative and fun, and
so is the haunted house set _ which one character describes as
``Charles Foster Kane meets the Munsters'' and is so vast it makes
the Winchester Mystery House look like a one-bedroom fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the film operates off a near-flawless performance
by Taylor, who must have seemed a risky choice for the lead of a
$100 million summer blockbuster, but is by far the best thing in
it, playing especially well off Zeta-Jones (the only sexual
chemistry in the movie).
</P>
<P>
   But the sets and effects are so overstated and cartoonish, they
work against the development of any real psychological terror; the
script makes no sense at all; and the rest of the cast is weak _
Wilson overacts outrageously; Neeson has never seemed such a blank
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding from his ``Speed 2'' fiasco, director Jan de Bont has
obviously reverted to the strategy that worked so well for him in
the original ``Speed'' and ``Twister,'' and tried to construct the
same kind of exhilarating, sense-clobbering, non-stop
amusement-park ride.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, it works. But it's a cheap thrill. Without
nail-biting suspense, delicious character play or room for our own
imaginations to create some terrifying possibilities, his film
generates more laughs than chills, and is instantly forgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The Haunting. Directed by Jan de Bont. Screnplay by David Self.
Cast: Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Lili Taylor,
Bruce Dern. DreamWorks Pictures. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
horror violence.

VA CHIEF SEES SOME HOPE FOR BUDGET INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo D. West Jr. said
Thursday he expected Congress to provide his agency with more
money, but he would not guarantee it would include the extra $3
billion sought by military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   West said he had ``seen signals'' from virtually every
congressional committee that the VA budget for next year would
rise. But he expressed doubt that the increase sought by major
veterans groups would be approved, saying, ``I don't think that's
what the Congress is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   West, who made his comments after speaking before 130 women
attending the 54th annual Gold Star Wives convention in San
Antonio, also said he was unaware of a General Accounting Office
report that showed his agency is wasting up to $1 million a day on
unneeded medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen that report but I'll say this, that it sounds
to me as if it's raising the question of declining populations in a
hospital system that is still the same size it's always been,''
West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what the report's about, it obviously presents some
issues we have to look at,'' he added. The General Accounting
Office is the auditing arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The VA system's patient load has dropped from 49,000 a day in
1989 to 21,000 in 1998, with nearly half the decline taking place
over the past three years. A GAO expert said VA hospital use is
likely to decline ``significantly'' over the next 20 years, as the
veteran population falls from 25 million to 16 million.
</P>
<P>
   How to best provide health services for veterans has become a
flashpoint of partisan debate on Capitol Hill. Republicans and
Democrats have wrangled over how much should be added to the
Clinton administration's request to spend $18 billion on the VA in
fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans have sought an additional $3 billion, saying anything
less would trigger VA health care cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Bill Bacon blamed West and the
Clinton administration for mismanaging the VA hospital system and
planning budgets that would force some facilities to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely intentional,'' said Bacon, leader of a
veterans group battling cuts at the VA hospital in Kerrville,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after his speech, West expressed confidence that
``Congress is going to do something about the budget.'' He did not
expect quick action because the VA's budget is usually among the
last approved by lawmakers. The next budget year begins Oct. 1.

DESPITE TECHNO EFFECTS, `INSPECTOR GADGET' LACKS ORIGINALITY,
CHARISMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never seen the popular cable TV cartoon show ``Inspector
Gadget'' _ and after viewing this live-action,
special-effects-laden film _ that's not about to change.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that there's anything particularly offensive or crude
about the movie. If anything, it's innocent in spirit and has an
almost 1950s chasteness _ and it's thankfully short. But it lacks,
despite the remarkable techno effects by wizard Stan Winston,
originality and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   It follows the formula set by tons of other kids films _ think
``Flubber.'' Its twists and turns are borrowed from movies such as
``Mission: Impossible'' and ``The Mask.'' Effects have once again
replaced the depth or breadth that characterize Disney's animated
films. Just look at ``Tarzan'' by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of a schlubby, non-descript security guard _
appropriately named John Brown (Matthew Broderick) _ who is in love
with Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher), an expert in robotics who has
a program to create the perfect crime-fighting machine. Bradford
calls her cyber protopoliceman a ``sophisticated network of tissue,
hardware and software.'' The police chief quips he's ``Columbo and
Nintendo rolled into one.'' All Bradford needs is a guinea pig for
her experiment.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown is critically injured on the job _ due to a dastardly
scheme implemented by the greedy Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett),
who tries to steal Bradford's invention in order to build an army
of techno-warriors he can sell to foreign militaries _ Bradford
realizes Brown is her man.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is surgically changed into a human hardware store called
Inspector Gadget, a not-so-super hero with a gizmo available at the
snap of a finger. Brown accidentally crushes Scolex's hand, turning
him into ``the Claw.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett goes overboard instilling Claw with menacing charm and
he's far more interesting than the mild-mannered Broderick who,
with his boyish everyman persona, lacks bite. And the film
introduces a jive-talking car (probably the year's second-most
irritating screen character after Jar Jar Binks), Gadget's grating
version of the Batmobile.
</P>
<P>
   While the film won't engage with young children, older kids may
find something to go nuts and bolts about. But from the response at
a preview screening, neither kids nor adults welded with the
too-tame, labored antics of Inspector Gadget. The best _ and most
clever _ part of the movie was a moment bolted into the closing
credits. If only the whole film had been that sharp and smart.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Gadget. Directed by David Kellogg. Written by Kerry
Ehrin, Zak Penn. Cast: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely
Fisher. Walt Disney Pictures. 77 minutes. Rated PG for mild
violence.

CIA DIRECTOR SAYS INEXPERIENCE LED TO CHINESE EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of the CIA disclosed Thursday that the
agency had selected just one target in the 11-week air war over
Yugoslavia, and its decision led to the accidental bombing of the
Chinese embassy in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only target we nominated,'' the director, George
Tenet, said at a rare public hearing of the House Intelligence
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike on May 7, which killed three Chinese and
wounded at least 20 others, the CIA decided it better go back to
its usual business of spying, a U.S. official said Thursday.
Reeling from its error, the agency almost immediately suspended
other preparations it was making to forward additional targets to
help NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet also acknowledged publicly that the CIA had employees and
maps that could have told military planners the correct location of
the embassy. But they were not consulted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Tenet and the deputy defense secretary, John Hamre,
recapped a now-familiar litany of bureaucratic errors the
administration says caused the accident _ including outdated maps,
faulty computer databases and a lack of safeguards _ it was the
director's remarks on the agency's selection of targets that
offered new insights into an accident that has dealt a stinging
setback to relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   From battle tanks to electrical power plants, deciding what to
hit in the air war was left largely to military experts in
Washington and Europe. But as the air campaign failed to achieve
quick success and dragged on longer than expected, the Pentagon
feared it would run out of top-notch targets and sought suggestions
from the CIA. ``We were very much looking for additional targets,''
Hamre said.
</P>
<P>
   At the CIA, analysts had long suspected the headquarters of a
Yugoslav arms agency was financing the Yugoslav military by selling
advanced technology to rogue nations, and jumped at the chance to
destroy a stubborn nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This episode is unusual because the CIA does not normally
assemble, on its own, target nomination packages containing the
coordinates of specific installations or buildings,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   The inexperience was clear from the start. The CIA team used a
flawed technique for locating the arms agency headquarters, Tenet
said. It had the correct street address for the arms agency,
Bulevar Umetnosti 2. But to pinpoint that location, the analysts
used a technique of comparing the number sequence on parallel
streets. Tenet said this practice offered only ``an approximate
location'' and was ``inappropriate'' for selecting aerial targets.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts compounded that mistake by using three maps to
locate the arms agency: two Yugoslav commercial maps from 1989 and
1996, and a U.S. government map produced in 1997. None showed the
location of the Chinese embassy, which was built in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the disaster did the CIA turn up in its files two
maps that accurately placed the embassy: one was a map handed out
by a Belgrade bank that showed a branch office near the embassy;
the other listed the embassy and its grid coordinates in its index
but did not mark the building on the map itself, an American
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Since this was the agency's first time developing a ``target
package,'' there was no procedure in place for senior officials to
review the work, Tenet said. ``This initial misidentification took
on the mantle of fact,'' he said. ``There was no cautionary
language associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Military planners never caught the mistake, partly because they
assumed the location had already been verified, Hamre said. A final
backup also failed when several computerized databases of sites
that were off limits to bombing, including embassies, hospital and
churches, did not have the current location of the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Database maintenance is one of the basic elements of our
intelligence effort, but it is also one that has suffered in recent
years as our workforce has been spread thin,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has taken several steps to avoid a
recurrence, including a system to update the databases. When
bombing cities, Tenet said, a new policy requires that government
officials familiar with the location be consulted, and ``sign off
on what a satellite picture says a site is or isn't.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN WOMEN'S STRIKE URGES MEN TO LIFT CONSCIOUSNESS - AND
TOILET BRUSHES
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY Clean a toilet? Make a taco? Change a diaper?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? That's something for you women or for
servants to do,'' says Alberto Romero, a 43-year-old Mexico City
auto mechanic. ``When I get home from work I'm tired, and the last
thing I want to do is get involved in those little things my
beautiful wife knows how to do so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero is exactly the kind of macho Mexican male that organizers
of a women's strike here Thursday were hoping would have to clean
up his own mess, for once, instead of relying on his wife, who also
works a full day as a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, which called on women not to perform domestic work
for 24 hours, was called by a Mexico City government agency known
as ProMujer, the Program for Equal Participation for Women.
</P>
<P>
   ProMujer or ProWoman _ was started by the government of
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a left-leaning politician who is the first
mayor of Mexico City to be chosen by voters in a democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico City's government is the first democratic government in
Mexico, and we think democracy begins at home,'' said Gabriela
Delgado, the director of ProMujer.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where many women still feel they must ask for their
husbands' permission to go out to a movie or enroll in a class,
housework is typically the domain of mothers, wives and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   But as more Mexican women start working outside the home,
however, they are becoming increasingly disgruntled with men's
attitude of helplessness when it comes to chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women around the world went on strike, then men would get
to work late with dirty shirts on and children wouldn't get fed any
meals,'' Delgado said. ``A lot of women work now and contribute to
the income of the family, but they have a double day of work
because men don't reciprocate by doing more housework.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado said Mexico City's government decided to promote the
24-hour work stoppage because July 22, Thursday, is recognized by
the United Nations as the International Day of Domestic Work.
</P>
<P>
   The strike appeared to be mostly symbolic, and many men and
women were unaware that it had been called. But Delgado was
confident that intense interest by the Mexican media on Thursday
would shake up many a household and get more women to elbow their
husbands into sharing more chores.
</P>
<P>
   Maru Trejo, a 43-year-old apartment manager, said she didn't
know about the strike but thought it was an idea whose time had
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and son only help me on Sundays,'' she said,
``because they say they should dedicate themselves to their work
and studies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Monday I have to go back to doing all the chores, and
it's heavy work with no pay,'' she said. ``But what can you do?
It's hard to change a 47-year-old man's habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero, the mechanic, isn't about to change his ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my wife that when we have kids, she'll have to stop
working because children require so much care care a man doesn't
understand. That's why God gave women the gift of having
children,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not macho,'' he concluded. ``I know there are some men who
cooperate with housework, and that's their business. But for now,
that's just not for me.''

ELECTION BATTLE FOCSS OF REFORM PARTY CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming this weekend, the followers of diminutive millionaire
Ross Perot are expected to clash with the loyalists of
wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura for control of the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the battle is election of the party's chairman.
Two Perot loyalists are seeking to replace current Chairman Russell
Verney, a Perot employee. Ventura is backing a third candidate who
has vowed to shake loose of the Perot faction's party control.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-day convention that begins Friday in Dearborn,
Mich., has more at stake than whether Perot, the party's founder
who won almost 20 percent of the popular presidential vote in 1992,
will remain its symbolic head.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this leadership struggle will decide who controls
the party's purse strings next year when the Reform Party's
presidential candidate is eligible for $12.5 million in federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While that amount pales next to the $60 million each that the
Republican and Democratic presidential candidates will receive, it
is enough money to launch speculation into who will head next
year's Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has not said whether he wants to run for president again,
as he did in 1992 and 1996. But Ventura already has tried to
recruit former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker to run, and Weicker
has said he will decide by August.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Patrick Buchanan has hinted he might leave his party
to run on the Reform ticket. And New York millionaire developer
Donald Trump has said that if nominated by the Reform Party, he
would run _ although the party has made no such moves.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hamphsire bolted from the
Republican Party, Smith toyed briefly with running for the Reform
nomination. But Smith decided to align himself with the U.S.
Taxpayers Party instead.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Reformists are worried that some of the potential
nominees might just be interested in the party's money. But he said
the party also would welcome potential candidates who embrace the
party's call for fiscal conservatism and political reform. The
party has little official interest in social issues dear to many
conservatives, like Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're coming simply to promote their own agenda and spend
the $12.5 million we've earned, then they are coming for the wrong
reasons,'' Verney said. ``We want them to first endorse us, our
principles of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign operatives privately are nervous about the
prospects of a Reform Party candidate in the general election. The
Bush family and many other Republicans blame Perot's 1992 bid for
cutting into President Bush's re-election support and costing him a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, Perot received 19 percent of the vote
nationally in 1992, but dropped to 8 percent in 1996 as the first
Reform Party candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls indicate that Perot did not actually affect the
outcome in either race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Perot drew voters from Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton
almost evenly. And only Ohio would have shifted from Clinton's
column to Bush's in the electoral college, but that still would
have left Bush far short of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, most of Perot's vote drop-off occurred among
independents who shifted to Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said the Reform Party has ballot status in 19 states, but
not Texas. To get on the ballot in Texas, the party will have to
collect more than 50,000 signatures next April and May, a drive
likely to cost $150,000 to $200,000. Verney said people seeking the
presidential nomination in August 2000 will be responsible for
getting on the ballot in states like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the benefit of the Reform Party's name ... then
you need to bring something to the party, and that's the ballot
access in the states where we don't have it,'' Verney said. ``In
order to participate for our party's nomination, they have to get
the ballot access.''
</P>
<P>
   Power struggles within Perot's political organizations are not
new, and his faction has always won so far. The most notable
attempt to break Perot's hold on the party occurred in 1996 with
former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm's unsuccessful bid for the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The latest struggle began boiling last year after Ventura's
surprise victory in the Minnesota governor's race. Immediately,
some in the Reform Party began touting him as a possible
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura last month withdrew his name from consideration as
presidential candidate, but he also made clear that he believed the
national Reform Party was in need of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that except for Minnesota and perhaps one or
two other states, the national Reform Party has declined
dramatically in recent years,'' Ventura wrote to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he supported Jack Gargan of Florida for chairman,
saying Gargan would move party headquarters out of Dallas, reform
the party's rules and make the party more of a grass-roots
organization with leadership coming from the bottom up. Gargan, 68,
has been a leader in the term-limits movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the convention delegates are not willing to elect and
support the best person for the job, I'll remain reluctant to fully
embrace the national Reform Party,'' Ventura wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Ventura's call to move the party out of Dallas shows
how little he knows about the party structure. Verney said the
party has no paid staff and members communicate almost exclusively
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party lives in cyberspace. We rent a post office
box in Dallas,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ventura published his letter, Verney announced
that he would not seek re-election as party chairman. Verney threw
his support to the party's current Vice Chairman Pat Benjamin, 58,
of New Jersey and Tom McLaughlin, 43, the party's Pennsylvania
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said his top priority would be building the party
into a national political force. He said he doubts Perot will run
again.

GORE TAKES TO CONNECTICUT RIVER TO DELIVER FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNISH, N.H. _ With the Connecticut River and the Green
Mountains serving as a pastoral backdrop, Vice President Al Gore
put on his environmental hat Thursday and delivered $819,000 for 29
improvement projects along the 410-mile river that curves through
four New England states.
</P>
<P>
   And that was after he and Governor Jeanne Shaheen canoed 3.5
scenic miles through shallow waters, with friends, supporters and
reporters paddling in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Although the announcement was billed as an official event,
rather than a campaign one, the environment is shaping up as a
critical issue in both the Democratic presidential primary and the
2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley is challenging Gore not only for the
nomination, but for the green mantle as well. And the Democratic
National Committee has already compiled material on Texas Governor
George W. Bush's environmental record, contending that it is not
very good.
</P>
<P>
   Among environmentalists in New Hampshire, the decision of whom
to support in the Democratic primary is not necessarily an easy
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a done deal in the least,'' said Tom Elliott, a
Hanover-area activist with the American Lands Alliance, concerned
with preserving untouched areas of the forests. ``The environmental
community is frustrated. We see a lot going wrong, a lot of things
not being done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's longstanding concern for the environment and his
authorship of ``Earth in the Balance,'' Ruth Cook of Franconia said
she is disappointed in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd heard more, I expected to hear more,'' said Cook,
chairman of the White Mountain School, which provides students with
an environmental education. Cook said she is planning to support
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gore cited the Clinton administration's
environmental accomplishments, such as the American Heritage Rivers
program that brought him to Cornish, but blamed Republicans for
obstructing progress in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been constrained by a Republican Congress,'' he said,
pointing to funding cuts for environmental programs and the
Congress's refusal to pass initiatives recommended by the Kyoto
international accord.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had no sharp words, however, for those who complain about
the Clinton-Gore record.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who say that are just like me _ they want to see more
done. And thank goodness they're out there pushing and fighting for
even bigger changes, because we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Huston of Keene is not disappointed, nor is she decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in the listening stage,'' said Huston, a member of
several environmental and conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
   She said she likes Gore's focus on reducing sprawl because ``the
things that are being paved over can't be reclaimed as open
space.'' But she said she would like him to be more aggressive
about curbing automobile and gasoline use, and she would like to
hear all the candidates talk about protecting the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Huston, an independent, said she finds Bradley's views on the
environment ``acceptable,'' and she said she realizes that Gore
can't do everything as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's very much limited and restricted in what he can
do,'' she said. ``He isn't president right now, there are political
realities he has to deal with, some of which I'm not even aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gore has his ardent supporters among
environmentalists, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area in which Al Gore has shown his courage,'' said
Martha S. Solow, a state representative from Hanover and a longtime
member of the Sierra Club and the Appalachian Mountain Club. ``He
has not wavered in the need to show concern about the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Lyman of Manchester has worked on federal and state
environmental legislation, as well as a program to reduce acid
rain. She hosted a party at her home for Gore and plans to vote for
him next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust that he is working within the system in a way that he
thinks best,'' Lyman said, ``and I would support him in those
efforts and encourage him to do more whenever he can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Gore said he will not yield to anyone when it
comes to protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my core commitments to the American people,''
said Gore. ``What you see is what you get. If you don't want a
president who will be committed heart and soul to moving heaven and
earth to clean up the environment in the right way, then vote for
somebody else, because that is what I will do, and I want people to
support me on that basis.''

`DROP DEAD GORGEOUS' CAN'T SUSTAIN ITS EARLY LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bogus documentary, or ``mockumentary,'' is fast becoming the
most overworked movie genre of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   This week's example of the phenomenon is ``Drop Dead Gorgeous''
_ a film within a film about a group of small-town Minnesota
contestants in a Miss Teen Princess Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   It's both a ``Fargo''-like satire of upper-Midwestern white
culture (``Yah, you betcha'') and a movie that _ like ``Election''
and ``Prom Night'' _ puts down a shallow high school event by
showing us how its values drive certain unstable characters to
murderous extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The front runner is Becky Leeman (Denise Richards), the
beautiful, overachieving daughter of the town's wealthiest family
who is president of everything (including the gun club) and has a
built-in advantage because her pushy, scheming mother (Kirstie
Alley) runs the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience is with Becky's
</P>
<P>
   rival, Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), the ambitious,
hard-working, infinitely more talented (she tap dances),
sweet-as-pie kid who lives in a trailer park with her alcoholic,
hairdresser mother (Ellen Barkin).
</P>
<P>
   The other contestants _ all of whom are on board for comic
relief and never have a chance of winning _ are a borderline
nymphomaniac, a chubby girl recently adopted by a Japanese
immigrant family (and now ``proud to be an Asian American''), and a
giggly rebel who can't stop talking about her brother, a New York
drag queen.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 minutes or so are hilarious: the actors are razor
sharp, the satire crackles with authenticity (writer-producer Lona
Williams is herself a former Minnesota beauty pageant contestant),
and the opening scenes cleverly establish the oppressiveness of
small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   It also gets big laughs from some uncomfortably dark material:
an amputation; an ongoing retarded character; a closet child
molester; a previous pageant winner dying from anorexia nervosa;
and a contestant with an unhealthy obsession with German shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' just can't sustain itself.
</P>
<P>
   The script starts repeating its best gags about halfway through,
and the direction gets ever broader as it goes along until the film
finally loses all effectiveness as satire and disintegrates into
vomit jokes and clumsy anti-climaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Drop Dead Gorgeous. Directed by Michael Patrick Jann. Written by
Lona Williams. Cast: Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst,
Denise Richards. New Line Cinema. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for
violence.

GORE WARNS GOP ON PBS DONOR LIST CONTROVERSY

<P>
   CORNISH, N.H. _ As Congress investigates WGBH and other public
television stations for sharing donor lists with political parties,
Vice President Al Gore warned Thursday that Republicans should not
use the controversy to try to kill public TV.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with WMUR-TV, Gore condemned the list-sharing
practice as ``bad judgment'' and said, ``they shouldn't have done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said Republicans should not try to cut the stations'
funding or eliminate public television as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people support public broadcasting,'' Gore said.
``It's really a bright spot on the television dial, especially for
children as a source of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great success story not only of television, but
public radio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he helped to lead the fight to save public
broadcasting when the Reagan-Bush administration tried to eliminate
it. ``There was a great outpouring across party lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ideological extreme that wants to do away with it and
they will seize on this as an excuse to start up their crusade
again to get rid of public broadcasting, but they will not succeed
because the American people support it,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ignoring strong objections from the White House,
Pentagon and lawmakers from Texas and Georgia, the House approved a
$266 billion Pentagon spending plan on Thursday that cuts $1.8
billion in funding the Air Force is seeking for production of the
first six Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the F-22, a major portion of which will be produced
at Lockheed's plant in west Fort Worth, will now be determined in a
joint House-Senate conference later this summer that will seek to
reconcile differences between defense spending bills in the two
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 379-45 to approve the measure. The bill, which
includes funding for other major Texas defense programs, including
the Lockheed F-16 and Bell Helicopter's V-22 Osprey, gained wide
approval from Texas members, who expect to attack the F-22
provision in conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and other Texas lawmakers have said they
are confident the conference will produce a defense spending bill
that includes funding for F-22 production.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, told lawmakers on the floor of
the House that the measure, which outlines a ``pause'' for the
program so that the Air Force can re-evaluate its budget
priorities, would amount to a termination of the Raptor program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, there is no pause,'' she said. ``A pause in
this program will result in the death of this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger's comments came as part of a group of lawmakers summoned
by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who had proposed an amendment to restore
production funding, but then withdrew it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., told lawmakers that the U.S. does not
want a ``fair fight'' in an air battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we pause, our enemies may not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Final assembly of the jet would take place at Lockheed's plant
in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   James Fetig, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, said the company is
disappointed in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Air Force has a well-established production plan for
the F-22 that minimizes risk, stabilizes costs, and delivers the
aircraft to warfighters in a timely manner,'' he said. ``It is now
up to the House Senate Appropriations Conference to avoid seriously
disrupting that schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials say the action would amount to a two-year
delay in production that would add $6.5 billion to the $70 billion
cost of the F-22 program. Administration officials have said they
will consider terminating the program if Congress cancels
production of the first planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the bill, already passed, contains $3
billion for production of the first six fighters and continued
development. The House bill now contains only $1.2 billion intended
for continued development.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders over the last week, including Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, have
come out in support of F-22 production.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wants to buy 339 F-22s, down from earlier plans
for more than 700.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the House plan say they are not out to kill the
Raptor. They just want to delay its production until they can
debate whether the Pentagon needs the plane and two others, the
Navy F/A-18E/F, and the Joint Strike Fighter, a tri-service
aircraft, that could cost taxpayers a combined $350 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, who quietly crafted the plan in his House
Appropriations subcommittee that wrote the Pentagon budget plan
passed yesterday, said he also wants the Air Force to look at
personnel, readiness and other issues that could hinder its ability
to fight wars. He also points out that the F-22 has been troubled
with cost and technical problems for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis promised to carefully consider the funding in conference
with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we will do everything that is necessary
to make certain there is no nation that will threaten us in
tactical air in the future,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lewis' supporters say the Air Force should consider
upgrading the Boeing F-15 to serve in the F-22's air superiority
role until the Joint Strike Fighter comes on line between 2010 and
2015.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, a former Air Force pilot and
seven-year resident of the ``Hanoi Hilton'' as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, scoffed at the idea of using the F-15 in 2005, when the
Air Force is expected to have a squadron of 18 to 24 Raptors
operational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew the F-15 when I was active in the Air Force and that
was over 25 years ago,'' he said. ``It will be in service over 33
years by the time the F-22 would reach operational capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 33-year-old airplane had been used in Korea, we would
have been fighting MiGs with Sopwith Camels,'' the most successful
Allied fighter of World War I, he said.

BRADLEY URGES BAN ON `SOFT MONEY' IN CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, who has
raised $11.7 million in his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination, says big money in politics is ``a great stone wall''
between Americans and their elected officials. He challenged both
national parties to ban unlimited ``soft money'' donations and
spending in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   `Before the money machines start humming,'' Bradley said
Thursday in a speech at the National Press Club, ``let's pause and
think of a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's reform proposal, the most comprehensive offered so far
by a presidential candidate, also called for public financing of
congressional elections, free broadcast time for federal
candidates, and same-day voter registration. It was immediately
rejected by the chairmen of both the Republican National Committee
and Vice President Al Gore's 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to campaign finance, Bill Bradley's approach is
`do as I say, not as I do,''' said GOP chairman Jim Nicholson.
``Bill Bradley can try to present himself as a reformer today, but
as a senator he never set a reformist example. He always milked the
system for all he could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coehlo, Gore's campaign chairman, noted that Bradley had
accepted Democratic Party money in the past. ``Now he would leave
the party and every Democratic candidate...to fend for themselves
while George W. Bush and the Republican money machine try to buy
the election,'' Coehlo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The negative reactions seemed tailor-made for Bradley's outsider
campaign. Despite his 18 years in the Senate, Bradley is running as
the anti-establishment candidate in the Democratic race. And
although he has raised the largest chunks of his 2000 campaign
money from lawyers, brokers, and bankers, according to the
nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, Bradley is casting
himself as the champion of middle-class America and contrasting his
fund-raising with Bush's pursuit of special-interest money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing breaks down trust in democracy as powerfully and
surely as money,'' Bradley said. ``It is like a great stone wall
that comes between the people and their representatives. A great
wall that prevents each from hearing the other. A great wall that
muffles the sounds of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance watchdog, said Bradley's
speech was important for its specific proposals, which Wertheimer
endorsed, and because it put a money-and-politics debate on the
agenda of the presidential campaign. ``Both Bradley and (Republican
Senator) John McCain are making money a symbol of what is wrong
with the system and what that means for our democracy,'' said
Wertheimer, who is president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Senate bill sponsored by McCain and Wisconsin Democrat
Russ Feingold, Bradley's plan would bar national parties from
collecting soft money and ban state parties from spending it in
federal elections. Because these donations are unlimited,
unregulated, and have been a big influence in recent elections,
soft money has become the prime target of those who want to
overhaul the campaign-funding system.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley accused Bush and Gore of hypocrisy on the soft-money
issue because, he said, both have called for changing the system
yet have ``directed their top fund-raisers to begin raising soft
money for the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be very clear: That is just not true,'' said Marla
Romash, a Gore spokeswoman. Romash said Bradley is the hypocrite
because as a senator, he did not propose to change the financing
system, and as a presidential candidate, the average contribution
to his campaign is a not-so-small $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's words have not been matched by his actions,'' said
Romash, who provided a four-page report on how Bradley ``has
benefitted and exploited the system he now condemns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are locked in a major money race. Federal
Election Commission reports show that as of June 30, Gore had
raised $19.5 million, compared to Bradley's $11.7 million. Neither,
however, was close to Bush, the overall money leader with $37.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley praised states, including Massachusetts and Maine, that
provide voluntary public financing of elections, calling it an
``elegant, principled idea.'' As president, Bradley said he would
propose that federal candidates who agree to limit their campaign
expenditures be eligible for matching money in primaries and public
financing of general elections, in addition to free air time on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said advance voter registration is ``the last barrier in
the long row of barriers blocking full participation.'' If
president, he would propose that any citizen with proper
identification be allowed to vote on Election Day, and that all
employers give workers a minimum of two hours off to vote.

ROHMER'S `AUTUMN TALE' ANOTHER ENJOYABLE COMEDY OF MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many American foreign-film fans have a tough time with France's
Eric Rohmer. His films are incorrigibly minimalist and understated
in every sense, and most of the character development and plot is
moved along by talk _ lots of talk.
</P>
<P>
   But, for others, these elegant little fables that appear with
amazing regularity every year or so are always a special treat. A
Rohmer film is bound to be a thoughtful, immensely satisfying
little drama filled with surprising revelations and barely
perceptible twists of character.
</P>
<P>
   His latest, ``Autumn Tale'' _ which ends his latest cycle,
``Tales of the Four Seasons'' (after ``Summer's Tale,'' ``Winter's
Tale'' and ``Tale of Springtime'') _ is no exception. It's another
enjoyable comedy of manners that seems both highly original, and,
at the same time, pleasantly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The story takes place in the Rhone countryside, and is sparked
when Isabelle (Marie Riviere), a happily married, well-off
bookseller in her 40s decides to play matchmaker with her childhood
best friend, Magali (Beatrice Romand).
</P>
<P>
   When Magali refuses to cooperate, Isabelle secretly places an ad
in the personals and, posing as her widowed friend, soon finds the
perfect romantic candidate in Gerald (Alain Libolt) _ so perfect
that she's reluctant to reveal the masquerade.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rosine (Alexia Portal), the free-spirited
twenty-something girlfriend of Magali's son, is also playing
matchmaker for Magali by slyly trying to team her up with her
(Rosine's) philosophy teacher ex-lover, Etienne (Didier Sandre).
</P>
<P>
   So the story is driven by the two matchmaking plot threads,
which weave in and out of each other, creating various
complications and misconceptions as they go, and finally find
resolution at a garden party Isabelle throws to celebrate the
marriage of her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   As always with Rohmer, the cast (all Rohmer regulars) is
competent but contains no real stand-out performance, nothing very
sexually provocative or highly comedic or visually striking
happens, and the characters are endlessly expressive of their
internal feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But the characters also have a freshness, vitality and
believability _ and above all, unpredictability _ that we seldom
find in fiction films. They just don't seem to be actors following
a preordained script, so the film has an almost documentary reality
and voyeuristic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And, slowly but surely, the pieces all come together to be
wonderfully life-affirming parable that wisely teaches us that,
even in the autumn of life (hence the title), there is nothing more
powerful or exhilarating than the eminent prospect of true love.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn Tale. Directed and written by Eric Rohmer. Cast: Marie
Riviere, Beatrice Romand, Alain Libolt, and Alexia Portal. October
Films.112 minutes. In French with English subtitles. Rated PG.

HOUSE PASSES $792 BILLION TAX-CUTTING BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House narrowly approved a $792 billion
tax-cutting package Thursday, a measure that would represent the
largest tax reduction since the early days of the Reagan
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House voted 223-208 in favor of a
10-year tax relief plan that would provide the first reductions in
the federal income tax rates since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would reduce the so-called ``marriage penalty''
suffered by many dual-income couples, eliminate inheritance taxes,
and cut capital gains taxes for both individuals and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans celebrated the vote Thursday afternoon, with
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., calling it a ``great day for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But with only a slim majority in the House and nowhere near
enough votes to force their will on the White House, House
Republicans hold few illusions the tax bill as written will
actually become law.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have drafted their own, markedly different
tax-cutting package, while President Clinton has repeatedly
threatened to veto what he described as the Republicans'
``exploding tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans charged ahead and passed a plan that threatens
our ability to pay off the debt and strengthen Social Security and
Medicare,'' Clinton said in a prepared statement. ``The plain fact
is that their tax plan is designed to explode to a $3 trillion cost
at the very time that Medicare and Social Security come under
strain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who had intervened with GOP renegades to ensure passage
of the bill, conceded lawmakers have a lot of negotiating to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president started out with no tax relief,'' Hastert said.
``He's moved our way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, dismissed the bill as a
political ploy, the latest salvo in the upcoming presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the bill's not going anywhere,'' Rangel said. ``What
you want is a veto from President Clinton. He becomes the
Scrooge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, authored the bill and shepherded it through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the need for a tax break, Archer noted: ``The
typical American family pays more than 38 percent of its income in
total taxes, more than it spends on food, clothing and shelter
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average household paid $9,445 in federal income taxes
alone last year, twice what it paid in 1985,'' Archer said. ``Is it
any wonder that Americans are working harder and longer just to pay
the bills?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans easily defeated an alternative tax proposal offered
by Rangel, which would have provided $250 billion of tax cuts over
10 years. Rangel's tax reductions, however, would have been
contingent on lawmakers also allocating enough money to shore up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's bill also would have allowed residents in Texas and
other states that do not have a state income tax to deduct their
state and local sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill would reduce each of the five major income tax
brackets by 10 percent over a 10-year time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for instance, would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket
_ the rate currently levied on the first $25,750 of any single
filer's income and the first $43,050 for joint filers _ to 13.5
percent over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The first cut would come in 2001, with the 15 percent bracket
dipping at that time to 14.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10-year period, the current 28 percent tax bracket
would drop to 25.2 percent, while the 31 percent would fall to 27.9
percent, 36 percent to 32.4 percent and the highest income tax
bracket _ 39.6 percent _ would drop to 35.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal worked out with a group of moderate Republicans,
the second phase of the rate reductions _ scheduled to start in
2004 _ would not go into effect unless the government's debt load
drops each year as well.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats scoffed at that provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give you a tax cut, and we'll tell you later if you're
going to get it,'' said Jake Siewert, a spokesman for the White
House's National Economic Council.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., argued that the
piece of the tax bill most likely to help middle and lower income
families is the only provision held hostage to reductions in the
nation's debt load.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, called the Financial Freedom Act of 1999, also would
exempt from federal income taxes the first $200 of interest and
dividend income for single filers, $400 for married couples. These
changes, likewise, would be phased in slowly over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the effects of the so-called ``marriage penalty'' _
the aspect of the tax code that forces many dual-income couples to
pay more in taxes than they would if they had remained single _ the
bill would raise the standard deduction for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would increase the standard deduction for couples
filing jointly from the current $7,200 a year to $8,600, equal to
twice the deduction allowed for single filers. Such a measure would
benefit an estimated 21 million couples _ including many who don't
actually suffer the marriage penalty _ saving the average family an
estimated $243 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes many provisions popular with the
Republicans' base constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The top tax rate on individuals' capital gains, the income
earned on stocks and other investments, would drop from 20 percent
to 15 percent. Estate and gift taxes would be eliminated.  &UR; And the
alternative minimum tax, the tax wealthier Americans and
corporations with a large number of deductions and credits are
forced to pay to ensure they provide some revenue to Uncle Sam. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For corporate America, the House bill would ratchet down the tax
rate corporations pay on capital gains, from 35 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel compared the Republican tax package to a Christmas tree
``decorated with every cut you can think of for Republican
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's counterpart in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman
William Roth, R-Del., has his own tax package. His bill, approved
by the Finance Committee this week, would reduce only the lowest
income tax rate from 15 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's bill lacks many of the provisions particularly popular
with conservatives, including the capital gains tax cuts and the
elimination of the inheritance or ``death'' taxes. Roth's bill
would merely trim the maximum estate tax from 55 percent to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on Roth's bill next week. Members
from both houses will then have to meet in a conference committee
to try to work out differences between the Archer and Roth bills.

CHURCH DOESN'T ENCOURAGE CREMATION, SCATTERING OF ASHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cremated remains of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her
sister were cast from a warship to the ocean currents in a manner
not favored by the Catholic Church and in a ceremony that occurred
only after the intercession of top Pentagon brass.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church prefers the presence of a body at its
funeral rites. And the Defense Department rarely accords the honor
of burial at sea to civilians. But it acceded to the wishes of the
son of the nation's 35th president, who gained in death the privacy
he rarely achieved in life.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren
Bessette were returned to the ocean not far from where Kennedy's
plane crashed last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church does not encourage the scattering of cremated
remains,'' said the Reverend James A. Wiseman, an associate
theology professor at Catholic University. ``The normal thing is to
place the ashes somewhere where they can be regularly honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said that while many Catholics believe that
cremation is unacceptable because they feel it violates the belief
in the resurrection of the body, the practice has been allowed
since 1963 when church law was revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cremation today in the Catholic Church is not forbidden; it is
tolerated and it is becoming increasingly more common,'' said
Lawrence Cunningham, a theology professor at the University of
Notre Dame. ``The identification of cremation with unbelief has
passed from the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Christian belief held that cremation was the practice of
pagans, an implied way of expressing contempt for the notion of the
Resurrection, a central tenet of the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was John Kennedy Jr.'s expressed wishes and the church
wants to honor the wishes of the dead unless they're contrary to
ethics and good taste,'' said Thomas Groome, professor at Boston
College's Institute of Religion, Education and Pastoral Ministry.
``The ocean has always been a striking metaphor for the presence of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The US National Conference of Catholic Bishops guidelines for
cremation says the ashes ``should be treated with same respect
given to the human body from which they come.'' The guidelines do
not allow for the scattering of ashes, calling instead for ``the
use of a worthy vessel to contain the ashes,'' which should be
buried or entombed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the ashes were dealt with during Thursday's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   If the cremation was unusual, the burial at sea Thursday was
even more so as Pentagon official estimated that just 1 to 2
percent of burials at sea are accorded to civilians like Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is a rich history of maritime burial and a
strict military procedure for how it should be carried out, the USS
Briscoe, a 9,200-ton destroyer, was hosting a civilian service
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceremony that they had for those three was not a military
burial at sea ceremony,'' said Ensign Kim Brasel, a Navy
spokeswoman. ``It was on a Navy ship, but all the Navy provided was
the ship. How the ceremony was carried out was determined by the
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said two Navy Roman Catholic chaplains and a
civilian priest officiated at the ceremony, which was approved by
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen after a request by US Sen Edward
M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said eligibility for burial at sea is
reserved for any active or retired member of the uniformed
services, their dependents, some civilians supporting military
operations, and others whose service to the nation makes them
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Pentagon said, fell into that final category,
citing his work with charities such as the President's Commission
on Mental Retardation and the Profile in Courage Award, whose
recipients he helped select each year in memory of his father John
F. Kennedy, the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   Except in time of war, burial at sea occurs rarely now. As
spelled out in Navy guidelines, it includes a firing squad, a
chaplain, an honor platoon, and a bugler. And it starts with a
reading from Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the depths I cry to Thee, O Lord, hear my voice,'' the
Catholic service begins. ``

IRISH PRIEST PROVIDING SPIRITUAL ASSISTANCE TO KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As they waited, prayed, and bade goodbye to John F.
Kennedy Jr., his extended family has received spiritual consolation
from one of their own _ the Rev. Michael Kennedy, a distant cousin
from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Father Kennedy, who celebrated the funeral Mass for his namesake
last winter after the 39-year-old son of Robert F. Kennedy was
killed in a Colorado skiing accident, was in Hyannis Port for last
weekend's scheduled marriage of Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great sense of humor and has this great stentorian
preaching voice,'' said a Kennedy family friend. ``He's very much a
country priest, and that's part of his charm. He's been a very
comforting presence during this time of mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   The parish priest in Dungarvan, a town of 5,700 in Ireland's
Waterford County, led the final prayers at Rose Kennedy's bedside
before her death in 1995. He has officiated at at least two Kennedy
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   When last weekend's nuptials were postponed after JFK Jr.'s
plane disappeared into the Atlantic Ocean, Father Kennedy
celebrated several Masses at the family compound in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   The priest created a media furor in 1995 when claimed from his
church pulpit that a revenge-seeking woman spread the virus that
carries AIDS to as many as 80 men in his rural coastal parish.
</P>
<P>
   Irish health officials said he could find no proof of Kennedy's
claim.

 &HT;    Digital photos without the wait
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One of the great things about digital cameras is
that they have little view screens that let you immediately see the
shot you've taken. Digital camera users don't have to wait for the
prints to come back from the photo finishing shop.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have to wait as their cameras transfer photo files
to their computers. Antec Inc. of Fremont, Calif., says its
PhotoChute 3 USB can get photos from the camera into the computer
as much as 50 times faster than other methods.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Goodwin, regional sales manager for Antec, said the
PhotoChute 3 USB takes advantage of the universal serial bus (USB)
port included in many new computers. The USB port, a rectangular
connecting device built into computers, is designed to improve the
flow of data between computers and peripheral components.
</P>
<P>
   Most digital cameras, Goodwin said, download their picture files
through computers' traditional serial ports, which are 30 to 50
times slower than USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said to use the PhotoChute, digital camera users take
the memory chip, or card, that stores photos as they are being
taken and inserts the chip into the PhotoChute. The device accepts
SmartMedia, Compact Flash and Type I and Type II ATA Flash cards.
</P>
<P>
   The PhotoChute reads the chip and transmits the picture file
through the USB port into the computer where the user can use
software to edit the photos, print them out and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get people past waiting for their pictures to load, and get
them to what they want to be doing _ putting the pictures on
postcards and the like,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said the writers of PC Magazine tested the PhotoChute
earlier this year by transferring 24 picture files (jpeg files
totalling 7 megabytes) using a digital camera and then using the
PhotoChute.
</P>
<P>
   He said the transfer that took nearly 17 minutes using the
camera was completed in 41 seconds with the PhotoChute.
</P>
<P>
   The PhotoChute also can be used to transfer data other than
photos that are filed on memory chips.

 &HT;    With advance planning, right fabrics, packing is in the bag
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One of the pleasures of going to local fashion
shows is meeting interesting people. At the spring Red Cross
fund-raiser, I sat next to Alice Eastman of Kettering, and we
talked about packing and dressing for vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman is a world traveler who was wearing a 100-percent linen
jacket and skirt. The fabric, though wrinkled, was pretty and
natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy anything that's not going to travel well,'' she
explained. ``I want to take everything out of the suitcase and be
able to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a garment says ``hand wash,'' Eastman passes. ``If you can't
machine-wash it, it won't hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   She's learned to travel light and advises women to take no more
than one week's worth of clothes, even on a two- or three-week
trip.
</P>
<P>
   She layers travel clothing. ``I'd rather wear a jacket and be
able to take it off,'' she says. ``Everything I buy is casual now.
People are more casual everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandals are her shoe of choice; a favorite is Clark's brand from
England.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman also takes along an all-weather coat with hood and a
sweater. She packs lots of black and white clothing, and plenty of
cotton and linen T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got Flax in your wardrobe, you're in business,''
Eastman says, adding that she can pack in less than an hour and be
dressed in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Danskin offers Packables
</P>
<P>
   A Danskin Travel Poll asked 500 women nationwide what they
looked for when choosing clothes to bring on a trip. The attributes
most often mentioned were clothes that offered versatility, comfort
and wrinkle-resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of those surveyed said they tend to overpack because
they want to be prepared for everything.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Danskin has introduced Packables, a collection
designed to create a hassle-free wardrobe. It features 12 black
mix-and-match pieces in sizes from small to 3X.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces include a knee-length and an ankle-length dress, a
knee-length and a long skirt, a crew neck T-shirt, a V-neck
T-shirt, jacket, cardigan, crewneck tunic, sleeveless shell,
drawstring pants and slim-leg pants.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is created from the company's new fabric, Tech
2000, which blends Tactel nylon with Lycra spandex to create a
lightweight, durable fabric. Prices range from $18 for a
cotton/Lycra T-shirt to $80 for a long dress.
</P>
<P>
   A Weekender Pak combines a complete weekend wardrobe _ jacket,
shell, slim pant and drawstring skirt in black _ and includes a
tote for $160, plus postage. The collection can be ordered by mail
at (800) 288-6749.
</P>
<P>
   Make a little plan, Jan
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Woolmark say the No. 1 mistake people make is
packing without a plan.
</P>
<P>
   I can vouch for that. I'm one of those who packs in a fairly
organized fashion, but then I keep throwing in extra items ``just
in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolmark's ``Packing Guide'' suggests that you spend more time
up front deciding what to bring. ``Make copies of the list for
future trips. Check off items only as they go into the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woolmark brochure suggests rolling and layering clothing
when you pack, or overlapping garments _ and shoes _ if you prefer
to pack items flat.
</P>
<P>
   Tips to try
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick one base color and one coordinating color. (A base color
might be black or navy, the complementary colors might be white,
tan or your favorite brights.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Always include classic separates. Jackets, trousers, skirts
and dresses in seasonless fabrics are most versatile. They can be
embellished by layering pieces or dressed down with casual looks
such as denim shirt-jackets, white oxfords or your favorite jeans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Space savers such as scarves, belts and jewelry are compact,
lightweight and can completely change the look of an ensemble. Pack
them inside shoes or handbags. Look for reversible clothing for two
looks in one.
</P>
<P>
   Pendleton adds these tips for hassle-free business packing:
</P>
<P>
   _ One jacket is all that's needed when you also pack a pair of
trousers, a skirt and two or three tops to pair with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pack in layers, putting heavy items such as books and shoes at
the bottom of the suitcase and garments on top. Keep dry-cleaned
items in their plastic bags or place tissue between the folds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unpack as soon as you reach your destination, even if you'll
be there for only one night. Allowing garments to hang out will cut
ironing time: For difficult wrinkles, hang clothes in a steamy
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep essentials such as makeup, jewelry, keys, plane tickets
and lingerie in your purse or carry-on. This will minimize the
inconvenience of lost or missing checked luggage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pack an extra pair of stockings in every color you'll need.

BUSH PROPOSES FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP WITH CHARITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Calling it the ``next bold step in welfare
reform,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush proposed Thursday a new
partnership in his presidential administration between the federal
government and charities _ even religious organizations previously
ineligible for federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make a determined attack on need, by promoting the
compassionate acts of others,'' Bush said. ``We will rally the
armies of compassion in our communities to fight a very different
war against poverty and hopelessness, a daily battle waged house to
house and heart by heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan calls for spending about $8 billion, or about 10
percent of the non-Social Security surplus, to support charities
and provide tax deductions and credits to encourage charitable
giving, even for the 70 percent of Americans who are now ineligible
because they do not itemize deductions on their federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, said he would establish an ``Office of Faith-Based
Action'' in the Executive Office to serve as a clearinghouse for
successful charitable social programs and assist religious
organizations that need help wading through federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he'll also change the regulations for federal funding
that require religious organizations to ``strip'' their programs of
moral and spiritual aspects he says are key to their success.
</P>
<P>
   And the presidential hopeful said he is prepared to defend his
plan in court against critics who may charge that some aspects blur
the constitutional line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told by legal experts that my initiative will pass
constitutional muster,'' Bush told reporters. ``But we are a
litigious society ... and I'm sure there are some who'll say we're
so process-oriented, we don't really care if the programs work;
therefore, let's sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not, and I would hope that I would have an attorney
general that would be nimble and able enough to defend the
concept,'' Bush said. ``The money goes to fund the services, the
cost _ but the money doesn't go to fund religious programs within
the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor stressed in his speech his commitment to
pluralism, pledging not to discriminate ``for or against Methodists
or Mormons or Muslims, or good people of no faith at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Vice President Al Gore called for a ``new partnership''
between church and state. But his proposal lacked many of the
specifics outlined Thursday by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose an appearance before Indianapolis's ``Front Porch
Alliance'' to answer charges by critics, most notably President
Clinton, that he embraces the slogan ``compassionate conservatism''
without telling potential voters specifically what that means.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, Bush's domestic policy
adviser for the presidential campaign, formed the Front Porch
Alliance two years ago as a cooperative effort among city
government, churches, synagogues, mosques and neighborhood
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have set an example of innovative, compassionate
government,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that made references to Pope John Paul II and St.
Francis of Assisi, Bush said his administration would allow private
and religious groups to compete to provide services in every
federal, state and local social program, adding that a specially
appointed advocate would ensure that charities are not
``secularized or slighted'' by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever we can, we must expand their role and reach, without
changing them or corrupting them,'' Bush said. ``This is the next
bold step of welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   When his administration sees a need to help people, Bush said,
``We will look first to faith-based organizations, charities and
community groups that have shown their ability to save and change
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited several examples of Texas programs _ like InnerChange,
a faith-based prison fellowship program that rousts inmates from
sleep at 5 a.m. and puts them to work.
</P>
<P>
   He said that to expand the role and reach of churches and
charities, Americans must get beyond two prejudices _ that
government provides the only real compassion and, conversely, that
all of our problems would be solved if only government would get
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   And he spoke directly to members of his own party: ``We must
apply our conservative and free-market ideas to the job of helping
real human beings,'' Bush said. ``Because any ideology, no matter
how right in theory, is sterile and empty without that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous presidents have declared a War on Poverty and promised
to create a Great Society, Bush said, calling them grand gestures
that were frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that government can spend money, but it can't put
hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives,'' Bush said.
``This is done in churches and synagogues and mosques and charities
that warm the cold of life. A quiet river of goodness that cuts
through stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staff members provided a summary of his proposal, which
spelled out how he plans to ``lead a determined attack on need,''
launching initiatives to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Help the 1.3 million children whose parents are in prison stay
out of prison themselves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open federal after-school programs to community groups,
churches and charities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a ``Compassion Capital Fund'' to invest in charitable
programs that work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase drug treatment funding and make faith-based and other
non-medical drug treatment programs eligible for federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish pilot ``Second Chance'' homes for unwed pregnant
teens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make permanent the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these initiatives mirrored Bush proposals in state
government. But because only three faith-based programs passed the
Legislature in 1997, there is not a long track record by which to
judge their success.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush authorized the private accreditation of religious
child-care centers, which still must be approved by the Texas
Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.
</P>
<P>
   As of this past March, only the Texas Association of Christian
Child Care Agencies Inc. had received accreditation and only one
child care facility was registered _ the once controversial Lester
Roloff Home for Boys and Girls in Corpus Christi. The home,
criticized for its harsh discipline of teen-agers, had moved to
Missouri more than a decade ago after refusing to submit to Texas
state licensing and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Another law exempts religious chemical dependency programs from
state licensing and regulations so long as the programs do not
provide medical services. So far, 21 organizations have applied for
this exemption, according to the Texas Commission on Alcohol and
Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The third law encourages state prisons, juvenile detention
centers and law enforcement agencies to use faith-based programs to
rehabilitate inmates and other troubled people, such as the
InnerChange program, based in Sugar Land near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also directed state welfare agencies to implement the
``charitable choice'' provision of the federal welfare reform law
that allows religious organizations to provide welfare services and
receive financial assistance from the Texas Department of Human
Services and Texas Workforce Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As of March, DHS had formal financial agreements with 16
faith-based organizations, nonfinancial agreements with 11
organizations and informal agreements with 34 organizations.

ELECTION BATTLE FOCUS OF REFORM PARTY CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub for minor editing) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming this weekend, the followers of diminutive millionaire
Ross Perot are expected to clash with the loyalists of
wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura for control of the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the battle is election of the party's chairman.
Two Perot loyalists are seeking to replace current Chairman Russell
Verney, a Perot employee. Ventura is backing a third candidate who
has vowed to shake loose of the Perot faction's party control.
</P>
<P>
   But the three-day convention that begins Friday in Dearborn,
Mich., has more at stake than whether Perot, the party's founder
who won almost 20 percent of the popular presidential vote in 1992,
will remain its symbolic head.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this leadership struggle will decide who controls
the party's purse strings next year when the Reform Party's
presidential candidate is eligible for $12.5 million in federal
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While that amount pales next to the $60 million each that the
Republican and Democratic presidential candidates will receive, it
is enough money to launch speculation into who will head next
year's Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has not said whether he wants to run for president again,
as he did in 1992 and 1996. But Ventura already has tried to
recruit former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker to run, and Weicker
has said he will decide by August.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Patrick Buchanan has hinted he might leave his party
to run on the Reform ticket. And New York millionaire developer
Donald Trump has said that if nominated by the Reform Party, he
would run _ although the party has made no such moves.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hamphsire bolted from the
Republican Party, Smith toyed briefly with running for the Reform
nomination. But Smith decided to align himself with the U.S.
Taxpayers Party instead.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Reformists are worried that some of the potential
nominees might just be interested in the party's money. But he said
the party also would welcome potential candidates who embrace the
party's call for fiscal conservatism and political reform. The
party has little official interest in social issues dear to many
conservatives, like Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're coming simply to promote their own agenda and spend
the $12.5 million we've earned, then they are coming for the wrong
reasons,'' Verney said. ``We want them to first endorse us, our
principles of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign operatives privately are nervous about the
prospects of a Reform Party candidate in the general election. The
Bush family and many other Republicans blame Perot's 1992 bid for
cutting into President Bush's re-election support and costing him a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   As an independent, Perot received 19 percent of the vote
nationally in 1992, but dropped to 8 percent in 1996 as the first
Reform Party candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   But exit polls indicate that Perot did not actually affect the
outcome in either race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Perot drew voters from Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton
almost evenly. And only Ohio would have shifted from Clinton's
column to Bush's in the electoral college, but that still would
have left Bush far short of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, most of Perot's vote drop-off occurred among
independents who shifted to Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said the Reform Party has ballot status in 19 states, but
not Texas. To get on the ballot in Texas, the party will have to
collect more than 50,000 signatures next April and May, a drive
likely to cost $150,000 to $200,000. Verney said people seeking the
presidential nomination in August 2000 will be responsible for
getting on the ballot in states like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the benefit of the Reform Party's name ... then
you need to bring something to the party, and that's the ballot
access in the states where we don't have it,'' Verney said. ``In
order to participate for our party's nomination, they have to get
the ballot access.''
</P>
<P>
   Power struggles within Perot's political organizations are not
new, and his faction has always won so far. The most notable
attempt to break Perot's hold on the party occurred in 1996 with
former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm's unsuccessful bid for the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The latest struggle began boiling last year after Ventura's
surprise victory in the Minnesota governor's race. Immediately,
some in the Reform Party began touting him as a possible
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura last month withdrew his name from consideration as
presidential candidate, but he also made clear that he believed the
national Reform Party was in need of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that except for Minnesota and perhaps one or
two other states, the national Reform Party has declined
dramatically in recent years,'' Ventura wrote to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura said he supported Jack Gargan of Florida for chairman,
saying Gargan would move party headquarters out of Dallas, reform
the party's rules and make the party more of a grass-roots
organization with leadership coming from the bottom up. Gargan, 68,
has been a leader in the term-limits movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the convention delegates are not willing to elect and
support the best person for the job, I'll remain reluctant to fully
embrace the national Reform Party,'' Ventura wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Ventura's call to move the party out of Dallas shows
how little he knows about the party structure. Verney said the
party has no paid staff and members communicate almost exclusively
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party lives in cyberspace. We rent a post office
box in Dallas,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ventura published his letter, Verney announced
that he would not seek re-election as party chairman. Verney threw
his support to the party's current Vice Chairman Pat Benjamin, 58,
of New Jersey and Tom McLaughlin, 43, the party's Pennsylvania
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said his top priority would be building the party
into a national political force. He said he doubts Perot will run
again.

NEW YORKERS FONDLY RECALL A `REGULAR GUY' WHO FASCINATED THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(bl) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city where glitz and grit cross paths on a
regular basis, where good works and good looks sometimes join
forces for just a night, John F. Kennedy Jr. had mastered the
anomaly of being a celebrity ``regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary New York kinds of things happened to him. He was mugged
in Central Park. Somebody stole his sport utility vehicle.
Strangers talked to him on the subway. A friend of a friend got him
Yankees tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But when it happened to Kennedy, it made the papers. He was
public property for years: the tabloids long ago baptised him a
Page One ``Hunk.''
</P>
<P>
   His love life was regularly dissected, his record as a
prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office was rated,
and his political magazine, George, was judged as if he had
something to prove to the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was not a New Yorker by birth, but the city had him in
its grip. He glided through its intersecting circles of high-octane
fashion, journalism, charity and sports. But after his death last
Friday at the controls of his single-engine plane in a crash off
Martha's Vineyard, many ordinary New Yorkers also recalled him as
one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Jimmy Mulzet, who has a job in the mailroom at
the City University of New York. Reaching Up, a group that Kennedy
founded in 1987 to provide educational fellowships for people who
work with the developmentally disabled, is housed at CUNY. Mulzet,
who has cerebral palsy, sometimes helps out at their meetings. So
that is where he and Kennedy first met in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when they see somebody with a disability, they
don't know how to act,'' said Mulzet. ``They are like scared,
because they don't know what you're going to do. They can't handle
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people, he added, ``are always staring down at you.''
Kennedy was not like that in all the seven years of their playful
acquaintance when they asked courteously after each other's
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot of people trying to figure out what
kind of man I am,'' Mulzet explained. ``John took me like I am and
he never never thought any more. He took me like a regular human
being. Just because I have a disability and sometime when I walk I
stagger, but John understands. He understands people that have a
problem and he never looked down on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Up was Kennedy's longest-running project. One of his
aunts is mentally retarded and like all the Kennedy cousins, he was
encouraged by the family's Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation to develop
a program dealing with some aspect of the disability field.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to meld his interests in the working poor and the
disabled into one project, Kennedy met with unions, service
providers, state mental health agencies and charities to put
together the fellowship program.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ebenstein, the executive director of Reaching Up, said
Kennedy should be credited for recognizing the link between the
education of frontline mental health workers and the quality of
care received by the disabled. His program has so far helped
subsidize the education of 375 caregivers and developed a
specialized curriculum for them at city colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the program, Kennedy traded on his glamour and his
name to bring together the rival organizations that work with the
disabled. Nobody, his colleagues recalled, said ``no'' to an
invitation to meet the handsome much-photographed son of a former
president, and Kennedy returned the favor by associating himself
with their fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is bringing those people together and John was always
there to grease the wheel,'' said Ebenstein. ``I can't tell you how
many payback dinners he went to with the agencies, how many college
presidents and union leaders he met with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of Reaching Up, Kennedy sometimes visited the
college classrooms where mental-health workers were studying. He
came to every annual convocation of the program's new Kennedy
Fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, he came on a bicycle. One year, he came on
rollerblades,'' said Amy Bittinger, director of family support
service at United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. ``We used to
worry the years he was still with the DA's office, but he would
rush in. He might be late, but he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, recently appointed to the President's Committee on
Mental Health, patronized other charitable groups that occasionally
thrust him onto the charity-ball circuit. He was a cofounder of the
Robin Hood Foundation, which raises money to feed the poor. He was
a benefactor of Naked Angels, a downtown theater company, and the
Whitney Museum of American Art. He adopted many of the arts and
preservation causes of his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
accepting a plaque in her honor last year at the dedication of the
newly renovated Grand Central Terminal and serving on a Municipal
Arts Society panel about the Hudson River park in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But he turned down many more invitations than he accepted.
Friends and colleagues remembered him as a man who wore his fame
lightly, but used it shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1995 launch of his glossy magazine George _ a cocktail
of politics, policy and celebrity-gazing _ Kennedy turned the
public fascination with himself into a marketing strategy. And he
was quick to see what could tweak New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In March, he called a press conference to announce that the
magazine had hired Alfonse D'Amato, the defeated Republican senator
from New York, to write an advice column. The sight of an
untarnished Kennedy heir and a veteran political scrapper together
in public proved irresistible. In answer to a reporter's question,
D'Amato suggested Kennedy might make a good candidate for mayor,
Kennedy demurred, sort of. The headline-writers took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of his cousins, his uncles and his father,
Kennedy did not seem infected with the politics bug. He campaigned
on behalf of some local candidates _ he once stumped for Mayor
David Dinkins in Harlem, for example _ but many of his politician
friends do not believe he had a New York political career in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he always held it open, because it was virtually
impossible for him to close it down entirely without sounding
awkward and strange,'' said former Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose son
Andrew is married to one of Kennedy's cousins. ``I don't think he
had the kind of ego that needs politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of his work at the magazine and his charitable
activities, Kennedy also attended the occasional fashion event with
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, a former publicist for Calvin
Klein. But his neighbors said that elegant tuxedo-clad icon is not
the man they most remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to same deli as everyone and he went to the same dog
run that everyone went on,'' said Judy Duffy, the assistant
district manager of Community Board One, which includes Kennedy's
building in Tribeca. ``When it snowed, he was shoveling out his car
like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He also came out to protest, with some of his other celebrity
neighbors, plans to erect a six-screen movie theater nearby. ``He
came just like any other New Yorker,'' said Paul Goldstein, the
district manager of the board. ``He was very distracting, that's
all. He attracted a lot of stares and gazes.''
</P>
<P>
   And that quality, after all, made Kennedy not quite a regular
guy, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1995, he went to the Downtown Boat House, a center for
kayakers a few blocks from his apartment, to ask about keeping his
kayaks there. When it was explained that everyone volunteered their
time to keep the place going, Kennedy was eager to do his part
until he was reminded what a disruption he might unwittingly
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had something to do that didn't involve contact with
the public, he would have been happy to volunteer,'' recalled
boathouse president James Wetteroth. ``Still, he was part of the
community here. He just had to walk a little faster than everybody
else to keep ahead of his celebrity.''

INMATE GIVES NEW MEANING TO INSIDER TRADING OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Even prison inmates are catching stock market fever.
But some prisoners have found it's hard to find an honest broker
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   A civil complaint filed Thursday by the Massachusetts Secretary
of State William F. Galvin accused a prisoner at the state prison
in Norfolk of defrauding other inmates, along with a woman in the
Netherlands, of $85,000 in a securities scam.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said at least three other prisoners were victims as the
couple took their money and promised to invest it in stocks _ but,
instead, invested for their own accounts by setting up a shell
Delaware corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be the new insider trading. This gives new meaning
to the term,'' Galvin said. ``This is the first time I've ever
heard of anything like this. Usually we want startup brokerage
companies in the Commonwealth, but this is not the kind of startup
we want.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that Sean Smith, 34, serving a life
sentence for a 1988 murder, took $55,000 from several other inmates
and their families, but never set up individual investment accounts
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Galvin's complaint charges that beginning in 1998,
Smith's wife, Christine Schwartz Smith, 56, of Milford, a nurse,
deposited much of the money in the couple's personal bank accounts,
and put $23,000 in her ETrade Internet trading account.
</P>
<P>
   A examination of the account showed she invested on her own
behalf in three stocks Ebay Inc., Amazon.Com Inc., and Open Market
Inc. _ according to the complaint prepared by David Briden, an
enforcement attorney for the securities division.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charged that Schwartz Smith sent letters to the
customers falsely reporting that accounts had been established in
their names and their money had been invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The securities division said the couple identified themselves in
Delaware legal papers as sole managers and employees of Market Edge
Investments International Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith was accused of earlier taking $30,000 from an
unidentified woman from the Netherlands and her father, by
convincing her that he wanted to marry her. Smith allegedly
corresponded with the woman by phone, mail, and e-mail while at the
Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Galvin's complaint, Smith's father apparently
deposited the woman's money in his son's brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Schwartz Smith Thursday were unsuccessful, and
a representative from American Incorporators Ltd. of Wilmington,
Del., MEIIC's incorporating agent, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was sentenced to his life term after pleading guilty to
killing Joseph M. Baker of Gloucester.

SATURDAY NIGHT FIGHTS: JESSE VENTURA VS. ROSS PEROT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one corner: Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler
turned Minnesota governor. In the other: Ross Perot, the feisty
bantamweight from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes clash between two larger-than-life personalities
gets underway on Friday when Reform Party activists gather in
Dearborn, Mich., to chart the organization's future. The pivotal
issue for delegates at the three-day convention is whether Ventura
should replace Perot as the party's public face and voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's allies have mounted an aggressive campaign to end
Perot's dominance of the Dallas-based party that he founded in
1995. Although Perot is revered by many party loyalists, Ventura
captured international attention by becoming the party's first
statewide officeholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has been moving in downward direction. Ventura has
demonstrated that the Reform Party can win,'' said Phil Madsen, a
party activist and a Ventura aide. ``This is a real defining moment
in the history of the Reform Party. Do we want more of the same or
do we want to put in some fresh blood with a winning mentality?''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will also influence the choice of the party's
presidential nominee. Ventura has ruled out a White House bid next
year, and he is just as adamant in ruling out Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Ventura, two men with out-sized egos, have maintained
a wary distance despite their political ties. They have not spoken
to each other since Ventura's November election, and they do not
plan to share the stage at the weekend convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is scheduled to address delegates Friday night. Perot
will get the prime Saturday night speaking slot. Madsen said
Ventura's offer to meet with Perot over breakfast Saturday was
rejected by a Perot aide.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes rivalry is being fought by proxy this
weekend in the election of a new Reform Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is actively supporting Jack Gargan of Florida, a retired
financial consultant who was an early leader in the term limits
movement. In an endorsement letter, Ventura warned party members
that he would ``remain reluctant to fully embrace'' the Reform
Party if his candidate loses.
</P>
<P>
   Perot has stayed out of the race, at least publicly. But Russ
Verney, the current chairman and Perot's chief political adviser,
has endorsed both of Gargan's rivals, Patricia Benjamin of New
Jersey and Tom McLaughlin of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   While Gargan's election would signal a clean break with the
party's past, Perot's influence is likely to wane no matter who
wins. About 320 convention delegates will vote on a new chairman
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Verney, the outgoing party leader, is a die-hard Perot loyalist
who is the Dallas billionaire's payroll as a ``policy analyst and
political adviser.'' Verney's Dallas office, supplied by Perot, is
the closest thing the party has to a headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Once Verney steps down, the party's formal ties to Dallas will
shift to the new chairman's place of business, be it Florida,
Pennsylvania or New Jersey. Verney, who rejected talk of a
Perot-Ventura rivalry, said the change is virtually meaningless
because Perot avoids involvement in day-to-day party business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outspoken Texan has not ruled out the possibility of
another White House bid. Perot received 19 percent of the vote as
an independent in 1992, but his share fell to 8 percent when he ran
under the Reform Party banner in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the slide, Perot's showing was good enough to
guarantee the next Reform Party presidential nominee $12.5 million
in federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think he wants it,'' McLaughlin said of
the likelihood of another Perot campaign. ``If the party said, `We
want you,' '' I think he'd take it. Right now, most people in the
party are looking for someone to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has been outspoken in his opposition to another
Perot campaign, has been trying to recruit former Connecticut Gov.
Lowell Weicker. Other frequently mentioned names include
conservative commentator Pat Buchanan and real estate mogul Donald
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $12.5 million, the party's nominee will have the
backing of a organization with a proven ability to overcome
election laws tilted against third party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a general admission ticket to the finals and $12.5
million,'' Verney said of the 2000 election. ``We will be there.''

FAMILIES REQUESTED NAVY FOR BURIALS AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy sea burials of John F. Kennedy Jr., his
wife and her sister were authorized by Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief
of naval operations, after requests from the families of the dead,
Pentagon officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy personally contacted Defense Secretary
William Cohen on Wednesday to request that his nephew be buried at
sea. Cohen passed the request to Johnson, who approved it at once,
according to Lt. Meghan Mariman, a Navy spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Similar requests were made by the families of JFK Jr.'s wife,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette, and
approved at once, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy was meeting the needs of the nation in responding to
the request of the Kennedy family _ the needs for closure, needs
for respect, needs for help,'' said Kenneth W. Bacon, the
Pentagon's chief spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said Cohen had not sought
President Clinton's approval before passing the requests on to
Johnson, but that the president wholeheartedly agreed with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mariman said hundreds of burials at sea are performed every year
for Navy dead. The ceremonies are performed only occasionally for
civilians, she said, but are perfectly within naval regulations
when permission has been granted. The burials of Kennedy, his wife
and sister-in-law were conducted Thursday from the destroyer USS
Briscoe off Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the carrier John F. Kennedy Thursday morning, a prayer
was offered, followed by a moment of silence, while the ship was
engaged in exercises off the mid-Atlantic coast, Mariman said.
President Kennedy served in the Navy in World War II.

GOSMAN SEEKING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF CAREMATRIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Abe Gosman, the legendary deal maker and nursing home
magnate who has hit hard times recently, is weighing plans to
regain control of CareMatrix Corp., an operator of assisted-living
communities he sold for about $250 million in stock three years ago
to a Burlington company, Standish Care Co.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other suffering Gosman ventures, CareMatrix stock has
plunged 68 percent this year following critical government reports
about quality of care and consumer protection issues at
assisted-living centers and investor fears the booming industry may
be overbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Gosman, however, indicated Thursday he thinks the selloff has
gone too far. CareMatrix's board of directors, which he chairs,
said it is looking for an investment banker to weigh plans for a
leveraged recapitalization _ essentially a management-led buyout _
``or other strategic alternatives that could maximize shareholder
value.'' In a prepared statement, Gosman said, ``We feel that the
current valuation of the assisted-living sector may indicate that
it would be more conducive for CareMatrix to be a private company
rather than being in the public market at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the board expected to tap an investment banker within a
week. Board member Donald Amaral has been pegged as a consultant to
work on the deal.
</P>

   The 70-year-old Gosman has made a fortune that reached an
estimated $480 million in 1996, landing him on the Forbes 400 list
of wealthiest Americans, before dropping by nearly half two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   For years the son of Russian immigrants has made headlines
through moves such as selling, repurchasing, then reselling
Mediplex Group Inc., the nursing home concern he built.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Gosman lost millions when Congress revoked the
unique tax-favorable status of a racetrack owner he had arranged to
merge with his Meditrust Cos. real estate investment trust. Shares
of another Gosman venture, PhyMatrix Corp., designed to buy up
physician practices, have also plunged in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   CareMatrix operates 60 assisted-living centers, alternatives to
nursing homes that provide seniors with a more independent
lifestyle while making medical and other assistance available on
site. It is building 18 more.
</P>
<P>
   While the aging of the baby boom generation has boosted stocks
in companies like CareMatrix and Sunrise Assisted Living Inc.,
their valuations have been rattled by an April General Accounting
Office study of centers in four states.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Congress's investigative arm found that more than
a quarter of the facilities it investigated had been cited for five
or more problems of quality of care or full disclosure of services
to prospective residents. The report fueled fears of a tougher
federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   CareMatrix stock fell 3/8 to 9 3/4, down from 30 5/8 on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Doctrow, a Legg Mason Wood Walker analyst who rates stock
CareMetrix as ``outperform,'' told Bloomberg News its price has
been depressed ``because of a lot of investors' concerns about
assisted-living companies. These were seen as growth stocks, and at
these share prices, it's difficult for them to get access to
capital to fund that growth.''

WEARY RIDERS SPRINT WITH END IN SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Most of the riders in the Tour de France are
weary and mainly looking forward to the end in Paris on Sunday,
which should have meant that the long, flat stage Thursday would be
raced at a moderate speed by a compact pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't bet on it,'' Jens Voigt warned beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt, the German rider for the Credit Agricole team, explained:
``A lot of teams haven't won anything yet and there aren't many
chances left. Some people are going to be attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight people, to be exact. Representing such have-not teams as
Festina, Vitalicio, Lotto, Big Mat-Auber, Francaise des Jeux and,
yes, Credit Agricole, the eight riders jumped away at Kilometer 45
(Mile 28) of the 200 overcast and breezy kilometers (124 overcast
and breezy miles) from backwater Mourenx to the wine center of
Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Their lead reached a maximum of 7 minutes 55 seconds at
Kilometer 100 (Mile 62) before a speedy chase began to reel them
in. Order was restored with 15 kilometers to go, when the last two
fugitives were sopped up.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the time for the obligatory sprint in Bordeaux,
which has welcomed the Tour nearly every year since it started in
1903, and has almost always witnessed a mass finish because of the
flat country leading into town.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei and an unfamiliar name the last
10 days as the race passed through the mountains and the Massif
Central, proved that the wear and tear have not reduced his power.
Registering his third victory in this 86th Tour, he won by half a
bicycle length over Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Rabobank.
Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, was third despite the thunderous
leadout support from his teammates, and George Hincapie, an
American with U.S. Postal Service, was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top sprinters two years ago, Zabel has obviously lost
rapidity in the final 200 meters and is now obliged to settle for
second and third places. He is wearing the green-points jersey,
however, and seems certain to bear it to Paris for a record fourth
successive year.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the American who leads the U.S. Postal Service
team and the Tour de France, had a quiet day although the pack was
disrupted twice _ once when firemen protesting working conditions
stopped the race shortly after its start and then when a spectator
about 7 kilometers (4 miles) from the finish hurled a cloud of
pepper into the path of the riders, interfering with the vision of
some.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan continued to wear the yellow jersey of the overall
leader by 6:15 over Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme, and
7:28 over Alex Zulle, a Swiss with Banesto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his early hopes, Voigt is nowhere near that group of
leaders. He finished the day in 62nd place among the remaining 141
riders, more than 1 hour 45 minutes behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The mountains, first the Alps and then the Pyrenees, did him in,
which was surprising for a man who usually rides strongly as the
road rises. After he finished eighth in the first long time trial
on July 11, the 27-year-old German was optimistic about his overall
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt showed little disappointment Thursday morning, possibly
because he has dealt with setbacks before. Despite a strong record
as a member of Germany's national amateur team, he found it nearly
impossible to find a job when he decided to turn professional in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a little book about me, what races I did and the years,
how many kilometers I trained and I sent it to the top 22 teams,''
he said. ``I really put a big effort into it: colors and
photographs and printed on a computer; really nice. Then I had it
translated into English and French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent it to the teams and I said: `Hey, please at least
answer me. Say yes or no, but answer me. What's the story?' But
only two teams answered, Festina and Rabobank, and both said no.''
</P>
<P>
   The Telekom team in Germany was especially uninterested. ``I
tried three years to get a contract with them and they never wanted
me,'' Voigt said.
</P>
<P>
   He finally signed with the Giant ZVVZ team in Australia,
performed well and was recommended by officials there to Credit
Agricole, then under the colors of the Gan insurance company. In
his first season in France last year, he rode so well that he was
elected third-leading bicycle racer of the year in Germany, behind
Zabel and Jan Ullrich, who finished second in the Tour and also
rides for Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Telekom would like to have me now,'' Voigt said with a
laugh. ``Too late. I'm happy where I am.''

`BONANNO' IS LONG, INDULGENT AND ULTIMATELY UNSATISFYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are glaciers that move faster than ``Bonanno,'' a two-part
movie airing Sunday and Monday on Showtime. And some have better
plot development.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, ``Bonanno'' is a big, fat addition to America's
Mafia-movie library that offers some good dish on organized crime.
But at four hours and 50 minutes, ``Bonanno'' is a veritable prison
term for anyone with a busy schedule and a healthy sense of right
and wrong. It is indulgent, confusing and ultimately unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   It also is unintentionally amusing in its dispassionate telling
of a story that presents mobsters as noble businessmen who view the
occasional rubout as an effective solution to a nagging personnel
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanno'' is adapted from two books _ ``A Man of Honor,''
Joseph Bonanno's autobiography, and ``Bound by Honor,'' written by
his son, Salvatore ``Bill'' Bonanno.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bonanno, now in his 90s, ran one of New York's most
powerful Mafia families for 37 years. His son was a high-level
lieutenant. Both are convicted felons with pasts undeniably more
exciting than your average business executive. But their lives as
merchants of menace are translated to the screen with all the
panache of spaghetti without the marinara.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed Canadian director Michel Poulette bought into the
Bonannos' claim that they're just average guys with a firm
commitment to friendship, trust and tradition. The result is almost
five hours of moviemaking bereft of any dramatic ebb and flow. The
mobsters go about their various businesses, some of them
legitimate, with zeal and conviction, but not a lot of excitement.
While it may be the true story of the Bonannos' view of their
Mafia, as opposed to dramatic embellishments like, say, ``The
Godfather,'' it's not a great way to keep an audience from drifting
off to snooze city.
</P>
<P>
   The production is lavish, with scenes shot in Montreal, Rome and
Sicily. And despite the weak storytelling, some performances are
noteworthy. The always compelling Edward James Olmos is powerful as
young Joe Bonanno's mentor, Salvatore Maranzano, in the early days
of Prohibition. And Bruce Ramsay makes the young Joe an almost
sympathetic antihero.
</P>
<P>
   Olmos and Ramsay appear in Sunday's installment, the stronger of
the two. It has more of a movie feel than Monday's, which seems
more documentary in nature as it trots out the Bonanno version of
Mafia influence on the election victories of Franklin Roosevelt and
John F. Kennedy, as well as the involvement of several Mafia
figures _ but not the Bonanno family _ in Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in flashback by the elder Bonanno, played by
Martin Landau. But Landau's narration, purposely made to sound like
that of a tired old man, only adds to the film's enervating effect.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno. Two-night television movie about Joseph Bonanno, one of
America's legendary organized-crime figures. Starring Bruce Ramsay,
Tony Nardi, Edward James Olmos and Martin Landau. Sunday and Monday
at 8 p.m., Showtime. Parental guideline rating: TV-MA.

 &HT;    Coke's fundamentals strong, Ivester says
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, seeking to
restore investor confidence in the company and its shares, says
prospects remain bright, even though any rebound in profitability
is likely to be gradual.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, however, didn't provide an outlook for
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early for me to give you a prediction for next
year,'' Ivester said to about 100 analysts and investors here. He
said the company's strengths remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing over the past 24 months has altered our view of our
long-term fundamentals,'' Ivester said at the 90-minute meeting,
which was held in response to requests from the investment
community.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Ivester, Coca-Cola is now able to react
more swiftly to changing market conditions, and it knows its
customers better.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales and profits have been hurt by global
recession and a health scare in Europe that prompted the costly
recall of products in several countries. Coca-Cola also faces a
European Union probe into its marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   While the business environment continues to be ``challenging,''
Ivester said, there are signs the worst may be over.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some previously depressed markets, such as
Indonesia and Korea, aren't declining further.
</P>
<P>
   Overall case volume, an indicator of the company's underlying
business, is about where it was a year ago, added Chief Financial
Officer James E. Chestnut. Coca-Cola derives about 75 percent of
its profits overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chestnut said gross profit margins are likely to slip
this year because of the costs associated with the consolidation of
bottling operations in Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that profit margins are benefiting from price
increases in some markets, such as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those price boosts have temporarily depressed volume and
permitted rival Pepsi, which deferred raising prices, to grab some
market share. But Ivester noted that Pepsi is now raising prices as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases, he said, will help bottlers achieve better
returns and permit them to expand the distribution of chilled
drinks, such as those sold from vending machines. Those sales are
more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Price increases will be ``prudent'' and ``selective,'' Ivester
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other matters, Ivester said:
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no need to name a president. ``We need less
hierarchy,'' he said. ``In 10 years, I can see layers going out,
rather than coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The company wants to resume its stock buyback program as soon
as possible. ``The sooner the better, and the faster the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday, Coca-Cola's shares rose 50 cents to $63.12
1/2.

CLINTON VOWS VETO OF LARGEST TAX CUT IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Thursday approved the largest tax cut in
history, setting up a pivotal showdown with President Clinton, who
assailed the measure as a reckless giveaway to the wealthy that he
will veto.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a group
of rebellious Republicans relented in the final hours and provided
the margin of victory, as the House voted 223-208 to cut federal
taxes by $792 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The action, which creates a lightning rod for debate in the 2000
elections, moves the measure to the Senate, where Republican
leaders are pushing a separate $792 billion plan for tax breaks.
The largest previous tax cut was $749 billion in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto threat is expected to force Republican leaders to
negotiate with the president, who has indicated he will block any
tax cut greater than $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a prelude to the showdown, GOP leaders cast themselves as
sentinels guarding against a spendthrift Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tax cut for fairness,'' said Hastert, who survived a
serious challenge to his leadership in shepherding the prized
Republican initiative through a largely reluctant House. ``We are
giving the American people the opportunity to take more money home
to put in their own pocketbooks instead of putting it in the
pockets of bureaucracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats described the tax-cut plan, titled ``The Financial
Freedom Act of 1999,'' as a recipe for a replay of the economic
downturn that followed the 1981 tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a backloaded, budget-busting, billionaire
bonanza,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts
Democrat. ``It's the pluperfect form of the Republican Robin Hood
in reverse. The wealthiest Americans get huge tax breaks and the
vast majority of ordinary people get nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat,
depicted the measure as ``a financial time bomb that will rip a
hole in the economy and return it to the late 1980s and early
1990s, which many of us in Massachusetts remember not as a
recession but a depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure would exhaust most of a projected $3
trillion surplus over the next decade by gradually cutting every
income tax rate by 10 percent, reducing capital gains taxes,
phasing out inheritance taxes and easing the so-called ``marriage
penalty.'' The bill also would expand tax credits for education,
health care and retirement purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this money is left in Washington, the politicians will
spend every dime of it on more government programs,'' said
Representative Bill Archer of Texas, who was the chief architect of
the tax cut as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
``Let's start today and give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   After hours of intense wrangling late Wednesday night, Hastert
and Archer appeased most of the rebellious GOP moderates with a key
concession that would scale back the tax cuts if the nation's $5.5
trillion debt began to worsen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only four moderate Republicans voted against the
measure: Representatives Michael N. Castle of Delaware, Greg Ganske
of Iowa, Constance A. Morella of Maryland, and Jack Quinn of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Six conservative Democrats from districts in the South and West
broke ranks and voted for the GOP package.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, the House voted, 258-173, to kill a Democratic
alternative for a $250 billion tax cut. Ganske was the only
Republican to support the Democratic plan, which 38 Democrats
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt, who along with John Olver was one of only two New
England Democrats to vote against the Democratic alternative, said
he viewed any large tax cut as a lower priority than preserving
Social Security and Medicare, and paying down the national debt. He
said he was wary about the fragility of the global economy. And he
expressed concern that projections for the federal surplus may ``be
built on sandcastles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't maintain fiscal discipline,'' Delahunt said, ``the
next thing we know the stock market, jobs, our prosperity, all
could be at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahunt and other Democrats described the Republican proposal
as far riskier for the nation's economic stability. They also said
the GOP plan could be particularly harmful to domestic programs
that may need to be reduced to compensate for the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, the top 1 percent of taxpayers, individuals
earning an average of $833,000, would receive a tax break of
$37,854, according to Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a
Massachusetts Democrat. By contrast, Moakley argued on the House
floor, the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, who earn an average of
$20,000, would see their taxes drop $138.33.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley projected that reduced domestic spending would cut
services for 200,000 children in Head Start, cause the Veterans
Administration to treat 986,000 fewer hospital cases, and end
federal rent subsidies for 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican proposal will benefit very few at the expense
of very many,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans countered that the wealthy already are taxed so
highly that they contribute about 40 percent of the total income
taxes the government levies. Referring to the rich, the House
majority leader, Richard K. Armey of Texas, said, ``You shouldn't
pay more than we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Several moderate Republicans who initially opposed the GOP plan
out of concern over the national debt and possible cuts in domestic
spending expressed confidence that they had resolved both issues by
forcing Hastert and Archer to include protections that addressed
both issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a win for everybody,'' said Representative Charles F.
Bass of New Hampshire, who was among the GOP moderates who received
the concession from Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Another moderate Republican, Representative Ray LaHood of
Illinois, said the concession was crucial for Hastert because it
protected his stature and preserved a key element of the GOP
agenda. ``For our party, this is the Big Kahuna,'' LaHood said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, saw it
another way. He argued that the moderate Republicans buckled under
pressure rather than stand by their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The least likely figures to appear for us here are Santa
Claus, Elvis, and courageous moderate Republicans,'' Frank said
after the final vote. ``This proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   The full Senate is expected to take up the tax issue as early as
next week.

SUPSECT IN SERIAL KILLINGS INDICTED ON CAPITAL MURDER CHARGES IN
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>

(Attn: Ill. Ky.) 
 
By JOHN MAKEIG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A capital murder indictment was returned Thursday
against Angel Maturino Resendiz in the death of a physician in her
Houston-area home.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County prosecutor Devon Anderson obtained the indictment
after a grand jury presentation that lasted less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Dec. 17 slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, of West
University Place, an enclave of Houston, was the ``strongest case''
against Maturino Resendiz because of all the evidence that was
found in Benton's home. Benton died of multiple stab wounds and a
blow to the head. She was also sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the policy of our office to proceed with the strongest
case, and that's Dr. Benton's,'' Anderson said. ``But the Dominguez
case won't be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of Houston schoolteacher Noemi Dominguez, 26, in
June could be brought up in the punishment phase of Maturino
Resendiz's trial if he is convicted of capital murder and the state
asks for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   And if an appeals court reverses that sentence, the prosecution
could start over and try him for Dominguez alone.
</P>
<P>
   Benton and Dominguez are among nine victims the so-called
``railroad killer`` is suspected of slaying in Illinois, Kentucky
and Texas since 1997. The name is derived from the fact that the
killings occurred near railroad tracks and authorities think the
killer traveled the United States on trains.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Maturino Resendiz's trial should start in February
or March. District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. said it would be in
March.
</P>
<P>
   But state District Judge Bill Harmon wants the trial to start by
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want it to begin as soon as possible,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz surrendered to Texas authorities July 13 in El
Paso. At that point, Texas had only charged him with burglarizing
the Benton home.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say DNA evidence has connected Maturino Resendiz to
Benton's rape, and several hair samples are still being tested to
see if they will provide further DNA evidence. The chance of two
people having matching DNA has been estimated at 1 in 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A West University police document in the county's case folder on
the burglary outlines why Anderson considers the Benton case so
strong, even before the DNA evidence was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   It says Maturino Resendiz's fingerprints were found on the
doctor's purse, which had been ``dumped open'' on a jewelry box in
her closet, and on pieces of the steering column that were broken
off her Jeep Cherokee, which was stolen and found later in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   While checking on those fingerprints, West University detectives
came upon some of the many aliases Maturino Resendiz has used
during his many arrests by police and U.S. immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
   One check of the prints led them to ``Carlos Rodriguez,'' who
was arrested in 1993 in Carson County for unauthorized use of a
motor vehicle. Another led to ``Pedro Angel Jaramillo,'' arrested
in 1995 by railroad police on charges of receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the prints were linked to ``Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez,`` the alias authorities used until he was brought
back to Houston. Defense attorneys Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte now
say Angel Maturino Resendiz is his real name and are filing motions
identifying him that way.
</P>
<P>
   One of those motions requests that police not be allowed to
question Maturino Resendiz without defense counsel present.
Another, evidently filed by Anderson but also signed by Tanner and
Duarte, advises Maturino Resendiz that he can get help from the
Mexican Consulate in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that another motion will be filed soon to have
Maturino Resendiz examined by experts to determine if he is sane
and competent to stand trial. Such a motion could be filed by the
defense or prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just watching what the state is doing,''
Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Anderson was quickly surrounded by television cameras when she
arrived for her appearance before the grand jury _ while Holmes
entered unnoticed through a different entrance.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted later she was Holmes' ``bait'' _ so he would not
dominate media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Holmes again departed without drawing attention,
while Anderson again talked with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, he was in the grand jury chamber as Anderson
laid out the evidence against Maturino Resendiz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hear the presentation, and I had some things to
say about the `turn-yourself-in' business,'' Holmes said, referring
to complaints from Maturino Resendiz and his relatives that they
understood the state would not seek the death penalty if he
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes denied that he was hiding from the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bashful,'' he said. ``One of the neat things about
this job is getting exposure about what you do. I wasn't avoiding
anything. I was letting the lady with the case get the exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Maturino Resendiz returns to court at 9:30 a.m. CDT Friday for
formal arraignment on the capital murder charge. Harmon said the
arraignment is only a prelude to a discussion on the trial date.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ In her tidy, pink-curtained apartment here,
Jenny Catanzaro, a retired hospital laundress, snipped out the
local newspaper's reprint of the Bessette-Kennedy wedding photo,
the one in which Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's hair gleams silver-gold
as her groom holds her hand to his lips. She plans to frame it and
hang it next to President Kennedy on her wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sick over it, that's all,'' Mrs. Catanzaro said.
``Oh, such a lovely couple!''
</P>
<P>
   In her deeply personal reaction to the death of people she had
never met, and in her habit the last several days of keeping a
constant eye on the television, Mrs. Catanzaro resembles millions
of Americans who lay no flowers and light no candles, but who share
the grieving involvement of those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Their psychology is not simple, experts say, and some mourners
admit to failing themselves to fathom why they feel so much; but
the emotions they express are straightforward: admiration, long
familiarity and fascination, a visceral sense of connection with
the ever-bereaved Kennedy family. The Kennedy story is a riveting
one, with tragedy, scandal and drama, that has unfolded in real
time along with their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   They are legion, these mourners. Continuing coverage of the
crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr, his wife and sister-in-law
Lauren Bessette has broken several records for cable television
ratings and numbers of visits to news Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   True, many people are baffled by their downcast neighbors.
``It's much like Princess Diana,'' said Tom Epstein, an
environmental engineer here. ``It's very sad that they died, but
they're really not famous in their own right _ it's accidental. A
lot of my friends almost resent the coverage, and at the same time
you feel guilty for resenting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, those who care seem to outnumber those who
don't, at least according to a casual sampling of sentiment here in
Providence, a newly hip old industrial city and college town where
John F. Kennedy Jr. went to Brown University. They may not be able
to say exactly why they care _ when pressed, they tend to list
Kennedy virtues and sorrows _ but they do.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beauty Connection, a hair salon on Federal Hill here,
Isis Adames, the owner, has been keeping the radio on a news
channel, she said, and clients have been talking about little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like he's the family of everybody,'' said Ms. Adames,
who immigrated from the Dominican Republic 10 years ago. ``He was
too young to die, he had a lot of future and it's gone already.''
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Providence, Benjamin E. Dias, a retired longshoreman
of 51, said: ``I've been feeling like a part of my family passed
away. They're the type of family you fall in love with, because
they're not out to get you, they're out to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Dias was selected at random for an interview as he sat
chatting with a parking lot attendant. He turned out to have read a
book about the Kennedy administration, to know the family history
well, from the virtues of its matriarch, Rose, to the sins of its
patriarch, Joseph, and to be planning to spend until 2 a.m.
watching cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   Dias admires the strong Kennedy sense of family and harbors a
few conspiracy theories about whether John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane
really got caught in fog. ``Both parties knew he was going to run
for president eventually,'' Dias noted darkly.
</P>
<P>
   Of John F. Kennedy Jr., he said, ``He never was sarcastic, he
never pushed people off, he was just a gentleman's gentleman, and
everybody loved him.'' Also, ``He was just an average guy, put in
an awkward position at an early age, and responded to it
gracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on psychology and American culture say there are some
powerful mechanisms at work that may help explain such personal
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we live in reality,'' said Charles P. Ducey, a
psychotherapist at Harvard University, ``but in fact we live, in
part, in the world of the imaginary. The Kennedys represent to
many, many people ideals of vigor, vitality, beauty,
sophistication, family tightness, even fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with an ideal becomes a personal one, Ducey
said, in that ``we want to appropriate their aliveness and
idealized qualities through making them the repository of our
ideals, projecting our ideals on them and identifying with them. It
makes us feel ennobled. At least in fantasy, we can dine at the
best places or be politically powerful or be changers in the world
of fashion or public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducey identified another phenomenon probably at work, that when
people are beautiful, others tend to fantasize that they are
invulnerable, ``protected from the travails of us mere mortals. So
when someone like that dies, it cuts through our denial that bad
things really happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the political aspect, Ducey said, for baby-boomers
who grew up seeing President John F. Kennedy as the repository of
liberal ideals and as a highly personable and personal president,
young and approachable. Those who remain liberals may have invested
their hopes for a liberal renaissance in his son, and everyone who
has repressed the pain and trauma of his assassination may have
felt the wound rent open a bit by this latest death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a psychological slippery slope right back to the pain at
that time,'' Ducey said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The fascination and sorrow is not limited to those 40 and above.
</P>
<P>
   College students, as well, have reported being glued to the
television since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle LeBlanc, a 20-year-old junior at Louisiana State
University, said in a telephone interview that she had been
watching for hours each day because she ``just couldn't believe
it'' and ``needed to hear it over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole mystery behind his father's death,'' she said, ``it
just seems like _ how could this happen to him, too? I couldn't
stop watching, and it's not like he's an important person or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the widespread, febrile fascination with the crash
story seems to reflect the royal-like role that the Kennedys play
in American society, said Henry Jenkins, director of comparative
media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Think, he said, of the bards 300 years ago. They circulated news
and legend about kings and queens, who fulfilled a basic need ``in
that they personified something larger than the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The king stood for the nation,'' Jenkins said, ``so what
happened to the king happens to the people, to one degree or
another, even though there was an enormous leap between the king
and the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that need has been lost,'' he said, ``even
though we live in an era of modern communications. We still have a
need to mythologize the people in power. We need someone who is
larger than ourselves. And I would suggest in the late 20th
century, that need is greater than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In a big, multicultural society like this one, where people are
more aware of others with whom they have less in common, ``Those
things we do share and know everyone cares about take on added
importance,'' Jenkins added. ``Because those are the things we can
talk about among ourselves despite these differences. And they're
things we can talk about on the Internet with people who live very
far away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing out his words, there has been an electrical storm of
Internet interaction concerning the Kennedy crash, a great deal of
it focused on people simply sharing their raw emotions with each
other. Some bulletin-board comments have expressed resentment that
a celebrity death would receive so much more attention than an
ordinary person's death; others have voiced grief and defended the
Kennedy record.
</P>
<P>
   Also at play, Jenkins noted, has been the narrative power of how
the immediate crash story unfolded, and how it fit into the larger
story of the Kennedys. Both Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr.,
he said, died young, ``and have an enormous following built up
around them over a long period of time. So it's as if we killed off
the protagonist one-third of the way through the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   A debate swirls around all this. Some say the public is showing
an admirable bell-tolls-for-thee empathy with others' misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Others maintain that celebrity culture and obsession with
beautiful, famous people can be destructive in that it seems to
diminish lives that are less glittering.
</P>
<P>
   There are also internal debates for people who wonder aloud why
they feel so much, and have no easy explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Catanzaro, the retired laundress, said that now, at age
78, she finds she is feeling sadder about the Kennedy plane crash
than she did about the fatal car crash of her sister back in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Kennedys, this tragedy got me more than my own
blood,'' she said, sounding a bit defiant. ``That's the way I feel.
That's the truth. I don't think anyone would ever change my mind
about liking them or thinking the world of them.''

 &HT;    Norfolk Southern, CSX grapple with clogged rail lines
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Norfolk Southern and CSX, the two big rail lines that
recently absorbed former Conrail tracks to bolster their service,
have run into unanticipated problems, congestion and service delays
during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Norfolk Southern, which has a major presence in
Atlanta, acknowledged the problems and outlined steps it is taking
to fix them this month. It hopes to have them solved before
transportation demands grow in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has experienced delays primarily on the
former Conrail lines in the North and Midwest, especially east-west
lines from areas such as New York and Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,
Cleveland and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In response to queries from the Conrail Transaction Council, a
body of shippers and government officials overseeing the operating
changes, Norfolk Southern said the routes that took effect June 1
have adequate capacity. However, the company said, ``other factors
contributed to our operating problems beginning in June.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise from several sources, the company said, including
trouble with the integration of computers for the combined system,
faulty data from the computers, difficulty notifying and marshaling
train crews to handle the work and confusion in some service orders
by customers.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have resulted in a backup of cars on the tracks,
called ``cars on line'' in the industry. This has slowed the
system. The company said it expects to reduce the number of cars on
line and resume more normal service by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   What has been troubling and ironic is that both Norfolk Southern
and CSX have worked during the past year to prevent the very
problems that have now overtaken them.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern, in its statement Thursday, was trying to quell
fears of prolonged congestion and service tie-ups like those that
plagued the Western rail lines when Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific merged their lines starting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Burns, a spokesman for CSX in Jacksonville, Fla., said
Thursday the company has also run into some difficulty with poor
data from its computer systems and last-minute decisions by
shippers to alter their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have made steady progress in reducing our trains on
line,'' Burns said. ``Our service is not what we want it to be, but
we are making steady progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern's problems apparently are more severe because
the company took over more of Conrail's lines serving major
industrial centers.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Norfolk Southern said: ``First, we were
confronted with, and are still dealing with, shortcomings in our
computer systems, particularly with respect to the quality of
data.''
</P>
<P>
   That has led to problems locating cars and getting them to their
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   As Norfolk Southern acknowledged, these problems can become
intolerable in today's transportation market, where manufacturing
and other plants rely on prompt shipments so they will not have to
warehouse parts.
</P>
<P>
   Other trouble during the changeover was caused by difficulties
communicating with work crews, ``preventing many employees from
making timely notification of their availability for assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Norfolk Southern said, problems arose with ``some
customers waiting until just prior to the June 1 implementation
date to decide how they would utilize the new competitive
alternatives now available between Norfolk Southern and CSX.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the congestion occurred on former Conrail lines,
the company said some of the problems spilled over into other
regions, Norfolk Southern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, there were more cars on the system than could be
processed, especially when much of the processing was unproductive
due to faulty information.''

TOUR FANS BEDAZZLED BY PERFORMANCE OF `LES AMERICAINS' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ The cyclists in the Tour de France are
storming toward Paris. And les Americains are leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   With the finish in sight Sunday, Lance Armstrong, of Austin,
Texas, has a secure hold on the leader's yellow jersey, and every
day he's surrounded by teammates as all-American as he is _ guys
from Michigan, Illinois, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was no different, as the 141 riders remaining in the
three-week Tour rode for 124 miles of flat road from Mourenx to
Bordeaux up the west coast of the country. It was goodbye to the
mountains and goodbye to the drug stories that have persisted for
Armstrong the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian rider Tom Steels, who rides for the Italian Mapei team,
dashed into the city surrounded by three dozen other cyclists, but
shook them off in the final sprint on the road downtown next to the
Garrone River. Steels, with a winning time of 4 hours 22 minutes 29
seconds, won a sprint stage in the first week, and almost won one
the following day, but was disqualified for elbowing another rider
at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong, who came in with a pack eight seconds later, is
still in control with a lead of 6 minutes 15 seconds over Spaniard
Fernando Escartin. Behind Armstrong in the standings, but with him
on virtually every hill are teammates Tyler Hamilton of Brookline,
Mass., in 16th place; Kevin Livingston of Austin, Texas (38th);
Frankie Andreu of Dearborn, Mich. (65th); George Hincapie of
Charlotte, N.C., (78th); Christian Vandevelde of Lemont, Ill.,
(129th), and the lone foreigner, Frenchman Pascal Derame (140). The
two other teammates, Jonathan Vaughters, of Englewood, Colo., and
Danish rider Peter Meinert-Nielsen, have dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Yanks have made a go at this 85-year-old French legendary
sporting event before; heck, they've even won it. But never before
has an all-American team produced such an all-American image. They
are sponsored by the folks who deliver the mail, and the leader is
from the land of 10-gallon hats and John Wayne movies . . . what
more could you ask for?
</P>
<P>
   So it's a contrast to Jonathan ``Jock'' Boyer _ who wore a stars
and stripes jersey and was called ``Jacques BoyAYE'' when he rode
the Tour in the early '80s, and to Greg LeMond, who won the race an
astounding three times, but always rode on French teams. It's even
gone beyond the now defunct 7-Eleven and Motorola teams, whose
rosters were more international.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorski, who has been with the US Postal Service team since
it was formed in 1996, said it's no accident the team no longer has
the mix of riders it used to. When US Postal Service first rode the
Tour three year ago, less than half of the riders were Americans.
Since then, they've released a Frenchman, a Polish rider, and a
Russian cyclist, and have bulked up on Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a real conscious effort to bring on more Americans,''
said Gorski, the general manager. ``You know, we're the US Postal
Service team, we're the only American team, and if things had gone
right, we might have had eight out of nine Americans here.'' US Pro
winner Marty Jemison of Salt Lake City didn't make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   With Armstrong wearing the yellow jersey, Gorski said he feels
more respect from the other managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I would never say there was any disrespect, it was
just that we were new kids on the block, the new team, and I don't
think they really paid much attention to us,'' he said. ``It's not
that they did anything particularly devious or anything, but they
just didn't really look at us as serious contenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who is riding in his third Tour, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a different level of respect, ever since
Lance got the yellow two weeks ago,'' he said. ``I don't know how
exactly, but I just sense it. They didn't believe that we could
ride the way we've ridden. I know they thought Lance had nobody to
protect him in the mountains, and Kevin and I proved them wrong.
Well, the whole team proved them wrong, they really rose to the
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   So while banners and signs for French and Italian riders still
dominate the roadside every day, more American flags are popping
up, with signs saying ``Go Amstrong'' (sic) ``Go Postal.'' More and
more of the 700 foreign journalists are swarming aroung the
half-dozen American journalists here, wanting to know more about
les Americains.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gorski said he's not shocked at the team's success,
he is a little surprised at the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective from four years ago was to become the first
American team to win the Tour de France,'' Gorski said. ``I just
didn't think it would be this year.''

 &HT;    UPS posts 28% increase in profits
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day after announcing plans for its first public
stock offering, United Parcel Service delivered a 28 percent jump
in second-quarter profits, to $588 million, compared with $458
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The gain was fueled by tripled operating profits from
international operations, which now appear solidly in the black
after years of losses during an expansion phase.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic operating profit rose 17 percent in the second quarter
as UPS, based in Sandy Springs, continues to recover from the
effects of a Teamsters strike two years ago next month.
</P>
<P>
   Average daily domestic package volume was 11.4 million, vs. 11.5
million in the same quarter before the strike, which prompted some
customer defections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't quite passed the final prestrike hurdle,''
spokesman Norman Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The sour note in the quarterly report was a slight decline in
profits in UPS' Worldwide Logistics unit, which offers supply-chain
management services and other nonpackage operations.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the decline was related in part to ``start-up
expenses for things we're not yet prepared to announce.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted nonpackage revenue grew a robust 21.6 percent. It
accounts for less than 5 percent of UPS' total.
</P>
<P>
   UPS said its forays into e-commerce, mainly through software
packages that give shippers online ordering and tracking
capability, continue to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it ``is seeing a significant increase in the
number of companies constructing Web sites for the upcoming holiday
season with built-in UPS shipping functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter revenue rose to $6.56 billion, up 7.4 percent
from the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of the year, profits were $1.1 billion
on $12.9 billion in revenue, up from a year-earlier profit of $810
million on revenue of $11.97 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the timing of the earnings release and the IPO
announcement was coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, UPS said it would end its status as one of the
world's biggest private companies by selling 10 percent of its
stock, or about 55 million shares, in a public offering later this
year. It's expected the offering could generate more than $3
billion, making it one of the biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
   The move is aimed at converting some UPS stock _ now owned
mainly by 125,000 employees _ into market-priced shares that can be
used as currency in future acquisitions.

GERMANY GETS A LATE START ON Y2K PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: The Netherlands, Spain, Great Britain)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, Germany _ Perhaps fittingly, Germany's first real scare
about Year 2000 computer crashes came on a Friday the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 1998, and most people here were greeting warnings
about Year 2000 failures with a lack of interest. It seemed like a
trivial problem, a matter of making sure that computer clocks would
not misread the year 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the test at the Hanover city power company, organized
by a confident data processing manager in the spirit of public
education, with local media invited to watch. At first, everything
seemed fine. But within a few minutes after ``midnight,'' the
computer began spewing out thousands of error messages. Then it
froze up entirely, and the monitors went blank.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover did not go dark. But for a few minutes, it was
impossible to monitor the electric grid or to trace equipment
breakdowns. It took seven months to eradicate all the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought it would be fine,'' said Juergen Rehmer, the
blue-jeans-clad manager who arranged the event. ``We had made a lot
of changes already, and I was quite certain that a full-system test
wouldn't present any great difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehmer's test was a watershed. It disrupted a widespread
complacency about Year 2000 problems, and marked the first time
that a German power company had issued a warning.
</P>
<P>
   At the time it occurred, the German government had yet to make
its first assessment of the Year 2000 problem. Surveys by insurance
companies showed that the vast majority of companies had not even
begun to look at their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European view is that Anglo-American countries are in kind
of an hysterical mold,'' said Peter Eibert, the Year 2000
coordinator at Ford Motor Co. of Europe, based in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and many of Europe's most advanced countries are racing
to make up for lost time. Corporations are pouring billions of
dollars into reprogramming computers. Government agencies have set
up hot lines. Industry associations hold countless conferences,
often invoking the image of ticking time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   They are making headway. Most experts are increasingly confident
that Europe is not likely to see catastrophic failures. A Year 2000
trial involving Europe's major banks went smoothly. Airlines and
airports, which recognized the danger long ago, say they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many smaller companies and public institutions are
running out of time.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, the German Council of Trade and Industry
found that only 45 percent of companies were properly prepared.
Hermes, a German insurance company in Hamburg, estimates that 60
percent of German companies still hadn't started a comprehensive
program by last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there will be a substantially higher rate of
bankruptcies in the year 2000,'' said Walter Schmitt-Jamin, a
managing director of Hermes. A doubling of the usual bankruptcy
rate, slightly less than one percent of companies each year, is
entirely possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The readiness varies considerably across Western Europe. In
Britain, the Netherlands and much of Scandinavia, governments and
corporations jumped on the problem two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany and France, government and business leaders were
until recently more lackadaisical. Poorer countries like Italy,
Spain and Portugal are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The formerly Communist nations of Central Europe and Russia are
much more seriously behind. LOT, the Polish national airline,
announced recently that it will ground about 70 flights on New
Year's Eve out of concern about Year 2000 breakdowns. The Russian
government recently reported that only one-third of the country's
banks were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Western European countries are well prepared in comparison. But
they also have more to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 nations of the European Union, 11 of which have now
adopted the euro as a single currency, is an increasingly unified
economy linked by dense information networks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a boom in the construction of cross-border fiber-optic
networks. Power companies buy and sell electricity over electronic
trading systems. Car manufacturers order from suppliers over
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when car manufacturers sent the worldwide suppliers detailed
Year 2000 questionnaires in early 1997, most of the responses
provided little in the way of useful information.
</P>
<P>
   That became a source of growing anxiety here in Germany over the
next year. Executives at General Motors' Opel subsidiary were
startled to discover that industrial robots they bought in 1997
still had Year 2000 glitches. By August 1998, Opel had decided to
start sending its own Year 2000 assessors on personal visits to key
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was to ask questions that indicated whether the
suppliers knew what they were talking about,'' said Roger Aze,
Opel's Year 2000 coordinator. ``Do you have a person in charge of
Y2K? Do you have a program and a schedule?''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, Opel started sending technical
experts to its most critical suppliers _ the ones whose own
assembly lines are linked directly by computer network to those of
Opel and that deliver on a ``just in time'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   But Aze is still bracing for things outside their control: power
disruptions or problems further down the supply chains.
</P>
<P>
   Power remains one of the biggest concerns. ``The energy industry
had overslept,'' Rehmer said bluntly. It wasn't until July 1998 _
four months after Hanover's surprising test failure _ that the
German Association of Electric Utilities advised members to ``Start
now!'' on Year 2000 preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Year 2000 experts in Germany say severe disruptions are
unlikely but cannot be ruled out. As a result, many big industrial
manufacturers are scaling back production to insulate themselves
for a shock of an abrupt power disruption.
</P>
<P>
   BASF AG, the chemical conglomerate based in Ludwigshafen, has
decided to shut a number of its systems on New Year's Eve so it can
get by on the electricity from its own on-site power plant.
</P>
<P>
   So many manufacturers are reducing their power consumption on
New Year's Eve that the utility industry has begun to worry about
disruptions caused by an abrupt plunge in demand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key differences between European countries on Year
2000 issues is the degree to which governments became involved.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair has built up a huge
program to promote awareness and point companies toward solutions.
Besides drumming up publicity, the government fielded several
thousand ``bug busters'' to get out the word.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands started a similar program, known as the Dutch
Millennium Platform, headed by Jan Timmer, the former chairman of
Philips Electronics NV Timmer irked business groups by exhorting
them to act, but most now experts rank the Netherlands alongside
the United States and Britain as among the best-prepared countries.

HANOVER, Germany: best-prepared countries.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By contrast, German leaders did not show much interest in the
subject until a few months ago. The government issued a tepid
report one year ago and a more thorough one this spring, and it
only recently set up an Internet site devoted to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments have largely been quiet on the matter. In
March, the German weekly news magazine Focus published a survey
indicating that most German cities had not yet prepared themselves
for problems. According to the survey, carried out with the German
Conference of Cities, half the cities had yet to test their
hospitals, and one-third had not tested their mass transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals have had a rude awakening. Andreas Tecklenberg,
director of a 260-bed hospital in the north German town of Eutin,
was dismayed when only six out of 150 manufacturers gave him useful
answers when he sent them queries about Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has started to get better information. At the
moment, he estimates, about one-third of the hospital's systems are
``green'' or ready; about one-third are yellow, and one-third still
red.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devices will have to be watched,'' Tecklenberg said. ``But
fortunately, we can have people take over if equipment goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At the German Heart Center in Berlin, which specializes in heart
surgery, administrators are avoiding elective surgery between
Christmas and January 3. It has also imposed a ban on holidays for
most of the medical and technical staff on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this from the American standpoint, we all
started late here,'' acknowledged Marcus Werner, who coordinates
the center's Year 2000 planning.
</P>
<P>
   Werner started his preparations in October and said he was now
reasonably confident about the hospital's medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many others, he worries about power. The hospital
shares a back-up generator with the University of Berlin, but he is
still worried about the software that will have to ration the
relatively scarce electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it comes down to is things you basically have no control
over,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Carleton Fiorina recalls dropping out of law school at the
University of California at Los Angeles as one of the most
difficult decisions she ever made. She had long assumed she would
become a lawyer, following in the footsteps of her father, a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   So after graduating from Stanford University, she headed off to
UCLA to pursue what she assumed was her destined career. She washed
out after one semester. The grind was bad, but Ms. Fiorina
recalled, ``What I really disliked was the emphasis on precedent,
the singular emphasis on what had gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, she has shown little regard for precedent, either in
her thinking or in her career. Ms. Fiorina, 44, took over as the
president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Co. on
Saturday, becoming the third woman to lead a Fortune 500 company,
after spending 19 years at AT&AMP;T and its spinoff, Lucent
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard _ the nation's second-largest computer company,
with $47 billion in sales last year _ is by far the largest
corporation with a woman as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In her career at AT&AMP;T and Lucent, the equipment-and-research arm
of Ma Bell that was spun off in 1996, Ms. Fiorina demonstrated an
instinct for unconventional choices, colleagues say. She joined
AT&AMP;T at 25 _ a delayed start in the corporate world after a failed
marriage in California, a stint teaching English in Bologna, Italy,
and earning an M.B.A. from the University of Maryland. She began in
AT&AMP;T's mainstream long-distance business in the Washington office,
selling phone service to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized as a potential executive, she was sent by AT&AMP;T to a
year-long management program at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School in 1988. William Marx, the head of AT&AMP;T's
equipment division, Network Systems, met her at MIT and was
impressed. ``I thought she'd be a first-class leader,'' recalled
Marx, who retired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At his urging, Ms. Fiorina, known as Carly, joined Network
Systems, where she thrived despite its male-dominated culture. In
the early 1990s, colleagues recall, shebegan prodding the unit to
think internationally. ``She was a strong proponent for dropping
our U.S.-centric focus,'' said Lucent chief operating officer
Daniel Stanzione. ``And that was before being global was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, AT&AMP;T announced its plan to split into three
companies _ AT&AMP;T, Lucent and the computer maker NCR. As Lucent's
executive vice president in change of corporate operations, Ms.
Fiorina spent much of the fall and early 1996 working on Lucent's
game plan and selling it to Wall Street in the run-up to Lucent's
initial stock offering in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lucent's shares have jumped roughly tenfold in
price, adjusted for stock splits, as the company positioned itself
as a key supplier in the Internet era and sales surpassed $30
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Fiorina helped shape its marketing strategy, by all
accounts her greatest contribution has been in selling it to
customers and shareholders. Her last job at Lucent was president of
the global service providers business, selling packages of data
networking services to major telecommunications companies. And she
was known for focusing the contracts, which could run into billions
of dollars, around two issues: customers and the competition. ``She
always boils it down quickly to what is it going to take to win
this deal,'' said Dan Plunkett, a managing director of the Delta
Group, a consulting firm that works for Lucent. ``It's in her
DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Former colleagues at Lucent describe Ms. Fiorina as an intense,
inspiring team leader. They speak of thoughtful touches like
midnight voice-mail messages, balloons and flowers sent to
employees thanking them for extra work. Yet she has no patience
with failure, they say, and while the top producers are rewarded,
the least effective are moved out. ``Carly is one of the most
action-oriented people I know, and she doesn't suffer fools well,''
said Stanzione of Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina attributes her no-nonsense manner to her father,
Joseph Sneed, a former deputy attorney general of the United States
who is a federal appeals court judge in San Francisco. ``He is
intellectually rigorous and intellectually honest, no matter what
the consequences,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina said her mother, Madelon, a painter who died
recently, taught her the importance of being positive which she
conveyed with ``a great zest for life.'' Ms. Fiorina says she
selected Lucent's bright red logo partly because it reminded her of
one of her mother's abstract paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my parents had a huge influence on me in encouraging me
to be the best that I could be,'' Ms. Fiorina said. ``I truly grew
up with no sense of limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Her demanding career, however, has involved trade-offs in her
family life. Her husband, Frank Fiorina, 49, took early retirement
last year from AT&AMP;T, where he had risen through the ranks to become
chief information officer of AT&AMP;T's corporate business unit. He
retired early because partly because his and his wife's work and
travel schedules left them little time together. ``Carly said they
felt they were going in opposite directions,'' a colleague said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina has two grown daughters from a previous marriage. But
the couple were married in 1985, when Fiorina's daughters were aged
8 and 12. ``I regard them as my own daughters,'' Ms. Fiorina said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fiorina has some history with Hewlett-Packard. She worked
there as a secretary in the summer before her sophomore year at
Stanford. And before Lucent was spun off, she and others from
Lucent visited Hewlett-Packard as a ``model'' company to study for
its management and corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucent, Ms. Fiorina had a policy of not taking calls from
executive recruiters. But after three failed attempts, Jeffrey
Christian of Christian &AMP; Timbers got through to her directly in
April. ``It was the specific opportunity that appealed to me,'' she
said. ``Hewlett-Packard is a unique company at a pivotal point in
its history.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, Ms. Fiorina met with Hewlett-Packard
chairman Lewis Platt and three other members of the board's search
committee in New York, Chicago and Palo Alto, Calif., where
Hewlett-Packard is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Platt, who will retire in December, said the board was impressed
with Ms. Fiorina's track record of accelerating the pace of change
and growth in an established high-technology company. Board members
also liked her. ``There is an energy and sparkle about her that you
can't help but notice,'' Platt observed.
</P>
<P>
   By leaving Lucent, Ms. Fiorina is walking away from stock
options with an estimated value of more than $50 million. To make
up for abandoning that prize, she is receiving a stock grant and
options from Hewlett-Packard, though the terms of her contract have
not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Though she will be the first outsider to head Hewlett-Packard,
Ms. Fiorina believes she will be ``accepted and embraced'' at her
new company. ``I think HP people are proud and smart, so they know
what works and perhaps what needs to be changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts do not think the selection of Ms. Fiorina
signals a strategic shift at Hewlett-Packard, which is about to
undergo a split-up as AT&AMP;T did. The computer maker, they say, has
rich portfolio of technology and it is accelerating its move as a
supplier to the Internet and electronic commerce markets, though
from a sluggish start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hewlett-Packard has an engineering culture, and it tends to be
slow,'' said Mark Anderson, president of Technology Alliance
Partners, a consulting firm. ``Carly has seen the dark side of
being slow at the old AT&AMP;T and also the benefits of speed at
Lucent. Picking her is not about technology or strategy. It's about
culture.''

 MARKETPLACE: GETTING A BUSINESS FOR NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next 10 days, Aetna Inc. expects to complete what it has
called its billion-dollar purchase of Prudential Health Care. Seven
months after the agreement was announced, though, neither side has
disclosed the full details. And analysts, left to sort it out for
themselves, now say the price is really closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
   With many important facts unknown, exactly how the deal will
affect Aetna's earnings remains murky.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Aetna calls it a billion-dollar deal, the company,
which reported $106.2 billion in assets this year, says the
Prudential purchase is not big enough to have to be reported to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. ``The price is low,'' said
Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the parent, Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, in fact, is virtually paying Aetna to take the
money-losing health care business off its hands and that Aetna will
inherit more than $600 million in cash that Pru Care, as it is
known, set aside to pay future medical claims. In addition, half
the announced purchase price is being financed by a three-year $500
million loan to Aetna by Prudential, which has been urgently
seeking a buyer for at least two years. And Prudential has agreed
to pay Aetna to make up for the bulk of expected operating losses
in the first 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Aetna is essentially getting this
business for free,'' said Jack Reichman, a health insurance analyst
at Standard &AMP; Poor's, the credit rating service. Rich Sinni, a
health benefits expert with Watson Wyatt, the benefits consulting
firm, agreed, saying, ``They got it for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudential is a mutual insurer owned by policy-holders. It will
not have to disclose its finances in detail until next year, when
it becomes a stock company.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pru Care booked losses in the hundreds of millions for
the last three years, Aetna said in December that the purchase
would be immediately ``accretive'' _ that is, it would add to
earnings in 1999 and 2000. Well, ``slightly accretive,'' Ms.
Oberdorf said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph France, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
projects that 15 to 20 cents will be added to Aetna's earnings per
share in 2000. The added pennies will presumably come from fees and
subsidies that will flow from Prudential after the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   An outsider might think that in view of Pru Care's well-known
string of losses, such arrangements for future fees and subsidies
would be subtracted from the sales price instead of adding to
Aetna's earnings statements.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules in the insurance world are obscure, said Paul
Brown, chairman of the accounting department at the Stern School of
Business at New York University. ``On the surface,'' he added,
``there is no question that it looks like an adjustment to the
purchase price, to be taken at the time of the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   But several industry experts said such accounting practices were
not unheard of in mergers and had rarely, if ever, been challenged.
One chief financial officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he recalled similar deals that were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna declined to say whether it would ever break out the Pru
Care results. ``Our reporting will fulfill all generally accepted
accounting practices and SEC requirements,'' Ms. Oberdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company had had ``no interaction'' with the SEC,
although the purchase did require approvals by the Justice
Department and regulators in states where either Aetna or Pru Care
does business. Last month, antitrust officials forced Aetna to
divest two money-losing health plans in Texas, cutting its
membership there by 425,000, to 2.5 million, including 1 million in
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said the deal was expected to close this month, after the
most recent state approvals, in Florida and California, and after
anticipated approvals in New York and New Jersey. But there could
be a delay in New Jersey. On Wednesday, the state medical society
and the American Medical Association asked the state attorney
general, John Farmer, to review the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential, the eager seller, agreed to subsidize future losses
until early 2001. It will make payments to cover expected losses in
providing administrative services to employer groups that
self-insure, meaning that they are responsible for medical costs.
About a third of Pru Care's 6.2 million members are in such groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prudential has been losing money on this business for years,''
seeking to gain market share, said Arun Kumar, an analyst at
Standard &AMP; Poor's. Aetna will not buy the self-insured business.
Instead, it will run it for Prudential until the contracts with
employers expire. Then Aetna plans to raise premiums rigorously and
try to recruit the customers for Aetna U.S. Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could expect an attrition rate of 15 to 25 percent'' _ or
900,000 to 1.5 million members _ Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
   For the more lucrative HMO business, Prudential has agreed to
targets that will effectively limit losses. If Pru Care misses the
targets, as yet undisclosed, Prudential will have to give Aetna 75
percent of the shortfall. If profits surpass the targets,
Prudential keeps 25 percent of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if medical claims turn out to exceed Pru Care's
reserves in the first nine months, Aetna will charge the excess to
Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   Pru Care set aside $520 million last year to cover 1998 health
care losses of $280 million plus anticipated future expenses. When
that proved insufficient, Pru Care absorbed an additional $190
million in the first quarter of 1999, according to insurance
department filings.
</P>
<P>
   Most Wall Street securities analysts have spoken well of the Pru
Care acquisition, which will make Aetna the nation's biggest
insurer, initially with more than 20 million members. But at the
least, the bookkeeping intricacies complicate their profit
projections.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna expects to add millions of new customers to its tightly
managed health plans and to charge them premiums high enough to
make the deal profitable after the Prudential subsidies stop in
2001. Ms. Oberdorf said there would be immediate savings when the
Pru Care unit no longer has to make substantial corporate overhead
contributions to Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   ``People generally think they can continue to make their
numbers,'' said James Lane, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
``But people are definitely on the edge of their seat about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumar said, ``To say a book of business is accretive in a real
sense, it would have to be showing a profit on its own merits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Meyer, an analyst at Duff &AMP; Phelps credit rating
agency, said, ``Whether the dollars are received up front or in
some other form is irrelevant to us.''

   One of  &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR; 's royal footmen has been demoted for
getting her pet corgis drunk. The British newspaper the Sun, which
isn't afraid to express moral outrage, quoted a Buckingham Palace
insider on the soggy saga.
</P>
<P>
   He said the offender had been ``famous for his party trick of
pouring booze into the corgis' food and water. ... He thought it
was funny to see the dogs staggering about. He was lucky not to be
sacked.'' The demon drink that went to the dogs was whiskey and
gin.
</P>

the 32 squares in the lists of 16 ``good'' things and 16 ``bad.''

 &HT;    Like his famous father, he represented hope for the future
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do people care so much that John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a
plane crash last Friday?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is pretty simple. It's because of what he stood for
and the kind of guy he was. Like his father before him, he
symbolized hope for the future and the idea that anything is
possible if you're young and try hard, says Gerald Celente, a New
York social scientist.
</P>
<P>
   It was John Jr.'s dad, President John F. Kennedy, who said in
the early 1960s that we'd land a man on the moon before 1970. The
goal was accomplished in 1969. And it was President Kennedy who
faced down the Russians in 1962 when the world was on the brink of
nuclear war. He was also one of the first major white leaders to
push for equal rights for African-Americans, which eventually led
to the Civil Rights Act in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering John's dad
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy's Jr.'s memorial service is today. His death
makes adults remember the first JFK, who many people think was one
of our nation's greatest presidents. President Kennedy was a hero
in World War II, and seemed to have everything. Tons of money.
Movie-star good looks. A gorgeous wife. And power.
</P>
<P>
   But then he was assassinated in 1963. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   When he died, the whole world cried. For many, the hope he
represented was snuffed out. We soon got more involved in the
Vietnam War, and race riots marred many American cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a famous
African-American leader, was murdered. And a few months later,
President Kennedy's brother Robert was shot dead, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clan
</P>
<P>
   Many say the Kennedy clan is the closest thing America has ever
had to a royal family. John Kennedy Jr.'s great-great grandparents
moved to America from Ireland in the 1850s. His granddad, Joe,
started off selling candy and newspapers, and got rich by the time
he was 35. Joe and his wife, Rose, built their fortune as they
built their family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Joe was named U.S. ambassador to England, and in 1939,
he warned that war was coming. He was right. He'd hoped his son Joe
Jr. would become president one day, but Joe Jr. died in a World War
II plane crash. So Joe Sr. turned to his John.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr.'s dad was almost killed in World War II, too. When he
got home, he was elected to Congress. He won the presidency in
1960, thanks in part to his glamorous wife, Jackie. John Jr.,
called John-John by the media, was born in November 1960, just
weeks before his father took office in 1961, and was a celebrity
from the second he was born.
</P>
<P>
   Living a normal life
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. and his older sister, Caroline, grew up with the world
watching. By the time he was a young boy, John Jr. was used to the
spotlight. But he never became a snob, says Peggy Barlett, an
expert on culture at Emory University. In fact, he led a pretty
ordinary life, and took up hobbies like regular folks do _ such as
inline skating, sailing and learning to fly.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. went to college at Brown University in Rhode Island and
then went to law school at New York University. He worked as a
prosecutor in New York City. But he left that work to start a
magazine called George. He also was known for doing charity work
and contributing money to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   He married his sweetheart, Carolyn Bessette, in 1996 on
Georgia's Cumberland Island. Carolyn Bessette and her sister Lauren
were also killed in the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think JFK Jr. represented dignity and grace ... in a way
that's rare with celebrities,'' says Barlett. ``He was wealthy and
famous, but he wanted to serve, to contribute his life to the
betterment of the nation, and we admired him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also admired, says Celente, because he wasn't a phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the subway. He always had this nice calming smile on
his face. It wasn't because he was so handsome that he was loved,
but a guy who related to the common man, the little people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, he was a lot like Princess Di. He didn't have to
mingle with the little people, but he did. And Americans are hungry
for someone like he was who's not a hypocrite who's in a place of
power to influence positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   With JFK Jr.'s death, Celente says, the Kennedy family has lost
its brightest beacon of hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy family has known sad times
</P>
<P>
   Curses are only real in horror movies, but the Kennedy family
has had horribly bad luck. John Kennedy Sr.'s dad, Joe, was the
grandson of poor people who moved to America from Ireland. Joe
started with zilch, married a woman named Rose and worked hard. But
it wasn't long before tragedy began to stalk.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s granddad, had hoped his son Joe Jr. would
become president, but Joe Jr. was killed in World War II. Daughter
Kathleen died in a plane crash, too, in 1948. President John
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Sen. Robert Kennedy was shot dead
during the 1968 presidential campaign. Ted Kennedy, who's in the
Senate, nearly died in a plane crash in the early 1960s, and in
1969 he drove a car off a bridge. A woman who was riding with him
died.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe's grandkids have had a lot of bad luck, too. One was
killed almost two years ago when he plowed into a tree while
skiing. Another died of a drug overdose. Others have been involved
in scandals. Now JFK Jr. and his wife are dead.

 &HT;    Beauty in a bigger package: Plus-size models in demand as
designers see market take off
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big is in.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers are finally making clothes for full-figured
women that are as jazzy as styles for smaller ladies, and they're
not skimping on quality, color or variety.
</P>
<P>
   Muu-muus and tunics that camouflage the body are out. Plus-size
women are wearing trendy garments such as Capri pants,
spaghetti-strap sundresses, sheer blouses and curve-hugging tank
tops, without making excuses for their dress size.
</P>
<P>
   The change ``validates women feeling beautiful, whatever size
they are,'' says Annemarie Mainwaring, East Coast buyer for
Nordstrom's plus-size department, Encore.
</P>
<P>
   Living large didn't become fashionable overnight. Magazines
directed toward larger women, such as BBW (``big, beautiful
women'') and Mode, helped change perceptions. And high-profile
celebrities such as Rosie O'Donnell, Camryn Manheim (of TV's ``The
Practice'') and plus-size model Emme have done much to improve the
larger woman's image.
</P>
<P>
   Women became more vocal about their desire for fashion-forward
styles as the full-figured population expanded from women ages 35
to 55 to those in their 20s and 30s and juniors as young as 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year 2000, they estimate that 50 percent of women over
age 18 will be a size 14 or larger,'' said Nordstrom's Mainwaring.
``It means, hopefully, we'll get an increased share of the market.
Exciting lines that have done well in missy will go forward in
women's sizes in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers such as Emanuel Ungaro, Gianfranco Ferre, Givenchy,
Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren are responding to the demand by
adding plus-size collections to their lines. Lower-priced brands
such as Garfield &AMP; Marks are also entering the field.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the plus-size market is the fastest-growing segment in
women's clothing. Last year sales were $23.7 billion, up 6.6
percent from 1997 and almost 44 percent from 1993, according to the
NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y., market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for high fashion plus sizes is also being felt in the
modeling business.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Lane Bryant spokeswoman Catherine Lippincott
was a size 16/18 model in New York, she could count fewer than two
dozen models her size, and ``there was never enough business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's probably 150 plus-size models in New York alone
that are working,'' she estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Business for full-size models is just beginning to pick up in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, L'Agence, one of the leading agencies here,
represents eight full-figured models. Elite Modeling Agency has
five and Arlene Wilson Management has four.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Yergens, 18, of Lilburn is one of them. She just signed a
contract with Arlene Wilson in February, and she's already had
three major assignments to model size 12 and 14 garments. One was
an ad for Target that appeared in a recent issue of Seventeen
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started and I'm really happy with the results,''
Yergens said. ``I'm still surprised a girl my size could be a
model.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to size 14/16 model Patricia Williamson has been so
great that she's taking her Arlene Wilson agent's advice to move to
New York so she can get more work. Not bad for a 25-year-old who
was told by an agency years ago that she was too heavy to ever be a
waif-thin model.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Either lose it or gain it.' So I gained a little
bit _ but not on purpose,'' Williamson laughed.
</P>

 &HT;    Celebrate summer's beauty with Bele Chere
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bele Chere _ the annual summer celebration of ``beautiful
living'' in downtown Asheville, N.C. _ has grown to be the largest
free outdoor street festival in the Southeast over the past two
decades. Organized in 1979 to help revive the downtown and lure
shoppers to the central city, the festival drew fewer than 10,000
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event, Friday through Sunday, is expected to attract
more than 350,000 for music, dancing, arts and crafts, mountain
heritage demonstrations, food, sporting events and special areas
for children and teens.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 acts _ from Medeski Martin &AMP; Wood to Ricky Skaggs
_ will perform on nine stages scattered throughout the heart of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is alcohol-free Sunday The interactive Arts Alley,
where festivalgoers will be able to participate in hands-on crafts
such as weaving and mural painting, is another addition.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mountain Heritage Area, which features the living arts
of Asheville's pioneer days, will offer demonstrations including
chair caning and blacksmithing. A log cabin begun during last
year's fest will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zone'' includes lively participatory activities for the
whole family: a NASCAR simulator, virtual golf, micro race cars, a
human maze, obstacle course, jousting and laser tag. Children will
build a Box City using a variety of recycled material in McDonald's
Funland. Older visitors can kick back in the Seniors' Oasis at the
Haywood Park Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And just for fun, raft rides will be offered in the Pack Square
Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Noon-11 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m.-11 p.m. Saturday and
noon-6 p.m. Sunday. Free. Limited parking downtown. Shuttles ($2
round trip) will operate from the River Ridge Shopping Center, off
I-240 at Exit 8, and Westgate Shopping Center, off I-240 at Exit 3.
828-259-5800 or www.belechere.com.

FIRST OF RAYMOND CARVER STORIES HITS PRINT WITH MINIMAL EDITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The papers had sat undisturbed in the desk of writer
Raymond Carver for a decade after his death in 1988. And that was
just fine with Tess Gallagher, his widow and writing partner, who
had left his study in their Port Angeles, Wash., home just as
Carver had left it, out of respect for his memory but also out of
fears about who might get involved once the papers were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher's reluctance finally dissipated in the face of the
enthusiasm of Jay Woodruff, a senior editor at Esquire magazine,
who had urged her to survey Carver's papers in hopes of finding
something new to publish on the 10th anniversary of his death.
Woodruff even agreed to help her.
</P>
<P>
   So this March, the two met in Port Angeles, about 85 miles
northwest of Seattle, and began the delicate task. By the time the
long day was done, they had made their way through Carver's
undisturbed papers, finding notes and scraps, but also the working
drafts for three short stories that seemed complete.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff was ecstatic, Gallagher more subdued, at least until
the first of the three new Carver stories, ``Kindling,'' was
published in Esquire's July issue, to praise. ``I'm very happy now
with the results,'' Gallagher said this week from her home. ``Ray's
voice has come forward wonderfully again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kindling'' will be followed by publication of the other two
new stories (``Dreams,'' ``Vandals'') in upcoming Esquire issues.
All are being published, Gallagher stressed, with ``a very
considered effort'' to keep them as they were found, with minimal
editing (all of which will be set out in a new Carver collection,
with the three stories, to be published next year by Alfred A.
Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Gallagher added, ``has been cut here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no minor matter. A critical New York Times Magazine
article recently charged that editor Gordon Lish was largely
responsible for the shape of some early Carver stories (which
Gallagher has said Carver later renounced). And this month's
publication of Ernest Hemingway's incomplete novel, ``True at First
Light,'' has focused much criticism on massively edited versions of
manuscripts left unfinished at an author's death.
</P>
<P>
   Carver's discovered pieces are short stories, not novels, which
should mute some of that criticism, as should publication of
exactly what editing has been done. But ``Kindling,'' another
expedition into hardscrabble Carver Country in the Northwest, is a
quiet work that does not seem, at least on initial readings, to
merit inclusion among Carver's best stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher believes the three new stories, written in the latter
stages of Carver's life, are particularly notable for the way they
provide ``missing links'' with other stories. She sees ``Kindling''
as the middle story in a trilogy that begins with ``Where I'm
Calling From'' and concludes with ``Chef's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's fine second collection of her own stories, ``At the
Owl Woman Saloon,'' is being published in paperback this week by
Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco's writers
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of intriguing public artworks at Safeco Field, the
Seattle Mariners new stadium, has received much notice. But
Safeco's doffing of its cap to writers has been mentioned only in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the most literary of sports and Safeco pays homage
with the display of work from 11 writers.
</P>
<P>
   These are part of the art project in the stadium's southwest
entrance that includes the entrance gates and the much-noticed
chandelier of translucent bats, plus the compass rose in the main
concourse floor. This project was done by Stable (Linda Beaumont,
Stuart Keeler, Michael Machnic).
</P>
<P>
   The three agreed to include some literary quotes in their work
when approached, in midproject, by three baseball and literary fans
_ Sherry Prowda, then head of Seattle Arts &AMP; Lectures and
originator of the idea, Rick Simonson of The Elliott Bay Book Co.
and this writer.
</P>
<P>
   A search of baseball and literary works followed to find
baseball quotations from a wide variety of writers, amid some
debate. Permission was secured to use the quotes and money was
raised for their inclusion ($3,000 from three supporters of Seattle
Arts &AMP; Lectures, $9,000 from the Public Facilities District).
</P>
<P>
   Quotes in the compass rose came from Don DeLillo, Doris Kearns
Goodwin, Bernard Malamud and Lucille Clifton. Quotes on the
entrance gates came from Lynda Barry, W.P. Kinsella, Richard Hugo,
Donald Hall, Annie Dillard, David Wong Louie and August Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The most poetic quote, and the quote with the strongest local
connection, came from Seattle native Lynda Barry: ``I know now I
was lucky to be in Sick's Stadium when the beautiful Seattle
Rainiers played, lucky to have seen them blast some night game
meteors over the fence, some shining burning meteors that sailed
out of the park and flashed a little starlight into the dark ratty
universe on the other side of the wall.''

 &HT;    Bad language is in the ear of the hearer
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were identical twins, and I cannot recall which of the two
_ Rob or Steve _ let it fly. The Watts were, shall we say, spirited
lads who, when vexed, were given to colorful language. By colorful
I mean electric blue. They were junior golfers, fairly good as I
recall, and were competing in a tournament of local renown. Rob or
Steve, whichever it was, was teeing off on No. 16 when his ball
hooked 90 degrees in midflight and sailed into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   One need not be a golfer to understand calamity. A club was
tossed and the sound of a certain indelicate word reverberated
across the fairway. In horror and embarrassment, a clutch of
mothers turned pink as cotton candy. I was a little uneasy myself.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were not nearby, so the intemperate twin was not
put in shackles or, like Timothy Boomer, convicted later in
criminal court. Boomer, you might recall, is the Michigan man who
said a bad word when his canoe capsized last year. According to one
witness he said it loud and he said it more than once. Under a
19th-century Michigan law, you can't cuss in public and expect to
get away with it, even if you're thrown into the drink without
warning.
</P>
<P>
   The news stories did not report what word Boomer chose to
express his feelings at a moment of deep personal disappointment,
not to say irritation. But you know it wasn't ``darn'' and it
wasn't ``drat.'' I'll bet you anything he used the F-word.
</P>
<P>
   For some, an essential part of speech
</P>
<P>
   There are those who, never in their entire lives, have let the
word pass their lips; it may never even have taken shape on their
tongue. Grace works in mysterious ways.
</P>
<P>
   There are others for whom it is one of the parts of speech, as
essential to the sentence as a noun or verb. More, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us it's a word we wish we hadn't said, but did
anyway. Our kids hear it, and wonder why Dad talks like that when
the kitchen's an inch deep in milk (and the new $30 mop doesn't
work). Son, a man named Thomas Paine said there are times that try
men's souls, and this is one.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a brief in behalf of cussin', only a comment on
vulgarity and taste. None of us really approves of bad words, but
H.L. Mencken, in his classic ``The American Language,'' noted that
a word's voltage can depend on which side of the ocean you're on.
``Bloody,'' for example, ``is entirely without improper
significance in America, but in England it is regarded as indecent,
with overtones of the blasphemous.'' When George Bernard Shaw put
the word into the mouth of the very respectable Mrs. Patrick
Campbell in ``Pygmalion,'' proper folks were scandalized. Mencken
quoted The New York Times' report:
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in the first English performance centered in the
heroine's utterance of this banned word. It was waited for with
trembling, heard shudderingly, and, presumably, when the shock
subsided, interest dwindled.''
</P>
<P>
   A chaste reliance on euphemisms
</P>
<P>
   Most taboo words wilt once exposed to air and the euphemisms
used in their place become quaint. Among the many examples Mencken
gives, ``goshamighty,'' ``cripes'' and ``jeez'' _ transparent
derivatives of God, Christ and Jesus _ came into use because
certain folks wanted to express annoyance or surprise without
cussing. A particularly silly word in this regard is ``friggin'.''
Its etymology is not in the least edifying, and yet chaste souls
use it to sound as if they put some zip into their otherwise staid
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times, to paraphrase Paine, when the soul is tried
beyond ``goshamighty,'' ``dadgummit'' and even ``friggin'.'' I
don't like cuss words and generally don't use them. I especially
don't like the F-word, although it's no more objectionable than
half a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   What goes unnoticed is the impunity with which other words _
equally coarse, equally repugnant _ are used daily. They are not
expletives, but part of a slang whose main engine seems to be talk
radio.
</P>
<P>
   One is the four-letter word that starts with ``s'' and rhymes
with, well, the F-word. I detest it. They say it's big in the
middle schools, an all-purpose epithet that ends up describing the
speaker more than it does the object of his dislike. But I hear it
on the sports talk shows _ public assemblies for moronic males _
and it's a favorite of Neal Boortz's. (I know, I know: Turn the
dial to National Public Radio. You won't hear Karl Haas using it.)
</P>
<P>
   No statute that I'm aware of prohibits its use, although if I
were to risk using it in this newspaper I could be selling shoes at
Kinney's. The more disagreeable sounds in our everyday speech
aren't the infrequent expletives but the exuberant rudeness and
in-your-face incivility that are part of daily discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech is an abstraction in the absence of concrete
examples. It's the examples, small in themselves, that tell how
mixed a blessing it is.

 &HT;    Mega-medium shapes world
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of the last year of the century, a priest joked
that if Jesus Christ returned for the Second Coming, his first stop
would be CNN headquarters in Atlanta. The comment was fictional, in
a novel titled ``Messiah'' by Romanian poet Andrei Codrescu, but
reality was working hard to make such speculation seem reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, the wired world, Magdalena Cizbanoska could
hear the NATO planes pass over her home in Macedonia, on their way
to bomb Belgrade, Yugoslavia. They drowned out the sound from her
TV set as she watched ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the bombers had dropped their payloads, CNN International
would pick up Serbian TV reports on the damage and send them on to
212 countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Micky Haimovich, anchor of the Channel 2 Nightly
News, rushed home after work to catch her favorite show _ ``Ally
McBeal'' _ only to have it pre-empted by a special about the
Israeli elections. ``People were really angry,'' Haimovich says.
``It's the most popular American show in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard researchers announced that teenage girls in the South
Pacific's Fiji Islands, which only started getting TV reception in
1995, were suddenly developing eating disorders after watching
``Melrose Place.'' In Brooklyn, N.Y., cable subscribers could pick
up Egyptian soccer teams playing on the Arabic Channel, while in
Miami, the public TV station carried ``BBC World News.'' Star TV, a
satellite service owned by Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp, was getting
ready to add ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' to its programming in
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really worry as I travel through the world about the volume
of channels,'' says Tom Johnson, chairman of the CNN News Group,
whose news service covers virtually every country on the planet via
17 satellites. ``So much of it is created to be the most popular
and not necessarily the best quality.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, protesters had chanted, ``The whole world is
watching.'' They were halfway right. As the calendar prepared to
click over to triple 000s, the whole world was watching the whole
world. Or as Time magazine put it when it made Ted Turner its Man
of the Year in 1991 (largely for founding CNN), ``What we are
seeing is not just the globalization of television. What we are
seeing is the globalization of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of the century, television has become more than
a mere medium; it is the uber-medium, the technology that ate the
world. The single biggest influence on what books people read is
Oprah Winfrey's Book Club. For years, the best guide for movie
audiences has been the thumbs of Roger Ebert and the late Gene
Siskel on their TV show. TV ads direct us on how to choose our
telephone service, our computers, our Web portals and, of course,
our TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   While other media and entertainment formats shape us, television
is the command center, the orchestrator of all other media, New
York University professor Neil Postman wrote in his 1985 book,
``Amusing Ourselves to Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one goes to a movie to find out about government policy or
the latest scientific advances,'' he wrote. ``No one buys a record
to find out the baseball scores or the weather or the latest
murder. No one turns on a radio anymore for soap operas. But
everyone goes to television these days for all of these things and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is our culture's principal mode of knowing about
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It determines our elections through advertising, shapes
international diplomacy, causes world leaders and governments to
tremble and sometimes tumble. It affects our children, although the
debate on just who is influenced and how has been going on for more
than 40 years. Some say it changes the very way we perceive the
world; the way we think, or don't think.
</P>
<P>
   The mass media, particularly television, has created a world
``where fantasy is more real than reality,'' Librarian of Congress
Daniel Boorstin wrote in 1960, when television was really just
setting its hook in us. Now, you can hardly tell fantasy from
reality on television, particularly when TV plays reality as if it
were a miniseries; ``60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt pegged the
O.J. Simpson trial as ``TV's longest-running entertainment
special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of TV may be junk, but the other 10 percent can
be educational, entertaining and worth watching,'' says John J.
Pungente, author of the new book ``More Than Meets the Eye.''
</P>
<P>
   And we've exported it. ``We have American producers coming over
to the Netherlands and teaching us how to imitate (Jerry) Springer
and Oprah (Winfrey),'' says Wouter van der Horst, a reporter for
Netherlands TV. ``So much of what we have is either American TV or
a copy of American TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a negative effect on world television,'' says
Patrick O'Heffernan, a former Georgia Tech professor who now
produces international TV for the Population Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as we sit in our Barcaloungers thumbing our remotes in
search of that perfect blur of reality and fantasy, don't forget
the people of Romania, who watched the Berlin Wall being taken
apart brick by brick on their TVs in 1989 and were inspired to
overthrow their own dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. It doesn't get any
realer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who previously had been denied access to a free flow of
information were able to see a world beyond their borders,'' says
CNN's Tom Johnson about TV's role in the chain-reactive fall of
communism. ``Not only in the news reports,'' he adds, ``but even in
the commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Samuel F.B. Morse and his telegraph or Gutenberg and his
printing press, there was no single inventor of television, no
``Watson, come here, I need you'' moment. Television as an idea was
theorized about and worked on in Europe and America in the late
19th century and in the first decades of this century, by
well-funded teams in laboratories and driven eccentrics tinkering
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The name itself first appeared, right on time, in 1900, at a
scientific convention in Paris, where Constantin Perskyi presented
a theoretical paper on a process he called television, supplanting
previous names such as the telectroscope.
</P>
<P>
   But if we were simplifying the invention of television for a
made-for-TV movie, we might start with an Idaho potato field in
1921, where 14-year-old Philo T. Farnsworth was plowing. The boy
had been thinking about something that a lot of inventors had also
been thinking about: how to send pictures through the air like
radio sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth looked back at the evenly plowed rows, or so the
legend goes, and had the epiphany that electrons could be projected
onto a screen in rows just like those in the potato field, and they
would form a picture. Six years later, Farnsworth filed the first
of several patents that were key in developing the new medium of
television. There is no single father of television, but Philo T.
Farnsworth _ with that wonderful farm-bred, all-American farm
boy-inventor name _ is as close as anyone comes.
</P>
<P>
   By 1928, Farnsworth was set up by investors in a lab, working on
his television system. One day an investor came by and asked when
he was going to start seeing some money back out of this new
gadget. Farnsworth was ready for him and sent a single, simple
image, because that's all the invention could do at that point. On
the TV set in the lab, Farnsworth sent the image of a dollar sign.
</P>
<P>
   How appropriate that Farnsworth established the dollar sign as
the symbol of television before a single set was sold or a single
commercial made. The dollar became the driving force of television.
It happened right away in the United States and took longer in most
countries, but eventually capitalism _ the selling of viewers to
advertisers _ was responsible for the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after all, what most TV is really about: not ``ER,''
not CNN's coverage of an international incident, but advertising.
To the people who run the business of television, programming
exists to get people to watch commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the TV industry was built on the model of
the radio industry. Congress declared in 1934 that the
electromagnetic spectrum _ the invisible portion of the atmosphere
where radio and TV waves travel _ was owned by the public. But in
reality, the airwaves were controlled by a handful of major
corporations: RCA and CBS in the early years, joined later by
Disney, Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Commercial-free,
public television was a straggler in America, and despite the
occasional ``Sesame Street'' or ``The Civil War'' never had
anywhere near the impact of the commercial broadcasters.

   UNDATED: of the commercial broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   In the '30s, there were sometimes more TV transmissions than
there were sets in private homes. Tiny experimental stations sprang
up in the Eastern United States, sending pictures at first to
engineers' homes. The 1936 Olympics in Berlin were televised to
theaters in Berlin, and the BBC showed Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain returning from Germany in 1938, promising ``peace in
our time,'' in what is believed to be the first live telecast of a
news event.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's prediction of peace, of course, actually turned
out to be World War II, which switched off the development of TV.
It was not until after the war, in the late '40s, that television
truly began, slowly in most countries, but with the speed of Philo
Farnsworth's electron beam in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the U.S. networks _ powerful NBC and CBS (already
established through radio), struggling ABC and doomed Dumont _
aired mostly sports and pseudo-sports: baseball, boxing,
professional wrestling, roller derby. But the vast amounts of time
to fill, and money to be made from sponsors, led to series, which
led to an explosion of new stars: Milton Berle, Lucille Ball and
Desi Arnaz, Howdy Doody. Some stars carried over from radio: Jack
Benny, Edward R. Murrow, Arthur Godfrey. Some were newly minted for
the new medium: Sid Caesar, Annette Funicello, Ernie Kovacs,
Captain Kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   The home TV set moved from curiosity to luxury to necessity. In
1950, 9 percent of homes had TV; in 1952, 34 percent; by 1962, 90
percent. Trends came and went _ vaudeville, westerns, live drama,
quiz shows, variety shows _ but television became more and more a
constant in the life of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter what was on. The TV was on; that was what
mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Newton Minow, the former Federal Communications Commission
chairman who coined the term ``vast wasteland,'' was a friend of
Robert Kennedy's in the early '60s. ``I'll always remember
something Robert said to me,'' he recalls. ```There used to be
three great influences on the child: the home, the school and the
church. In the home there's a fourth: television.'''
</P>
<P>
   The '60s saw the consolidation of television's dominance, from
President Kennedy's funeral in 1963 to Neil Armstrong's moon walk
in 1969. In between, coverage of the Vietnam War introduced a new
phrase, ``the living room war,'' and a new concept: that television
might be more powerful than the president of the most powerful
country on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   When CBS anchor Walter Cronkite aired a special on the Tet
Offensive in early 1968, he concluded that the best the United
States could hope for in the Vietnam War was a stalemate. President
Lyndon B. Johnson, watching in the Oval Office, switched off the
set and said to his aide Bill Moyers, ``If I've lost Cronkite, I've
lost Middle America.'' Soon after, Johnson announced that he would
not seek re-election. ``The nation's uncle had rendered judgment,''
historian Barbara Tuchman later wrote. Five years later, Watergate
would only become an issue to many Americans, and lead to the
downfall of the next American president, when the Senate hearings
were televised live.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans wallowed in their watching of what Paddy Chayefsky
called ``the basic theater of our century,'' as ``The Beverly
Hillbillies'' gave way to ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and as cable grew
from a way to improve the picture in rural areas into a huge
industry of niche networks, a quieter revolution was taking place.
In 1962, the first communications satellite, Telstar, was launched
into orbit, linking North America and Europe. David Brinkley,
reporting in Paris, told Americans there was ``no important news''
in the city that day. A Canadian university professor, Marshall
McLuhan, saw a bigger picture and predicted that the world would
soon become a ``global village.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more satellites followed, and cable was laid around the
world, so that by the end of the century viewers in Australia could
watch Matt Lauer live at base camp on Mount Everest on NBC's
``Today,'' Saudi Arabians could watch Serbian atrocities via BBC
World News, Moscow businessmen could watch high school students in
Littleton, Colo., on CNN International and Venezuelans could watch
``The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, most countries had had one or two channels, usually
noncommercial and supported or run by the government. The models
were different, ranging from the objectivity and high culture of
the BBC to the propaganda and dreary dramas of Soviet and Eastern
European TV. But in the '70s and '80s, many democracies began to
allow commercial channels to compete. Then cable and satellite
transmission let loose a deluge, usually of American news and
entertainment _ movies and music, but mainly American TV shows. The
soap opera ``Dallas'' was translated into 90 languages, and ``Wheel
of Fortune'' was adapted throughout the world, with dozens of Vanna
White knockoffs turning a letter board of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   And the world turned. The Soviet Union, which had rigidly
controlled its own television for its entire existence, began
experimenting with glasnost (openness), allowing MTV to penetrate
the Iron Curtain on a limited basis in 1988, then CNN in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two things TV does best are free speech and free
enterprise,'' said Barry Sherman, professor of telecommunications
at the University of Georgia. ``Both conspired to bring down the
Soviet model.''
</P>
<P>
   Under glasnost, viewers behind the Iron Curtain could see the
lavish lifestyles of ``Dallas,'' the hedonistic videos of MTV, the
truth about the world on CNN and the commercials they all ran.
There were many forces that caused the fall of the Berlin Wall in
1989 and the self-destruction of the Soviet Union into individual
republics in 1991 _ political, historical, economic _ but there is
no doubt that those forces were whipped along by television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise be to information technology! Praise be to the
reporters and announcers of CNN!'' Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet
foreign minister, wrote in 1991, shortly after a coup against
Mikhail Gorbachev had failed. Although official Soviet TV had been
running pro-coup stories and authorities had tried to cut off CNN,
Russian homes with satellite dishes had been able to get the truth
about what was happening from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day 1991, Gorbachev signed the official papers
dissolving the USSR. He had forgotten his pen, however, so he
borrowed a black Mont Blanc from Tom Johnson, then president of
CNN, who was in the Soviet leader's Kremlin office for the historic
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beginning of the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin had said,
in effect, that the capitalists would sell the communists the rope
with which they would hang themselves. Near the end of the century,
Lenin's successor had broken up the Soviet empire by signing his
name, with a pen loaned to him by a television executive.
</P>
<P>
   Philo Farnsworth's little experiment _ a dollar sign on a TV set
_ had conquered the world.

 &HT;    Movement to digital TV set to revolutionize medium
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next revolution in television _ the biggest revolution ever
_ has already begun. But you probably haven't noticed, or cared.
</P>
<P>
   It's digital TV, sometimes called High Definition Television
(related to but not exactly the same thing as digital), and it will
change everything about television, except, most likely, the
quality of the shows. That will take a creative upsurge, not a
technological one.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: The changes are coming, and they're huge.
``We're in the pioneering stages of a new digital era that's going
to be the most exciting yet,'' says Tom Johnson, chairman of CNN
News Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What digital really means is instead of us operating in a
50-channel universe, we could theoretically be operating, in
another five years, in a 2 million-channel universe,'' says David
Hill, former CEO of Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, the whole notion of a ``channel'' won't mean
what it means today, says Steve Necessary, vice president of
marketing for Scientific-Atlanta, which is building set-top boxes
that will be part of the revolution. A ``channel'' on your digital
TV set could mean NBC, or your
</P>
<P>
   e-mail, or Web site amazon.com, or an update of your stock
portfolio, or a new video that starts when you want it to start.
There could be 1 million cable subscribers in a major city tuned to
1 million different ``channels'' simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   For all of TV's history, we've watched an analog signal _ a wave
traveling through the air. (Even on cable, it's still basically a
wave). Now, TV networks and stations are converting to digital, a
signal in 0s and 1s, which is the same way a computer processes
information. A digital signal can carry much more information than
analog.
</P>
<P>
   The first use of that additional information has been far better
picture quality and CD-quality sound. Already networks are
broadcasting shows such as ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,''
``Chicago Hope'' and ``Wonderful World of Disney'' in digital TV,
but you need either a new digital TV set or a set-top converter box
to see the difference.
</P>
<P>
   But just as cable TV was driven by consumer desire for better
picture quality at first, and then grew into a massive industry, so
digital will eventually result in ``an explosion of new choices,''
according to Andrew Fisher, executive vice president of Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters (networks such as Fox, stations such as WXIA),
cable networks (such as CNN) and cable system operators (such as
MediaOne) all are planning digital expansions. On cable systems, as
broadband (a bigger pipe into the home) becomes more widespread, so
too will the choice of pay-per-view options until we reach what's
called ``video on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll pull up a menu on your TV, press a button and begin
watching a movie and have the same control over that movie that you
have over a videotape in your VCR,'' says Necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from ordering pizzas to paying your electric bill via
digital TV is talked about by someone, somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters, meanwhile, are currently limited to one channel,
but digital will allow them to expand to as many as 12 channels. A
station would have its regular signal but might also rerun its
afternoon soap operas in prime time, run a local weather feed 24
hours a day, have reams of extra sports statistics available during
a game and sell you, directly, everything you see during the
commercials or the shows themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For now, digital sets are too expensive ($5,000 and up) but will
inevitably come down to the price range of sets today, says Robert
X. Cringley, host of the PBS series ``Triumph of the Nerds.'' As
prices fall, the industry will announce more and more innovations
to drive consumer desire.
</P>
<P>
   But the networks are taking it very slow in making those
announcements. ``This is one of those cases where you can tell the
pioneers by the arrows in their backs,'' says Scott Sassa,
president of NBC Entertainment, explaining why the TV powers are
making lots of plans but holding back on implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inevitable, the experts agree. Digital TV may be
poking along right now, but in the century to come, it will make
today's 60-channel cable lineup look like the days of
black-and-white and rabbit ears.

 &HT;    No mystery: The end in sight for `X-Files'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It looks very likely that after this coming
season, TV's hit ``The X-Files'' will become ``The Ex Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm preparing in every way for this to be the final season,''
creator Chris Carter said Thursday at the biannual meeting of the
Television Critics Association here. ``I'm plotting these 22
episodes as a wrap-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said there was still a chance that Fox, which wants the
show to continue, would make a deal to enable another season, but
it was Carter's firmest statement ever that the show finally will
wind down, and that its complex mystery-mythology of aliens
colonizing the earth finally will be explained in full. He said
both he and star David Duchovny's contracts are up after this year,
and Duchovny has been very vocal about wanting off the show to
pursue other acting opportunities. Co-star Gillian Anderson has a
longer contract, but the series' hard-core following would probably
be outraged if Fox tried to make the series without Carter or
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot for fans is that Carter said he is in
negotiations for a second ``X-Files'' feature film, and that it's
not a matter of if, but when, that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Carter appeared at the TCA tour to talk about ``Harsh Realm,''
his virtual reality series launching in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   With a military setting that includes a lot of gunplay, the show
is violent at a time when the outcry against violence in the media
is louder than ever. But Carter said it would not be toned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into a lot of blood, guts, gore and gratuitous
gunfire,'' he said. ``I want to suggest a lot, see the effects of
violence and not the violence itself. It's not the glorification of
war, it's the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   `Party' star moving on
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Love Hewitt will walk away from ``Party of Five,'' the
Fox series that made her a star, this season after three episodes.
Her character, Sarah Merritt, will move to New York to search for
her biological father in ``Time of Your Life,'' a drama that will
premiere in October.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been plagued by rumors of trouble ever since the
pilot was scrapped for extensive reworking. But the producers, who
also created ``Party of Five,'' said the changes were made because
``Time,'' originally meant to follow ``Party,'' was moved to 8 p.m.
Mondays, where it would precede ``Ally McBeal.'' The new show, they
say, will be geared to viewers who never watched ``Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, 20, who's called ``Love'' by her friends and family,
said she wasn't concerned that committing to five years on another
series would compromise her film career (``Can't Hardly Wait,'' ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer'') or music career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be movies I miss out on doing, but my heart is in
this,'' she said, adding that she hoped that having her character
move to New York after breaking up with her boyfriend would show
teenage girls that it's OK to be single.

HOUSE PASSES TAX-CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: An expanded version of this story is scheduled to move by 9
p.m. ET; see also TAX-ASSESS) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the House put down their marker
Thursday in the debate over how to allocate projected federal
budget surpluses, passing the largest tax cut in nearly two decades
despite a veto threat from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which would cut taxes by $792 billion over
the next decade, passed on a largely party line vote of 223-208.
Four Republicans voted against it, and six Democrats voted in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome averted a major defeat for Speaker Dennis Hastert
and the rest of the Republican leaders, who scrambled throughout
the day on Wednesday to keep the bill from being derailed by
objections from a dozen or so moderates within their own party.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates said the tax cut was too big and left none of the
surplus for debt reduction and needed spending, but most of them
voted for the bill in the end after adding a complex and hastily
written provision that makes a portion of the tax cut contingent on
reducing the interest payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for personal income tax rates to be cut gradually
by 10 percent over the next decade, and for the top rate on capital
gains to be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It would also phase in a repeal of the tax on large
inheritances, create a deduction for health insurance expenses, cut
a variety of business taxes and reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, which leaves many two-income couples paying a bigger tax
bill than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill stands almost no chance of becoming law. But it
represents the opening bid by conservatives as they head toward
negotiations with the Senate, which is moving toward passage of its
own, somewhat less partisan, tax cut, and with Clinton, who despite
his veto threat has opened the door to some tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is among the most ideologically charged and
politically potent facing Congress and the Clinton administration
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1920s has the federal government had a realistic
prospect of taking in more money than it spends over a sustained
period. Current estimates show the government running a surplus of
$2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, permitting both parties the
luxury of setting out wish lists that reflect their basic
philosophies about the size and role of the federal government,
their approaches to long-term challenges like assuring the solvency
of Social Security and their strategies for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ideology and politics, there is also economics. Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and usually one of
Washington's most outspoken proponents of tax cuts, undercut the
Republicans Thursday by suggesting that Congress should hold off on
a big tax reduction while the economy is strong and concentrate
instead on paring the national debt. Big tax cuts typically
stimulate economic growth, and the Federal Reserve is already
concerned that the economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is not right,'' Greenspan said in response to a
question at the House Banking Committee a few hours before the vote
on the tax bill. ``I think we will need a very important reduction
in marginal tax rates and in the capital gains tax rate at some
point in the future when this economy inevitably falters.''

 &HT;    Caravaggio's life gets methodical treatment, but biographer
lacks artistic flair despite hard living, artistic innovations
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a man of melancholy and fire, shadow and light. His
revolutionary paintings _ epicene boys, translucent vases of
flowers, religious subjects that possess an almost obscene
naturalism _ made him one of the most famous artists of his day.
And though he painted like an absolute angel, and was befriended by
popes and princes, he was a murderer, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1571-1610), one of the
great innovators in the history of art and something like the James
Dean of the Italian Baroque _ brooding and sensual, sexually
ambivalent and dead at 39. An heir to the Renaissance, Caravaggio
lived in a world reeling from the aftershocks of Martin Luther's
Reformation. His time, and his mind, were out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   For some 300 years after his death, this bad-boy master of the
chiaroscuro had a somewhat tepid reputation. His shooting star had
plunged. But after a 1985 retrospective at New York's Metropolitan
Museum of Art, and Derek Jarman's homoerotic film of 1986, the
Caravaggio myth began to take on a life of its own. Like Vermeer,
who also had a way for turning prosaic moments into images of
psychological profundity, Caravaggio has recently acquired a much
larger audience (one of his masterpieces, the ``St. John the
Baptist'' from the Capitoline Museum in Rome, is on display at the
Wads-
</P>
<P>
   worth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., through Sept. 12).
</P>
<P>
   That the swarthy painter is difficult to elucidate only pumps up
the frenzy to publish. Readers want to know more about the violent
man who took his dirty-footed models from the Rome demimonde and
killed a man in a knife fight. But how much more is there to
report?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, if one is to take British writer Helen Langdon's new
biography at face value.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the scholar hasn't done her homework.
She gives context and plenty of it, weaving a detailed tapestry of
the politics, history and religion of the age, excerpting from the
poetry and polemics of the day, and building upon the work of
Caravaggio's previous biographers. She just doesn't know how to
turn it all into a good story.
</P>
<P>
   As an emotional portrait, Langdon's book is particularly flawed.
She refutes the popular notion that Caravaggio was a homosexual by
telling us that he liked the company of heterosexual colleagues and
ladies of the night and that, by the way, he painted pretty women,
too. She explains his grisly naturalism by saying that he probably
took the advice of Leonardo da Vinci, who advised budding artists
to hone their craft by watching public executions and the like. And
she says that Caravaggio's last pictures are darker because he was
a fugitive on the run, in fear for his own life. Well, blow me
away.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are a few vivid details hidden within this
laborious read. There's Caravaggio the young Turk, calling the
patron who fed him salad for dinner ``Monsignor Insalata.'' There's
the egocentric artiste attacking the poor restaurant waiter who
couldn't tell him which artichokes were cooked in butter and which
in olive oil. There's a lovely account by Orazio Gentileschi
(father of Artemisia) about Caravaggio's sending around to the
artist's studio to borrow a pair of wings and a Capuchin robe to
use as props.
</P>
<P>
   When describing some of her subject's more lyrical passages,
Langdon's prose sometimes takes on a blush of its own. But then
she'll come out with a clunker such as this: In Rome, the saints
``were recalled by the Mamertine prison, from which Peter's attempt
to flee martyrdom was halted by a vision of Christ carrying the
cross, to whom he addressed the famous words Domine Quo Vadis? _
Whither goest thou? _ in the small and humble church of Santa
Prisca, built over the house of Aquila and Prisca, where Peter had
stayed, and which was restored for the Jubilee by Cardinal
Benedetto Giustiniani, who shared with Baronio a special veneration
for St. Peter, and in the church of Santa Pudenziana, built over
the house of the senator Pudens and his daughters, Praxedis and
Pudenziana, both virgin martyrs, and restored by Cardinal
Alessandro de Medici.''
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone have the slightest idea what she is talking about?
</P>
<P>
   Langdon seems to have spent an awful lot of time with this
artist. Yet in the end, I don't think she quite gets him. Die-hard
caravaggisti will want to read this treatise, but for less serious
browsers, there are better books out there _ with pictures whose
details you can actually see.

 &HT;    6 Southerners go up against publishing giants
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the New York book industry continues to consolidate, more
small publishers are springing up to fill niches left by the
conglomerates. The latest such press is BelleBooks, a new
publishing company formed by six Southern female authors.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's purpose is to ``showcase the rich storytelling
traditions of Southern women,'' says company president Debra Dixon,
an author and Tennessee business consultant. BelleBooks' first
offering, ``Sweet Tea and Jesus Shoes,'' a collection of humorous
and poignant short stories, will be published in May.
</P>
<P>
   Among the collection's authors are Georgia natives Deborah
Smith, Donna Boyd and Sandra Chastain. Smith, the author of the
1997 best-selling novel ``A Place to Call Home,'' made news this
year with a two-book, $1.2 million deal with Little, Brown. Boyd is
the author of more than 80 novels in both genre and general-list
fiction. Chastain is the author of more than 40 novels in
contemporary and historical women's fiction. Her latest, ``The
Runaway Bride'' (Bantam Books, $5.99 paperback), is a featured
selection of the Doubleday Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   The press eventually will acquire novels and story collections
from outside writers, but Dixon says the first projects will
involve only the six authors. Other partners are Florida romance
author Gin Ellis, a former NFL photographer who has extensive
graphics and design experience, and Georgia writer Nancy Knight,
author of the critically acclaimed 1998 play ``Chattahoochee
Rising.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would successful authors want to get into publishing?
Smith says it's a matter of control. ``Even for the rare author who
has achieved a certain amount of success, the business of
publishing will always be capricious. This also gives us an
opportunity to publish material that our traditional publishers
wouldn't want.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Smith at DebBsmith(at)AOL.com or
write her at 1065 Ridgeway Road, Dahlonega, GA 30533.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Joint effort: Some authors are finding two heads are better
than one when it comes to writing a book.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Mary and Pam O'Shaughnessy, writing as Perri
O'Shaughnessy, have done very well collaborating on such legal
thrillers as ``Acts of Malice.'' And husband and wife Howard and
Susan Kaminsky create page turners such as ``The Twelve'' under
their own names, although they wrote the first two novels under the
pseudonym Brooks Stanwood.
</P>
<P>
   The latest novel in the dual-authorship trend is ``Gideon''
(Ballantine, $24.95), a thriller about a novelist who is asked to
write a book based on a mysterious diary. The subject of the diary
is not identified, but obviously he is a powerful player in
Washington politics. The writer is paid $250,000 in a secret deal
with his agent, but before he can finish the project, people all
around him are killed and he finds himself a target as well.
</P>
<P>
   The author is Russell Andrews, a name that's not familiar
because it's the pen name of David Russell Handler, a novelist, and
Peter Andrew Gethers, an editor at Random House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began as a movie script,'' Gethers says, ``but when we
showed it to screenwriter William Goldman (``Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid,'' et al.), he told us he thought we had a novel. So
we outlined it and began expanding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gethers and Handler each wrote 20 to 30 pages a week and
e-mailed the results to be edited and rewritten as one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have done this as easily without the Internet,''
Gethers says, ``since I live in New York and he lives in
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   No movie deal has been signed yet, but with Goldman involved,
Gethers says, it's almost a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the news: Plans for a fourth film version of ``The
Godfather'' may be dead, but there's more fiction coming from the
late author Mario Puzo. ``Omerta,'' a novel about a contemporary
Mafia family, will be published next summer by Random House. ...
St. Martin's Press, which bought the rights to Savannah author
William C. Harris' novel ``Delirium of the Brave,'' has moved up
the publishing date for a new edition of the hardback from January
to this November.

 &HT;    Sweet 16 Emmy nominations for `Sopranos'
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among a voting group that prefers the tried and true over the up
and coming _ TV's first law: Imitation is the greatest form of
television _ HBO's groundbreaking season-old drama ``The Sopranos''
received 16 Emmy nominations on Thursday. It was more than any
other show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' which centers on the lives of a present-day
suburban mafia family and has become both a popular and critical
phenomenon, also was the first cable series ever nominated in the
dramatic series category.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows that grabbed a bundle of nominations: Fox's quirky
comedy ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's legal drama (and last year's drama
winner) ``The Practice'' and the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc'' all
picked up 13 bids apiece.
</P>
<P>
   HBO received a total of 74 nominations, second to NBC's 84.
Other network totals: ABC's 58, CBS' 46 and Fox's 33.
</P>
<P>
   HBO also finished second to NBC last year in nomination totals,
and it was cable's increasing presence at the Emmys that led to the
scrapping of the Cable Ace Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based TNT's ``The Pirates of Silicon Valley'' grabbed
five nominations, including best TV movie, a category which
includes HBO's ``The Rat Pack'' and ``A Lesson Before Dying,''
A&AMP;E's ``Dash and Lilly'' and Showtime's ``The Baby Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The major awards were announced live from Los Angeles on NBC's
``Today'' show early Thursday morning. They provided a brief
respite from that network's nonstop coverage of John Kennedy Jr.'s
burial at sea, with presenters Camryn Manheim and David Hyde
Pierce, both winners last year, occasionally hamming it up with
each nomination.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Manheim, nominated as this year's best dramatic
supporting actress in ``The Practice'' and champion of fat women
everywhere, lifted the itty bitty Pierce clear off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominating highlights:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The biggest story in comedy was ``Everybody Loves Raymond,''
which many felt was unfairly shut out last year. In its third year
it finally got nominations in major categories: best comedy, best
actor (Ray Romano), best actress (Patricia Heaton, even though she
was pregnant for much of last season and was barely seen in a
number of episodes) and supporting nods to Peter Boyle and Doris
Roberts, who play Romano's infuriatingly intrusive parents on the
CBS sitcom. It was the first nomination for their work on the show
for all four.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ABC's ``Sports Night,'' a huge hit with critics but still
struggling for major viewer support, was surprisingly light on
nods, getting only three. They were for writing, directing and
multicamera editing _ all strengths of the show _ but Felicity
Huffman, who plays the show's neurotic producer, should have been
found in either the Best Actress or Supporting Actress categories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The growing WB network also got very little respect from Emmy
voters, who tend to be more conservative, like Academy Awards
voters, and may not have heard yet about the youthquake the WB's
shows have set off. ``Felicity'' star Keri Russell, for example,
won the Golden Globe earlier as Best Drama Actress but wasn't even
in the top five for Emmy. ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' a much
better drama than its title indicates, got two minor nominations,
one for makeup, but nothing for star Sarah Michelle Gellar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Actors playing the four most prominent characters on ``The
Sopranos'' all received nominations: James Gandolfini for lead
dramatic actor as mobster Tony Soprano; Edie Falco, as Tony's wife,
and Lorraine Bracco, who plays his therapist, for lead dramatic
actresses; and Nancy Marchand, who plays Tony's frighteningly
guilt-disposing mother, for supporting dramatic actress.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Three actresses from ``The Practice'' dominate the supporting
dramatic actress category: Manheim, Lara Flynn Boyle and Holland
Taylor. The only non-``Practice'' actresses: Marchand, and Kim
Delaney of ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Two actors from the ``The Practice'' were also nominated in
supporting roles: Michael Badalucco and Steve Harris. Dylan
McDermot was nominated from the same show as lead actor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lucy Liu's ``Ally McBeal'' portrayal as Ling, the TV season's
most memorable newcomer, was rewarded with a nomination for
supporting comedic actress. She joins last year's winner, Lisa
Kudrow of ``Friends,'' as well as Kirsten Johnston of ``3rd Rock
From The Sun,'' Wendie Malick of ``Just Shoot Me'' and Doris
Roberts of ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Beyond ``The Sopranos,'' Emmy voters retreated into the
comfort of familiarity in the drama category, where they nominated
four other series _ ``ER,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and
``Law &AMP; Order'' _ that have dominated the category for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar faces: ``Frasier,'' which last year set a
record with its fifth win the comedy category, also saw last year's
winners nominated again: Pierce, in a supporting role, and Kelsey
Grammer for lead in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 12 Emmy telecast (8-11 p.m. on Fox) has no host named
yet, and may not have one again this year. Executive producer Don
Mischer said Thursday at the biannual Television Critics
Association meetings that he liked the host-less Emmys last year
because he was able to cram more star presenters in. Mischer said
there will be a one-hour pre-Emmy show from 7-8 p.m. concentrating
on the red-carpet scene outside the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy theme this year will be the future of TV, including the
coming convergence of TV and computers; the show is negotiating
interactive elements with excite.com. There won't be all the
retrospectives awards shows usually favor. ``If I have to see Alan
Alda lift off in that helicopter again or Mary Tyler Moore close
down that newsroom, they're great, but we've pretty much done
that,'' Mischer said.

 &HT;    Has anyone seen dad? Not in `The Wood'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a movie called ``The Wood'' opened in theaters last week,
audiences and critics were charmed by this sweet, coming-of-age
story about three African-American males. The characters have no
guns, no criminal records and no drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   But they're missing something else that hardly anyone seemed to
notice: fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if they were out of town on business, or deadbeat
dads, or maybe just dead. Fact is, their absence isn't mentioned in
the movie at all. They are simply persona non daddy.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with actor Taye Diggs, who plays Roland, the nervous
bridegroom who goes AWOL on his wedding day. The movie centers on
Roland's remembrances of growing up with his two buddies, who are
now trying to drag him to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs spoke glowingly about the influences of his own mother and
father and how they pushed him to do his best. But the actor said
it never occurred to him that Roland or the other two leads had no
fathers onscreen, or any reasonable facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Rick Famuyiwa, on whose life ``The Wood'' is
partly based, was raised in a single-mother household, which might
provide a glib rationale for why his character's fathers are
missing in action. But he insisted that his upbringing had nothing
to do with his cinematic choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing the movie I don't think I ever said I was
going to exclude fathers from it,'' Famuyiwa said. ``But as a
writer, you can't answer every question. You'd like to get in those
details, but we only had two hours to tell the story and I wanted
to focus on the friendship between these three young men.''
</P>
<P>
   I cringed when he said ``details.'' It's the same gut-spasm I
get watching a black athlete on television after a big play who
invariably mugs for the camera and yells ``Hi, Mom!'' _ never
acknowledging the other chromosome donor responsible for his
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of moms in ``The Wood,'' played by beautiful
black actresses whose presence conveys a sense of family stability
and enduring strength. And there is one dad in the picture: a
glowering father-of-the-bride caricature, who grabs Roland by the
scruff of the neck when he shows up late for the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should keep reminding myself that ``The Wood'' is just a
movie, a heartfelt but uneven effort by a promising, but unseasoned
director.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to shake the nagging implication that black
fathers are so out of sight and out of mind that it's not worth
even a few seconds of screen time to explain us into oblivion. It's
not Famuyiwa's fault that too many black children are being raised
by single mothers, who are fighting a battle with one parent tied
behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a black father, I can't help but wonder if Roland is so
terrified of marriage for a good reason. Maybe he didn't see enough
examples of the guts it takes to stick it out with your wife when
raising children.
</P>
<P>
   The movie reminded my wife and me of a sick joke we once laughed
about. It was several years ago, when a white woman named Susan
Smith drowned her two sons, then claimed they had been kidnapped by
a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had to be lying, the joke went: It's hard enough to get a
black man to take his own children, much less someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   While fatherhood is overlooked in ``The Wood,'' I'm lucky that
hasn't been the case in my own life. My Pops never lets me forget
how much he loves me and how much he expects of me. I remind myself
about that with every byline, by including the ``V,'' which is the
first letter of his name and of the middle name my son and I have
inherited from him.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe when my son's son grows up _ with a ``V'' in his name,
too, I hope _ he'll sit in a theater with his dad, watching a movie
about a generation of black fathers who are so good at what they do
that nobody would ever dare write them out of the script.

 &HT;    Big Winnipeg `small town at heart'
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Canada _ As you cross the plains of Manitoba on your
way to Winnipeg, you are treated to an inspiring sight. For as far
as you can see, there are vast swaying fields of near-golden wheat,
oats and barley, oceans of blue flax, and brilliant expanses of
yellow canola and sunflowers, with heads bigger than dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   You feel as if you're in a farmland fairy tale _ and then you
hear about Nicolas Ulrich Vogel, the alleged Tractor Terminator.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old farmer from nearby La Broquerie appeared in
provincial court in Winnipeg a couple of days ago, charged with
mischief endangering life and dangerous driving. Last Sunday, a
family that included three kids was picnicing when a man on a
tractor tried to run over them. Later, the same guy rammed the
family's car. A day earlier, the attack tractor forced a car off a
rural road and into a ditch. Before that two people on horseback
where chased.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain it?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the guy needs to get into town a little more.
</P>
<P>
   And Winnipeg would let him feel at home, while, at the same
time, let him see a whole new world. They call this place the oasis
in the prairie, the Chicago of Canada. Manitoba's multicultural
capital of 650,000 has large populations of First Nations (Indian)
people, Inuit (formerly Eskimos), French Canadians, Ukrainians,
Chinese and Icelanders.
</P>
<P>
   It also has corn-flavored ice cream, a much-heralded new art
exhibit entitled ``Women in Agriculture,'' and atop the green dome
of the magnificent Manitoba legislative building _ some 240 feet
from the ground _ you find Golden Boy. The gilded 14-foot lad
clutches a sheaf of wheat under his left arm and in his upraised
right hand he holds an eternally-lit torch.
</P>
<P>
   He looks to be in full stride. They say that's the way he was
sculpted in 1914, not a current attempt to join the spectacle
taking place down below.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today and running through Aug. 8, Winnipeg is hosting
the 1999 Pan American Games. With 5,000 competing athletes, 2,000
support staff and 2,300 media representatives, the Games are the
third largest athletic competition ever held in North America.
Eclipsed only by the Summer Olympics of Los Angeles and Atlanta,
the Winnipeg gathering is bigger than the Olympic Games of
Montreal, Calgary and Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is sending 773 athletes to compete against 41
other Western Hemisphere nations ... and some of North America's
most persistent mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   Winnipeg is known for the pests, and thanks to heavy rainfall
the past few months, the city has been in full-itch alert. That's
prompted Winnipeg's 12-man insect control crew to launch its second
citywide fogging of the summer, the first time that's happened in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment I arrived here, it appeared Winnipeg was ready
for the world. At the airport, you are met by a Customs guard and
his hyper-active drug dog, who takes a quick whiff of you, then
does repeated sniff-and-sprint laps around the baggage carousel.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that mosquito fog fouled up one German Shepherd's
snoot earlier this week. His frenzied pawing of a Venezuelan
athlete's bag caused the visitor to spend his first night in town
at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police headquarters. Fifteen hours
later, he was released. No drugs were found.
</P>
<P>
   From that, one thing is sure. The mix-up made for heartfelt mea
culpas. That's the nature of this shy, unassuming city. It's safe,
it's clean and, most of all, the place is rich in common courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winnipeg passes itself off as a big city, but it's small town
at heart,'' said Greg Steele, a Manitoba gun dealer taking part in
historical re-enactments at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   At the CanWest Global Park _ the new downtown ballpark that
hosts the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the AA Northern League _ I stopped
by a hamburger stand in the last inning of a game the other night
and, though the people already were packing up, the counter girl
cheerfully said, ``We'll open back up and cook you a burger.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the ball park, it has the hottest ticket of these
Games. The Pan Am baseball competition will feature the Cuban
national team, this one even better than the bunch who trounced the
Baltimore Orioles two months ago. At least now it's better, but who
knows what tomorrow brings?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the first Cuban athlete _ Abel Juncosa Reyes, a member
of the pistol and rifle team _ defected. That comes on the heels of
four of the country's top basketball players and a team masseur
defecting last Saturday night during the Olympic Games qualifying
tournament in San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, dozens of top athletes _ most notably
baseball players, many who are now in the Major Leagues _ have fled
Cuba. That explains the posse of sports agents and big league
scouts trailing this team.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. baseball team is made up of minor league players _
including three from the Cincinnati Reds _ and is coached by Buddy
Bell, the long-time Major Leaguer who is now the minor league's
field coordinator of the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   As for CanWest, while I sat there the other night I felt I had a
taste of what Dayton, Ohio's, new downtown ballpark will be like.
Home plate faces toward the river, the city's biggest buildings
rise up behind the grandstands and everywhere _ from the mascot and
comic vendors to the between-innings giveaways and nonstop music _
there is entertainment. The thing I noticed most in the sold-out
park were people of all ages _ little kids with gloves, fawning
preteen girls with painted nails, oh-so-cool grunge boys, young
couples, senior citizens _ all having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago _ when the National Hockey League Jets were here
before their jump to Phoenix _ NHL players voted Winnipeg their
least favorite city. As the L.A. Kings' Charlie Simmer put it:
``The best thing about Winnipeg is the airport. It lets you
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted in the winter, this seems like one of the coldest cities
on Earth, but then again, what do those gap-toothed hockey players
know?
</P>
<P>
   Boasting some 170 ethno-cultural groups, Winnipeg has plenty of
diverse, quality restaurants, its own ballet company, symphony,
opera, a major theater and several top flight museums. It has a
French Quarter, Chinatown, a historic warehouse area called the
Exchange District that hosts a thriving music scene, and The Forks,
a gala communal gathering spot at the junction of the Red and
Assiniboine rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Am Games also bring a music fest, highlighted by daily
concerts featuring everybody from the Neville Brothers, Jimmy
Cliff, Francophone rappers Dubmatique, pop singer Chantal
Kreviazuk, jazz saxophonist Jane Bunnett, the Southern fried rock
'n' roll band Nashville Pussy and the city's own aging rockers,
Guess Who.
</P>
<P>
   Sportswise, there promises to be plenty of interesting stories _
from U.S. teen tennis star Alexandra Stevenson, who shocked
Wimbledon when she made the semifinals and it was revealed Julius
Erving was her dad, to Dennis Martinez, the former Cleveland
Indians star, who now coaches and pitches for Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Winnipeg has dubbed the next 17 days ``Partyin' on the
Prairie.'' For some, the partying started early. A container of
equipment was stolen from the Argentine rowing team over the
weekend. Two teens were eventually nabbed. They said they mistook
the container for a cooler of beer.

 &HT;    Meshell Ndegeocello, swimming against the mainstream
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Meshell Ndegeocello isn't bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The calm, cool and quite talkative 30-year-old picks up the
phone at her Los Angeles hotel room ready to converse about her
second stint on the last Lilith Fair tour, the third album she's
releasing Aug. 24 and how she's hoping its title, ``Bitter,''
doesn't convey anything other than optimism about her musical
future.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that in this critical video age, neither MTV, BET or
VH1 have put her and her similar videos in heavy rotation.
Commercial radio airplay is hardly assured, since she concedes,
playfully: ``I might have upset a few programmers with the
`Leviticus: Faggot' single.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the all-important sales category _ ah, hem, next subject.
</P>
<P>
   But to put the old saying a new way: It's been better for
Ndegeocello to have released her 1993 multi-Grammy-nominated debut,
``Plantation Lullabies,'' and its 1996 follow-up ``Peace Beyond
Passion'' _ and have them flop on the charts _ than to have never
put out the critically touted ``expressions of where I was'' at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds simple, but I'm just happy to be here,'' says the
singer-songwriter-musician, who's been out of the public eye for
three years. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Q: If things are well with you now, explain why you called your
new album ``Bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   A: The title comes from (my) being able to appreciate sorrow and
pain in order to enjoy the good things happening now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You take really long breaks between records. Any particular
reason?
</P>
<P>
   A: I enjoy the time away. I don't understand those artists who
put out albums every year. I like to have experiences to write
about. And it's great to be on a small label (Madonna's Maverick)
that gives me that kind of time. Though I'm sure they wish that
after giving me all that time that I would be much more commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But the label hasn't dropped you.
</P>
<P>
   A: We don't know that yet. But I can't create and be true to
myself worrying
</P>
<P>
   about ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wait. Are you saying there's a possibility, though you're
close to releasing this record, that the label may drop you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, that's a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And with that in mind ...
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm optimistic. As a musician, I have to believe everyone can
hear my music. So I don't wake up and worry about why I'm not a
mainstream success. I have no idea. I know it's hard to get my
stuff on MTV because I'm not going to make some $1 million movie to
give to them. I pay for that! And I'm really not going to do that.
I think it has been a detriment to music that it has become more
visual.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And yet, people coming out to see you perform live has helped
you develop a considerable following?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, word of mouth has been a great thing for me. But when
they see me live, it's the music that's up front. No fireworks. No
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does performing in Atlanta differ _ if at all _ from
other cities?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's just a connection. Maybe it's because I'm a
Southerner (born in Berlin, but raised in Washington, D.C.). And
Southerners appreciate people who speak their mind. I love being
there, love seeing people of color and love that heat on one of
your various Peachtree streets (in Atlanta)!

 By STUART ELLIOTT  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boom in the new media of the Internet is supposed
to portend the beginning of the end for traditional media along
with a similar fate for the traditional advertising agency. But
don't waste time trying to tell those purported dinosaurs about
their impending doom: They're too busy counting the money pouring
in from, of all places, the very companies that are supposedly
going to put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The rush among Internet companies to promote their brands to
computer users is turning into a gold rush for television, radio,
newspapers, magazines and outdoor advertising, not to mention the
mainstay Madison Avenue agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is strong and advertising is good anyway,'' said
Stephen B. Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week magazine in
New York, published by McGraw-Hill Cos. ``But because of technology
and e-commerce, we're blowing the doors off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our summer issues are like April or October fat,'' he added.
``There are tons of ads from companies you didn't know a few months
ago _ and in some cases, you hadn't heard of till you see the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   How robust is the growth for the traditional media from the
online media? While spending among all advertisers in traditional
media in the first quarter of 1999 rose 4.6 percent from figures in
the period a year earlier _ according to Competitive Media
Reporting, a research unit of VNU NV _ the largest gain by far came
in the category of new media: up 183.1 percent, to $284.2 million
from $100.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like when the medium of TV got turned on, and ad
budgets escalated geometrically,'' said Jonathan Bond, co-chairman
at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners, an agency that works for cyberspace
clients like the DLJ Direct online brokerage firm and Theglobe.com
at its New York and San Francisco offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race,'' Bond said. ``The first one to become a brand
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   To become a brand, a product must gain awareness among
consumers. But the new media still lag behind the traditional media
in how many consumers they reach; for instance, about 37 million
households have Internet access while about 100 million have TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially for businesses that are trying to target people who
are on the fence about going on line, the traditional media are
obviously THE best place to reach an audience not quite there
yet,'' said Patrick Keane, director for online advertising
strategies at the consulting company Jupiter Communications in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to the hefty sums spent by the new media in the
new media to advertise themselves, they must also turn to the old
media, at least for the moment, to reach mass audiences to
advertise their wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a feeding frenzy,'' said O. Burtch Drake,
president and chief executive of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies, the industry trade association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that all the `dot coms' are using off-line media
to attract people to their sites,'' he added. ``But you cannot do
on the Net what you can do in a 30-second television commercial or
a strong newspaper ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, newspapers are scrambling to keep up with the additional
demand for ad space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one word I would use is explosive,'' said Jyll Holzman,
senior vice president for advertising at The New York Times. ``It's
triple-digit growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An account that wanted to spend $2 million in eight weeks came
in yesterday,'' she added, ``and it was 35 minutes from `We're
interested' to `We'll commit.' That does not happen every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times plans to run a special news section about e-commerce
on Sept. 22, Ms. Holzman said, and ``it could have the most
advertising of any special section ever to appear in our pages.''
</P>
<P>
   The sibling print medium of magazines is reporting similar
strength. For the first six months of 1999, new- media companies
spent $111.5 million to advertise in magazines. That was 154
percent above the $44 million spent in the period a year earlier _
and almost as much as the $117 million spent during all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports of our demise are premature,'' said Chris Miller,
executive vice president for marketing at the Magazine Publishers
of America, the trade association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to kill anybody,'' she added. ``The media are
all being married to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most prosaic media are benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit on the beach as I did last weekend,'' said F. Stone
Roberts, co-chairman and chief executive at Gotham Inc. in New
York, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies that
handles cyberclients like America Online and WebMD, ``half the
banners you see planes towing are for `dot com' businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a little something different in mind when they used
to talk about `banner ads,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of outdoor advertising, billboards, is also
thriving, particularly in what Tom Bedecarre, chairman at Citron
Haligman Bedecarre/Euro RSCG in San Francisco, part of the Euro
RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, described as ``the top
wired markets.'' Those are cities like Boston, Denver and San
Francisco in addition to the giants like Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billboards along Highway 101 near the San Francisco airport
and in Silicon Valley go for $15,000 to $25,000 a month,'' said
Neil Cohen, senior vice president for business affairs at
Adauction.com in San Francisco. Last week, his company auctioned
several sites for an average of 35 percent more than the already
high prevailing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started in remnant, distressed media,'' Cohen said. ``But
an auction also works when something is scarce, in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The demand in traditional media is keeping traditional agencies
busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must get five calls a day saying, `We've got $2 million to
spend and we like your Etrade advertising,''' said Rich
Silverstein, co-chairman and creative director at Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners in San Francisco. ``I can't even keep track
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason they seem to need us is that we have to give them a
brand, a soul,'' said Silverstein, whose agency, a unit of Omnicom
Group, recently landed big ``dot com'' accounts like Etrade, the
online brokerage firm, and Ebay, the auction Web site. ``There
isn't a lot of soul on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is a hotbed of account activity because of its
proximity to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from no `dot com' accounts to five in the last six
months,'' said Bedecarre, referring to new clients like Cnet and
Women.com. ``And it will be six tomorrow; we were just hired by
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We love working with these clients,'' he added, ``because
there's a greater conviction in the online world that advertising
works than in the off-line world.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is fueled by cash raised in initial public
offerings and from venture capitalists, who encourage ad spending
to build businesses and market valuations by building brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, ad spending was funded by profits,'' Bond
said, ``and no profits meant no ad spending. But now there's a
paradigm shift. It's OK to spend money on advertising without
profits; your financial strategy and your marketing strategy are
intertwined.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Madison Avenue is less than exuberant about all the new
new-media work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time you have to be very careful,'' Silverstein
said. ``Not all these companies are going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me where is Tucker, Hudson, Studebaker?'' he asked,
referring to defunct car brands. ``It all sorted out to the Big
Three.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all risky,'' Bond said. ``I'm not bragging about our
Internet assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you,'' he added. ``I've got to find some
boring old bricks-and-mortar clients.''

FRANCE'S VIVENDI TO BUY BIG STAKES IN CANAL PLUS AND B SKY B 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vivendi SA, the French utilities giant, made a double
lightning strike on Europe's rough-and-tumble pay-television
industry Thursday, agreeing to pay around $2.7 billion in cash and
stock to increase its holdings in the Continent's two biggest
pay-TV stations _ Canal Plus SA of France and B Sky B of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise move heightened speculation that Vivendi, the
world's largest water company and a growing force in European
information industries, was out to push the two companies into a
merger. Such an idea would be likely to face opposition from Rupert
Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp., which owns 40 percent of B Sky
B.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see Rupert liking that,'' David Adair, a media analyst
at HSBC Securities, said. Merger talks between B Sky B and Canal
Plus collapsed last March over Murdoch's reluctance to relinquish
management control. Only this month, he restated his opposition to
a merger.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually simultaneous deals, Vivendi raised its stake in B
Sky B to 24.5 percent from 17 percent while increasing its holding
in Canal Plus to 49 percent from 34 percent. If the two pay-TV
companies merged, Adair said, Vivendi would hold 30 percent of the
combined entity, leaving Murdoch with 25 percent. Referring to
Vivendi, Adair said, ``They do want a merger here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi's maneuver lifted the stocks of Canal Plus, which rose
6.4 percent, to 68.60 euros ($72.03), and B Sky B, which jumped
nearly 10 percent, to 603.5 pence ($9.47). Vivendi increased 2.61
percent, to 78.70 euros ($82.64).
</P>
<P>
   The French company acquired shares of B Sky B last month when it
bought Pathe SA, which held 17 percent of the British satellite
company.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of multichannel, high-definition digital
television is likely to reshape Europe's entire television
industry. In Britain, B Sky B has plunged into a price-slashing war
with a terrestrial rival, Ondigital, in a fight for dominance.
Cable operators, too, are planning to introduce digital channels.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi said Thursday that it had increased its holding by
purchasing indirect stakes in B Sky B held by two British media
groups, Pearson PLC and Granada Group PLC. Vivendi paid 600 pence a
share ($9.42), a 9 percent premium to B Sky B's closing price
Wednesday. Pearson shares moved up 1.4 percent, to 1,247 pence
($19.58), while Granada shares gained 5.8 percent, to 659.5 pence
($10.34).
</P>
<P>
   Both Pearson and Granada had indicated earlier that they wanted
to sell their roughly 4 percent stakes in B Sky B and each will get
more than $620 million from the sale. Both companies said they
planned to use the proceeds to reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with the two British groups is conditional on
regulatory clearance of the Vivendi merger with Pathe.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal with Cie. Financiere Richemont AG, the Swiss
luxury goods group that includes Cartier jewelry and Piaget
watches, Vivendi bought Richemont's 15 percent stake in Canal Plus
for $1.4 billion in stock. The deal valued Canal Plus shares at 73
euros ($76.65) each.
</P>
<P>
   Richemont, which recently sold its Rothmans cigarette brand, is
seeking to focus on its luxury goods business. Johann Rupert, its
chief executive, said the deal with Vivendi ``will permit us in due
course to redeploy the proceeds in the further development of our
core luxury goods business.'' Under Thursday's deal, Richemont
agreed to hold its newly acquired Vivendi stock for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi apparently is calculating that after the start-up costs
of digital television, the new broadcasting technology will become
a cash machine across Europe. In a statement, Vivendi said the
shift to digital television would significantly increase
shareholder value when the two pay-TV companies reach the
break-even point after the costs of introducing digital television.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, those costs are proving expensive because of the
rivalry between B Sky B and Ondigital. Initially, both companies
offered digital services on the condition that subscribers pay $300
for set-top receivers. But when B Sky B decided to give away the
set-top receivers, Ondigital was forced to follow suit, ratcheting
up both companies' costs.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi said it planned to reduce its stake in Canal Plus to 40
percent within a few months to make way for an unidentified
``international strategic partner,'' but gave no indication of its
identity. Vivendi said it would finance its recent acquisitions by
issuing 47 million new shares _ almost twice the increase foreseen
in the deal with Pathe.

JFK JR. HAD TWO WHITE HOUSE VISITS BEFORE ONE WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton was mistaken when he said John F.
Kennedy Jr. had not visited the White House after the assassination
of President Kennedy until Clinton invited him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a news conference Wednesday, said he had helped the
younger Kennedy ``come to terms'' with the death of his father by
taking him on a tour of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy had actually not been back to the White House
since his father was killed until I became president,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the young Kennedy had visited the White House earlier,
during the terms of both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his mother had a private dinner at the White House
at the invitation of Pat Nixon on Feb. 3, 1971. The next day,
Kennedy, who was then 10 years old, wrote a three-page thank-you
note to the Nixons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never thank you more for showing us the White House,''
Kennedy wrote, in a letter posted Thursday on the Web site of the
Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation
(http://www.nixonfoundation.org). ``I really liked everything about
it. You were so nice to show us everything. I don't think I could
remember much about the White House but it was really nice seeing
it all again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy continued: ``When I sat on Lincoln's bed and wished for
something, my wish really came true. I wished that I would have
good luck at school.'' Kennedy also said he ``loved the dogs,''
``really liked the old pistols,'' and the food ``was the best I
have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also wrote to the
Nixons, saying, ``A day I have always dreaded turned out to be one
of the most precious I have spent with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also visited the White House in 1981 when Reagan had a
ceremony honoring Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Jake Siewert said Thursday
that Clinton made his comment based on what Kennedy had told him
during his March 5, 1998, visit to the White House. ``The president
was recounting a private conversation he and Mrs. Clinton had with
John,'' Siewert said.

BUDGET OFFICE SAYS CLINTON UNDERESTIMATED COST OF DRUG COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: An expanded version of this story is tentatively scheduled
to move by 9 p.m. ET) 
(DW) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that
President Clinton had grossly underestimated the cost of his
proposal for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan L. Crippen, director of the budget office, also told
Congress that Clinton had overstated the savings that could be
achieved by his proposals to redesign Medicare and encourage
competition in the traditional fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton unveiled his drug proposal on June 29, he said it
would cost $118 billion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget
Office says now that the cost would be $168 billion. The budget
office number is higher by $50 billion, or 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate has many political ramifications. It will give
Republicans a reason to support a much more limited Medicare drug
benefit, as Congress is normally obliged to use the cost estimates
from its own budget office.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Michigan on Thursday, Clinton defended his proposal
to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries. He said that 75 percent of elderly Americans
``either have no drug coverage at all, or coverage that is
unstable, unaffordable and rapidly disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress wrestled with the details of Clinton's proposal
Thursday for the first time, as Donna Shalala, the secretary of
Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and a few Democrats told her they had grave doubts
about the president's proposal. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the
proposal ``will cause an explosion in the cost of the Medicare
program,'' and he suggested that it would make more sense to
provide drug benefits at first to low-income Medicare beneficiaries
with no other drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While criticizing Clinton's proposal, Republicans expressed
sympathy for elderly people struggling with high drug costs _ a
potentially influential group of voters in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., said he intended to ``move ahead very promptly in
September'' with legislation to provide some Medicare drug
benefits. But Roth made clear that his proposal would be less
comprehensive and less costly than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had said he could save $25 billion over 10 years by
making Medicare more competitive and efficient _ for example, by
steering patients to doctors and hospitals that promise to give the
government deep discounts. The Congressional Budget Office said
these changes would save only $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also boasted that his plan would increase competition
among health maintenance organizations that serve 16 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries. But Roth said it was not ``genuine
competition'' because Medicare's fee-for-service program would not
compete directly with the HMOs on prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office said its estimate of the costs
of prescription drug benefits was higher than the president's for
four reasons. First, the budget office assumes faster growth in
drug spending for the elderly. Second, Crippen said, his office
took account of drug spending for nursing home residents, which the
administration had apparently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Crippen said, if Medicare starts to cover prescription
drugs, many low-income people will apply for federal assistance in
paying the premiums and other costs normally borne by
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Crippen said, the president wants to hire private
companies to manage drug benefits for the elderly, but he would
restrict their activities so they could not save as much money for
Medicare as they now save for private employers and HMOs.

`SOPRANOS' MAKE A HIT WITH EMMY NODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Agents Mulder and Scully proved no match for
Tony Soprano Thursday as ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's flavorful slice of
mob lowlife, emerged as the first cable series ever nominated for a
best-drama Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   While earning more Emmy nominations than any other show _ 16 _
and highlighting the ascendancy of cable programming in a realm
once dominated by the broadcast networks, ``The Sopranos'' also
rubbed out its Sunday-night competition, Fox's ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, the paean to paranoia was not
nominated in the best-drama category, a development that
disappointed but did not surprise ``X-Files'' creator Chris Carter,
who clearly anticipated the ``Sopranos'' juggernaut. ``I thought
this would be the year there wouldn't be room for us, and I was
right,'' Carter said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy once again had room, however, for a pair of lawyer shows
set in Boston and produced by one-man idea factory David E. Kelley:
ABC's ``The Practice'' was nominated as best drama (a category it
won last year), and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' was nominated as best
comedy. Both shows received 13 Emmy nominations overall (including
``Practice'' star Dylan McDermott's first nod in the best-actor
category), as did the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO, whose 74 Emmy nominations trailed only NBC's 82, was also
celebrating the nominations of ``Sex and the City'' as best comedy
and star Sarah Jessica Parker as best actress in a comedy. But this
was clearly the year of ``The Sopranos,'' a seriocomic gem that put
the venerable mob genre on the psychiatrist's couch and inside the
home of angst-ridden New Jersey underboss Tony Soprano.
</P>
<P>
   The hitherto-unknown James Gandolfini, who somehow made Tony
into an endearing Everythug, was nominated as best actor, while two
compelling costars, Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano) and Lorraine
Bracco (Dr. Jennifer Melfi), were nominated as best actress. In
addition, Nancy Marchand was nominated as best supporting actress
for her chilling performance as Tony's dangerously unhinged mother,
and John Heard was nominated in the best-guest-appearance category
for his role as a sleazy detective.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly for a show whose dialogue constantly arrested the ear
with its sheer originality, ``The Sopranos'' also dominated in the
drama-writing category, picking up four of the five nominations,
including one for a script by East Boston native Frank Renzulli.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, chairwoman of the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences, said in an interview Thursday that ``The Sopranos'' was
``a breakthrough show'' that ``got the attention of the creative
community because it was fresh and innovative.'' Nominations are
made by academy members, who include writers, performers,
directors, and other TV professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the replacement of ``The X-Files'' with ``The
Sopranos,'' the lineup of best-drama nominees was the same as last
year: NBC's ``ER'' and ``Law &AMP; Order,'' and ABC's ``NYPD Blue'' and
``The Practice.'' In addition to ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Sex &AMP; The
City,'' nominees for best comedy were CBS's ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and NBC's ``Frasier'' (last year's winner) and
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news for WGBH-Ch. 2, which has been buffeted
by two weeks of controversy over its swapping of donor lists with
the Democratic Party. The WBGH-produced ``Great Expectations,''
part of the ``Mobil Masterpiece Theatre'' franchise, was nominated
as best miniseries, and ``The American Experience,'' also produced
by WGBH, was nominated as best documentary series.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's home run in the Emmy nominations, combined with the total
of 60 nominations picked up by 18 other cable channels, is certain
to cause more gnashing of teeth at the broadcast networks. For
several years, broadcast executives have argued that cable networks
have an unfair advantage because they can concentrate their
resources on a few series and blockbuster movies per year, while
broadcast networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox must fill 22 hours
per week with programs. But HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer retorted
Thursday that that means the broadcast networks have more shots at
producing quality shows.
</P>
<P>
   Another sore point for networks is that ``The Sopranos'' is
laden with violence and profanity while ``Sex &AMP; the City'' features
plenty of the activity described in its title _ subjects for which
the broadcast networks are roundly criticized. Now the networks
will have to watch clips from those cable shows aired repeatedly on
Fox when the Emmy Awards are handed out on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Fox entertainment president Doug
Herzog noted pointedly that HBO is ``lauded and applauded'' for the
same subjects that earn condemnation for broadcast networks like
his. But Herzog also tipped his cap to HBO, saying: ``Look, they're
doing great quality stuff . . . `The Sopranos' is the hot show.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer said the cable channel is ``just ecstatic'' at
receiving 74 nominations, second most in the channel's history, and
at grabbing two of the five nominations for best movie with ``The
Rat Pack'' and ``A Lesson Before Dying.'' After previously earning
nominations in the comedy category for ``The Larry Sanders Show,''
HBO executives were pleased at ``breaking through'' to drama,
according to Schaffer.
</P>
<P>
   To John Leverence, awards director of the Academy of Television
Arts and Sciences, HBO's bounty of nominations Thursday underscored
its shift from an outlet for previously released movies to a
channel that emphasizes its original, regularly scheduled
programming. ``HBO seems to be taking on more of the shape and
paradigm of a traditional broadcast network like NBC,'' said
Leverence. ``There's been a big change, a kind of sea change.''

HOUSE WITHHOLDS FUNDS FOR F-22 FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also PENTAGON-JET) 
(sw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The F-22 fighter jet was defeated in battle in
Congress on Thursday night, as the House voted overwhelmingly for a
military spending bill that withholds $1.8 billion to buy the first
six of the 21st-century warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But the war is not over. The fight over the $70 billion F-22
program now moves to a House-Senate conference, which may not take
place until September.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Thursday night's 379-45 vote for the $266
billion military spending bill ``was the vote on the F-22,'' said
Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., and the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, who led the fight
to remove the funds for the planes from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill passed on Thursday night spends about half the
money available to Congress to finance federal agencies. It
provides a $15.5 billion increase over the appropriation for the
1999 fiscal year _ a huge rise in comparison to the cuts and
freezes being imposed on most domestic spending bills this year,
and $2.8 billion more than what the White House and the Pentagon
requested. It includes $90.2 billion for research, development and
purchase of new new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a number of measures intended to increase military
readiness, recruitment and retention. It would boost pay for 1.4
million active-duty military personnel by 4.8 percent and add
nearly $600 million for recruiting and retaining personnel and
improving the quality of their lives in service.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would spend the $1.8 billion intended to buy the
first six F-22s on pay hikes and bonuses for Air Force pilots, on
additional F-15 and F-16 jets, models already in the arsenal, and
on developing the Joint Strike Fighter, one of three new fighter
aircraft that the Pentagon wants to build.
</P>
<P>
   That decision underscores the House Appropriations
subcommittee's position that military priorities need to be
redirected from an intense focus on a few hugely expensive
high-tech programs to basic requirements like spare parts, training
and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming days, the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, the
giant military contractor that makes the F-22, will lobby Congress
heavily, as they have all week, to get the money back, using
classified briefings and reminding members of the jobs and money
that the plane creates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, the Air Force persuaded House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, who had opposed the money for the planes until that
moment, to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his position,'' said his spokesman, John Feehery.
``He met with the Air Force and he felt they made a compelling
case. He's willing to take another look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, the core supporters of the F-22 in the
House, knowing they were outnumbered, did not even put up a fight.
They had planned to offer an amendment restoring the funds, but did
not. Their debating was desultory. Some read prepared speeches that
lifted lofty language from Lockheed Martin's promotional materials
for the futuristic fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were more blunt. The F-22, said Rep. David Obey of
Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, is a ``billion-dollar cancer eating a hole in the Air
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the money for the first of the fighters;
key senators say they will fight for the program, and President
Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen say they want the money
restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my intention to try to persuade the Senate'' otherwise,
Lewis said. ``It will be a head-on collision, in some ways, and a
full-scale debate.''

PEPSI ACKNOWLEDGES ROLE IN PUTTING COCA-COLA UNDER INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Commission's raid this week on Coca-Cola offices in
four countries followed complaints from competitors, including
Pepsico, that had accused Coca-Cola of unfair business practices
designed to keep rival products off store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico acknowledged Thursday that it had informed European
Commission officials that it believed Coca-Cola was abusing its
dominant position in the European market. The acknowledgment
indicates the cola wars have moved to a fresh international arena.
</P>
<P>
   While Pepsi executives had said they would not exploit Coke's
problems that arose from a recall in Europe earlier this month,
they appeared less constrained over Coke's already-difficult
relationship with the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late last year, we expressed our concern about certain
Coca-Cola practices that we believe are unlawful, and this year we
filed a formal complaint with the commission,'' a Pepsi spokesman,
Richard Detwiler, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He would not elaborate on what those practices were. But the
European Union's competition commissioner, Karel van Miert, said in
a statement Thursday that the probe centered around whether Coke
had used its clout as the biggest-selling soft drink to dissuade
retailers from stocking rival products.
</P>
<P>
   Van Miert said European regulators suspected Coke used illegal
incentives in Denmark, Austria and Hungary. They include rebates
for meeting growth targets and offering a full range of Coke
products, and payments for exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there were ``indications that Coca-Cola is granting
very significant promotional rebates in the form of price
reductions or free products which are sold by participating buyers,
like supermarkets, during promotions.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola denied the allegations, saying, ``We
are confident that, at the conclusion of this process, the
Coca-Cola Company's business practices will be found to be within
all laws and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Van Miert publicly castigated Coca-Cola
executives over plans to acquire most of the overseas rights to
Cadbury Schweppes brands, accusing the soft-drink giant of
attempting to sidestep European Union antitrust rules. Coke
maintains that it and the European officials interpreted the EU
requirements differently.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from Van Miert's office swooped into Coke offices
in Austria, Hungary and Denmark early Monday and Tuesday, seizing
documents from company files. They also seized papers from company
offices in London.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with analysts in New York Thursday, Coke's chairman
and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester downplayed what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty routine thing,'' he said. ``It happens. It's not
the first time. It's been happening in other industries.'' He
added: ``I sort of expected it, that as this wave was going
through, someone in the EU would say, `oops, we forgot Coca-Cola.'
''

UNICEF SAYS $500 MILLION WILL WIPE OUT POLIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Unicef said Thursday that it needs $500 million
to achieve the goal set in 1988 of eradicating polio throughout the
world by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   If it can raise this money and complete its campaign to immunize
all the world's children under 5, Unicef said, polio will follow
small pox to become the second communicable disease to be
completely eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The last recorded case of small pox occurred in Somalia in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of consigning to history a disease that
has terrified communities and devastated countless lives,'' the
executive director of Unicef, Carol Bellamy, said at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that the goal is achievable, the secretary of health
and human services, Donna Shalala, said polio had already been
eradicated in the West, in eastern Asia and in the Pacific basin.
``One hundred and fifty countries are currently polio free,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of eradication by the end of next year is estimated at
$1.25 billion. Unicef has already raised $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of abolishing polio was set in 1988 by the World Health
Organization, another U.N. agency, which said earlier this month
that it was focusing on 10 countries: Angola, Congo, Sudan,
Somalia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the campaign, which is being managed by
Unicef, polio immunization has spread from 10 percent of the
world's children to more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the number of confirmed polio cases fell to 5,108,
from 35,251 a decade earlier. Unicef estimates that before its
campaign got under way, polio killed or crippled up to 500,000
people a year. Only 33 countries reported instances of polio in
1998, 14 fewer than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Unicef says, 450 million children were vaccinated,
134 million of them on a single day in India, which accounts for
about 70 percent of the confirmed polio cases.

TAYLOR DUMPS NIXON FOR FALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he takes his game past the security checkpoint and up to
the exclusive ``next level,'' Clippers power forward Maurice Taylor
has decided to elevate his contract-extension dickering to what he
anticipates will be a higher plateau.
</P>
<P>
   According to a league source, Taylor has dropped Norm Nixon as
his agent and replaced him with representation svengali David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach all parties involved were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, in the preparatory stages of his third NBA season, is
seeking a six-year contract extension worth a few expired
presidents beyond $70 million. Those numbers represent the
prevailing wage for the league's rising, go-to hotshots, a status
most of the NBA's big thinkers say Taylor deserves to be in.
Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling, typically, does not seem to be
as easily convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is handing the duties of persuasion to Falk.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new collective bargaining agreement, the
Clippers can sign him to the extension as early as Aug. 1, but an
agent change requires a two-week embargo on representation by the
new agent. The negotiating on Taylor's enthusiastically sought deal
also will be delayed while Falk whose client list includes Michael
Jordan and Alonzo Mourning is on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition to the Falk stable is Indiana Pacers swingman
Jalen Rose, now an ex-Nixon client who happens to be a close friend
of Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   (subhead) More agent talk
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom, selected by the Clippers with the fourth pick in
last month's draft, finally has chosen a new agent. He's Jeff
Schwartz, and the biggest name on his roster is tennis star Pete
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Odom's move to L.A. last week was delayed by finalizing this
management deal, and by being the subject of a two-team war to get
the Rhode Island ace's signature on a sneaker deal.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is rumored to be the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Now expected to arrive in L.A. late this week, Odom talked with
Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball
operations, every day last week. According to the confounded
sources of a Southern California radio talk show contributor, Odom
had been ``unreachable'' and already judged to be a draft-day
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they just have the wrong number,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   More agents? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was reported that Robert Fayne, the deal-maker for
free agent Lorenzen Wright, said his client would never play for
the Clippers again.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wright wants to put no less than $5 million per season
the number offered by the Clippers last March in his pocket, he may
have little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Of the teams with requisite cap room to sign Wright without a
sign-and-trade tango the Clippers, Raptors and Bulls only the Clips
seem interested in rewarding the backup center/forward's
double-single average (points and rebounds) with at least $5
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams are ``capped out,'' and would be required to trade a
player with an almost identical salary back to the Clippers. In
every sign-and-trade proposal Baylor has fielded thus far, the
player in question was not high on anyone's wish list.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Wright's agent works the phones, he would be advised
to keep the Clippers and their $5 million offer on speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws
</P>
<P>
   While Orlando free agent Penny Hardaway and the Lakers make
goo-goo eyes at each other, the Clippers will keep the candle
burning. But, according to a league source, their interest in the
temperamental shooting guard most likely will continue to be used
as fall-back, bargaining leverage by Hardaway's agents. ... The
Clippers will not renew the contracts of two popular employees
assistant coach Jim Brewer and trainer Ray Melchiorre
</P>
<P>
   . Brewer, who was chosen by Cleveland with the second pick in
the 1973 draft, has been with the team for five seasons. Melchiorre
just completed his third year with the Clippers, his 26th season in
the NBA.

BUSH PROPOSES FEDERAL FUNDING OF FAITH-BASED SOCIAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (Eds: Syntax in last sentence of 6th graf is CQ.) 
(With BUSH-TEXT. See also MCCAIN-BRADLEY.) 
(mk) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Thursday that
the federal government should ``rally the armies of compassion in
our communities'' by providing tax incentives and federal funds to
churches and neighborhood groups to help the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can spend money,'' the Republican presidential
hopeful said. ``But it cannot put hope in our hearts or a sense of
purpose in our lives. That is done in churches and synagogues and
mosques and charities that warm the cold of life.'' Repeatedly in
his speech and in a news conference that followed, Bush spoke of
the ``transforming power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at a Methodist church here, Bush gave the first
major policy speech of a presidential campaign that until Thursday
had been more notable for spectacular fund raising, and the slogan
``compassionate conservatism,'' than for any detailed discussion of
issues. On this potentially sensitive issue of the role of
religious institutions, Bush provided many of the specifics that
his critics, including President Clinton at a Wednesday news
conference, have chided him for neglecting.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed spending $8 billion in federal money, a sum he
described as 10 percent of the budget surplus not derived from
Social Security, ``to encourage an outpouring of giving in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance when my administration sees a responsibility
to help people,'' he said, ``we will look first to faith-based
institutions, to charities and to community groups that have shown
their ability to save and change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his proposal would violate the constitutional
separation of church and state, Bush said, ``I'm told by the legal
experts that my initiative will pass constitutional muster. We will
send money to fund services. But the money does not go fund the
religious programs within the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that should be asked about a federal program, he
said, was not who implemented it but ``Does it work?''
</P>
<P>
   A central part of Bush's plan would permit lower-income
taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions _ the great majority
of filers _ to deduct their charitable donations. He also proposed
bigger tax breaks for corporate giving, limiting the civil
liability of businesses that donate equipment or cars to charitable
groups, and allowing people to make charitable contributions with
money from Individual Retirement Accounts without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would seek changes in laws and federal regulations
so that individuals could direct some of their state taxes
``directly to private and religious institutions fighting
poverty.'' He said this could be accomplished by letting states use
excess federal welfare transition funds for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush proposed federal grants to ministries and
mentoring programs to help the 1.3 million children he said had
parents who were in prison. He said he wanted to try InnerChange, a
Texas prison program that ``teaches inmates to rely on faith to
transform their lives,'' in four federal prisons to test its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke at a meeting hosted by the Front Porch Alliance, an
Indianapolis city program that uses church and neighborhood
organizations to fight crime and poverty. Church choirs prepared
the audience for his address.
</P>
<P>
   In it he promised to ``change the laws and regulations that
hamper the cooperation of government and private institutions'' in
order to ``allow private and religious groups to compete to provide
services in every federal, state and local social program.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush insisted that while no religious organization would have to
change its nature to qualify for participation in federal programs,
his ``faith-based'' approach would not be sectarian. ``We will keep
a commitment to pluralism,'' he said, ``not discriminating for or
against Methodist or Mormons or Muslims, or good people with no
faith at all.'' And he said he would insure there were ``secular
alternatives'' to faith-based programs.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based organizations can and already do receive federal
grants for a variety of social welfare programs. Melissa Skolfield,
assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health
and Human Services, said that ``the welfare reform bill
specifically allows faith-based organizations to receive federal
funds to help move people from welfare to work.'' Moreover, she
added, ``we've used the bully pulpit'' to make the case for even
greater involvement by such groups.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional scholars generally agree that the government may
use churches, synagogues and mosques to help administer social
service programs as long as the programs do not promote religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ira Lupu of the George Washington University Law
School, an authority on the subject, said that the Supreme Court
has upheld the use of government funds by religious institutions as
part of a social service program as long as there is no
accompanying proseletyzing. ``You can't, for example, give food to
hungry people while transmitting a religious message,'' he said.
``As long as they are acting as social service agencies and not as
religious agencies, it's acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Supreme Court, in a case called Bowen vs. Kendrick,
upheld the Adolescent Family Life Act enacted by Congress to
promote chastity. The court ruled that the law did not violate the
Constitution's prohibition against mingling church and state even
though it required that some funds be funneled through religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the audience that his message was not directed only to
Washington bureaucrats but also to his own party:
</P>
<P>
   ``We must apply our conservative and free market ideas to the
job of helping real human beings because any ideology, no matter
how right in theory, is sterile and empty without that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the attitude that governments should only ``leave us
alone'' was a ``destructive mindset.'' Asked at his news conference
if by that comment he was repudiating the approach of a Republican
Congress first elected in 1994 with a great promise to reduce
federal programs and regulations, he declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``It is not enough to call for volunteerism,'' a
hallmark of his father's term as president. ``Without more support
and resources, both public and private, we are asking them to make
bricks without straw.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to work with institutions that shared a
belief ``in the transforming power of faith, a belief no one is
finally a failure or a victim, because everyone is the child of a
loving and merciful God _ a God who counts our tears and lifts our
heads.''

STATE OFFICIALS' SUVS HITTING VEHICLE BUDGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Sport utility vehicles -- expensive, gas-guzzling and
often padded with extras _ have become status symbols for state
officials these days, swelling the budget for government vehicles
and irking those who try to control car costs.
</P>
<P>
   With seemingly everyone from a press secretary to a Mass
Turnpike attorney motoring around in muscular Ford Expeditions,
Explorers, or Chevrolet Blazers, SUV envy has set in. It seems
nobody who is anybody wants to drive a car from the state's
standard fleet, made up of Dodge Neons and Ford Tauruses bought at
a volume discount.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinent secretaries and agency executives defend their SUVs --
costing between $21,000 and $35,000 -- as necessary for work. But
few of those commissioners, directors and secretaries can cite
recent on-duty treks off-road.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state's frugal chief budget writer, Secretary of
Administration and Finance Andrew Natsios, drives what most
high-ranking offificals shun: a $13,000 Dodge Neon, so stripped
down it does not have a tape deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're satisfied that the majority of these vehicles are
appropriate for the agencies, given their task,'' said Natsios
spokesman Joe Landolfi. ``I guess it does beg the question...to see
if the policy is not being stretched a little thin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, along with public
safety-related agencies, appears to have purchased the most SUVs,
despite complaints from environmental and consumer groups about the
vehicles' low gas mileage and danger to smaller cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets a bad example for the people of Massachusetts for
pollution and safety,'' said Dan Becker, director of the global
warming and energy program at the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The largest SUVs, such as Chevrolet Suburbans and Tahoes, emit
about 115 tons of carbon dioxide over a lifetime. Ford Tauruses
emit about 64 tons, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs are also twice as likely to kill other car drivers in a
collision. And because utility vehicles are known to tip over,
their occupants have the same likelihood of dying in a crash,
Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Environmental Secretary Robert Durand was ``strongly
advised by the Cellucci administration not to order a sport utility
vehicle'' after he took over his post early this year.
</P>
<P>
   But he did anyway, choosing a Chevrolet Blazer to add to the 172
SUVs already in the environmental affairs fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's expected to traverse the state, often to remote areas in
inclement weather,'' said Durand's spokesman Jim Hunt. ``Whether
it's the backwoods of the Berkshires or the beaches of Cape Cod.
It's the nature of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked the last time Durand was required to travel off-road, Hunt
told a Globe reporter he would get back to her with the
information, but never did.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt did say the environmental secretariat owns an electric car,
although it does not get out on the road much.
</P>
<P>
   David Balfour, commissioner of the Metropolitan District
Commission, navigates a two-door 1996 Chevrolet Tahoe that listed
at $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got it because he needed it for his job,'' said MDC
spokesman Sam Campbell. ``Bear in mind, the commissioner of the MDC
is operational in all types of weather and all types of conditions.
We're talking beach emergencies, road emergencies. It is an
exemplary vehicle for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Balfour uses the car for his own personal use, Campbell
said, ``He uses it to get to and from his house. I think he uses it
when he plays golf or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell later said he misspoke because Balfour has a foot
problem that precludes him from golfing regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For other officials, there are other explanations. Lt. Gov. Jane
Swift has a Tahoe, often with a child seat strapped in the back for
her infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She travels back and forth from the Berkshires almost every
weekend,'' said Swift spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer. ``And in the winter
it's pretty important to have that kind of a vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has contracts to lease Tauruses and Dodge Neons and
receives reduced rates on those cars as a result of the purchasing
agreement. For an official or agency to request anything else, they
need special permission, and must place a special order.
</P>
<P>
   But with Beacon Hill flush with cash these days, and Cellucci
and legislators preparing to approve another in over a dozen state
tax cuts, there has been little outcry over the increase in
expensive vehicle purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, which falls under
Environmental Affairs, has purchased 13 new SUVs, all of them 1999
Chevy Tahoes, among the largest of the sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The oversized Tahoes and Ford Expeditions have among the lowest
gas mileage of all SUVs at an everage 13 miles per gallon,
according to Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the Turnpike Authority, Chairman James Kerasiotis drives a
1999 Expedition, as does Patrick Moynihan, the Central Artery
Project Director. The authority's chief engineer, Joseph Gill,
drives a 1998 Expedition. Even the general counsel, James McGrail,
drives a 1996 Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a basic -- it's not an Eddie Bauer (edition) or
anything,'' said spokeswoman Jodi D'Urso Matthews, who also has a
1996 Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Expeditions have been added to the State Police and
Engineering &AMP; Maintenance Division since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MBTA General Manager Robert Prince also drives an Expedition,
worth about $32,000.
</P>
<P>
   Former East Boston state representative Gus Serra, ordered
himself a top-of-the-line Expedition when he landed a $119,000 job
as director of strategic planning for the Massachusetts Port
Authority this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Massport executive director Peter Blute thought the
vehicle was too extravagant and ordered it sent back. Serra does
not drive a state car now.
</P>
<P>
   Blute drives a 1999 Expedition that cost $31,787 and is equipped
with a Massport radio and police lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run an airport, a seaport and a bridge,'' said agency
spokesman Jeremy Crockford. ``We are expected to come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which generally has
an old fleet of cars and trucks, purchased 35 vehicles for the 1999
model year. Of them, 14 were four-door Chevy Blazers.

 &HT;    Bell says study backs long-distance bid
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. said Thursday
that a newly released and ``extremely gratifying'' study by an
outside consultant bolstered its campaign to enter the
long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell cannot enter the long-distance telephone
business until it satisfies the state Public Utility Commission and
the Federal Communications Commission that it can easily and
accurately transfer its customers for local service to competitors
who capture their business.
</P>
<P>
   Telcordia Technologies Inc., a consulting firm and corporate
descendant of the old Bell Laboratories, was picked by the PUC to
test how well Southwestern Bell is doing in linking its computer
systems to those of its new rivals for local phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The interim report delivered Thursday by Telcordia contained
about 1,000 pages of often-technical material and drew no simple or
clear-cut conclusions. Data is still being analyzed and collected,
and there is more testing to do, said a Telcordia official, Sarita
Khurana.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Wood, chairman of the PUC, said the study would give
Southwestern Bell ``a clearer road map'' on what it needs to do to
make its ``operations support system'' as effective as required.
</P>
<P>
   About the interim report, Wood said, ``It wasn't an A-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Maddox, a Southwestern Bell spokesman, said the interim
report was ``a welcomed compliment'' to the company's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   It showed, he said, that ``the vast majority of critical issues
are being tested successfully'' and has ``allowed Southwestern Bell
to fine-tune its systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T, hardly eager to welcome Southwestern Bell into the
ranks of long-distance competitors, has ``a real problem with the
process'' that Telcordia used in the study, said spokesman Kerry
Hibbs. The testing, Hibbs said, ``was too controlled and too
limited, not reflecting a real-life test.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests, he said, should have been ``blind,'' meaning that
Southwestern Bell did not know when the testing was taking place as
orders were processed.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he did not how long it would take for Southwestern
Bell to respond to concerns raised by the interim report.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC is taking up, on Aug. 5, other issues related to
Southwestern Bell's long-distance quest.
</P>
<P>
   The commission in April, however, said it would endorse the
company's bid for long-distance service if it fulfilled certain
conditions, including the tests conducted by Telcordia.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it expects to begin selling long-distance
service by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell cannot sell long-distance service now because
it and other Bell local phone companies were restricted to local
service when the old Bell System was broken up in 1984.

FEAR OF SIDS LEAVES BABIES FLAT ON THEIR HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of modern medicine's simplest and most effective preventions
against a fatal condition has a down side, or a flat side to be
more precise.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics first
recommended that parents have their babies sleep on their backs to
reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome, there have
been many fewer such crib deaths. But parents and pediatricians
have been noticing that babies have been developing flat spots on
their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Somsanith, 24, of Lee's Summit, Mo., took the ``back to
sleep'' advice to heart and even when nine-month-old June tried to
roll over, she put her back on her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her head looks like a box,'' Somsanith said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Somsanith took June to the pediatrician, who told
her that June's head was indeed flat because she slept in one
position all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Craniofacial specialists and neurosurgeons say that the problem
is no reason to go back to putting babies on their stomachs: They
simply want parents to be aware of something that can be avoided if
parents make a conscious effort to change the direction infants'
heads face when they are on their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Graham, director of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's
Craniofacial Clinic in Los Angeles, said the number of babies with
plagiocephaly, the term for assymetrical heads, has jumped
five-fold in the last five years, to one in every 60 babies.
</P>
<P>
   If caught early, at two months or so, varying the position the
baby sleeps in will help correct the problem, according to Dr. Carl
Heilman, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at New England Medical
Center's Floating Hospital in Boston. If a parent waits until a
baby is six to nine months old, the child may need to wear a
custom-made molding helmet for a few months. After a year, the
helmet has little effect, said Heilman.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatrician Dr. Maurice Edward Keenan, a pediatrician at
Massachusetts General Hospital and a member of the American Academy
of Pediatrics Task Force on Infant Positioning and SIDS, said that
assymetrical heads are a minor problem compared to the success of
lowering the risk for SIDS. In 1997, the number of SIDS deaths was
2,991, down from 4,891 in 1992, according to the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said parents do ask about the ``flat head'' issue all the
time, and he tells them that the head will shape back by itself,
after the babies are able to move in different positions by
themselves. ``Once a baby is six months old, he or she will turn
over on the tummy. At nine months, it's not really an issue,'' said
Keenan, who said the helmets ``make parents feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martina Hegarty of Boxford, Mass. put her son Owen in the
crib on his back, he always turned his face to the left. No matter
what she did, Owen favored his left side. When Owen was five months
old, Hegarty pointed out to her pediatrician that the back of his
head was flatter on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Hegarty's pediatrician sent her to Heilman, who recommended Owen
wear a molding helmet to correct his flat head. Owen wore it 23
hours a day for 10 weeks. On June 24, the helmet came off for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't want him grown up with a funny-shaped
head,'' Hegarty said.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1992, Heilman, who sees the worst cases, saw one or two a
year. Now he sees at least 30. John Mulliken, director of the
Craniofacial Centre at Children's Hospital here, sees about 10 new
cases a week, and 95 percent of them need a helmet to correct the
malformed head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't always improve back to completely normal on their
own,'' Heilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Babies' skulls are very soft and malleable in the first months
of life. At the same time, their necks are at their weakest, and
they are least able to turn their heads on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to roll a ball down the hill with a big flat
place; it's not going to respond appropriately,'' said Graham of
Cedars-Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are babies sleeping on their backs at night, they are
also on their backs in car seats and other carriers. ``Once they
start to get a flat spot, it's so easy for a child to lay on that
area,'' Heilman said.
</P>
<P>
   The misshapen head will not cause brain damage, said Mulliken,
but it can cause other long-term problems, such as a protruding
forehead, and misaligned eyes and ears. Nine-month old Brock Kelly
of Smithville, Mo., had offset ears, one cheek lower, and one eye
smaller than the other. ``I was scared that he would have to have
surgery,'' said Stacy Kelly, Brock's mother. The helmet that Brock
has worn since April and the doctor visits cost her $3,000, which
insurance covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are spending a lot of money on waste,'' said Mulliken,
because the problem is so preventable.
</P>
<P>
   For some babies, the deformity can become quite severe, and
resemble a rare condition, called craniosynostosis, in which the
baby's skull bones fuse together too soon, limiting the growth of
the brain. In Denver, there have been lawsuits against doctors who
performed unnecessary surgery because they thought a flattened head
was craniosynostosis, when it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Mulliken said he only saw two infants with craniosynostosis in
the last year, but sees about 10 a week that have flat heads from
sleeping in the same position.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are three times more likely to have a lopsided head, said
Mulliken, possibly because the heads of infant boys are bigger, and
grow more rapidly than girls'. Also, male fetuses are less flexible
than female fetuses, and thus have more deformational anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Stacy Kelly will take Brock back to the doctor. She
hopes he won't need the helmet any more. ``I miss his head,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Aviation Hall of Fame to get $1 million gift
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The National Aviation Hall of Fame is getting a
$1 million boost from longtime supporters Ervin and Zoe Dell Nutter
towards its goal of raising $5.2 million to support its new
Learning and Research Center, officials plan to announce tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is to be made at the hall of fame's annual
reception for enshrinees and members. Tonight will be the first
time this function has been held in the organization's new center
at the Air Force Museum. The enshrinement ceremony is to be held
Saturday evening in the downtown Dayton Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center is scheduled to open to the public Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is the first major contribution the hall of fame has
received towards its fund-raising goal of $3 million for an
operating endowment for the center, executive director Mike Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hall is also raising $2.2 million to fund the construction
of interactive exhibits in the center. The state of Ohio has
appropriated $1.1 million, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising co-chairman Wilkinson Wright, grandnephew of
airplane inventors and hall-of-fame enshrinees Orville and Wilbur
Wright, said tonight's announcement of the donation will mark the
start of a concentrated effort to raise the remaining money by Dec.
17, the 96th anniversary of the Wrights' first powered flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a number of years, we had one event, our annual
enshrinement, and we just occupied rented space,'' Wright said.
``Now, for the first time, we've got the space and we'll be able to
carry out our educational mission.''
</P>
<P>
   A museum, research center and educational activities were among
the things the U.S. Congress mandated when it made the hall of fame
the nation's first congressionally chartered aviation organization
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled between the two hangar-shaped galleries of the Air Force
Museum, the learning and research center encloses 17,250 square
feet of exhibit, research and office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful. We have our building. All we have to do now is
finish it up,'' Zoe Nutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers this week were putting up temporary exhibits that will
stand until permanent exhibits are funded and built. Jackson
estimated that will take about 18 months. The temporary exhibits
will then be used for traveling displays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nutter's gift for the operating endowment is important
because the new center will mean new expenses for the organization,
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operations and our responsibilities have increased, and we
have to support them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the Nutters' donation reflects their years of
support for the hall of fame since it was established in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nutters have been a backbone of this organization for
years, not only through their financial contributions, but also
through their work,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ervin Nutter, retired president of Elano Corp., was a charter
member and is a trustee emeritus, and Zoe Dell Nutter, also a
trustee, was the first woman to hold the positions of president and
chairwoman, Jackson said.

CHURCH DOESN'T ENCOURAGE CREMATION, SCATTERING OF ASHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cremated remains of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her
sister were cast from a warship to the ocean currents in a manner
not favored by the Catholic Church and in a ceremony that occurred
only after the intercession of top Pentagon brass.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church prefers the presence of a body at its
funeral rites. And the Defense Department rarely accords the honor
of burial at sea to civilians. But it acceded to the wishes of the
son of the nation's 35th president, who gained in death the privacy
he rarely achieved in life.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren
Bessette were returned to the ocean not far from where Kennedy's
plane crashed last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church does not encourage the scattering of cremated
remains,'' said the Reverend James A. Wiseman, an associate
theology professor at Catholic University. ``The normal thing is to
place the ashes somewhere where they can be regularly honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said that while many Catholics believe that
cremation is unacceptable because they feel it violates the belief
in the resurrection of the body, the practice has been allowed
since 1963 when church law was revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cremation today in the Catholic Church is not forbidden; it is
tolerated and it is becoming increasingly more common,'' said
Lawrence Cunningham, a theology professor at the University of
Notre Dame. ``The identification of cremation with unbelief has
passed from the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Christian belief held that cremation was the practice of
pagans, an implied way of expressing contempt for the notion of the
Resurrection, a central tenet of the Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was John Kennedy Jr.'s expressed wishes and the church
wants to honor the wishes of the dead unless they're contrary to
ethics and good taste,'' said Thomas Groome, professor at Boston
College's Institute of Religion, Education and Pastoral Ministry.
``The ocean has always been a striking metaphor for the presence of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The US National Conference of Catholic Bishops guidelines for
cremation says the ashes ``should be treated with same respect
given to the human body from which they come.'' The guidelines do
not allow for the scattering of ashes, calling instead for ``the
use of a worthy vessel to contain the ashes,'' which should be
buried or entombed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the ashes were dealt with during Thursday's
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   If the cremation was unusual, the burial at sea Thursday was
even more so as Pentagon official estimated that just 1 to 2
percent of burials at sea are accorded to civilians like Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is a rich history of maritime burial and a
strict military procedure for how it should be carried out, the USS
Briscoe, a 9,200-ton destroyer, was hosting a civilian service
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ceremony that they had for those three was not a military
burial at sea ceremony,'' said Ensign Kim Brasel, a Navy
spokeswoman. ``It was on a Navy ship, but all the Navy provided was
the ship. How the ceremony was carried out was determined by the
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said two Navy Roman Catholic chaplains and a
civilian priest officiated at the ceremony, which was approved by
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen after a request by US Sen Edward
M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said eligibility for burial at sea is
reserved for any active or retired member of the uniformed
services, their dependents, some civilians supporting military
operations, and others whose service to the nation makes them
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Pentagon said, fell into that final category,
citing his work with charities such as the President's Commission
on Mental Retardation and the Profile in Courage Award, whose
recipients he helped select each year in memory of his father John
F. Kennedy, the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   Except in time of war, burial at sea occurs rarely now. As
spelled out in Navy guidelines, it includes a firing squad, a
chaplain, an honor platoon, and a bugler. And it starts with a
reading from Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the depths I cry to Thee, O Lord, hear my voice,'' the
Catholic service begins. ``

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Flags from 46 states line the entryway inside
the 2 million-square-foot hangar where the F-22 fighter jet is
being assembled, representing ``all the states where some part of
the plane is being produced,'' said R.S. Rearden Jr., Lockheed
Martin's vice president for the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed beyond those flags on the factory floor are the
plane's trademark vertical fins, the wings that will span 44 feet,
sections of the fuselage and other parts waiting to be fastened
together to make the fourth and fifth F-22 jets ever assembled. At
the end of the hall, an American flag is painted across the exit
doors where the planes will role out under the message: ``Through
These Doors Pass the Most Awesome Fighters in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   This picture of outsized industrial self-confidence survived
years of questioning from Congress about cost overruns and delays
in the Air Force project. Throughout those years, the program
enjoyed the powerful protection of Georgia politicians _ Newt
Gingrich, the former speaker of the House whose district included
this Lockheed plant, and Sam Nunn, the former head of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, Lockheed finds itself in the unaccustomed position
of being on the defensive with Congress, with the House Thursday
night approving the deletion of the $1.8 billion earmarked to
manufacture the first airplanes. It was a stunning defeat for the
Pentagon and the manufacturer, which rarely had encountered a
Congress opposed to a military program on the verge of production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should have seen it coming, but nobody did,'' said
Tom Burbage, the president of Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems.
``We thought this would be the first year we wouldn't have a
battle, and instead we have the biggest we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has been lobbying heavily to save this program
and remains confident that it can win this battle in conference
between the House and the Senate. It does have the support of
several prominent senators, including Ted Stevens of Alaska, who
are ardent loyalists of the next-generation jet.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The firm recently hired Glenn LeMunyon, a lobbyist who was an
aide to Sen. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, and is now charged with
saving the F-22. The biggest aerospace defense contractor, Lockheed
Martin employs its own lobbyists as well as outside firms _
spending $1.98 million in the last six-month reporting period _ to
lobby Congress on its behalf. For the 1998 congressional elections,
the company outspent all of its aerospace competitors, donating
more than $1 million to political action committees for candidates
in both parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan research organization.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the profit from producing 339 of these fighter jets,
at a spiraling cost that Congress estimates may now reach $200
million for each plane. Jobs, too, are at issue, with 1,700 at the
Lockheed Martin plant here, 1,700 at the company's plant in Fort
Worth, Texas, and another 1,500 at the Boeing plant in Seattle
where the wings and rear fuselage section are made along with the
electronic aviation system. At Pratt &AMP; Whitney and its
subcontractors, some 3,000 people are working on the jet's engines.
</P>
<P>
   At peak production, projected for the year 2004, the company
estimated that 11,000 people would be employed in the production of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, jobs are also at issue in the Missouri district of
Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader. Part of the $1.8
billion stripped from the F-22 was earmarked by the House instead
to buy refitted F-15 fighter jets, which are manufactured there.
</P>
<P>
   Burbage, the Lockheed Martin president, insists that the stakes
go way beyond jobs, however. He asserts that the loss of the F-22
program ``will have a profound effect on the science, engineering
and industrial base of the entire defense aerospace industry,'' a
statement his lobbyists are repeating throughout the halls of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the flat, almost blunt silhouette of the F-22,
with its two upright back fins, has little of the futuristic look
of the B-2 stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in the cockpit, however, it has the feel of an
ultra-modern video arcade game in which approaching enemy aircraft
are tracked on a computer screen as red triangles, easily
distinguishable from the green squares representing the
``friendlies'' and the pale yellow oblongs indicating planes with
unknown loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use the cursor like a mouse and see who he is,'' said C.L.
``Buzz'' Buzze, a former Air Force fighter pilot and now the F-22
advanced product representative, as he manipulated the levers of a
facsimile of an F-22 cockpit with deceptive similarities to a
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The cursor slid over the triangle and immediately identified the
enemy plane as a fighter jet from the Russian fleet. When the plane
came in range, the command ``Shoot'' appeared on the screen and
with a flick of a switch a white tail slithered across the screen
hitting a dot that exploded into a small fiery ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't even appear on his radar. He didn't know you were
in the neighborhood and he's destroyed,'' Buzze said. ``That's what
we mean by first look, first shoot, first kill.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, this successful demonstration of the stealth,
speed and maneuverability of the F-22 remains more video game than
actual simulation since the plane has yet to be fully tested in
real flight.
</P>
<P>
   But when, and if, the plane passes all of its tests over the
next three to four years, the officials say that the expensive
stealth qualities built in to nearly every part of the plane's
design will ensure that the F-22 is never seen on the radar of any
other aircraft before it is attacked. And the F-22's supersonic
cruising speed would enable the F-22 pilot to take that first shot
and be the first to kill a plane in an aerial duel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day of a war, we'll destroy the enemy in the sky and
on the ground,'' Rearden said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit's simulated war games, the pilot was not hampered
by any of the 97 outstanding issues noted in a congressional report
as limiting how the plane could operate in real life. Using the
plane's cursor, targets were selected and the information
transmitted instantaneously to a wingman without making radio
contact, several surface-to-air missile defense systems were evaded
and a nuclear weapons plant bombed, all accomplished by relying on
a single computer screen.

<P>
   This aviation electronic system in the cockpit, where data is
collected, integrated and instantly compiled on the screen, is
itself one of the biggest sales points for the jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the electronic system does the integration so the pilot
can focus on the tactical mission _ not having to do what we call
the housework of integrating the raw data,'' said Rearden.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee cited these ``ambitious
technical goals of the F-22,'' especially the electronic system in
the cockpit, as the reason for the expensive delays in the fighter
jet development.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   This advanced technology has come at a cost far in excess of the
original $70 million budgeted for each plane. Lockheed Martin
officials admit that the average price per plane, when all costs
are included, is $172 million _ not far from the $180 million and
$200 million figure cited by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But they recognize that Congress is convinced that the Pentagon
should drop at least one of the three fighter jet programs under
development.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Lockheed Martin has a different candidate than its
own F-22 jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress feels it needs to remove one of the air weapons
programs, I'd pick the F-18,'' said Rearden, referring to the
Navy's refitted fighter jet.

LIFE GOES ON, BUT IT'LL NEVER BE THE SAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sander Vanocur, the former NBC correspondent, first heard
the news, he recalled what John O'Hara, the Irish-American
novelist, said on a hot July day in 1937. ``They tell me that
George Gershwin is suddenly dead at 38. That's what they tell me,
but I don't have to believe it if I don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer and songwriter died of a brain tumor, a celebrity
death which, like many, caused shock, disbelief, and grief among
thousands, even millions, who had never met him.
</P>
<P>
   The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. is different because of
Americans' attitude about history. However imperfectly, they knew
that the young man who perished with his wife and sister-in-law
while approaching Martha's Vineyard was ``a part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The prayers, the sadness, the flowers in TriBeCa all flow to a
clan whose rise to glory began on the margins of American society,
an underdog dynasty. John F. Kennedy Jr. was born 17 days after his
father became the first Roman Catholic president amid the fears of
millions that the White House would be an outpost of the Vatican.
Friday, as his life is celebrated at a Mass at St. Thomas More
Church in New York City, anti-Catholicism has almost vanished in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy saga covers most of the century. John F. ``Honey
Fitz'' Fitzgerald was elected to the US House of Representatives in
1894. One of his grandsons, John, became president; two more,
Edward and Robert, became senators; and two of his great-grandsons,
Joseph and Patrick, also have served in the House. A half-dozen
Frelinghuysens from New Jersey have served in Congress, but only
four from another Dutch dynasty, the Roosevelts. The grandchildren
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt have known little political fame.
</P>
<P>
   The future has always been Kennedy country and the greatest
Kennedy success could lie among its women. Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg has been a key decision maker on many matters,
including her father's library. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the
lieutenant governor of Maryland, may possess as much charm and
savvy as her father, Robert, her uncles and cousins, and even her
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The much-photographed Kennedys have been reviled and revered. In
a society anxious about ``family values,'' theirs has been on
exuberant display for four decades, along with those of the
Bouviers, Skakels, Bennetts, Smiths, Lawfords, and Shrivers. (A
large family means many in-laws.)
</P>
<P>
   In a nation of small families, size matters. When Edward Kennedy
barely escaped death in the crash of a small plane in 1964, his
brother Robert visited him and remarked in that ruefully wry
Kennedyesque way, ``I guess the reason my mother and father had so
many children was that some of them would survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy, the ninth of nine, is, at 67, the sole suriving
son, the patriarch, and an all-too-accomplished eulogist. The
Kennedys' famous fatalism was once expressed by President Kennedy's
citation of a French fisherman's prayer: ``Oh God, thy sea is so
great and my boat is so small.'' Thursday's burial was private and
at sea off Cape Cod, that slip of land of which Henry David Thoreau
said in 1865: ``A man may stand there and put all America behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The America John F. Kennedy Jr. leaves behind is one in which
the median age is younger than his at his death. The vast majority
of his fellow citizens have no contemporary memory of his father's
violent death in 1963 nor that of his uncle in 1968. The grief of
the Kennedys has been vivid in the nation's tribal memory as only a
photograph or a video image, but no less vivid for being so.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tretick, who died last week at 77, was a photographer
for Look magazine. One of his most famous pictures was of the
President Kennedy's young son climbing through a desk in the Oval
Office. ``The Kennedys are great, but you have to do things their
way,'' Tretick once said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys stage-managed their own public image in the days
before 24-hour cable channels and the vast hordes of paparazzi that
their fame and glamour enticed. The Hyannis Port family compound
this week has been a logo for media fascination with one family's
grief.
</P>
<P>
   The old Latin liturgy once included an Augustinian admonition,
``Vita mutatur non tollitur'' _ ``Life is changed, not taken
away.'' That belief sustains those of faith; in addition, there's
always the Irish wake tradition of stories and memories, happy and
sad.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote in ``A Thousand Days'' of how a
young assistant secretary of labor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
reacted to President Kennedy's death. ``I don't think there's any
point in being Irish if you don't know that the world is going to
break your heart eventually. I guess that we thought we had a
little more time,'' Moynihan said. ``Mary McGrory said to me that
we'll never laugh again. And I said, `Heavens, Mary. We'll laugh
again. It's just that we'll never be young again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Across America and the world, many people feel a lot less young
than they did a week ago.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday
warned anew about euphoric stock markets and promised to act
``promptly and forcefully'' to prevent any revival of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He then infuriated some House Republicans by characterizing
their drive for a huge, immediate tax cut as premature and
economically unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street quickly interpreted Greenspan's testimony to the
House Banking Committee as a warning that the Fed's Open Market
Committee is more likely to raise interest rates, possibly as early
as its next meeting in August but almost certainly by October
unless the economy slows from its current robust pace.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments ``left little doubt that he is nervous
about inflation risks in the United States,'' said Michael Moran,
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged from its high
for the day by more than 100 points after Greenspan began talking,
rallied a bit before the close, ending down 33.56 points at
10,969.22. But the broader market _ particularly growth-oriented
technology stocks _ fell much more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   And the bond market, which is extremely sensitive to the
potential for Fed action, tumbled as the rate on the 30-year
Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,
climbed to 5.96 percent from its close of 5.90 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In answering questions from lawmakers, the Fed chairman hedged
his comments somewhat, acknowledging that there is no evidence yet
of inflation's imminent return. But his prepared remarks, which
express the views of the entire group of Fed policy-makers, were
more hawkish than many had expected and suggested that the Fed's
modest recent increase in short-term interest rates will not
necessarily be its last.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed nudged rates higher by one quarter of a percentage
point on June 30, it adopted a ``neutral stance'' on the future
direction of interest rates. But that position, Greenspan now made
clear, did not preclude the Fed from acting as soon as it sees
imbalances emerging in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and
price increases will be picking up,'' Greenspan said, ``the Federal
Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman also expressed worries about the level of the
stock market, and in a more muted version of his now-famous
comments in 1996 about ``irrational exuberance,'' he talked about
the risks of euphoria that exceeds any reasonable assessment of
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity
prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future
become relatively small,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street was focused on Greenspan's comments on the
likelihood of another rise in short-term interest rates, Washington
was focused on his unusually clear warning to Republicans about
their plan for a $792 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. The
subject came up time and time again, and Greenspan's message was
stern: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying hold off for a while,'' Greenspan said just two
hours before the House approved the tax bill. ``And I'm saying that
because the timing is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan urged Congress to pay down the debt and delay any tax
cut until the economy begins to turn down. ``The business cycle is
not dead,'' he warned, telling lawmakers that whenever an economic
slowdown hits, ``a significant tax cut'' may be needed to ward off
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was quick to add, as he has many times before, that
tax cuts are preferable to increased spending. Republicans have
often cited this in support of their plan, saying that to leave a
surplus hanging around in Washington is to invite spending binges.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman openly disagreed with Republicans like Rep.
Merril Cook of Utah, who asked ``what's wrong with moving down that
path simultaneously'' _ that is, paying down the $5.6 billion
national debt and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan responded that tax cuts should wait until the debt is
clearly shrinking. ``Once we know we really have got it locked in
place,'' he said, and ``if we are not being confronted with large
number of spending programs which try to eat up the surplus, I
think at that point we can basically focus on getting important tax
cuts in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, Greenspan was siding with the White House,
Democrats in the House and a small number of moderate Republicans
who have argued that the tax cut passed Thursday is too big and too
soon. And no sooner were the words out of his mouth than some
Democrats were repeating them on the floor of the House, in last
minute, unsuccessful arguments against the tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point _ I don't know when that going to be _ this
economy is going to slow down and perhaps slow down quite
significantly,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I would suspect that a significant tax cut,
mainly of marginal tax rates and capital gains tax rates, might be
a very useful and timely vehicle to sustain an economy which is
otherwise weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The markets shrugged off Greenspan's longer-term predictions of
slowdown, however, and focused instead on his assessment of whether
the Fed would move pre-emptively to slowdown the economy. ``Most of
the time we can't be pre-emptive because, as I point out in my
remarks, the future is opaque,'' said Greenspan, who is widely
considered an expert on opacity.
</P>
<P>
   On monetary policy, Greenspan ran through the familiar litany of
potential problems that could fuel inflation: A slowdown in the
growth of productivity improvements, continued labor shortages,
rising oil prices. But he stopped short of saying that he saw an
immediate threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal projections that we make with respect to what the
economy will be doing in the longer run requires that we have a
very firm judgment on what the long-term productivity growth is,''
he said. ``And I would submit at the moment we don't have that good
a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he would be paying particularly close attention
to the next report on job growth in the economy, which is due in
early August, and to changes in commodity prices, which can be a
useful indicator of early price pressures and the strength of
industrial activity.
</P>
<P>
   He also downplayed the risks of weakness in the global economy,
saying that fears last year that prompted the Fed to cut rates in
the fall have eased considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan's testimony,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at
Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, ``suggests that he believes there is
a high probability that interest rates will need to rise further to
contain future inflation.''

EXCERPTS FROM GREENSPAN'S ECONOMIC REPORT TO HOUSE PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With FED-ECON) 
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan presented his
twice-a-year report on the economy to the House Banking Committee
on Thursday. Following are excerpts from his testimony:
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased
monetary policy to counter a seizing-up of financial markets that
threatened to disrupt economic activity significantly. As those
markets recovered, the FOMC had to assess whether that policy
stance remained appropriate. By late last month, when it became
apparent that much of the financial strain of last fall had eased,
that foreign economies were firming, and that demand in the United
States was growing at an unsustainable pace, the FOMC raised its
intended federal funds rate 1/4 percentage point, to 5 percent. To
have refrained from doing so in our judgment would have put the
U.S. economy's expansion at risk. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The already shrunken pool of job-seekers and considerable
strength of aggregate demand suggest that the Federal Reserve will
need to be especially alert to inflation risks. Should productivity
fail to continue to accelerate and demand growth persist or
strengthen, the economy could overheat. That would engender
inflationary pressures and put the sustainability of this
unprecedented period of remarkable growth in jeopardy. One
indication that inflation risks were rising would be a tendency for
labor markets to tighten further. But the FOMC also needs to
continue to assess whether the existing degree of pressure in these
markets is consistent with sustaining our low-inflation
environment. If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost
and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will
have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude imbalances
from arising that would only require a more disruptive adjustment
later -- one that could impair the expansion and bring into
question whether the many gains already made can be sustained. ...
</P>
<P>
   By themselves, surges in economic growth are not necessarily
unsustainable -- provided they do not exceed the sum of the rate of
growth in the labor force and productivity for a protracted period.
However, when productivity is accelerating, it is very difficult to
gauge when an economy is in the process of overheating.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, assessing conditions in the labor market
can be helpful in forming those judgments. Employment growth has
exceeded the growth in working-age population this past year by
almost 1/2 percentage point. While somewhat less than the spread
between these growth rates over much of the past few years, this
excess is still large enough to continue the further tightening of
labor markets. It implies that real GDP is growing faster than its
potential. To an important extent, this excess of the growth of
demand over supply owes to the wealth effect as consumers
increasingly perceive their capital gains in the stock and housing
markets as permanent and, evidently as a consequence, spend part of
them. ...
</P>
<P>
   In its deliberations this year, the FOMC has had to wrestle with
the issue of what policy setting has the capacity to sustain this
remarkable expansion, now in its ninth year. For monetary policy to
foster maximum sustainable economic growth, it is useful to preempt
forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability. But
this may not always be possible _ the future at times can be too
opaque to penetrate. When we can be preemptive, we should be,
because modest preemptive actions can obviate more drastic actions
at a later date that could destabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   I should emphasize that preemptive policymaking is equally
applicable in both directions, as has been evident over the years
both in our inclination to raise interest rates when the potential
for inflationary pressures emerged, as in the spring of 1994, or to
lower rates when the more palpable risk was economic weakness, as
in the fall of last year. This even-handedness is necessary because
emerging adverse trends may fall on either side of our long-run
objective of price stability. Stable prices allow households and
firms to concentrate their efforts on what they do best: consuming,
producing, saving, and investing.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the interpretation that we are currently enjoying
profuctivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are
not overextended. There can be little doubt that if the nation's
productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their
future potential would be elevated. That prospect has supported
higher stock prices. The danger is that in these circumstances, an
unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can
drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks
in the future become relatively small. Such straying above
fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the
inevitable adjustment occurs. It is the job of economic
policymakers to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully,
ease the transition to the next expansion.

FIRST OF RAYMOND CARVER STORIES HITS PRINT WITH MINIMAL EDITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The papers had sat undisturbed in the desk of writer
Raymond Carver for a decade after his death in 1988. And that was
just fine with Tess Gallagher, his widow and writing partner, who
had left his study in their Port Angeles, Wash., home just as
Carver had left it, out of respect for his memory but also out of
fears about who might get involved once the papers were reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher's reluctance finally dissipated in the face of the
enthusiasm of Jay Woodruff, a senior editor at Esquire magazine,
who had urged her to survey Carver's papers in hopes of finding
something new to publish on the 10th anniversary of his death.
Woodruff even agreed to help her.
</P>
<P>
   So this March, the two met in Port Angeles, about 85 miles
northwest of Seattle, and began the delicate task. By the time the
long day was done, they had made their way through Carver's
undisturbed papers, finding notes and scraps, but also the working
drafts for three short stories that seemed complete.
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff was ecstatic, Gallagher more subdued, at least until
the first of the three new Carver stories, ``Kindling,'' was
published in Esquire's July issue, to praise. ``I'm very happy now
with the results,'' Gallagher said this week from her home. ``Ray's
voice has come forward wonderfully again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kindling'' will be followed by publication of the other two
new stories (``Dreams,'' ``Vandals'') in upcoming Esquire issues.
All are being published, Gallagher stressed, with ``a very
considered effort'' to keep them as they were found, with minimal
editing (all of which will be set out in a new Carver collection,
with the three stories, to be published next year by Alfred A.
Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Gallagher added, ``has been cut here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no minor matter. A critical New York Times Magazine
article recently charged that editor Gordon Lish was largely
responsible for the shape of some early Carver stories (which
Gallagher has said Carver later renounced). And this month's
publication of Ernest Hemingway's incomplete novel, ``True at First
Light,'' has focused much criticism on massively edited versions of
manuscripts left unfinished at an author's death.
</P>
<P>
   Carver's discovered pieces are short stories, not novels, which
should mute some of that criticism, as should publication of
exactly what editing has been done. But ``Kindling,'' another
expedition into hardscrabble Carver Country in the Northwest, is a
quiet work that does not seem, at least on initial readings, to
merit inclusion among Carver's best stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher believes the three new stories, written in the latter
stages of Carver's life, are particularly notable for the way they
provide ``missing links'' with other stories. She sees ``Kindling''
as the middle story in a trilogy that begins with ``Where I'm
Calling From'' and concludes with ``Chef's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's fine second collection of her own stories, ``At the
Owl Woman Saloon,'' is being published in paperback this week by
Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco's writers
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of intriguing public artworks at Safeco Field, the
Seattle Mariners new stadium, has received much notice. But
Safeco's doffing of its cap to writers has been mentioned only in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the most literary of sports and Safeco pays homage
with the display of work from 11 writers.
</P>
<P>
   These are part of the art project in the stadium's southwest
entrance that includes the entrance gates and the much-noticed
chandelier of translucent bats, plus the compass rose in the main
concourse floor. This project was done by Stable (Linda Beaumont,
Stuart Keeler, Michael Machnic).
</P>
<P>
   The three agreed to include some literary quotes in their work
when approached, in midproject, by three baseball and literary fans
_ Sherry Prowda, then head of Seattle Arts &AMP; Lectures and
originator of the idea, Rick Simonson of The Elliott Bay Book Co.
and this writer.
</P>
<P>
   A search of baseball and literary works followed to find
baseball quotations from a wide variety of writers, amid some
debate. Permission was secured to use the quotes and money was
raised for their inclusion ($3,000 from three supporters of Seattle
Arts &AMP; Lectures, $9,000 from the Public Facilities District).
</P>
<P>
   Quotes in the compass rose came from Don DeLillo, Doris Kearns
Goodwin, Bernard Malamud and Lucille Clifton. Quotes on the
entrance gates came from Lynda Barry, W.P. Kinsella, Richard Hugo,
Donald Hall, Annie Dillard, David Wong Louie and August Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The most poetic quote, and the quote with the strongest local
connection, came from Seattle native Lynda Barry: ``I know now I
was lucky to be in Sick's Stadium when the beautiful Seattle
Rainiers played, lucky to have seen them blast some night game
meteors over the fence, some shining burning meteors that sailed
out of the park and flashed a little starlight into the dark ratty
universe on the other side of the wall.''

   WASHINGTON _ By narrowly securing passage of a $792 billion tax
cut on Thursday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert won a sweet victory
and avoided a precipitous collapse of his party's bargaining
position for budget talks with President Clinton. But there is
still a long road ahead in a high-stakes negotiation that is likely
to set down many of the themes of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Republicans are staking their identity and their
majorities in the House and Senate on vast tax cuts, even though
the tax rebellion that propelled Ronald Reagan into office nearly
two decades ago has subsided as the economy has boomed. A $792
billion reduction would be the largest since Reagan pushed through
a reduction in income tax rates in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not miss the purpose of the Republican Party and
conservative philosophy,'' Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said on
Thursday, arguing for the tax cut. ``It is our mission in this city
to shift power and influence from this city back to the people who
sit in the gallery and watch on television and pull the wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, see this looming confrontation as a defining
moment for the 2000 campaign. President Clinton this week
repeatedly showcased his party's stance, with his threats to veto
the Republican bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a critical choice,'' Clinton said, ``whether to move
forward with the fiscal discipline that got us to where we are
today or return to the kind of risk-taking that got us into
recessions and deficits before.''
</P>
<P>
   The head-to-head confrontation between Clinton and the
Republicans is still weeks off.
</P>
<P>
   First, Republicans have to agree among themselves. Though
Hastert survived another near-death experience by pushing through
the tax cut, the effort he had to exert to earn the last votes from
Republican moderates showed that even tax cuts no longer serve as
glue for the Republican Party. And from the right, the presidential
candidate Steve Forbes complained that the House's tax cut was too
timid.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republicans are each promoting separate bills
that cut taxes by $792 billion, and share common goals like
spurring savings and investment and reducing the so-called marriage
penalty, which causes some couples to pay more taxes once they
marry.
</P>
<P>
   Their approaches, however, are at times sharply different and
will have to be resolved in a House-Senate conference committee.
The House bill, for example, is tilted more toward the wealthy. It
includes a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income taxes phased
in over a decade. The Senate bill would reduce the lowest income
tax rate to 14 percent from 15 percent and increase the number of
Americans who pay at the lowest rate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever bill comes out of conference will be vetoed by
President Clinton as too large; then the battle for public opinion
will begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The stirrings could be heard on the House floor on Thursday as
Republicans argued just as they had in the Reagan years that tax
cuts would stimulate the economy, while Democrats remembered how
the tax cut of 1981 contributed to the deficits that plagued the
nation over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's economic picture has changed since Reagan swept
into office riding discontent with high inflation and high taxes.
And it is not at all clear that the political climate favors
Republican tax-cutters at a time of low unemployment and a booming
economy.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press, showed that when Americans were asked which
issue they would like to hear discussed in the presidential
campaign, health care, Social Security and Medicare all drew more
interest than tax cuts, which was listed by just 9 percent of the
public.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that the public could be open to tax cuts, for
the part of the budget surplus that is not attributable to Social
Security payroll taxes _ which explains why the Republican budget
makes a point of setting aside the Social Security funds so they
cannot be used for other spending programs or for tax cuts. But
even that support seemed to depend on how poll questions were
phrased.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what should be done with the surplus after reserving
two-thirds for Social Security, support for tax cuts was relatively
high when people were not given specific spending alternatives.
Sixty percent of those polled supported a tax cut, while only 25
percent wanted ``new federal programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for tax cuts fell off significantly, however, when
people were asked whether they preferred tax cuts or spending on
education, the environment, health care, crime-fighting and
defense. Sixty-nine percent of the public wanted the remaining
surplus spent on those programs while only 22 percent favored a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told a House
hearing on Thursday that it is more important to pay down the
national debt than cut taxes. Debt reduction, he said, would lower
interest rates and put the government in better shape for the
retirement of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heated debate, the outlines of a budget and tax-cut
compromise are already visible if the two parties decide they want
accomplishments over campaign issues. Clinton's own budget proposed
$250 billion in tax cuts. And a handful of Senate Democrats have
already signaled their willingness to go along with a $500 billion
tax cut. A grand deal might involve Clinton's agreeing to a larger
tax cut in exchange for Republican support of the new Medicare
prescription drug benefit he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   But for now neither the White House nor congressional Democrats
are making an effort to help Republicans out of the problem they
have created for themselves by their joint pledges to protect
Social Security and to provide the near $1 trillion tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   With little money left for other needs, Republicans have not
been able to find a way to pass crucial spending bills for labor,
health, veterans and education programs because the cuts required
would be too deep to be politically viable.
</P>
<P>
   And that only increases Clinton's own negotiating position come
the end of September, when the new fiscal year begins. The last
thing the Republicans want is to be accused again of shutting down
the government.

CLINTON RENEWS THREAT TO VETO GOP TAX PACKAGE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ President Clinton, moving to pit Medicare
against tax cuts, charged Thursday that the Republicans' $792
billion relief package would scuttle an effort to save the senior
citizen's health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here for a townhall session to promote his proposal
to add universal prescription drug coverage to Medicare. Clinton
renewed his threat to veto the Republican plan and stepped up
efforts to present it as a choice between a short-term gain for tax
relief vs. the long-term gain of salvaging Medicare from
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Republican) plan would give us no money to stabilize or
modernize Medicare, and it would require substantial cuts in
education, in national defense, in biomedical research, in the
environment,'' Clinton said at the forum held at the Lansing
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP package, he said, would spend ``virtually the entire
non-Social Security surplus on a tax cut'' and would do nothing to
extend the life of Social Security or Medicare, both of which are
expected to become insolvent as the aging Baby Boom generation
retires.
</P>
<P>
   The president urged the crowd of seniors, pharmacists, doctors
and nurses to contact their members of Congress to halt the 10-year
tax relief plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to send a clear message,'' he urged. ``I just
want you to think about this, and then communicate your feelings.''
But the friendly crowd applauded as Clinton pledged to ``veto it if
it passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Medicare proposal calls for devoting a portion of the
expected surplus to shore up the program and extend its solvency to
2027. He also would create a new prescription drug benefit for all
Medicare recipients for a $24 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   He said his plan would still leave money for a ``substantial tax
cut'' for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats support a $250 billion tax cut package targeted
for child care, long-term care costs and other specific items. The
House defeated the Democratic tax alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also released a study by the National
Economic Council and the Domestic Policy Council that showed 75
percent of retirees ``lack decent, dependable, private-sector
coverage'' for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 75 percent, the study claimed, 33 percent of the seniors
had no drug coverage at all, 8 percent purchase Medigap drug
coverage which can be expensive and 17 percent had coverage through
Medicare managed care. The remaining 17 percent were covered
through Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and other public programs.
</P>
<P>
   And, the survey indicated the situation is getting worse because
more private-sector companies are eliminating health coverage for
retirees. The survey, another administration tool to bolster its
proposal, was entitled ``Disturbing Truths and Dangerous Trends:
The Facts About Medicare Beneficiaries and Prescription Drug
Coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that the vast majority of our seniors either have no
drug coverage at all, or coverage that is unstable, unaffordable
and rapid disappearing. It means, therefore, that we need a drug
plan for our seniors that is simple, that is voluntary, that is
available to all and that is completely dependable,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans in Congress support the idea of creating
prescription drug coverage within Medicare, but they maintain it
should only go to those seniors who are in financial need.
Republicans contend two-thirds of the elderly don't need the drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The president heard a number of stories of seniors forced to
make life and death decisions because of the high cost of medicine.
The forum was sponsored by the National Committee to Preserve and
Strengthen Social Security and Medicare, the Older Women's League
and the National Council of Senior Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   One man complained the elderly were ``really candidates for
welfare'' because prescription drug costs are out of control. A
doctor told the story of a patient who died recently after making a
financial choice between medicine for heart problems and diabetes.
His patients, the doctor said, ``bleed your heart'' because of
their struggles to afford necessary medication.

FEW EXPECT SENATE TO ACCEPT `GIMMICK' THAT EASED PASSAGE OF TAX
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., N.J.) (See also TAX-CONGRESS, TAX-ASSESS) 
(DW) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All day on Wednesday, Republican leaders negotiated
with a small band of moderate Republicans who were threatening to
bring down the party's cherished tax-cut bill on the ground that
Congress might be risking money the government did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a compromise was contrived that satisfied both sides.
The incremental reductions in income-tax rates would not go into
effect, they agreed, in any year when there was not a budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Republicans decided to measure whether a surplus
existed by determining each year whether the national debt was
lower than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, shortly before midnight, they changed plans and decided
that the gauge triggering tax cuts would be whether government
interest payments were lower than they were in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent reason for the change is that counting tax cuts,
gross government debt can be expected to rise slightly over the
next 10 years because of transfers between government accounts.
That would mean tax cuts could not go into effect. But total
interest payments are projected to fall because the Congressional
Budget Office is forecasting lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote was taken early Thursday to put the restrictions
into the tax bill, hardly any of the legislators knew what they
were voting for.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of day, when outside policy experts on both sides
of the tax-cut debate had a chance to read the measure, they
pronounced it absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a dumb idea,'' said Stephen Entin, an economist at
the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, who was a
Treasury official in the Reagan Administration and is a devotee of
deep tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office who is now an economist at the Brookings Institution and who
opposes tax cuts, said, ``It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experts can take solace in one point: Hardly anyone in
Congress thinks the contrivance will become law. ``It was a
gimmick, a smear of grease to get us past a sticky spot last
night,'' said a senior Republican congressman who who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A top staff member on the Senate Finance Committee said there
was no chance this would become part of a companion bill that will
go before the Senate as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Republicans in the House who agreed to the deal
were breathing easier today after all the pressure they faced from
their leaders on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be part of killing a significant tax bill,''
said Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey. She said she could not have
voted for the bill without the trigger mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   What if the bill comes back from the conference with the Senate
without the mechanism?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to face that when we come to it,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Another moderate, Rep. Nick Smith of Michigan, who was one of
the main authors of the compromise, said, ``If this doesn't come
back from conference, 40 Republicans will have to be convinced that
our conferees really tried and couldn't do it, and even then some
of us will be quite wary.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is how the mechanism would work: Each July, the
Congressional Budget Office would determine whether total
government interest payments, to the public and to government trust
funds, were lower in the previous 12 months than they had been in
the 12-month period before that.
</P>
<P>
   If they were lower, then the cut in income-tax rates scheduled
to go into effect the following Jan. 1 could be put into place.
Otherwise, the tax cut would be postponed for a year. Then it would
be subject to the same test of lower interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, tax rates would fall by 1 percentage point in
2003 and continue to fall in annual increments until the reduction
reached 10 percentage points in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The other tax cuts in the bill, like the reduction in capital
gains rates and the abolition of inheritance taxes, would not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The worst problem cited by the policy experts is that interest
payments, which depend not only on the size of the debt but also
the level of interest rates, are not always a good measure of debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that if interest payments rise sharply from
one year to the next and then fall slightly in the following year,
a tax reduction would be allowed even though more interest was paid
in the third year than in the first.

HEINZ SELLING ITS WEIGHT WATCHERS UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz Co. broke up the odd couple of food and dieting
Thursday with an agreement to sell its Weight Watchers diet-class
business to a European investment firm for $735 million.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz will use $14 million from the sale to keep a 6 percent
stake in the business, which is being acquired by Artal Luxembourg
SA. Heinz will keep the Weight Watchers frozen meals, desserts and
breakfast products.
</P>
<P>
   William Johnson, the chief executive of the Pittsburgh-based
Heinz, announced in February that he planned to sell the division
as part of a reorganization aimed at refocusing the company on the
food business.
</P>
<P>
   Weight Watchers had been hurt by competition from diet fads,
particularly diet pills, but the business had bounced back in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Weight Watchers chief executive Kent Kreh said the business had
been profitable during the last two years after a change to its
program that allowed participants to eat the foods they wanted and
a marketing campaign that included Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of
York. The unit has also benefited as people have quit taking diet
drugs because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company got a good price for a business that was near
death two years ago,'' John McMillin, a food industry analyst with
Prudential Securities, said. ``The fact that it's rolling now is
nice, but what they are doing now is getting rid of a business
outside of their focus.''
</P>
<P>
   McMillin estimated that Weight Watchers had operating income of
$70 million last year on sales of $400 million. Heinz does not
break out the division's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Heinz can get back to ketchup and its other mainstay food
products. This year, Heinz began a new advertising campaign to
bolster ketchup consumption and brand loyalty among younger
consumers. It is also working to increase sales and manufacturing
capacity in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Kreh, who has led Weight Watchers for two and a half years, said
he expected to continue to run the company, and that it would
continue to be based in Woodbury, N.Y. Under the terms of the deal,
Kreh and several other top executives will receive stakes in the
company, though details have not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the recent profitability of Weight Watchers, the deal
could dilute the company's earnings by 7 cents a share this year,
said Nomi Ghez, a food industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Artal Luxembourg executed the transaction through its U.S.
investment arm, Invus Group Ltd. of New York. Artal, which has $1
billion under management, also has investments in Keebler Co. and
the Sunshine Biscuit Co. unit of Flowers Industries.  &QL;

FORD WORKERS AT BRAZILIAN PLANT GO ON STRIKE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a move that increased tension over Ford
Motor Co.'s plan to build a $1.3 billion car factory in Brazil's
poor northeast, far from the industrial south where most of this
country's auto industry is concentrated, 1,500 workers at the
company's truck plant here went on strike Thursday, fearing that
their jobs are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the plant in Ipiranga, a gritty industrial suburb,
halted production of pickups and larger trucks. The strike is the
latest negative development to tarnish Ford's image in Brazil since
the company clashed with Socialist officials in a dispute over tax
breaks in a southern state earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The strike Thursday was in response to a newspaper report saying
that Ford planned to close the Ipiranga facility and transfer the
jobs to the northeast, where labor costs are cheaper. Ford said the
report was erroneous because the company is studying the transfer
of the Ipiranga plant to another site in Sao Paulo state. Still,
the workers remained on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we have a guarantee from Ford that people won't lose
their jobs, we are justified,'' said Eleno Jose Bezerra, general
secretary of the Sao Paulo Metalworkers Union, in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ford representatives met with union officials Thursday afternoon
to try to resolve union concerns. It was unclear whether workers at
the Ipiranga factory would continue to strike in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced this week a package of incentives worth
about $100 million a year to lure Ford to the northeastern state of
Bahia after officials from another state in the country's south
reneged on earlier incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Officials sought to make the package politically palatable by
reducing the original incentives, estimated at $390 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, politicians and union leaders in southern Brazil were not
pleased. ``Viva Ford,'' Gov. Mario Covas of Sao Paulo state
remarked sarcastically.

 &HT;    Forbes is pioneering Internet e-electioneering
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ This week, Steve Forbes was barnstorming across
Iowa in a bus, and touting a flat tax proposal he says will make
the House Republicans' tax cut look small by comparison at stops in
New Hampshire. His campaign headquarters in Alexandria, Va., was
humming with activity.
</P>
<P>
   But a significant part of the wealthy magazine publisher's
efforts have been placed not on his campaign bus, his headquarters
operation, or on the airwaves, where he has so far outspent all his
Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the campaign happens on the Internet, where the
virtual Steve Forbes walks tall.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the 2000 presidential election will be to the
Internet what the 1960 election was to television, Forbes has gone
all-out to mount what his Web site (www.forbes2000.com) describes
as ``America's first full-scale Internet campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Political reporters get a daily e-mail briefing on what Forbes
is doing and what others in the media are saying about him.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Web site can plug their income information into
a flat tax calculator to see how they'd do under his plan and read
position papers on other issues. Returning visitors will see a
customized page, with the topics they've shown an interest in
pushed to the top of the page, once an upgrade takes effect in a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those who like what they see can sign on as e-precinct captains,
sending customized Forbes e-postcards out to like-minded friends,
working their way up through e-wards, e-counties and e-states as
they gain new recruits, all the way to the e-national committee.
</P>
<P>
   As on other campaign sites, donors can use the Internet to make
credit card campaign contributions. When Forbes held a fund-raiser
recently at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York, e-contributors who'd
donated $10 watched a streaming video of the reception _ an
e-cocktail party _ and later, a personal message from the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the presidential campaigns have an Internet presence
_ Elizabeth Dole, for instance, recently delivered an
e-commencement address to graduating college seniors _ but Forbes'
operation is generally conceded to be the most pervasive and
innovative.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Segal, Forbes' senior media advisor for Internet
strategy, is a self-made e-entrepreneur with a passionate distaste
for what ``big media'' have done to citizen involvement, and a deep
conviction that computers can put politics back in the hands of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is in danger of being reduced to little more than a
television game show. They produce, and the rest of us just sit
back and watch,'' Segal said. ``There's a huge pent-up demand for
citizen participation in the process. People desperately want their
hands back on it again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way it was when, as a 12-year-old in Hamilton,
Ohio, Segal volunteered for his first campaign, Richard Nixon's, in
1972. He loved the hum of activity at the Republican headquarters
as workers licked stamps, worked the phones and kept a wary eye on
the George McGovern office down the street, where Democrats were
doing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Smitten, Segal became a Wunderkind of Ohio Republican politics,
directing a successful legislative campaign as a high school junior
and skipping college to work for Cleveland Mayor Ralph Perk and
Sen. Robert Taft Jr. and as director of the Ohio GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Segal left politics and in 1981 became a partner in Hensley
Segal Rentschler, an industrial ad agency that was fortunate to
come along at about the time the Internet was popping.
Business-to-business commerce, in which his firm specializes, has
been the space program of Internet marketing, Segal said,
developing the ``Tang and pocket calculators'' of the commercial
Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   He supported Forbes in 1996 and on a subsequent visit to New
York convinced him to put a big stake on Web politics.
</P>
<P>
   In '96, Segal says, only 3 percent of likely Republican primary
and caucus voters were online. The total now is between 60 percent
and 70 percent, and growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   Segal joined a team with a deep bench of operatives from
previous Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, the campaign manager, was Jack Kemp's chief of
staff at HUD, where he met Rusty Paul, Forbes' Southern political
director and former chairman of the Georgia GOP. Segal describes
him as ``a great mixer of the stew.'' Communications director Greg
Mueller and his lieutenant K.B. Forbes (no relation) previously
worked in Pat Buchanan's presidential campaigns. Jerry Keen, his
coalitions director, is the former chair of the Georgia Christian
Coalition, and Ruth Kissler, who Segal says has brought a level of
``almost corporate efficiency'' to the campaign, served as Rep.
John Linder's (R-Ga.) deputy when he chaired the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Every day at 8:30 a.m., Mueller chairs a meeting from the
Alexandria headquarters that also includes staff traveling with the
candidate and Segal and the Web team, who operate the site from the
ad agency's offices in a Cincinnati suburb.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about what the day's message will be and how the
ground and Internet campaigns will coordinate their efforts. Segal
is convinced one impact of the Internet will be to shrink response
time even further, with successful campaigns getting in several
volleys within each news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Like Segal, Peter Dayton, managing editor of the Forbes 2000
site, and Jeff Jones, the technical director, come from a
commercial Internet background. They believe the real payoff on
Forbes' Internet investment will come later, when their extensive
profiling of site visitors will enable them to identify everyone
within a given area code who supports the flat tax and is willing
to put a bumper sticker on his car, or make a call to her talk
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   But the story these Internet political pioneers will be telling
their grandchildren is about Forbes' campaign kickoff an-
nouncement, the first ever to be made on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Already a gleam comes to their eyes when they recount it.
Because of FEC restrictions on expenditures, work on the site
couldn't begin until 11 days before the announcement. The
Victoria's Secret site had only recently crashed when it tried to
put on an Internet lingerie show, Segal recalled, and ``the
Luddites in the campaign'' were afraid the same thing would happen
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was scheduled to go on the ``Today Show'' at 7 a.m.
Eastern Time and announce the Internet event, an hour before it
occurred. At 5:30 a.m., the site still wasn't working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Like engineers in the early space program, campaign workers and
technicians in Cincinnati, Alexandria and Annapolis, Md., jointly
called out a ``5, 4, 3, 2, 1'' countdown as the fateful hour
arrived. Cheers went up in the three locations as Forbes' grainy
face began to move, on schedule, on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Segal said he checked a counter a moment later and saw that the
Forbes site had registered 8,000 hits in the first 20 seconds. The
announcement scored 360,000 hits in the first hour, and 20 million
in the first week. It was a milestone in a new frontier of
politics.

 &HT;    Bradley backs ban on `soft money'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley waded
into the campaign finance reform debate Thursday, proposing to ban
unregulated soft money to the political parties and allow for
publicly funded campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley appeared at the National Press Club to make his case
that trust in politicians and democracy has been corroded by too
much money and too many special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy doesn't have to be a commodity that is bought and
sold,'' Bradley told the sold-out luncheon gathering at one of
Washington's oldest forums.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley steered clear of criticizing his own party for the
abuses of the 1996 election, but allowed himself a dig at Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that both Gore and Bush favor banning soft money,
but have directed their fund-raisers to come up with the
unrestricted funds for the general election. If named the
Democratic nominee, Bradley said he would challenge his Republican
opponent to direct the national parties not to raise soft money to
spend on issue advertising and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of how seriously the Gore camp views Bradley's
surprisingly strong challenge for the nomination, Gore's campaign
chairman, Tony Coelho, issued a quick response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has long supported and worked for many major,
substantive changes to reform our campaign finance system, changes
Bill Bradley now embraces but in 18 years in the Senate never
championed,'' Coelho said. ``In election after election, Bill
Bradley took money from the Democratic Party. Now he would leave
the party and every Democratic candidate, from school board to U.S.
senator, to fend for themselves while George W. Bush and the
Republican money machine try to buy the election and take America
backwards on issues like education, gun control, the environment,
and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the Republican National Committee attended
Bradley's speech to distribute comments from RNC Chairman Jim
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson called Bradley a ``newfound reformist'' who as a New
Jersey senator of 18 years ``always milked the system for all he
could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Nicholson's remarks, Bradley noted that he had
directed his campaign not to accept contributions from political
action committees, and that all his funds came from individual
donors subject to the $1,000 federal limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not setting up sham committees in Virginia where 10 people
can get together and give $100,000,'' Bradley said. ``The way we
are raising money in this campaign is what is right about this
campaign, not what is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press secretary, Mindy Tucker, reiterated that he
supports a ban on soft money from unions and corporations _ but not
from individuals _ and declined the Bradley pledge. ``Let's let the
candidates earn their party's nomination, and then the debates
between the parties can begin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised over $11 million in his uphill bid to defeat
Gore for the Democratic nomination, demonstrating more support than
many observers thought he could muster. Bradley, the former NBA
basketball star, said he would not consider becoming Gore's running
mate should he not win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign finance plan, Bradley called for the federal
government to double any contribution up to $250 in exchange for a
candidate agreeing to spending limits, and for candidates to
receive free television time 60 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would also ban corporations and unions from funding
issue ad campaigns, and require organizations running issue ads 60
days before a general election to disclose their donors if they
mention a candidate by name.
</P>
<P>
   To increase voter participation on Election Day, Bradley
proposed allowing voters to register to vote on Election Day, which
Bradley said was possible because of computerized databases of
voters in each state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a GOP contender, has also proposed
campaign finance reforms and, like Bradley, has pledged to make
them a central part of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's on people's agenda,'' said Bradley, who was
scheduled to attend a Washington fund-raiser Thursday evening.
``They see money and politics and they see what's not being done.''

HOUSE PASSES TAX-CUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand; 6th graf quoting Hastert is new, as is the entire
2nd take.)  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Del., Pa., Md., Texas., Va., Calif., Mo., Ky., Wash.,
Iowa)  (See also TAX-ASSESS, TAX-DEBT) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the House put down their marker
Thursday in the debate over how to allocate projected federal
budget surpluses, passing the largest tax cut in nearly two decades
despite a veto threat from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which would cut taxes by $792 billion over
the next decade, passed on a largely party line vote of 223-208.
Four Republicans voted against it, and six Democrats voted in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome averted a major defeat for Speaker Dennis Hastert
and the rest of the Republican leaders, who scrambled throughout
the day on Wednesday to keep the bill from being derailed by
objections from a dozen or so moderates within their own party.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates said the tax cut was too big and left none of the
surplus for debt reduction and needed spending, but most of them
voted for the bill in the end after adding a complex and hastily
written provision that makes a portion of the tax cut contingent on
reducing the interest payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for personal income tax rates to be cut gradually
by 10 percent over the next decade, and for the top rate on capital
gains to be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It would also phase in a repeal of the tax on large
inheritances, create a deduction for health insurance expenses, cut
a variety of business taxes and reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, which leaves many two-income couples paying a bigger tax
bill than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Mr. President, we say, what's wrong in letting American
taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money,'' Hastert said at a
Republican pep rally after the vote. ``We trust them to spend it
right, and we think you should too.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill stands almost no chance of becoming law. But it
represents the opening bid by conservatives as they head toward
negotiations with the Senate, which is moving toward passage of its
own, somewhat less partisan, tax cut, and with Clinton, who despite
his veto threat has opened the door to some tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is among the most ideologically charged and
politically potent facing Congress and the Clinton administration
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1920s has the federal government had a realistic
prospect of taking in more money than it spends over a sustained
period. Current estimates show the government running a surplus of
$2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, permitting both parties the
luxury of setting out wish lists that reflect their basic
philosophies about the size and role of the federal government,
their approaches to long-term challenges like assuring the solvency
of Social Security and their strategies for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ideology and politics, there is also economics. Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and usually one of
Washington's most outspoken proponents of tax cuts, undercut the
Republicans Thursday by suggesting that Congress should hold off on
a big tax reduction while the economy is strong and concentrate
instead on paring the national debt. Big tax cuts typically
stimulate economic growth, and the Federal Reserve is already
concerned that the economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is not right,'' Greenspan said in response to a
question at the House Banking Committee a few hours before the vote
on the tax bill. ``I think we will need a very important reduction
in marginal tax rates and in the capital gains tax rate at some
point in the future when this economy inevitably falters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor, Republicans swept aside criticism of their
tax-cutting plan. Sending excess revenues back to the taxpayer,
they said, was the best way to advance their goals of reducing the
power of the federal government and increasing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If the surplus is not used for tax cuts, they said, Democrats
would inevitably use it for new spending programs. Even with a big
tax cut, Republicans said, there is already more than enough money
sloshing around Washington to pay for domestic and military
spending and deal with the long-term problems in Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing that most voters rank tax cuts behind
Social Security, Medicare and debt reduction as the best use for
the surplus, Republicans said a broad-based tax reduction would
help the party recapture the conservative fervor of Ronald Reagan's
first term as president, when Democrats in Congress acceded to an
even bigger tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats believe they know best how to spend money by
spending it with government,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the
author of the Republican bill. ``We believe the people know best
how to spend their own money. And what this debate is really all
about is downsizing the power of Washington and upsizing the power
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats replied that the Republican plan was built on
assumptions about future surpluses that might never materialize,
risking the return of budget deficits and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   They said that by using nearly all of the portion of the surplus
available for tax cuts _ the $996 billion over the next decade that
does not come from excess Social Security revenues _ Republicans
were missing the country's best chance to do more to shore up
Social Security and Medicare and to invest in education, health
care, the environment and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Democrats said, the Republican tax cut is
disproportionately tilted toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said the Republicans were
pandering to their conservative base with an irresponsible bill
that they knew would never be signed into law. The Republicans'
intention, Rangel said, was to create a ``Christmas tree'' and cast
Clinton in the role of Scrooge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bill is what we call in Harlem a trip to nowhere,''
Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also kept up the pressure on the Republicans, repeating
his veto threat for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this plan that's being voted on in Washington
will not enable us to pay off our debt,'' Clinton said Thursday
during a trip to Lansing, Mich. ``It will not do anything to add to
the life of Social Security and Medicare. It will require huge cuts
in our other investments and taking care of our kids. And I will
veto it if it passes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the frantic bargaining between the Republican leadership
and their moderates on Wednesday, there was relatively little drama
in Thursday's vote. Most of the moderates who had threatened to
defect said they were satisfied that the leadership had taken their
concerns seriously and had agreed to their demand that the largest
component of the tax cut _ the phased-in reduction in personal
income tax rates _ take effect only if regular progress is made in
bringing down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But there was considerable confusion on both sides of the aisle
about just how the contingency would work in practice, and whether
it was anything more than an expedient way of holding the fractious
Republican majority together for a few hours to get the tax bill
passed. Even some of the moderates said they did not expect the
provision to survive when the House and the Senate reconcile their
tax-cut bills in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The four Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps.
Michael Castle of Delaware, who had led the moderate revolt; Jack
Quinn of New York; Greg Ganske of Iowa, and Constance Morella of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The six Democrats who voted in favor of the bill were Reps.
Sanford Bishop of Georgia; Virgil Goode of Virginia; Ralph Hall of
Texas; Gary Condit of California; Pat Danner of Missouri, and Ken
Lucas of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the House did not vote. They were Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., who was attending services for his cousin, John F.
Kennedy Jr.; Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and John Peterson, R-Pa. There
is one vacancy among the 435 seats in the House.

F-22 FIGHTER TAKES SERIOUS HIT FROM HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved a $266 billion defense bill
Thursday that takes the extraordinary step of eliminating funding
for production of the F-22 stealth fighter that the Air Force
contends will guarantee U.S. air supremacy well into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of 379-45 followed the withdrawal of an amendment that
would have restored $1.8 billion in the Pentagon budget to pay for
the first six F-22s, which are still in development and are
intended to replace the F-15 as the nation's front-line fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the House voted to keep nearly $1.2 billion in the
Pentagon budget for continued research and development of the F-22,
and the Senate is expected to restore enough funding later this
month to begin production of the plane next year with a scheduled
operational delivery date of the first six in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also hinted that Clinton will
likely veto the final defense spending bill for next year if it
does not include funding for production of the sophisticated
radar-evading aircraft designed to fly at Mach 2.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the program arose in the House Appropriations
Committee earlier this month after the panel received a Pentagon
report showing that the cost in the developmental phase of the
program had grown out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force put the estimated cost for each F-22 at about $200
million. But lawmakers said the cost for each aircraft, if the
program continues unchecked, will likely grow to some $300 million,
an expenditure that the committee decided could not be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., and Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis., argued that money would be better spent on refitting and
upgrading the F-15 and other U.S. fighters and aircraft that
defense officials say will continue to provide an air supremacy
advantage over other nations at least through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-22 is a beauty of an airplane. It would be great to have
it if we had all the money in the world,'' Obey said during debate
Thursday on an amendment to restore funding that was offered by
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and then withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Barr decided not to press the case for his amendment after he
was assured by Lewis that F-22 funding would be reconsidered in
conference with the Senate.

F-22 program is killed, argued that failure to follow through on
the program would endanger the national security of the country by
relying on F-15s and other fighters that are nearly 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canceling the F-22 means that we can't guarantee air supremacy
in the next conflict,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, who
described the plane as ``a cornerstone'' of the Pentagon's
long-term modernization and defense strategy. ``We need it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson noted that up to ``151,000 jobs in 42 states,'' some in
the Fort Worth-Dallas area, could be lost as a result of shutting
down the program, the bulk of which was awarded to the Lockheed
Martin, Boeing and Pratt &AMP; Whitney companies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by committee not to include funding for production
marked one of the rare times that lawmakers have moved to stall,
and possibly kill, a major weapons system program on the verge of
production.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate defense appropriations bill contains about $3 billion
for the F-22 through next year, and Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, has vowed to do everything he can
to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Thursday that his intent is not to the kill the
program altogether, but simply to delay it while Congress takes
more time to consider whether it needs the F-22 along with two
other new fighter aircraft _ the F/A-18E/F and the Joint Strike
Fighter _ that the Navy and the Marine Corps want built.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force, meanwhile, is warning that any slowdown in the
production schedule of the F-22 would kill the program because it
would be prohibitively expensive to rehire laid-off workers and
restart production.

ALTERNATIVE TO VACCINE BARRED FOR BABIES HAS PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental vaccine for rotavirus, the leading cause of
severe diarrhea in infants and young children, may be more
effective and easier to deliver than the recently suspended
standard vaccine, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   But further research is needed before the experimental vaccine,
known as 89-12, can be marketed. Licensing, if it ever comes, would
not be for at least three years because the critical third and
largest stage of testing has not begun, said Dr. Richard Ward, an
author of the report being published Saturday in London in the
medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, at least three other experimental vaccines are
being tested against rotavirus, which each year sends 50,000
American children to the hospital and kills 20.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the need for alternative rotavirus vaccines
arose last week when federal health officials called for suspension
at least until November of the standard rotavirus vaccine,
RotaShield. RotaShield is recommended for all infants, and its
manufacturer, Wyeth-Ayerst of St. Davids, Pa., said 1 million
infants in the United States had received it since the Food and
Drug Administration licensed it on Aug. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for
suspending the use of RotaShield because the agency had received
reports of 20 babies who had developed a painful blockage of the
bowel, called intussusception, shortly after swallowing the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   CDC epidemiologists are investigating the link between the
vaccine and the bowel obstruction. Thursday there were 32 reported
intussusception cases; in 27, the bowel obstruction began three to
seven days after the babies received RotaShield, officials of the
CDC, a federal agency in Atlanta, said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is viewed as a prudent public health measure. But
it has been embarrassing for the government because RotaShield was
developed at the National Institutes of Health, a federal agency in
Bethesda, Md., before it was licensed to Wyeth-Ayerst. Also, CDC
officials promoted the vaccine even before the FDA licensed it.
</P>
<P>
   If, as some financial analysts have predicted, RotaShield never
returns to the market, health officials will need to consider an
alternative if one is available.
</P>
<P>
   The 89-12 is derived from a strain of rotavirus that infects
humans, unlike RotaShield, which is derived from strains that
infect monkeys. The 89-12 is so named because the rotavirus was
isolated from the 12th participant in a study in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The 89-12 vaccine is derived from a live virus that was weakened
by passing or replicating it 26 times in test tubes in a
laboratory. Dr. Ward, the co-author, said in an interview that
Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, where he works, had licensed the
vaccine to Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc. of Needham, Mass., which,
in turn, licensed it to SmithKline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of 215 infants ages 10 weeks to 16 weeks agreed to let
the choice of whether their children swallowed 89-12 or a placebo
be made randomly in the study that was conducted at Dr. Ward's
hospital and three pediatrics centers, in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia. The 89-12 was given in two doses, the second from 6
to 10 weeks after the first. (RotaShield is given in three doses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rotavirus disease occurred in 2 of 108 babies in the group that
received 89-12, compared with 18 of 107 who received the placebo.
89-12 was safe with a mild fever being the most common side effect.
</P>
<P>
   The 89-12 contains one strain of rotavirus compared with four in
RotaShield. Dr. Ward said the single strain was a potential
advantage because it would lower the cost and make quality control
easier. Also, Dr. Ward said, studies have shown that the amount of
immunity decreases when a second strain is put in a rotavirus
vaccine because they compete with each other.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is not known whether 89-12 protects against all
strains of rotavirus because it is derived from one, known as G1,
which is the dominant strain in the United States. G1 was the only
one causing illness at the time of the study, August 1997 to June
1998. ``So all we know is that it works against that one strain,''
Dr. Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   RotaShield's future could have ``dramatic'' implications for the
expanded tests that are needed for the 89-12 vaccine, Dr. Ward
said. If RotaShield is taken off the market permanently, then
scientists testing rotavirus vaccines in the United States ``could
do it much easier because we could use a placebo group, which
cannot be done ethically if there is a licensed vaccine,'' Dr. Ward
said, and the effectiveness is more apparent with a placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Avant did not return a telephone call Thursday.

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a meeting of AT&AMP;T's board here Wednesday, the two
sides of the company's executive incubator were hard at work. The
nation's biggest communications company takes executive development
seriously, and this was the directors' chance to learn about some
of the company's possible future leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A series of senior executives made presentations about
up-and-comers in their departments, assessing the young managers'
chances to one day join the company's highest ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the incubator sat in two of the boardroom
chairs. There among the directors were Eastman Kodak Co. chairman
George Fisher and former Tele-Communications Inc. chairman John
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Malone each began their careers at AT&AMP;T, and in the
1960s and '70s their names might well have been floating around a
similar board meeting. But eventually each made his mark on the
business world by leaving AT&AMP;T _ Malone in 1968 and Fisher in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   One of AT&AMP;T's greatest strengths is also perhaps its least
avoidable weakness: It creates many world-class executives but
holds on to few of them.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T that Malone and Fisher left decades ago bears little
resemblance to the AT&AMP;T of today, but the tradition has held up and
even passed down to old Ma Bell's progeny. In the most recent
example, Hewlett-Packard Co. has just named as its chief executive
Carleton Fiorina, a top executive at Lucent Technologies Inc.,
which spun out of AT&AMP;T in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems likely that many of the young executives that
AT&AMP;T's board heard about Wednesday will have left the company by
the time their number comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Other big companies, such as General Electric Co., are also
known as wellsprings of executive talent. But with the
communications industry's breakneck expansion, AT&AMP;T executives have
scattered across the digital frontier like so many honeybees,
pollinating both startups and established giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just three or four years ago we were talking about Pat Russo,
Carly Fiorina, Joe Nacchio,'' said Harold Burlingame, now AT&AMP;T's
executive vice president for mergers, who for years was in charge
of human resources. Of the three, only Patricia Russo is still in
the extended AT&AMP;T family, as Lucent's executive vice president for
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After spending his entire career with the company, Nacchio left
his job running AT&AMP;T's consumer long-distance operation in 1996 to
become chief executive of Qwest Communications International Inc.,
the long-distance upstart.
</P>
<P>
   In leaving AT&AMP;T, Nacchio was hardly alone. In addition to
Hewlett-Packard and Qwest, the roster of companies that have recent
AT&AMP;T alumni among their most senior executives includes Teligent,
Priceline.com, Global Crossing, Fidelity Investments, Gateway and
Zilog. And that does not even include Netscape, Teledesic and
Nextlink, which are currently or have recently been run by
executives who spent relatively short stints with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Of the senior AT&AMP;T executives who have recently departed,
Nacchio offers perhaps the most pointed comments about the campaign
of attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of our cases, a lot of it had to do with whether the
company recognized our own talent,'' he said. ``When I was there,
the grass was always greener, and they always believed the people
outside were better than the people they had already.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's young executives did not always harbor that suspicion.
For many decades, the company has followed a similar regimen in the
training of its executives, focusing on rotations among different
assignments every 18 to 24 months in the interest of broadening
their experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent time in product management, engineering, sales,
marketing, financial management and manufacturing,'' said Curtis
Crawford, who was president of Lucent's microelectronics unit
before becoming chief executive of Zilog, the semiconductor
company, last year. ``Having had the responsibilities, I'm much
better qualified than someone who had been in a vertical
assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T's traditional method of grooming executives had at
least a few flaws. Perhaps the most glaring was a reliance on
credentials rather than talent.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious internal victim was Robert Annunziata, now
chief executive of Global Crossing, the fast-growing undersea cable
company. Annunziata joined AT&AMP;T in 1966 straight out of high school
as an 18-year-old technician. He never went back to school, though
by 1983 he was managing AT&AMP;T's national Merrill Lynch account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that because I didn't have the college credential
I would never go further, and I had other guys that said they
needed me because I knew how to run the business,'' he said, adding
that he got a great education at AT&AMP;T. ``That's when I decided to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch hired Annunziata and made him chief executive of
the operation that became Teleport Communications, which he built
and then sold back to AT&AMP;T last year for $11.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s AT&AMP;T's own senior executives had doubts about
the farm team they had created. The communications industry, which
AT&AMP;T had dominated for so long, was being radically changed by new
competition and new technology, and top AT&AMP;T executives like
chairman Robert Allen were concerned that new ideas were needed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So the company hired high-profile outsiders, including Alex
Mandl, who joined the company as chief financial officer and became
chief operating officer, and Jerre Stead, who became a executive
vice president and is now chairman of Ingram Micro Inc., the
computer distributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period where they had an incredible need to go
outside and to some extent it was something of a fad,'' said
Jeffrey Weitzen, who last year left AT&AMP;T after 17 years to become
president of Gateway Inc., the computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of the outsiders disturbed lifers like Nacchio, while
Allen's mixed signals in the mid 1990's about his own departure
disturbed some of the new hires. Mandl left in 1996 to become
chairman of Teligent Inc., the wireless communications carrier.
Nacchio left soon after Allen went outside the company yet again in
picking John Walter, a relatively unknown publishing executive, as
president and sucessor. (After Walter failed, the board hired C.
Michael Armstrong as chairman from Hughes Electronics.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you develop a lot of good people you're not going to be
able to keep all of them,'' Mandl said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T still has a lot of home-grown talent in executives like
Frank Ianna, the chief quality officer, and John Petrillo, the
executive vice president for strategy. But the company's chief
financial officer, president for consumer services and general
counsel have each been hired from the outside in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T executives continue to be seen as hot
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cachet is clearly there,'' said Dennis Carey, vice
chairman of Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. Referring to
James Barksdale, who left his job as chief executive of AT&AMP;T's
wireless unit in 1995 to become chief executive of Netscape, he
added, ``The Barksdales, the Annunziatas, the Curt Crawfords _
whether they were homegrown or not, the point is that they were
there when they were recruited out.''
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the senior executives who have left AT&AMP;T over
the last few years, there has probably been no stronger motivation
than the simple desire for more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch Mike Armstrong, and he would say things, and I
ended up being the person who said, `We tried that and it didn't
work','' said Gail McGovern, a 24-year AT&AMP;T veteran who resigned
last year as president of the company's consumer division to become
Fidelity's president for distribution and services. ``And I
realized I wanted to be the person coming up with kooky ideas and
bouncing them off people.''

KENNEDY, PASSENGERS DIED INSTANTLY, CORONER SAYS

<P>
   CHILMARK, Mass. _ John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister
died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's
investigation continues. One source close to the probe said that
all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up,
including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including
plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a
wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it
hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but
died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts
Chief Medical Examiner Richard J. Evans. After an examination that
occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that
all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators would not comment further on the condition of
the bodies or the details of coroner's report. And they would not
say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering
question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July
16.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is
usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in
forensic pathology said Thursday. The cause of death is generally
known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the
cause of the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed
especially quickly, pathologists said. The remains were taken to a
Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released
to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical
examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said
Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook
County, Ill. The haste in this case, he said, could lead to
questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so
are the risks of carelessness. He pointed to other ``autopsies
associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation
that followed President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and the
questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago,
in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as
Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let . . .those kinds of pressures alter your
routines,'' he said. ``If you alter your procedure and do things
differently, then you're always going to run into problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri
counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45
minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the
death.
</P>
<P>
   In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine
whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain
rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for
the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign
of what the pilot was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the
testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said. After every
plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send
investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to
collect a series of specimens.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix
said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine
the victims' injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a
victim's family sues for damages related to the crash. A medical
examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments
before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes
it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact
that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local
district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual
intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the
burial. Officials were especially reluctant to give out information
on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
</P>
<P>
   Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical
and reasonable, Kirschner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he
said. ``Because when you're too deferential, you're not thinking of
the things you should be thinking of.''

BRADLEY PROPOSES MAJOR CAMPAIGN-FINANCE OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Asserting that big money is the root of multiple
problems in American politics, Bill Bradley, the former senator
from New Jersey, proposed a sweeping overhaul of the federal
campaign finance system on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is running against Vice President Al Gore for the
Democratic presidential nomination, said he would refuse soft
money, the unlimited and unregulated cash that goes to political
parties, but only if Republicans agreed to a similar ban.
</P>
<P>
   He wants a system, he said, in which ``candidates run on the
strength of their ideas, not the weight of their wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also called for same-day voter registration to make it
easier for people to vote and a requirement that employers give
their workers at least two hours off on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his proposal for reducing the importance of money in
elections, Bradley advocated free television time for candidates.
He also called for taxpayer-financed congressional campaigns in
which candidates would receive $2 in public funds for every $1 they
received in private contributions of $250 or less. In exchange, he
said, he would limit the amount they spend. Currently there is
federal public financing only for presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if he won his party's nomination, the first thing
he would do would be to seek a pact with the Republican nominee not
to have their respective parties raise or spend soft money in the
general election for items like issue advertising, which is a
thinly veiled way for groups to promote or oppose a particular
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, led by the Republicans, has resisted efforts in recent
years to overhaul the campaign finance system, including some
measures embraced by Bradley, like a soft-money ban. Democrats,
too, have been at best ambivalent about campaign finance overhaul,
although both President Clinton and Gore have endorsed legislation
that would ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are already counting on raising at least $100
million in soft money for issue advertisements for 2000. And the
leading candidates for president are awash in money this year, with
Republican George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, already
attracting a record $37 million in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley noted Thursday that while Bush and Gore have both said
they support changing the campaign finance system, they have both
``directed their top fund-raisers to begin raising soft money for
the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp reminder of just how important money is in political
campaigns, Bradley was headed Thursday night to a fund-raising
event in suburban Washington after delivering his anti-money speech
at the National Press Club at lunch. He also plans to spend this
weekend at five fund-raisers on Long Island, N.Y. Next week his
friends from the National Basketball Association are planning a
star-studded fund-raiser for Bradley, a former New York Knicks
player, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's Web site simultaneously calls him a ``strong advocate
for campaign finance reform'' and boasts that he has raised $11.7
million so far for his presidential campaign, much of it from Wall
Street. The amount has impressed campaign-watchers and given him
credibility as a plausible alternative to Gore, who has raised $18
million.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho,
said that Gore had long worked for changes in campaign financing
but also suggested that Bradley's approach would leave other
Democratic candidates to ``fend for themselves while George W. Bush
and the Republican money machine try to buy the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said the former senator would
not ``put the House and Senate Democrats at a comparative
disadvantage.'' Hauser noted that Bradley would spurn soft money
only if the Republicans did, too. This has been the central defense
all along for Democrats continuing to raise vast amounts of cash
even as they call for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has put off until October a debate on legislation to
overhaul the campaign finance system. The legislation is sponsored
by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in New York Thursday, McCain strayed across party
lines to praise Bradley and reiterate his own pledge to ban soft
money. ``I welcome another voice to the fight to take our
government back from the special interests and big-dollar
contributors,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee was not so kind. Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the party, called Bradley a hypocrite and
said ``he always milked the system for all he could get.''
Nicholson said that Bradley called for voluntary spending limits in
1991 only after he rejected a proposed $3 million spending limit
for his 1990 campaign, in which he spent $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, changing the way campaigns are financed is a relatively
low priority for voters. A new survey by the Pew Research Center
found that only 28 percent of voters said campaign finance should
be a priority, ranking it 16th after other goals like reducing
crime (ranked first by 76 percent) and improving education (74
percent).
</P>
<P>
   The topic appeals particularly to independent voters, the survey
found, and, said Charlie Cook, a political analyst, serves
Bradley's image as an anti-establishment candidate running an
``outsider'' campaign. ``It allows him to play off both George Bush
and Al Gore and differentiate himself from the Clinton-Gore
administration,'' Cook said.

EXCERPTS FROM BUSH'S SPEECH ON GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following is an excerpt from a speech delivered Thursday in
Indianapolis by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for
the Republican Party's presidential nomination, as provided by
Bush's presidential exploratory committee:
</P>
<P>
   Today I want to propose a different role for government, a fresh
start, a bold new approach.
</P>
<P>
   In every instance where my administration sees a responsibility
to help people, we will look first to faith-based organizations,
charities and community groups that have shown their ability to
save and change lives. We will make a determined attack on need, by
promoting the compassionate acts of others. We will rally the
armies of compassion in our communities to fight a very different
war against poverty and hopelessness, a daily battle waged house to
house and heart by heart.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies. On the contrary, it will be government that serves
those who are serving their neighbors. It will be government that
directs help to the inspired and the effective. It will be
government that both knows its limits and shows its heart. And it
will be government truly by the people and for the people.
</P>
<P>
   We will take this path, first and foremost, because private and
religious groups are effective, because they have clear advantages
over government.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the idea of compassion is dismissed as soft or
sentimental. But those who believe this have not visited these
programs. Compassion is not one of the easy virtues.

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, July 19,
about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. with his wife and her sister
in an airplane crash attributed a statement about them imprecisely.
It was Carolyn and Lauren Bessette's family _ not the Kennedy
family _ who said: ``John and Carolyn were true soulmates, and we
hope to honor them in death in the simple manner in which they
chose to live their lives. We take solace in the thought that
together they comfort Lauren for eternity.''

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, July

efforts in Kosovo rendered part of his comment incorrectly. The
official, John Ruggie, an American adviser to Secretary General
Kofi Annan, said the United Nations' relief workers and police were
supposed to get ``up and running'' while the NATO force restored a
secure environment. He did not say the force had already restored
such an environment.

WASHINGTON: employers and HMOs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crippen said that half of Medicare beneficiaries ``already have
coverage for prescription drugs that is at least as generous as the
coverage offered under the president's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But on his visit to Lansing, Mich., on Thursday, Clinton said
such coverage was in jeopardy. Employers are reducing retiree
health benefits, and Medicare HMOs are charging more for drug
coverage, while premiums for individual insurance policies to fill
the gaps in Medicare are rising rapidly, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's trip appeared to be an effort to deflect the
criticism implicit in Thursday's testimony by Crippen and another
influential expert, David M. Walker, the new comptroller general of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Congress should be careful about establishing new
Medicare benefits on the assumption that the federal budget would
run surpluses for the next decade. ``Current projected surpluses
could well prove to be fleeting,'' Walker said, but the new drug
benefits would have a ``permanent claim'' on the federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to a rising limit. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 in 2002 and would increase
gradually to $2,500 in 2008. The president would pay subsidies to
private employers who provide retiree health benefits with drug
coverage at least equivalent to the new Medicare benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader,
said it was ``utterly absurd for us to subsidize employers who are
currently providing this benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, even as senators said that Clinton's plan would
prove too expensive, they said he was not doing enough to protect
sick people with very high drug costs. Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,,
said the president should not worry so much about covering routine
drug expenses, but should help people with ``catastrophic drug
costs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When President Clinton said Wednesday that he was John
F. Kennedy Jr.'s host for his only visits to the White House since
his father's assassination in 1963, Clinton was ``speaking off the
cuff'' without research, according to White House spokesman Barry
Toiv. In fact, JFK Jr. had been back at least twice before. He, his
sister, Caroline, and their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
visited President Richard Nixon at the White House in February
1971, and he and his sister visited President Ronald Reagan there
in March 1985. Toiv said Clinton was relying ``on what John Kennedy
had told him.

U.S. ATTORNEY PROBES TRADING BY DATEK SECURITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York is investigating trading activities at Datek Securities that
took place as recently as two years ago, according to an official
close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the investigation, begun in recent weeks and still in
the most preliminary stage, are scant. But it is said to involve
trading activity at the firm using NASDAQ's Small Order Execution
System, set up in 1984 to facilitate the buying and selling of
NASDAQ stocks by individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bethge, chief marketing officer of Datek Online Holdings,
said: We have not been informed that Datek Online is a target of
any investigation. We have received a document subpoena from the
U.S. attorney, and we are cooperating fully with the U.S.
attorney's office.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Datek Securities Corp., based in Iselin, N.J., was incorporated
in 1978. For years, Sheldon Maschler was head trader and dominated
the firm, an over-the-counter stock trading house. The company
became Datek Online Holdings in 1998 and focused on the individual
investor. Since then, it has presented itself as a new company with
new management and distanced itself from Maschler and the old stock
trading house. With 250,000 customer accounts, Datek Online is the
nation's fourth-largest Internet brokerage firm; it is now run by
Jeffrey Citron, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Datek also owns most of Island ECN, an electronic stock trading
network that accounts for about 15 percent of trading in NASDAQ
stocks. Island has petitioned the Securities and Exchange
Commission to become an independent stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As reported Thursday, Vulcan Ventures, the venture capital fund
financed by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., withdrew
its plans to invest as much as $75 million in Datek Online Holdings
and $25 million in Island ECN, though two other venture capital
firms proceeded this week with a $195 million infusion into Datek.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear what investigators are looking for in Datek
accounts, the subpoenaed documents could be full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The history of one customer account at Datek provides a glimpse
of how the small order trading system was used to generate profits
at the firm. The account, active from 1994 to 1997, belonged to a
relative of a person who has been close to Datek. This person, who
declined to be identified for fear of reprisals, supplied the
account information to The New York Times and explained how it and
similar accounts came to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The account began with less than $100,000. But in one year at
Datek, it generated an astonishing $1.1 billion in total
transactions, both purchases and sales of stocks. In one day, 17
trades, some with profits of less than $50, were recorded. The
heavy activity led the investor to the close the account.
</P>
<P>
   According to the person who supplied the account documents, as
early as 1994 Maschler began holding meetings for Datek traders. At
these meetings, Maschler tried to persuade those present to bring
accounts to Datek with the promise that each investor would be
guaranteed annual profits of at least 15 percent. If the trading in
the account generated more in profits than the guaranteed return,
Datek would pocket the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Those who brought in such accounts were offered a finder's fee
of 5 percent of the account's assets, explained the person with the
documents. The accounts were discretionary, meaning that their
owners did not have to be consulted before each trade was executed.
The person who supplied the documents confirmed that the investor
earned 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to comment on the specifics of the case, a
spokesman for the SEC said that it was a violation of securities
laws to guarantee a return on an investment and that it was
unlawful for a firm or broker to share in the profits an account
generates.
</P>
<P>
   There was no answer at Maschler's home in Boca Raton, Fla. Datek
officials said Maschler was no longer with the firm and they could
not supply the name of his lawyer. When asked about the unusual
account activity and guaranteed returns, Bethge said it predated
current management and he could not verify or dispute the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the supplier of the documents, Maschler told the
traders that he planned to use the individuals' funds to buy and
sell NASDAQ stocks on the small order execution system. At the
time, market makers posting prices in NASDAQ stocks were obligated
to execute customer orders that came through on the system in
amounts up to 500 shares. Maschler had become known for using the
system aggressively to nail market makers who were slow to update
their price quotations on a stock and were momentarily offering to
buy stocks at prices above the current market or sell at prices
that were too low. Catching market makers napping in this way is
what the firm became known for.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules governing the small order system stipulated that
the system could only be used for individual investors. Brokerage
firms and their principals were prohibited from using the system
for their benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Maschler and Datek have had many run-ins with regulators over
the years. In May, the SEC fined Datek $50,000 for filing false
financial reports and illegally using customer money to pay the
firm's expenses in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, the National Association of Securities Dealers
censured and fined Maschler $675,000 and suspended him from
association with any NASD member for one year. The association
charged that between 1991 and 1993 Maschler and other Datek
employees violated rules by splitting up orders that were too large
for use on the small order system into orders that could meet the
requirements.  &QL;

DESIGN FLAWS, GUARD'S ERROR LED TO TEXAS CONVICT'S ESCAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Design flaws in the state's most high-tech
lock-up, a prison guard's mistake and a fleet-footed convict who
had all the luck of a lottery winner led to the escape last month
of a convicted murderer from the state prison, officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two prison investigative teams' efforts, though, Texas
Department of Criminal Justice officials are still unable to
pinpoint one factor that allowed Clifton Jones, a 33-year-old
inmate from Dallas doing 26 years for murder, to escape from the
Estelle High Security Unit near Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a combination of events and luck,'' said board
member Mac Stringfellow, the board's liaison on the escape
investigation team.
</P>
<P>
   On June 25, Jones slipped out of his handcuffs and cleared three
fences _ the first 25 feet tall _ within a matter of seconds before
dodging guards' gunfire and running into the woods, where he eluded
capture for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Guards at the high security facility _ which houses the most
aggressive and assaultive prisoners _ were astounded when they saw
Jones, who has a history of being able to slip out of handcuffs,
scramble over the 25-foot high fence that surrounds enclosed
recreation cages, said Gary Johnson, director of prisons for TDCJ.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' escape has prompted several design changes in the high
security unit and four other such facilities under construction
elsewhere in the state, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable of the design changes will be the installation of
guard towers outside perimeter fences _ a throwback to older prison
facilities that do not have the computerized and electronic
monitoring intended to minimize the number of employees needed in
the high security units.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most critical design flaw was the placement of a
camera pole too close to the perimeter fence and the lack of
sufficient barriers to prevent an inmate from climbing it. Once
Jones scaled that he used it somewhat as a pole vaulter to clear
the perimeter fence _ his last barrier to freedom, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, TDCJ is moving all camera towers away from the
fence and putting razor wire and other barriers to prevent would-be
escapees from climbing it. TDCJ also is installing a third,
razor-wire-topped fence around the Estelle Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, an Estelle guard doing routine security
checks reported the potential escape risk with the pole and
recommended that razor wire be installed around it, but that
recommendation was never followed up on, Johnson acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman Allan Polunsky told TDCJ administrators he has
``serious concerns'' that that recommendation was ignored or
forgotten. The current warden, Ricky Thaler, was not assigned to
the unit when the recommendation was made.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also, however, found an 8-inch-by-16-inch gap in the
25-foot high chain-link fencing around the recreation yard, and he
was able to squeeze through that. That gap, prison officials
insisted, was not noticeable from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Thaler said TDCJ is in the process of welding the chain link and
installing metal plates around the top of the entire recreation
yard to block any other possible hole a prisoner might squeeze
through.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, officials said, Jones could not be locked in his
recreation cell because the locking pin on the cell door was
already in the locked position. Only one guard carries the keys to
the recreation yard cages, and he was busy elsewhere in the
recreation yard, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those locking pins can fall into the locked position when a cell
door is slammed too hard or when a door is closed too slowly.
Nonetheless, TDCJ officials said they are the best locks they have
seen.
</P>
<P>
   The escape was set in motion as a female officer, Diana Shupak,
was escorting Jones from his cell to the recreation yard. After
performing a routine strip search of Jones, Shupak handcuffed Jones
and took him to the recreation cage to which he was assigned that
day, Johnson told the Texas Board of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Shupak's strip search violated TDCJ policy, Johnson and other
prison officials said, because TDCJ requires inmates to be strip
searched by officers of the same gender whenever possible. They
said male guards were available, but Shupak did not request one.
Shupak, however, also erred when she cuffed Jones. First of all,
Johnson said, the cuffs apparently were not tight enough and second
were not double locked in violation of Estelle Unit policies.
</P>
<P>
   Double-locking the handcuffs would not have necessarily
prevented Jones from pulling his hand out of the cuffs, but it
would have prevented him from opening the cuff into a hooklike
weapon, as he did, Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
   Jones twice before had managed to slip out of handcuffs,
officials added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The review team could not conclude that (Shupak) did not apply
the handcuffs correctly,'' Johnson added. ``It's a real judgment
call on whether the handcuffs are secure. That's often only (a
difference of) one or two clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Disciplinary action is still pending against Shupak, but it is
not likely to be as severe as suspension or termination, Thaler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said luck played as big a role in the escape as
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we pointed out, (inmate) Jones had no way of knowing which
recreation yard he would be going to. It was a matter of him being
able to get out of the handcuffs,'' Stringfellow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had he not been able to get out of the handcuffs, he never
would have been able to get out of the recreation yard. Had the
8-inch gap at the top of the chain-link wall not been there, he
would not have been able to climb out of there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the camera pole not been ... so close to the outside
perimeter fence, he would not have been able to scale that and jump
over the fence. So it was a combination of several things, and it
would be hard to point at one single incident or event that caused
it.''

BUDGET OFFICE SAYS CLINTON UNDERESTIMATED COST OF DRUG COVERAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats for all needing; story is now 2 takes)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Congressional Budget Office said Thursday that
President Clinton had grossly underestimated the cost of his
proposal for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dan L. Crippen, director of the budget office, also told
Congress that Clinton had overstated the savings that could be
achieved by his proposals to redesign Medicare and encourage
competition in the traditional fee-for-service program.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton unveiled his drug proposal on June 29, he said it
would cost $118 billion over 10 years. The Congressional Budget
Office says now that the cost would be $168 billion. The budget
office number is higher by $50 billion, or 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate has many political ramifications. It will give
Republicans a reason to support a much more limited Medicare drug
benefit, as Congress is normally obliged to use the cost estimates
from its own budget office.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Michigan on Thursday, Clinton defended his proposal
to offer coverage of prescription drugs to all 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries. He said that 75 percent of elderly Americans
``either have no drug coverage at all, or coverage that is
unstable, unaffordable and rapidly disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress wrestled with the details of Clinton's proposal
Thursday for the first time, as Donna Shalala, the secretary of
Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Finance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and a few Democrats told her they had grave doubts
about the president's proposal. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the
proposal ``will cause an explosion in the cost of the Medicare
program,'' and he suggested that it would make more sense to
provide drug benefits at first to low-income Medicare beneficiaries
with no other drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While criticizing Clinton's proposal, Republicans expressed
sympathy for elderly people struggling with high drug costs _ a
potentially influential group of voters in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., said he intended to ``move ahead very promptly in
September'' with legislation to provide some Medicare drug
benefits. But Roth made clear that his proposal would be less
comprehensive and less costly than Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had said he could save $25 billion over 10 years by
making Medicare more competitive and efficient _ for example, by
steering patients to doctors and hospitals that promise to give the
government deep discounts. The Congressional Budget Office said
these changes would save only $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also boasted that his plan would increase competition
among health maintenance organizations that serve 16 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries. But Roth said it was not ``genuine
competition'' because Medicare's fee-for-service program would not
compete directly with the HMOs on prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office said its estimate of the costs
of prescription drug benefits was higher than the president's for
four reasons. First, the budget office assumes faster growth in
drug spending for the elderly. Second, Crippen said, his office
took account of drug spending for nursing home residents, which the
administration had apparently overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Crippen said, if Medicare starts to cover prescription
drugs, many low-income people will apply for federal assistance in
paying the premiums and other costs normally borne by
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Crippen said, the president wants to hire private
companies to manage drug benefits for the elderly, but he would
restrict their activities so they could not save as much money for
Medicare as they now save for private employers and HMOs.

</P>
<P>
   Crippen said that half of Medicare beneficiaries ``already have
coverage for prescription drugs that is at least as generous as the
coverage offered under the president's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   But on his visit to Lansing, Mich., on Thursday, Clinton said
such coverage was in jeopardy. Employers are reducing retiree
health benefits, and Medicare HMOs are charging more for drug
coverage, while premiums for individual insurance policies to fill
the gaps in Medicare are rising rapidly, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's trip appeared to be an effort to deflect the
criticism implicit in Thursday's testimony by Crippen and another
influential expert, David M. Walker, the new comptroller general of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said Congress should be careful about establishing new
Medicare benefits on the assumption that the federal budget would
run surpluses for the next decade. ``Current projected surpluses
could well prove to be fleeting,'' Walker said, but the new drug
benefits would have a ``permanent claim'' on the federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Under the president's proposal, Medicare would pay half of a
beneficiary's drug expenses, up to a rising limit. The maximum
federal payment would start at $1,000 in 2002 and would increase
gradually to $2,500 in 2008. The president would pay subsidies to
private employers who provide retiree health benefits with drug
coverage at least equivalent to the new Medicare benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader,
said it was ``utterly absurd for us to subsidize employers who are
currently providing this benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, even as senators said that Clinton's plan would
prove too expensive, they said he was not doing enough to protect
sick people with very high drug costs. Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,,
said the president should not worry so much about covering routine
drug expenses, but should help people with ``catastrophic drug
costs.''

   MICROSOFT (Seattle) _ Microsoft is known for conservatism in
predicting financial performance, but President Steve Ballmer
seemed to carry that tendency to new extremes Thursday. Reacting to
an instant poll in which most attendees at a meeting predicted
Microsoft revenues would grow 25 percent or more in the new fiscal
year, Ballmer exclaimed, ``Come on! It's outlandish! It's crazy!''
Ballmer was addressing 300 analysts and journalists at the
company's annual analyst meeting in Seattle.

SPORTS COLUMN: L.T. GLADLY A GUINEA PIG FOR HIS KIDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When he was L.T., the best outside
linebacker ever to play football, he thought of Giants Stadium as
his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew everything about my job,'' he was saying. ``You
couldn't throw anything at me that I didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Lawrence Taylor, in a black warm-up suit, black cap and
black shower clogs, had returned to Giants Stadium to discuss his
pending induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 7 in
Canton, Ohio, and his life outside that office, a life that has
sometimes been so much harder for him to live than for him to sack
a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often Thursday he would mention that he is ``at peace
with myself now,'' that he was involved in film and television
work, that he wanted ``a better family life.'' And when asked if he
might have been as marketable as Michael Jordan if not for his drug
problems, his news conference dissolved into a counselor's couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't care about that,'' he said. ``We all lie in the bed we
make. That's the life I lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that I'm 40 years old and I'm at peace with myself.
It took a long time coming, but who knows what would've happened if
things would've been changed, because money's not what makes me
happy. Things are not what make me happy. Advertising stuff doesn't
make me happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my kids now and I look at other kids. Their families
haven't gone through drugs and stuff like that, and yet their kids
go through it. Yes, I've been through that and my kids are fine and
I talk to them all the time about the problems with it, and so far
I have no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to be the guinea pig in order for them to stay safe
and free of problems, then I'll do that gladly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could've stayed away and changed things and had the great
life and have my kids suffer? No, I would rather have myself suffer
than have somebody else suffer. I'm happy with the way everything
has turned out. I'm very happy. Because if it turned out better for
me, it might've turned out worse for others. I am happy with how it
turned out because it's all just a journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he feel his drug problem was now under control?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know,'' he said. ``I have no idea. The demons come up
every day. You do the best you can. The person who says they got it
under control and they know what exactly is going to happen, they
really don't know what they're talking about. I have it under
control today. I don't know if I'll have it under control
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Did being ``at peace'' with himself include drugs?
</P>
<P>
   ``That includes everything,'' he said. ``I don't say I have no
problems, but I have nothing that stresses me out or have an
anxiety about. I'm no flower child now, but I'm pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's happy that he is able to have his 17-year-old son, T.J., as
his Hall of Fame presenter instead of having to choose between Bill
Parcells, once his Giants coach, or Wellington Mara, the Giants'
co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``T.J.'s mother asked me,'' he said, referring to Linda, his
former wife, who lives in Charlotte, N.C., with T.J. and his two
sisters, Paula and Tanisha. ``I called one day and asked her if I
should ask Bill or Wellington, and she said, `T.J. wants to do it.'
He's already sent me a copy of his speech. He's a quarterback and
linebacker. He's 6-1, 6-2; he's built like I was at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged once having a ``pact'' with Parcells to be his
presenter, but the Jets will be in training camp then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put him in a situation where he would have to
choose between me and his team,'' Taylor said. ``Don't tell him,
but I think Bill should be there.''
</P>
<P>
   By saying that, of course, L.T. had told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not only happy for myself,'' he said of his induction,
``I'm happy for the Giants fans, I'm happy for my family. I didn't
think I was going to be this excited about it, but the closer it
gets, the more excited I'm getting. To see my son up there giving
my induction speech is going to be fun. I think I'll be able to
control my emotions. Of course I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Or will he? Some Hall of Famers who return to Canton each year
are said to hold pools as to which inductee will shed tears first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a better chance of hitting the lottery than see me
cry,'' Lawrence Taylor said firmly. ``If I cry, you can come and
spank me.''

ASHES OF KENNEDY, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW SCATTERED NEAR CRASH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ Between a beach he loved and the site where
his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes
and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to
the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
</P>
<P>
   In a private, closely guarded ceremony aboard a US Navy
destroyer, the remains of Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, her 34-year-old sister, were laid
in the choppy Atlantic Ocean. The ceremony occurred in view of the
shorefront estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, and near where his small plane plunged into the sea last
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the mercies of God, a Roman Catholic priest and two
Navy chaplains presided over a brief, solemn ceremony on the deck
of the USS Briscoe. Meanwhile, three miles away, the USS Grasp, a
Navy salvage ship continued retrieving the wreckage of Kennedy's
shattered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   One to three members at a time, the grieving family members cast
the ashes to the ocean. A Navy brass quintet played, but the
familiar strains of Taps was not heard at this non-military
ceremony rarely allowed on a Navy ship for a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   All along the shoreline of southwestern Martha's Vineyard,
vacationers and Vineyarders, gripped for days by news of Kennedy's
disappearance and the grim discovery of his remains, watched with
the drama from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel devastated,'' said Pat Mutolo, a vacationer from
Rochester, N.Y., whose voice broke with emotion as she watched the
Briscoe's progress. ``I woke up to the news Saturday morning and
said, `Oh, my God.' No family deserves this.''
</P>
<P>
   The service, which concluded nearly a week of intense emotions
after JFK Jr.'s plane was reported missing last Friday, began at
9:30 a.m. as the funeral party, led by Kennedy's uncle, US Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, left the family compound at Hyannis Port for
Woods Hole. There, the Briscoe, a guided-missile destroyer
transported them to the burial site.
</P>
<P>
   The warship moved at a processional pace past the jagged Gay
Head cliffs and the beaches where bits of Kennedy's airplane were
found.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which began shortly before noon, was witnessed by
about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including
Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters'
mother, stepfather and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The party listened as the clergymen conducted the moving ritual
of committing human remains to the sea. Kennedy's sister and uncle
spoke at the somber service, which fulfilled John Kennedy Jr.'s
wishes to be buried at sea _ and away from the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by Coast Guard vessels, the crew of the Briscoe ensured
that privacy in a strictly enforced security zone that kept the
news media, in chartered boats and TV helicopters, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the use of the Briscoe,
which was diverted from maneuvers in the North Atlantic to become
the platform for a nationally riveting funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were recovered
Wednesday afternoon, and their ashes scattered less than 24 hours
after Navy divers lifted the bodies feet from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapid turn of events, hundreds of mourners and the
curious lined the southwest shoreline of Martha's Vineyard from Gay
Head to the wild beaches along Moshup Trail, near the estate that
Kennedy and his sister had inherited from their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cami Stephens of Hyannis, watching the Briscoe return to Woods
Hole, said she wanted to bid farewell to Kennedy, someone she knew
and admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down-to-earth _ someone who'd get coffee up the street,
someone who'd say `Hi,' '' explained Stephens, who said she has
been part of many get-togethers at the compound in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his family ``would make you feel like you were
someone,'' she said. ``This, to me, it's like a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners arrived in Woods Hole about 9:30 a.m. and were
quickly transported to the Briscoe by the Coast Guard vessel
Sanibel. Close to 10 a.m., the Briscoe pulled up anchor and began
its journey around Gay Head in choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:20 a.m., four miles off the southern shore of Martha's
Vineyard, the ship stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crew then completed preparations for a ceremony that lasted
roughly 30 minutes. The service was attended by dozens of Briscoe
crew members outfitted in dress-white uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the mourners returned to Woods Hole at 3:30
p.m. Sen. Kennedy and the funeral party then proceeded to Hyannis
Port for a private reception. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of
assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s
cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a fledgling pilot, was at the controls of a
newly-purchased, high-performance airplane from Fairfield, N.J. to
Martha's Vineyard last Friday just after sunset, en route to a
cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight _ and less than 20
miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport _ Kennedy's plane vanished
from air-traffic control radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Though the exact cause of the crash is not yet known,
authorities believe Kennedy lost control of the single-engine
airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the
murky night sky. The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying
corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision,
aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting
the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast
Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology
government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras,
Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early
Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped
into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have
been sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies
of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette. At 7:15 p.m. that night, the
remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne,
where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard J.
Evans and Dr. James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims'
families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies,
fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid
press or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial Mass for Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette is scheduled
for 11 a.m. Friday at St. Thomas More Church in New York, where
Kennedy's mother often prayed. President and Hillary Clinton plan
to attend. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette is set for 7 p.m.
Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.

GOLDSTEIN UNANIMOUS PICK AS CHANCELLOR OF CUNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The trustees of the City University of New York
unanimously chose a new chancellor Thursday who has the strong
support of Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and
pledged that they and the politicians would step back and let him
grapple with the huge problems facing CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing the new chancellor, Matthew Goldstein, are
many of the same ones faced by public universities across the
United States and range from a bare-bones budget to the fractious
issue of how to deal with students in need of remedial instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge by the trustees to avoid micromanaging was in stark
contrast to their actions over the last two years, during which
they, with the encouragement of the governor and the mayor,
dictated policy changes in such areas as remedial education and
student testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the board was intrusive is that it did not have a
strong person as chancellor,'' said John J. Calandra, one of the
trustees pressing most strongly for change. ``I think people will
be very deferential to Matt. He's our guy. We picked him. If he
looks good, we look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the trustees, the mayor and the governor will make good
on such assurances _ and stop their constant stop public criticism
of the university _ could determine whether CUNY can shake its
problems and begin to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, for example, said earlier this year that he believed
CUNY should be ``blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goldstein said Thursday that he had personally been given
assurances by both officials that ``they wanted to see effective
leadership and that they thought that the board, with a new
chancellor, was configured in a way that that could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday evening, Goldstein expressed his
agreement with many of the changes called for in the recent, highly
critical report by the mayor's task force on CUNY, including the
need to reorganize the university.
</P>
<P>
   But he also made it clear that he is his own man. He said he had
some differences _ though he did not specify them Thursday _ with
the board's policy that students needing remediation will be barred
from bachelor's degree programs beginning next January.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Goldstein said, ``CUNY should
continue to remediate.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he did not believe the board's policy should be
put in place before the unreliable tests that are now being used to
determine who needs remedial tests are replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, 57, who was raised on Manhattan's Lower East Side and
was the first in his family to attend college, also said he
deplored some of the recent attacks on CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussion has to move from the ill-preparedness of
students and their dropout rates and all the other things that give
the perception of CUNY as a Third World university,'' he said in an
interview. ``You know it's not true, and I know it's not true, but
we need to shift the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is known not just for his managerial skills but for
his insider's knowledge of a university that has been his home for
much of his adult life: He was a student at City College, president
of CUNY's research foundation, acting vice chancellor for academic
affairs for the university and a dean and president at Baruch. For
the last year, he has been president of Adelphi University in
Garden City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But the system he takes over presents by far the greatest
challenge of any of these assignments. It is the nation's largest
urban university _ a sprawling system of 17 undergraduate colleges,
several graduate schools and 200,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   And he takes charge at a difficult time. CUNY's reputation is in
tatters. Its budget has been slashed. Its full-time faculty has
aged and been cut to less than half of what it was in the '70s.
Morale is in the basement. Giuliani's task force on CUNY, headed by
Benno C. Schmidt Jr., recently pronounced it ``a university
adrift.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the same day that a Navy destroyer scattered the
ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law off the
coast of Martha's Vineyard, more than a thousand of New Yorkers
gathered for a memorial service at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, one
of the most important churches for the city's sizable Irish
community.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by Irish and American flags, a dozen bagpipers filed
into St. Patrick's Old Cathedral as the soaring stone walls echoed
the wail of Gaelic hymns. Inside the 164-year-old cathedral in
lower Manhattan, people fanned themselves with green-colored
programs as others dabbed their eyes with handkerchiefs. Outside on
Mott Street, hundreds of others who could not fit inside stood
silently behind police barriers and listened to the Irish music,
biblical psalms coming from inside church on speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the private service that will be held Friday at the
Church of St. Thomas More, on Manhattan's upper East Side, there
were no celebrities or politicians at Thursday night's service.
Many, like Wilma Silva, an administrative assistant from Brooklyn,
were working people who said they were drawn to the memorial by a
need to share their grief with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is closure for me,'' said Ms. Silva, 30, who until
Wednesday when divers located their bodies, held out hope that
Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette would be
found alive. Growing up in New York, Ms. Silva said she felt an
indescribable bond with Kennedy, and she has kept a scrapbook with
photographs of him cut from magazines since she was a child. ``I
just felt so close to him'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many mourners said they considered Kennedy one of their own, a
true New Yorker who managed to be both princely and down-to-earth.
Kenneth Howze, 41, from Harlem said he came because he wanted to
pay respect to a man who, in a small way, showed him respect years
earlier. As a teen-ager, Howze said he met Kennedy in Manhattan's
Riverside Park when they were introduced by a mutual friend. Years
later, when he spotted Kennedy on the street, Howze stopped him and
asked if he remembered their earlier meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he did and described the exact situation,'' Howze
said. ``I was really moved by the fact that a president's son would
remember a black man from Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd were many Irish-Americans who described the
Kennedy clan as family. Olivia Fitzsimons, 51, a skin-care
specialist from the East Village, said that in many homes a picture
of President John F. Kennedy hangs beside that of the pope and the
Virgin Mary. ``The Kennedys are just part of us,'' Ms. Fitzsimons
said. ``After his father died, we followed everything that John
John did.''
</P>
<P>
   George and Mary Gibbons were among the scores of people who came
too late to get inside the cathedral. As she stood outside
listening to the bagpipes, Mrs. Gibbons began to weep as she spoke
about the younger Kennedy and his death. She said her home in
Queens was filled with Kennedy memorabilia including a tea set and
a salt and pepper shakers emblazoned with the Kennedy children.
``This is such a big loss for us,'' she said. ``They grew up
alongside our kids, we followed his every step.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those who said that they were surprised by how
strongly they reacted to Kennedy's death. Bethany Bowles, 28, a
graphic designer who lives in lower Manhattan said she had not
planned on coming to the memorial but was drawn inside when she saw
the crowd gathering on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange but I've been thinking about their death all day
long,''s he said as her eyes welled with tears. ``I guess I could
relate to John F. Kennedy Jr. as a young person who had so much
promise.''

BRADLEY BACKS BAN ON SOFT MONEY, CHIDES BUSH, GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
characterized large campaign contributions Thursday as corrosive to
American politics and chided Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush for criticizing unregulated donations to political
parties while encouraging their use in the 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed a series of campaign finance reforms Thursday,
including a ban on soft money, but the former U.S. senator from New
Jersey also said he would not accept the No. 2 spot on the
Democratic ticket if Vice President Al Gore wins the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifeblood of democracy and politics is trust ... but
nothing breaks down trust in democracy as powerfully and surely as
money,'' said Bradley, who has raised $11.7 million this year in
his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said if he wins the Democratic nomination he will direct
the party during the general election not to spend soft money _
unregulated contributions primarily from unions and corporations
that can be used to help candidates indirectly. While political
parties are allowed to raise and spend soft money, candidates
cannot do so.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley criticized Gore and Bush, the Republican front-runner,
for urging a ban on all soft money while at the same time plotting
how to use it. ``Both have said they support changing the soft
money system,'' Bradley said. ``However, both reportedly have
directed their top fund-raisers to begin raising soft money for the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore aide said his campaign staff is focused on raising money
for the primary campaign and has no role in deciding how the
Democratic Party spends its funds. At the same time, deputy
campaign manager Stacie Spector said Gore will not follow Bradley's
lead and direct party officials not to raise and spend soft money
in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ``suggestion would leave the Democratic Party at the
mercy of the Republican money machine,'' Spector said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush takes a similar
position regarding soft-money expenditures. ``He believes that
individuals have the right to express themselves in our American
democracy,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   During a sold-out speech to the National Press Club, Bradley was
asked if he would accept an invitation to be Gore's vice
presidential running mate if Gore wins the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley answered, ``Uh, no,'' before moving to the next
question.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to banning soft money contributions, Bradley called
for same-day voter registration, requiring employers to allow
workers two hours off to vote, increasing public financing of
campaigns, and providing free television time for major party
candidates. The proposals go far beyond those embraced by the
Clinton-Gore administration and awaiting action by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, another contender for the
Republican presidential nomination and a principal sponsor of
legislation to ban soft money, applauded Bradley for calling
attention to the issue and took up his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have promised in the past that I will refuse to engage in
the use of soft money if I am my party's nominee for president,''
said McCain, whose bill so far has been blocked from debate by GOP
congressional leaders. ``I challenge the other presidential
candidates, both Democrat and Republican, to make the same
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore decline to accept money from special-interest
groups allied as political action committees, or PACs. Bush, who
raised a record $37.3 million in the first half of the year,
accepts any donations allowed by law, including PAC contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of June, Gore raised about $19.5 million and
reported having $9.3 million of that on hand. Bradley reported
raising $11.7 million with about $7.5 million of that still in the
bank June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley's relative financial parity with the vice
president appeared to make him a viable alternative for the
Democratic nomination, he still trails in national polls. Gore
leads the race for the nomination by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after his speech, Bradley appeared at a Washington
fund-raiser for his campaign. The former New York Knicks star
basketball player is scheduled to attend five fund-raising dinners
on Long Island over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   While campaign aides coordinate Bradley's fund-raising efforts,
almost two dozen business leaders are helping with the effort. A
list provided by Bradley of his ``advisory board members'' include
several chief executive officers from the sports industry. Among
them are Abe Pollin, owner of the Washington Wizards; John J.
Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres; Donald L. Dell, president of
the sports-marketing firm ProServ; and Lawrence Lucchino, president
of the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Also guiding Bradley's fund-raising are Howard Schultz, CEO of
the Starbucks coffee chain; John H. Bryan, CEO of Sara Lee Corp.;
Louis B. Susman, managing director of Salomon Brothers; Thomas
Labrecque, former president of Chase Manhattan Corp.; Washington
lobbyist Terry Bracy; Bonnie Reiss, a New York attorney; and
Mellody Hobson, senior vice president of Ariel Capital Management.

 S.F. CREDIT CARD FIRM ADMITS BILLING ERRORS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Credit card giant Providian Financial said Thursday
that a computer glitch caused it to levy improper late payment
charges against thousands of customers, its first admission that
some consumer complaints lodged against it were valid.
<P>
   The San Francisco company, the nation's ninth-largest credit
card issuer, set aside $20 million to cover customer refunds and
issued a statement expressing ``regret'' over ``inconvenience to
our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Providian said it charged improper late fees in about 700,000
cases out of 90 million payments received over the past 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's statement came two months after The Chronicle and
KRON-TV reported that the company was the subject of hundreds of
consumer complaints and an investigation by the San Francisco
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed, accusing
the company of unfair business practices. Thursday, attorneys
representing Providian customers said the company's actions
bolstered their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime a defendant takes subsequent remedial action, that's
an admission of liability,'' said San Diego attorney Phillip
Schuman, whose case was one of eight suits against Providian
recently combined in California state courts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the alleged abuses most frequently cited by consumers _
and a key focus of the district attorney's probe _ was Providian's
apparent habit of charging $29 late fees in cases when payments
actually arrived on time.
</P>
<P>
   Other complaints accuse the company of using misleading
techniques to sell customers services of questionable value, such
as credit protection or auto club memberships. Providian has said
it made all disclosures required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's statement Thursday ``seems to validate some of the
claims against them,'' said Michael Hughes, a San Francisco stock
analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Late in May, following an avalanche of bad publicity and a 30
percent plunge in its stock price, Providian hired the accounting
firm Ernst and Young to examine its payment-processing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But until Thursday, the company had not admitted that its own
procedures might have been at fault.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement prepared for reporters last May, the company
pointed its finger at the postal system. Late-fee complaints
``happen primarily because customers underestimate how long it
takes the U.S. Postal Service to deliver their payment,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the company backtracked. ``Providian is absolutely
committed to customer satisfaction, and that includes taking full
responsibility when we make a mistake,'' said Konrad Alt, the
company's newly hired chief public policy officer.
</P>
<P>
   Providian officials said it was they, not Ernst and Young, who
discovered the late-fee error. They said they traced the problem to
a software programming error made in October 1997. The bad code
acted up only in special cases _ mainly during three-day holiday
weekends, when payments were due by Monday, received over the
weekend but not processed until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem also surfaced when payments received over the
weekend could not all be processed on Monday and had to be carried
over to the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Payments are supposed to be credited not on the day they are
processed but on the day they physically arrive, even if that is
not a regular business day. Providian said it duly credited the
payments as of the arrival dates. But its software recognized the
Tuesday processing date, not the arrival date, and imposed a late
fee.
</P>
<P>
   The company has fixed the errant computer code, and officials
said they are confident they have solved late-fee problems.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman, the attorney representing Providian customers, said the
company's $20 million reserve was not enough to cover what it owes
customers for improper late charges as well as fees charged
incorrectly for exceeding credit limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom would call this a spit in the ocean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuman said he doubted Providian's actions would slow the San
Francisco district attorney's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will have no mitigating effect with the D.A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the district attorney's office declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's willingness to refund late fees stands in contrast
to what was, until recently, a hard line.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen company employees contacted by The Chronicle
in recent weeks said the company pressured them to deny requests
for fee reversals. Such reversals generally had to be approved by
supervisors who were evaluated, in part, on their record of keeping
fees in place.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's Alt denied that the company had a system of
rewarding employees when they did not reverse late fees.
</P>
<P>
   Employees said the fast-growing company was swamped by a heavy
volume of payments, which overwhelmed processing capacity and
created chronic backlogs.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after reports surfaced of consumer abuses, Providian
announced what it called an ``enhanced customer satisfaction
program,'' including commitments to reverse late fees on customer
requests and offer two-day grace periods past regular due dates
before levying charges.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's statement on late fees appeared in its regular
second-quarter earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its net income soared to $126.5 million, up 101
percent from the same period in 1998. During the three months ended
in June, it opened more than 1.1 million accounts, an increase of
more than 10 percent from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based revenue, which includes late charges, shot up 127
percent from the year before to $494.7 million. Investors reacted
euphorically to the profit report, driving the company's shares up
$6.50 to $99.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management successfully boxed off the distractions from the
people who operate the business,'' said Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown
analyst Mark Alpert.

NAVY DEFENDS USE OF RESOURCES IN KENNEDY RECOVERY, BURIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy played an extraordinary role in the
recovery and burial at sea of John F. Kennedy Jr., deploying
hundreds of crew members and two of its finest vessels to a mission
almost never ordered for veterans or military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 members of the military and their children are buried
at sea each year. But they are buried en masse, their ashes
scattered during normal naval exercises, without their families on
board, a Navy official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Navy transported Kennedy family members
Thursday to the ocean burial site aboard the USS Briscoe. The
destroyer, which costs the Pentagon approximately $87,000 a day to
run, had been directed to Massachusetts from the Virginia shore the
night before. In addition two Navy chaplains were flown in, after
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen agreed to a request from Senator
Edward M. Kennedy and the family of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and
her sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the cost of the Navy's involvement could run as high
as $400,000, according estimates by military analysts and a General
Accounting Office report listing annual expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lieutenant Commander Irene Smith said the event was ``not
unprecedented.'' Under Navy rules, children of military personnel
or ``other US citizens who are determined eligible . . . due to
notable service or outstanding contributions to the United States''
can be granted permission for burial at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy qualified, according to a Pentagon statement, not only
because his father was president and a World War II Navy hero, but
also because Kennedy's own ``contributions to his country are both
notable and outstanding.'' The statement cited his role as head of
Reaching Up, a nonprofit group that assists people who work with
the disabled, and his role on the President's Commission on Mental
Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, officials were hard-pressed to recall Naval
participation in a ceremony such as Thursday's, in which none of
the deceased had served in the military or held elected office.
Analysts also said the Navy's three-day role in the search and
recovery far exceeded normal practices, except when the accident
involves a military plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite unusual,'' said retired Admiral Eugene Carroll, who
spent 37 years as a Navy pilot. ``General aviation pilots crash all
the time, and they don't go diving for submerged wrecks. That's
almost unheard of. If there hadn't been direct directions from the
White House, this would not have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Navy spokeswoman, also said it was highly irregular
for a ship's course to be altered for a funeral. Under normal
circumstances, she said, Navy officials ``will not get a ship
underway just for a burial, because of fuel constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of money to get the ship underway,'' she said.
``This was a request from Senator Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton earlier defended extending the time period for
recovering Kennedy's plane ``because of the role of the Kennedy
family in our national lives and because of the enormous losses
they have sustained in our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am,'' Clinton said at a news conference Wednesday. The
USS Grasp, the Navy salvage ship that was brought off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on Monday to retrieve the plane and the victims,
was believed to be returning to Virginia later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore Thursday defended Clinton's decision to
extend the Coast Guard search, saying it was appropriate given the
Kennedy family's connection to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was clearly the right thing to do,'' Gore said in
an interview with WMUR-TV in New Hampshire. ``If it had not been
done, there would have been a lot more criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Thursday that although the Defense secretary
directed the destroyer to be used for the Kennedy funeral, the
``impact on the operational schedule of the Briscoe was minimal.''
The ship, which carries 300 sailors and 26 officers, sailed from
the waters off Virginia on Wednesday afternoon and is scheduled to
return there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship was going to be at sea anyway,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Bacon also confirmed that the military has been forced
to cut back its participation in veterans' funerals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many veterans once received a military detail at their
funerals _ such as having two soldiers present to fold an American
flag and a third to play ``Taps'' on the bugle _ the Pentagon is
now ``not able to provide full teams,'' Bacon said. Army Lieutenant
Colonel Tom Begines also said it is an ``increasing strain to
provide honors,'' primarily because of a lack of resources and the
growing number of older veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the ship off Martha's Vineyard, that would pay for a
lot of buglers for a lot of people who've done a lot more for their
country,'' said John Pike, a defense analyst for the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington. Pike's father, who was in World
War II and the Korean war, died several weeks ago and was denied a
bugle player at his funeral by the Army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not raised the subject of reimbursement by the
Kennedy family, and does not break out the costs of its ships per
day. An associate of the Kennedy family said Thursday night that
the family had not discussed paying the military, but would make a
reimbursement if there is an appropriate way to do so.
</P>
<P>
   To many, payment hardly seemed appropriate, or necessary. ``Most
people, except Kennedy-haters, can't even understand the
question,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a grateful nation does. We don't bury James Dean
or Elvis Presley, but we haven't had many presidents assassinated,
and I think we should feel some special responsibility,'' Hess
said. ``I think it's just plain an exception to the rule, something
the nation chooses to wink at because of the uniqueness of the
situation. You don't write rules or regulations for a situation
this unique.''

 PAYBACK TIME _ ENTREPRENEUR TRAINS YOUTHS FOR TELECOM JOBS  &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ A year ago, Frank Tucker's telecommunications
company was perched in an Oakland, Calif., business incubator where
Tucker took advantage of all the freebies he could get. Free
accounting services. Pro bono legal advice. You name it.
<P>
   Tucker, who spent 20 years in the marketing departments of AT&AMP;T,
New York Telephone and Pacific Bell, was convinced that
deregulation of the telecommunications industry was creating
opportunities for startups like his to land lucrative contracts
rewiring older buildings and equipping telephone company central
offices to meet the needs of new competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Tucker Technology Inc. is out of the incubator and
comfortably lodged in the classic Central Building in downtown
Oakland. Tucker expects his company to have revenues of $5 million
this year generated by its 75 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker attributes the firm's success to three things:
deregulation's many opportunities, an appetite for hard work, and
an ability to forge partnerships with community organizations that
train the people he can put to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people complain they &LR;   &LR; can't get trained workers,''
Tucker said. ``I see all the human resources this industry needs
hanging out on street corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Laney College in Oakland, Women's Economic Agenda Project in
Oakland and Capital Commitment in Washington, D.C., are three of
Tucker's valued partners. All teach students, often from low-income
neighborhoods, to become telecommunications technicians and move up
from minimum-wage jobs to something more promising.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker takes entry-level workers, starts them at double the
minimum wage and tries to move them up to $25-an-hour positions
with the help of on-the-job training from retired Pacific Bell
employees like Art Cravanas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Pacific Bell, you learned one job and did it for
20 to 30 years,'' said Cravanas, Tucker's field manager. ``Here,
you see it all and do it all. It's made me excited about work
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-year-old Jonathan Harden started with Tucker after
completing the three-month cable technician training at Laney
College. He tried to get a job with Pacific Bell but it wasn't
hiring. Tucker took him on as an intern in April, paying him $10 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up to $14 now,'' Harden said with evident pride. ``I love
the work because I'm doing different things every day, working with
good people and using my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also finds good employees through Capital Commitment,
which supplements the technical training it offers with classes
that teach the basics of the work world, such as what your boss
expects, how to get along with difficult co-workers and how to
handle your paychecks. In fact, he likes the organization so much
that he sits on the nonprofit organization's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Boykin, president of Capital Commitment, said his
organization is involved in the welfare-to-work population and
knows it isn't enough to just get people jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to help them figure out how to go from public
assistance to a $35,000-a-year job and make the most of it,'' he
said. ``It's not enough to make money. You need to manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said his firm has leveraged off the successes of his
partners. He's also worked closely with the biggest
telecommunications union, the Communications Workers of America.
All of his positions are union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud when I take an entry-level person and put them in a
job with a union card and a career,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Long-Scott, executive director of Women's Economic Agenda
Project, says her nonprofit group's mission ``is not to train
people for dead-end jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her clients are single, working mothers living in West
Oakland, where the median income is around $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Frank has done is exemplary,'' says Long-Scott. ``It's
what these big Silicon Valley companies should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who grew up in the Bronx, said the best role model he
ever had was his father. His father worked in the garment industry
in lower Manhattan. Eventually, the senior Tucker saved enough
money to open his own factory, partnering with a friend who ran the
local luncheonette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned more watching my father go to work at 5 in the
morning and return home at 8 o'clock at night than I ever learned
in my MBA program,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of TUCKER23 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  From time to time, Tucker thinks about moving east, where his
biggest clients _ Lucent Technology, Nortel and AT&AMP;T _ are located.
Lucent even offered him free office space in Atlanta. But he's
committed to staying in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I crawled into that incubator, and I ran out,'' Tucker said.
``It would be unfair of me to leave town now.''

the disabled, and his role on the President's Commission on Mental
Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, officials were hard-pressed to recall Naval
participation in a ceremony such as Thursday's, in which none of
the deceased had served in the military or held elected office.
Analysts also said the Navy's three-day role in the search and
recovery far exceeded normal practices, except when the accident
involves a military plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite unusual,'' said retired Admiral Eugene Carroll, who
spent 37 years as a Navy pilot. ``General aviation pilots crash all
the time, and they don't go diving for submerged wrecks. That's
almost unheard of. If there hadn't been direct directions from the
White House, this would not have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the Navy spokeswoman, also said it was highly irregular
for a ship's course to be altered for a funeral. Under normal
circumstances, she said, Navy officials ``will not get a ship
underway just for a burial, because of fuel constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of money to get the ship underway,'' she said.
``This was a request from Senator Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton earlier defended extending the time period for
recovering Kennedy's plane ``because of the role of the Kennedy
family in our national lives and because of the enormous losses
they have sustained in our lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at
fault _ I am,'' Clinton said at a news conference Wednesday. The
USS Grasp, the Navy salvage ship that was brought off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard on Monday to retrieve the plane and the victims,
was believed to be returning to Virginia later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore Thursday defended Clinton's decision to
extend the Coast Guard search, saying it was appropriate given the
Kennedy family's connection to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was clearly the right thing to do,'' Gore said in
an interview with WMUR-TV in New Hampshire. ``If it had not been
done, there would have been a lot more criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said Thursday that although the Defense secretary
directed the destroyer to be used for the Kennedy funeral, the
``impact on the operational schedule of the Briscoe was minimal.''
The ship, which carries 300 sailors and 26 officers, sailed from
the waters off Virginia on Wednesday afternoon and is scheduled to
return there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship was going to be at sea anyway,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Bacon also confirmed that the military has been forced
to cut back its participation in veterans' funerals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas many veterans once received a military detail at their
funerals _ such as having two soldiers present to fold an American
flag and a third to play ``Taps'' on the bugle _ the Pentagon is
now ``not able to provide full teams,'' Bacon said. Army Lieutenant
Colonel Tom Begines also said it is an ``increasing strain to
provide honors,'' primarily because of a lack of resources and the
growing number of older veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the ship off Martha's Vineyard, that would pay for a
lot of buglers for a lot of people who've done a lot more for their
country,'' said John Pike, a defense analyst for the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington. Pike's father, who was in World
War II and the Korean war, died several weeks ago and was denied a
bugle player at his funeral by the Army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has not raised the subject of reimbursement by the
Kennedy family, and does not break out the costs of its ships per
day. An associate of the Kennedy family said Thursday night that
the family had not discussed paying the military, but would make a
reimbursement if there is an appropriate way to do so.
</P>
<P>
   To many, payment hardly seemed appropriate, or necessary. ``Most
people, except Kennedy-haters, can't even understand the
question,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what a grateful nation does. We don't bury James Dean
or Elvis Presley, but we haven't had many presidents assassinated,
and I think we should feel some special responsibility,'' Hess
said. ``I think it's just plain an exception to the rule, something
the nation chooses to wink at because of the uniqueness of the
situation. You don't write rules or regulations for a situation
this unique.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday
warned anew about euphoric stock markets and promised to act
``promptly and forcefully'' to prevent any revival of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He then infuriated some House Republicans by characterizing
their drive for a huge, immediate tax cut as premature and
economically unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street quickly interpreted Greenspan's testimony to the
House Banking Committee as a warning that the Fed's Open Market
Committee is more likely to raise interest rates, possibly as early
as its next meeting in August but almost certainly by October
unless the economy slows from its current robust pace.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments ``left little doubt that he is nervous
about inflation risks in the United States,'' said Michael Moran,
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged from its high
for the day by more than 100 points after Greenspan began talking,
rallied a bit before the close, ending down 33.56 points at
10,969.22. But the broader market _ particularly growth-oriented
technology stocks _ fell much more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   And the bond market, which is extremely sensitive to the
potential for Fed action, tumbled as the rate on the 30-year
Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,
climbed to 5.96 percent from its close of 5.90 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In answering questions from lawmakers, the Fed chairman hedged
his comments somewhat, acknowledging that there is no evidence yet
of inflation's imminent return. But his prepared remarks, which
express the views of the entire group of Fed policy-makers, were
more hawkish than many had expected and suggested that the Fed's
modest recent increase in short-term interest rates will not
necessarily be its last.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed nudged rates higher by one quarter of a percentage
point on June 30, it adopted a ``neutral stance'' on the future
direction of interest rates. But that position, Greenspan now made
clear, did not preclude the Fed from acting as soon as it sees
imbalances emerging in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and
price increases will be picking up,'' Greenspan said, ``the Federal
Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman also expressed worries about the level of the
stock market, and in a more muted version of his now-famous
comments in 1996 about ``irrational exuberance,'' he talked about
the risks of euphoria that exceeds any reasonable assessment of
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity
prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future
become relatively small,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street was focused on Greenspan's comments on the
likelihood of another rise in short-term interest rates, Washington
was focused on his unusually clear warning to Republicans about
their plan for a $792 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. The
subject came up time and time again, and Greenspan's message was
stern: Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying hold off for a while,'' Greenspan said just two
hours before the House approved the tax bill. ``And I'm saying that
because the timing is not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan urged Congress to pay down the debt and delay any tax
cut until the economy begins to turn down. ``The business cycle is
not dead,'' he warned, telling lawmakers that whenever an economic
slowdown hits, ``a significant tax cut'' may be needed to ward off
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was quick to add, as he has many times before, that
tax cuts are preferable to increased spending. Republicans have
often cited this in support of their plan, saying that to leave a
surplus hanging around in Washington is to invite spending binges.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman openly disagreed with Republicans like Rep.
Merril Cook of Utah, who asked ``what's wrong with moving down that
path simultaneously'' _ that is, paying down the $5.6 billion
national debt and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan responded that tax cuts should wait until the debt is
clearly shrinking. ``Once we know we really have got it locked in
place,'' he said, and ``if we are not being confronted with large
number of spending programs which try to eat up the surplus, I
think at that point we can basically focus on getting important tax
cuts in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, Greenspan was siding with the White House,
Democrats in the House and a small number of moderate Republicans
who have argued that the tax cut passed Thursday is too big and too
soon. And no sooner were the words out of his mouth than some
Democrats were repeating them on the floor of the House, in last
minute, unsuccessful arguments against the tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point _ I don't know when that going to be _ this
economy is going to slow down and perhaps slow down quite
significantly,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I would suspect that a significant tax cut,
mainly of marginal tax rates and capital gains tax rates, might be
a very useful and timely vehicle to sustain an economy which is
otherwise weakening.''
</P>
<P>
   The markets shrugged off Greenspan's longer-term predictions of
slowdown, however, and focused instead on his assessment of whether
the Fed would move pre-emptively to slowdown the economy. ``Most of
the time we can't be pre-emptive because, as I point out in my
remarks, the future is opaque,'' said Greenspan, who is widely
considered an expert on opacity.
</P>
<P>
   On monetary policy, Greenspan ran through the familiar litany of
potential problems that could fuel inflation: A slowdown in the
growth of productivity improvements, continued labor shortages,
rising oil prices. But he stopped short of saying that he saw an
immediate threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal projections that we make with respect to what the
economy will be doing in the longer run requires that we have a
very firm judgment on what the long-term productivity growth is,''
he said. ``And I would submit at the moment we don't have that good
a judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he would be paying particularly close attention
to the next report on job growth in the economy, which is due in
early August, and to changes in commodity prices, which can be a
useful indicator of early price pressures and the strength of
industrial activity.
</P>
<P>
   He also downplayed the risks of weakness in the global economy,
saying that fears last year that prompted the Fed to cut rates in
the fall have eased considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan's testimony,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at
Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, ``suggests that he believes there is
a high probability that interest rates will need to rise further to
contain future inflation.''

CONNECTICUT SEEKS EVIDENCE IN PATRIOTS STADIUM DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Still smarting from the New England Patriots' decision
to abort their move to Hartford, Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal has asked Governor Paul Cellucci to turn over
all documents that could show Beacon Hill was secretly negotiating
with team officials to keep the Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who has threatened to sue the Patriots for millions
of dollars, is searching for evidence that team owner Robert Kraft
was double dealing despite being contractually bound to negotiate
exclusively with Connecticut until the $375 million stadium deal
was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Blumenthal sent Freedom of Information Act
requests to Cellucci, Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, several
Cabinet members and the town of Foxborough, apparently focusing his
search on a memo that stadium consultant Rizzo &AMP; Associates sent to
the State House updating officials on infrastructure costs along
Route 1.
</P>
<P>
   However, team counsel Daniel Goldberg of Bingham Dana said the
Patriots had no involvement in requesting the memo, which the
consultant produced in response to a request from state officials
for an update on possible infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots were in no way involved in getting Rizzo &AMP;
Associates to update their information. Rizzo had done work on the
old stadium plans, obviously they were the choice for the state to
turn to for information,'' Goldberg said. ``They weren't requested
to do it by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pressing ahead with our investigation,'' he said
Thursday. ``We've reached no conclusion about whether we will take
legal action and we will reach a conclusion only after consulting
with the governor (John Rowland) and reviewing all the results of
this document request and other measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said his office has already obtained documents from a
variety of sources, including ``participants in the discussions.''
He declined to elaborate. It is unclear whether they were
Connecticut officials or the leadership team from Massachusetts
state government, Foxborough and the National Football League who
came up with a counter stadium offer, winning back the Patriots
with $70 million for infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be more specific about the sources,''
Blumenthal added. ``We have evidence that would support a number of
theories that could lead to legal claims against the NFL, the
Patriots, and others. But we're not at this point ruling out any
defendants or claims or confirming any.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the development pact the team signed with Rowland, the
Patriots agreed to negotiate with no one else while contractually
bound to the Connecticut deal. If the team broke that agreement, it
would be subject to a $2 million penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft decided to stay in Foxborough when it appeared the
Hartford site could not be be cleared of a steam plant and
contaminants in time for a 2001 stadium opening _ an excuse that
let the Patriots walk away from the lucrative deal without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal suspects more may have been going on behind the
scenes and believes it was too convenient that Massachusetts had
its own stadium offer waiting when Kraft rejected the Hartford
plan.
</P>
<P>
   He may seek ``more than $2 million'' in damages from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say whether it would be significantly more or not,''
Blumenthal added. ``But it would seek to cover all our damages,
including fees and expenses that we paid, as well as opportunity
costs, economic injury.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Connecticut will probably reach a conclusion on whether
to pursue a lawsuit within a couple months.
</P>
<P>
   However, Goldberg said he doubts the attorney general will find
any evidence of double dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to find a basis for liabilty and the
development agreement made it very clear what rights the Patriots
had to make a decision not to go forward,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer said the governor's legal
office will be handling the FOI request and denied that
Massachusetts had any inappropriate contact with the team while it
was still locked into the Connecticut agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that they're going to take steps and
pursue every avenue they can,'' Hoffer said. ``However, the fact
remains, we were not having any negotiations with the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL declined to comment on the suit.

WOMAN FOUND SLAIN, APPARENTLY RAPED, IN CENTRAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 39-year-old woman who appeared to have been
sexually assaulted was found slain Thursday atop a hill in the
northern tip of Central Park, with her head badly beaten and some
of her clothes ripped from her body, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Susan Fuchs, had been living in a small,
assisted-living shelter in Harlem for people with mental illnesses,
law enforcement officials said. Her body was found before 11 a.m.
in a clearing atop the Great Hill, a dense, wooded area about 150
feet into the park from West Drive near 107th Street, said
Assistant Chief William Taylor, the commander of Manhattan
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was lying on her back, partially clothed, with blunt
trauma to the right side of the head,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that they believed that the attack occurred
sometime between 2 a.m., when several neighbors said that they had
heard a woman's scream but failed to call police, and 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neighbors, Cynthia Torres, said that she was awakened
shortly after 2 a.m. in her Central Park West apartment by what
sounded like a woman's screams. ``It was a cacophony of screams,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to her window, she said, she saw a man walking
down Central Park West rubbing his hands and shouting profanities.
Ms. Torres did not say why she did not call police. Thursday, she
gave her account to detectives who were canvassing the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Several other witnesses also told the detectives of hearing
screams, and one said the she had seen Ms. Fuchs in a heated
quarrel with a man she apparently knew shortly before 2 a.m., an
investigator said. Some investigators believe those were the
screams neighbors heard.
</P>
<P>
   But until an autopsy is performed Friday, it will be impossible
to tell what time Ms. Fuchs was killed, and whether what Ms. Torres
heard was the fatal attack. Among other things, pathologists will
try to determine whether the sexual contact took place before,
during or after the attack, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fuchs' body was discovered by a man, who then alerted a
Parks Department employee, who called police, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night whether Ms. Fuchs had been the
victim of a random attack or killed by someone she knew,
investigators said, but several detectives working on the case said
they were leaning toward the theory that she was killed by someone
she knew, noting that a witness told police of seeing her arguing
with a man sometime between midnight and 2 a.m., an investigator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also found an orange-juice container with a bloody
fingerprint on it, two investigators said. And while police believe
Ms. Fuchs was probably attacked with a rock, an investigator said
that there was so much blood at the scene that they had not yet
found which rock, if any, was used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the body in Central Park _ which, despite being
statistically one of the safest areas in the city tends to garner
great publicity when crimes occur there _ touched off an intense
police investigation and manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Ms. Fuchs was often seen in the park near the
spot where she died.

COMMENTARY: TICK, TOCK, TICK ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This column, eliminated earlier, is now restored.) 
(mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You couldn't make this up. Prime Minister Ehud Barak's favorite
hobby is repairing old watches. It is so fitting, because if Barak
has to juggle anything these days it is the multiple clocks ticking
away in the Middle East _ some of which are of the innocent cuckoo
variety and others of which have dynamite attached. The Israeli
leader's tenure could well be titled ``Beat the Clocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak raised a lot of expectations during his Washington visit
that he will do just that. He raised those expectations not by
promising to give away the store. Indeed, he will be a tough
negotiator. No, he raised expectations by his approach and
demeanor, which he rightly made clear will be in stark contrast to
his predecessor's. He made clear that he is ready to treat the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as a real partner, even going so
far as to call Arafat from Washington to brief him on the talks
with President Clinton; he made clear that he is going to treat his
Arab negotiating partners with respect, not contempt; and he made
clear that he is thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   How big? Barak indicated to the president that he wants to
resolve the Palestinian refugee issue once and for all, by getting
enough money to settle those who cannot return in their host
countries; he indicated he wants to settle the water issues once
and for all, by securing big investments in desalination. He
indicated a desire to make big concessions on the Golan Heights for
a big peace with Syria. In sum, Barak made clear to the president
that if Israel is going to withdraw from land, it should be to end
the conflict once and for all, not postpone it. Clinton told Barak
that if he is ready to do such big things, he should do them early
in his term.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's timing is not the only factor. There are other
clocks that will have to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the biological clocks of Yasser Arafat and
Hafez al-Assad. Both men are ill. Will either live long enough to
negotiate the sort of big deals _ and big compromises _ that Barak
is talking about, and also institute them? It isn't clear yet how
much compromising Arafat and Assad are up for, but whatever they
can give will be more than their successors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Iran clock. There are two bookends to the
Middle East _ Egypt on one side with about 60 million people, and
Iran on the other side with about 60 million people. The Iranian
bookend is splintering, and it could scatter a lot of regional
instability if it really falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one cannot forget the Iraq clock. Saddam Hussein is
clearly racing to acquire weapons of mass destruction. Will he come
up with one in the next couple of years, and what sort of havoc
might he wreak around the region if he does?
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget the Clinton-Gore clock. The president has 17
months to go in his term. Barak is counting on him to come up with
some big money from Congress to grease any peace deal. (He should
have the help of American Jewish leaders, many of whom are now
tripping over themselves to get behind Barak and to distance
themselves from Bibi-ism. The king is dead. Long live the king.)
</P>
<P>
   Last is the internal Israeli clock. Will the domestic issues,
ranging from budgets to secular-religious relations, be manageable
enough so that Barak can keep a sustained focus on the peace front
and keep the Israeli center together to sustain simultaneous
withdrawals from the West Bank and Golan?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, despite these questions, you can't lose sight of the
big clock that has been driving all the parties toward a settlement
ever since Anwar el-Sadat visited Jerusalem. At the close of the
lavish White House reception on the South Lawn for Barak last
Sunday night, a loudspeaker would announce to guests when they
could pick up their cars at the East Gate. At one point the
speakers were blaring across the White House lawn, ``Ambassador
from the PLO, your car is ready. Ambassador from the PLO, your car
is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 years ago, no one thought he had a watch that would ever
tick long enough to hear those words echoing across the South Lawn
of the White House. So yes, we should worry about all the little
clocks, but there is obviously a big clock ticking somewhere too.
Barak is clearly in sync with that big clock. Now we will find out
who else is.

CONNECTICUT SEEKS EVIDENCE IN PATRIOTS STADIUM DECISION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON -- Still smarting from the New England Patriots' decision
to abort their move to Hartford, Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal has asked Governor Paul Cellucci to turn over
all documents that could show Beacon Hill was secretly negotiating
with team officials to keep the Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who has threatened to sue the Patriots for millions
of dollars, is searching for evidence that team owner Robert Kraft
was double dealing despite being contractually bound to negotiate
exclusively with Connecticut until the $375 million stadium deal
was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Blumenthal sent Freedom of Information Act
requests to Cellucci, Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, several
Cabinet members and the town of Foxborough, apparently focusing his
search on a memo that stadium consultant Rizzo &AMP; Associates sent to
the State House updating officials on infrastructure costs along
Route 1.
</P>
<P>
   However, team counsel Daniel Goldberg of Bingham Dana said the
Patriots had no involvement in requesting the memo, which the
consultant produced in response to a request from state officials
for an update on possible infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots were in no way involved in getting Rizzo &AMP;
Associates to update their information. Rizzo had done work on the
old stadium plans, obviously they were the choice for the state to
turn to for information,'' Goldberg said. ``They weren't requested
to do it by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal is not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pressing ahead with our investigation,'' he said
Thursday. ``We've reached no conclusion about whether we will take
legal action and we will reach a conclusion only after consulting
with the governor (John Rowland) and reviewing all the results of
this document request and other measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said his office has already obtained documents from a
variety of sources, including ``participants in the discussions.''
He declined to elaborate. It is unclear whether they were
Connecticut officials or the leadership team from Massachusetts
state government, Foxborough and the National Football League who
came up with a counter stadium offer, winning back the Patriots
with $70 million for infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be more specific about the sources,''
Blumenthal added. ``We have evidence that would support a number of
theories that could lead to legal claims against the NFL, the
Patriots, and others. But we're not at this point ruling out any
defendants or claims or confirming any.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the development pact the team signed with Rowland, the
Patriots agreed to negotiate with no one else while contractually
bound to the Connecticut deal. If the team broke that agreement, it
would be subject to a $2 million penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft decided to stay in Foxborough when it appeared the
Hartford site could not be be cleared of a steam plant and
contaminants in time for a 2001 stadium opening _ an excuse that
let the Patriots walk away from the lucrative deal without penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal suspects more may have been going on behind the
scenes and believes it was too convenient that Massachusetts had
its own stadium offer waiting when Kraft rejected the Hartford
plan.
</P>
<P>
   He may seek ``more than $2 million'' in damages from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say whether it would be significantly more or not,''
Blumenthal added. ``But it would seek to cover all our damages,
including fees and expenses that we paid, as well as opportunity
costs, economic injury.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Connecticut will probably reach a conclusion on whether
to pursue a lawsuit within a couple months.
</P>
<P>
   However, Goldberg said he doubts the attorney general will find
any evidence of double dealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to find a basis for liabilty and the
development agreement made it very clear what rights the Patriots
had to make a decision not to go forward,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer said the governor's legal
office will be handling the FOI request and denied that
Massachusetts had any inappropriate contact with the team while it
was still locked into the Connecticut agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that they're going to take steps and
pursue every avenue they can,'' Hoffer said. ``However, the fact
remains, we were not having any negotiations with the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL declined to comment on the suit.

   DEAL FOR PRUDENTIAL UNIT SEEMS CLOSE TO A GIVE-AWAY
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 days, Aetna expects to complete what it has
called its billion-dollar purchase of Prudential Health Care. But
seven months after the agreement was announced, neither side has
disclosed the full details. And analysts, left to sort it out for
themselves, now say the price is really closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, analysts say that Prudential Life Insurance is
virtually paying Aetna to take the money-losing health care
business off its hands and that Aetna will inherit more than $600
million in cash that the company set aside to pay future medical
claims. In addition, half the announced purchase price is being
financed by a $500 million loan to Aetna by Prudential. Market

STARR SET TO SPEAK AT CONSERVATIVE FUND-RAISER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, has
agreed to be the keynote speaker at a November fund-raiser for a
group calling itself ``Minnesota's conservative think tank,''
drawing criticism from a Democratic Senate candidate in that state.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is scheduled to speak to the group, the Center for the
American Experiment, at its First Annual Fall Conservative
Briefing, for which seats will sell for $75 and sponsorships will
go for up to $5,000. David Lillehaug, a Democratic candidate for
the Senate, said Thursday that it was ``highly inappropriate'' for
the independent counsel to appear at a fund-raising event for a
clearly ideological group.
</P>
<P>
   The center speakers at past fund-raisers have included former
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, Gen. Colin Powell,
Robert Bork, a former federal judge who was nominated to the
Supreme Court, and Jeanne Kirkpatrick, the former U.S. delegate to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehaug, a former U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said it was
improper for Starr to be the main draw at the fund-raiser because
he was obliged to avoid such events in his role as a federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Starr, Edward Page, said that ``this is a very
respectable group,'' which has been the host to many distinguished
speakers, and that ``Ken looks forward to returning to Minnesota
where he has many close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation from the center's director, Mitch Pearlstein,
said: ``Personally, there's hardly another person I would more like
to meet and hear these days than Judge Starr, as my respect and
gratitude are enormous both for what he has done and for what he
has been forced to withstand as an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlstein said his group had been mainly active on issues in
Minnesota and supported such ideas as school vouchers and free
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ideologically driven but not partisan,'' he said. The
center's board is heavy with state Republicans but includes some
Democrats.

who have gone out of business in order to complete trace requests.
the bureau's stance toward gun makers, distributors and legitimate

criminal investigations, even as the bureau's own system of tracing
guns used in crimes or seized by the police shows that tens of
thousands of the firearms are sold by licensed retailers. (Paul

 &HT;    Vistors to collectors convention feed hobby habit
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Randy Duplissey cased the West Concourse of the
Georgia World Congress Center on Thursday, a man on a mission. He
carried a full wallet and an empty backpack in his quest for two
specific treasures: the only missing figurines in his bobbing head
doll collection.
</P>
<P>
   He covered every inch of Halls F, G and H of the 20th National
Sports Collectors Convention, stopped at two dealers' tables four
separate times and finally decided he had found what he was looking
for: a bobbing head doll of the Cleveland Browns, $130; a bobbing
head doll of the Boston Patriots, $150.
</P>
<P>
   ''This completes my collection,'' said Duplissey, who works in a
grocery store in Richmond, Va. He had driven to Atlanta to get the
last two dolls, made in Japan about 30 years ago. ''These are hard
to come by. They're made of papier mache. You don't even have to
touch them for them to damage; the paper takes in humidity and
cracks on its own. Now that I've got all 26 teams in the 1970s NFL
and AFL, I'll move on to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Duplissey is the target consumer of the Collectors Convention.
These are people with a passion _ and money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Sports collecting is a multibillion-dollar hobby and business.
It is difficult even for the most ardent participants to get a
financial handle on the phenomenon. At the peak of the trading card
industry, the figure was put at $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the fault with that was it was based on new
card product, the manufacturers' price to wholesale,'' said Michael
Berkus, executive director of the show and a serious collector
himself. ''That doesn't take into account the price from wholesale
to retail or any memorabilia, which is now larger than the trading
card industry. Or vintage card sales, or apparel or scorecards.
There's no way to put a barometer on all of what's going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Collecting has moved into cyberspace. For the first time, online
services such as eBay, Amazon.com. and Collectors Universe have
booths at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The CollectingChannel is providing live Webcasts online so
people around the world can see what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast certainly can't capture all of the wheeling, dealing
and treasures at this marvelous garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   This is where you can pick up a golf ball autographed by Dan
Quayle ($20), a seat from the late Crosley Field ($695), a complete
set of unused 1982 season tickets to the Atlanta Braves ($500) or a
78 rpm record of ``Take Me Out To The Ball Game'' with Phil Rizzuto
singing along with Mitch Miller's band ($10).
</P>
<P>
   There's even a package of three Champ Prophylactics with the
likeness of Ted Williams on the cover ($100). ``I wouldn't use
them,'' dealer Will Simmons said. ``But Ted Williams collectors buy
them. They weren't endorsed by Ted Williams but that's sure his
image on the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The stuff goes beyond sports. Hopalong Cassidy spurs (rare,
unpriced). Two movie stills of Katherine Hepburn ($425) framed
around a note to a collector: ``Thank you for your nice letter. I
am sorry but I do not sign or send photographs,'' above her
signature. An unused ticket to a 1956 Fats Domino concert _ it cost
$2.50 to see the show at Loyola Field House _ is $175.
</P>
<P>
   Want something bigger? A piece of the basketball floor on which
Michael Jordan made the last shot of his career to enable the Bulls
to beat the Utah Jazz for the 1998 NBA title is on display here
before going up for auction for $2 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that large chunks will be sold,'' said Rick
Caselli of the auction company that brought it to the show, ``and
that it won't turn into toothpicks for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which proves one thing: People will collect anything and
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is tied into a relationship with sports,'' Berkus
said. ''There's also a relationship of the somewhat inner child
that says there's no reason to grow up, you can still keep your
baseball cards even though your mother threw them out. Go back and
get them. Any time you want to be 12 years old again, go into your
den and pull down that shoe box and play with them again. People
like to recapture the value and fun they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing proudly with his bobbing head dolls, Duplissey agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's buying back childhood memories,'' the 36-year-old said.
''I read a newspaper article five years ago that said that the
three best investments were stocks, real estate and sports
memorabilia. I went with the sports stuff. I drove 500 miles here.
If I can also find any unique Minnesota Vikings pieces, the trip is
well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons. ''A lot of my customers are doctors,''
said dealer Pat Armstrong, who specializes in vintage memorabilia
out of his shop in Burlington, Iowa. ''They tell me they put it in
their waiting room so when kids come in they are distracted and
don't worry about what the doctor is going to do to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The vintage market seems to be hot right now. For instance,
collectors are seeking any items from baseball's Cuban League and
Negro League.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Storm came from Arvada, Colo., to stand in line for
wrestling queen Sable's autograph ($30) on his Playboy magazine.
She signed as Rena Mero because she's fighting the World Wrestling
Federation over use of her stage name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably spend about $800 for autograph tickets,'' Storm
said. That includes $200 for Bill Russell's signature on an 8x10
photo. ''That's just my hobby. I could go buy pictures that have
already been signed but the fun for me is getting to meet these
people,'' the 28-year-old collector said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, people can now bid on items without
leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely changing the business,'' said dealer Bill
Biggar of Chamblee. ''It's bringing more people into collecting. I
don't think it's pushing prices up, necessarily. It enables people
to sell stuff you probably wouldn't look at. The only danger we've
seen is some of the stuff not being genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it helps folks who can't afford to travel to shows.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cooley of Kilgore, Texas, just happens to be here
visiting relatives. Her husband, a collector, sent her down to get
a set of Molten Metal cards. She picked up Beanie Babies for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think collecting is about the thrill of getting it and no
one else will have it,'' Cooley said. ''And you never know, it
might be worth something some day.''

THE BATTLE FOR THE BERKELEY AIRWAVES RAGES ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling of ``Elan Fabbri'' in 14th graf is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ By 8 a.m., a dozen or so protesters were
standing in front of the offices of radio station KPFA, holding
signs asking the drivers zooming across Martin Luther King Jr. Way
to ``Honk for Free Speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone did.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers also waved and yelled, ``Yeah!'' and ``Free KPFA!''
as if they were cheering the home team before a crucial match. A
few even waved at the police officers stationed across the street,
next to the television news vans. And the officers smiled back.
</P>
<P>
   What started four months ago as a squabble over who should
control programming _ the staff and management of KPFA, the oldest
public radio station in the country, or its parent, the Pacifica
Foundation _ has become Berkeley's biggest battle in years.
</P>
<P>
   With each new round of that battle, which began when Pacifica
fired KPFA's popular station manager on March 31 and became fiercer
as other members of the staff were discharged for airing their
gripes over the radio, the rallies have multiplied. Since Tuesday
of last week _ when Pacifica closed the station after physically
yanking the host of a news program off the air in midsentence _
rallies, some involving thousands of people, have occurred daily.
And protesters have been camping out in front of the building, now
boarded and padlocked, day and night. (Tents even occupied the
middle of the street until Wednesday, when the police had them
moved.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pacifica Foundation, which also owns four other publicly
supported, politically progressive stations (KPFK in Los Angeles,
WBAI in New York, WPFW in Washington and KPFT in Houston) denies
what many here suppose: that it is dismantling the only radio
station that the political left has in the San Francisco Bay Area
in order to sell it. Fifty-year-old KPFA has a vast signal, and
would most likely prove a lucrative asset on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica says it is simply trying to improve KPFA's often quirky
programming in order to attract more listeners. But the
foundation's actions have aroused animosity, not least among groups
that once got their message across to the public through KPFA
programs. To them, some of the big social issues of the past _
censorship, community vs. corporate power, the threat of force (in
the station's hiring of armed guards as a response to protests) _
are back.
</P>
<P>
   So some of the old radicals _ from activists of the Free Speech
movement to onetime Black Panthers to People's Park founders _ are
back, too. They have been joined by college students, supporters of
listener-sponsored community radio from all over and local
residents not typically prone to Berkeley's protest tradition.
Nearly 100 people have been arrested during demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been arrested before, but for this it's worth it,''
Liam Kirshner, the president of an Internet consulting business,
said as he stood among protesters blocking traffic the other day.
``This protest is going to continue until we get the station
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests here are starting to have an effect at Pacifica's
other stations. Demonstrators rallied at WBAI in Manhattan last
Friday, and members of the staff at KPFK in Los Angeles have
organized a teach-in on the Berkeley situation for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Progress toward a resolution appears to be minimal, although
both sides met with a federal mediator on Tuesday and plan to do so
again on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, the protesters acquire new allies. ``Free
KPFA'' T-shirts are becoming as common in Berkeley as the Nike
swoosh in a locker room. State legislators plan a hearing to
investigate Pacifica's handling of the situation. Alice Walker
spoke at a rally. Joan Baez volunteered for a fund-raising concert.
Even officers in riot gear have mentioned that, well, they too are
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go into a coffee shop without people stopping me to
give their support,'' said Dennis Bernstein, the news-program host
who was dragged off the air by armed guards and an interim station
manager, because he was addressing the dispute. ``I've gotten calls
from Hawaii, South Korea, all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacifica Foundation concedes that in the public relations
battle, it is getting flattened. Thursday Elan Fabbri, who had been
Pacifica's sole spokeswoman during the crisis, was replaced by a
San Francisco public relations firm. Lynn Chadwick, Pacifica's
executive director, said the foundation realized that its message
had not been getting across. ``I plan to be much more available
now'' to the news media, Ms. Chadwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifica has maintained that the station's offices were closed
for the sake of the staff's safety. It says that protesters had
barged into the KPFA building and that shots fired on April 1 into
the Pacifica Foundation office next door are being investigated as
attempted homicide.
</P>
<P>
   To the foundation and its chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, who is
also the chairwoman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, the crux
of the problem is KPFA's unwillingness to change to reflect the
changing demographics of listeners. While the station's 59,000-watt
signal could reach more than 6 million listeners, its audience,
Pacifica says, has stagnated at 200,000. Most of those, Dr. Berry
said, are ``white males over 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Since shutting down the offices last week, Pacifica has been
broadcasting old programs from the station's archives over KPFA.
The staff's programmers, meanwhile, say they will continue to
provide a voice to their loyal listeners. In recent days, they have
started broadcasting their shows over pirate airwaves from in front
of the building, where the plywood covering the windows is now
papered with posters announcing the latest events to ``free KPFA.''

ASHES OF JFK JR., WIFE, HER SISTER SCATTERED AT SEA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOE STINEBAKER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ The Atlantic Ocean reclaimed the remains of
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law Thursday morning,
this time following a somber ceremony on board a naval destroyer
two miles from the site of last Friday's tragic plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The scattering of ashes at sea brought to a close nearly a week
of highly publicized search-and-recovery efforts several miles
southwest of Martha's Vineyard, a popular resort island on which
Kennedy and his sister, Caroline, own a substantial beach-front
estate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape and Islands medical examiner's office said Thursday
that Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law
Lauren Bessette were killed instantly when their plane slammed into
the ocean after a 30-second freefall while on approach to the
Martha's Vineyard airport. The medical examiner's office, which
conducted autopsies on the three bodies late Wednesday night, said
all three died as a result of massive trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Media, well-wishers and the curious began lining narrow
Massachusetts 28 here in Woods Hole early Thursday morning, some
holding signs of condolence for the families. At around 8:50 a.m.
EDT, a police escort led a caravan of dark Chevrolet Suburbans and
vans with darkly tinted windows into the Coast Guard station.
Moments later, members of the two families could be seen boarding
Coast Guard cutters that took them out to board the 563-foot USS
Briscoe, a naval destroyer brought to Woods Hole from Virginia, for
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Among those gathered on board were Kennedy's 67-year-old uncle,
Sen. Edward Kennedy; his sister and brother-in-law, Caroline and
Edwin Schlossberg; and cousins Maria Shriver, William Kennedy Smith
and Anthony Radziwill. Representing the Bessette family were
Carolyn and Lauren's mother and stepfather, Ann and Dr. Richard
Freeman; and their sister, Lisa Ann Bessette. Family members could
be seen embracing as they prepared to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. flags and three wreaths were taken aboard the cutters
for transfer to the Briscoe, presumably for use in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Briscoe sailed out through Vineyard Sound around 9:30 a.m.,
and arrived near the location of the crash almost two hours later.
After a brief, private ceremony, which included two Navy chaplains
and a Roman Catholic priest, the ashes of the Kennedys and Bessette
were scattered to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials said the ceremony was not a formal military
burial at sea, because none of the three were military veterans.
Defense Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican colleague of
Ted Kennedy in the Senate, said he approved the Kennedy and
Bessette family's request for burial at sea. The approval came
under a military regulation allowing such ceremonies ``due to
notable service or outstanding contributions to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Briscoe returned to the harbor at Woods Hole about 1:30
p.m., when Coast Guard cutters again picked up the families and
returned them to the Coast Guard station. The families left the
station about 3:45 p.m. without making any comments.
</P>
<P>
   The burial at sea stemmed in part, a Kennedy family source said,
from an earlier expressed desire of the son of the former
president. Another consideration, the source said, was that a
standard interment would give gawkers yet another Kennedy burial
site to visit _ and possibly desecrate.
</P>
<P>
   The same concern figured in the decision to cremate the bodies
before the final committal at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the family were irked, the source said, that the
White House confirmed the plans for burial at sea to news
organizations Wednesday night. But, the source conceded, advance
word of the plan helped dispel any sense that the family was trying
to hide anything by the quick disposition of the remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, in turn, sought to make clear that
it allowed military participation in the ceremony only after being
asked by the family, through the office of Sen. Kennedy, a
patriarch not only of his family but also of Clinton's Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an offer'' from the White House, ``it was a
request,'' from the Kennedys, said a senior official of an
administration that had already been challenged on the president's
decision to authorize an extended, expensive search for the plane
and remains using federal civilian and military resources.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton had no direct
role in approving military participation in the service, an action
taken by Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ceremony was the first of several memorial services
planned for the Kennedys and Bessette. A public service sponsored
by the Emerald Isle Immigration Society was held Thursday night at
the Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two private family services were planned. The
service for John Kennedy Jr., 38, and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,
who were married in 1996, is scheduled Friday at St. Thomas More
Church on Manhattan's Upper East Side. President Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have said they will attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   Security preparations were stepped up Thursday as police blocked
East 89th Street and papered the surrounding neighborhood with
no-parking signs.
</P>
<P>
   A service for 34-year-old Lauren Bessette will be held Saturday
night at Christ Church in the Bessettes' hometown of Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage recovery resumed after Thursday's service, with Coast
Guard and Navy officials attempting to retrieve the rest of
Kennedy's shattered plane, which lies upside down and in pieces 116
feet below the surface. Federal officials recovered an 8- to
10-foot portion of the plane's fuselage, propeller and instrument
panel Wednesday afternoon, at the same time the bodies were
recovered from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The propeller is of particular interest to investigators because
it can help determine whether the plane suffered any mechanical
problems prior to impact. If the propeller's tips are turned in,
that could lead investigators to believe the propeller was
operating on impact. A bending of the propeller can indicate that
it was stationary when the plane hit the water.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said the plane's remaining wreckage lies
scattered within 40 yards of where the bodies and fuselage were
discovered. Officials with the National Transportation Board, which
is investigating the accident, said the crash impact tore the wings
and engine from the plane's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are taking the wreckage to the Cape Cod Coast
Guard station for examination, in hopes it might provide
information about the crash. Although NTSB investigators have been
hesitant to say so publicly, some have said privately that there is
no evidence of mechanical problems, and the likely cause of the
accident involved pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said at a press briefing Wednesday that
it may be six to nine months before the agency completes its
investigation and releases a report listing the accident's probable
cause. Hall said there would be no more information released by the
NTSB until after the weekend's memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy family has generally been successful in limiting the
amount of information about the weekend's events that have been
reported publicly. A local newspaper, the Cape Cod Times, reported
that the Kennedys had insisted that no photographs be taken at the
three autopsies, out of fear they might end up in tabloid
newspapers or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although photographs are usually taken during autopsies, it was
unclear Thursday whether that was the case with the Kennedys and
the Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wishes of the family were appropriately expressed,'' said
prosecutor Michael O'Keefe. ``Where it was possible, they were
followed.''

FORMER YUGOSLAV ARMY CHIEF DENOUNCES MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The former chief of the Yugoslav army
said Thursday that he was considering entering active politics and
called for the peaceful ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic,
charging that he has politicized the army.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilo Perisic, whom Milosevic dismissed as army chief of staff
in November, said in an interview published Thursday, ``The current
state leadership must be removed by political means, and the people
should be taken along the path of civic and democratic programs,
and not those of hatred and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, who was said to be under house arrest during the
three-month conflict with NATO, did not call for Milosevic's
immediate resignation, as many opposition leaders do. He implied
support for early elections, but his interview, with NIN magazine,
was gnomic, as well as leaving confusion about his plans. But his
comments will add an important voice to calls for change.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be offering himself up to talks with the
opposition, but did not say whether he wanted to join an existing
party or start one.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Milosevic's apparent concern for army loyalty after
protests by reservists for their Kosovo combat pay, he made an
unusual visit today to army headquarters, where he met all top
commanders. He praised the army's ``skills and knowledge, bravery,
dedication, patriotism and military virtues,'' which ``prevented
plans for the occupation of our country,'' state television said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, who is widely considered to have some significant
support in the army, and especially the officer corps, has had
conversations about a new party with a close friend, Zoran Lilic,
the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and a vice president of
Milosevic's Socialist Party. But Lilic says he sees his future with
the Socialists, an indication that Milosevic retains significant
strength among the ruling elite that he nurtured.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of staff, Perisic reportedly counseled Milosevic
against a conflict with NATO, and he was replaced soon after a deal
was struck in October with Washington for unarmed observers in
Kosovo. But the arrangement fell apart, as armed fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army reinfiltrated Kosovo, taking over nearly 40
percent of the province, and a widespread Serb offensive led to the
bombing in March.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic's successor, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, has been fiercely
loyal to Milosevic and his wife, Mira Markovic, and on Sunday he
stepped into politics by warning the opposition that the army could
move against them. Ojdanic told the state-run newspaper Politika,
``It is the task of us all now to preserve the stability of the
country, because there are many sold souls, Western vassals, who
want to take power by force and take the country into a new
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments prompted Perisic to contend that ``now the
military leadership has been turned into a party cell of the SPS
and JUL,'' the parties of Milosevic and Mrs. Markovic,
respectively. Her party in particular, Perisic said, by
``usurpation, blackmail and fear, has penetrated into all
institutions, the Yugoslav army included, but only after my
dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisic contended that Milosevic's policies in Kosovo were ``in
some elements worse than a capitulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership,'' he said, ``thrust the people forward to be
sacrificed, while they themselves remained untouchable and made
personal profit from the people's sacrifice and became even more
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership, Perisic added, ``wanted the army to carry out
unwise and sometimes fatal decisions,'' while rejecting his advice
in early 1998 to declare a state of emergency in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on, the Yugoslav army and Interior Ministry troops were
used for the eradication of terrorism, but in a manner that only
gave argument to the international community to start threatening
and, unfortunately, to realize its threats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic urged political leaders and citizens to act swiftly to
create a common platform that ``will rally all democratic forces''
in Yugoslavia ``with the aim of reintegration into the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``danger of civil war'' from miscalculation by both
the opposition and the leadership had to be avoided, which is why
he had decided to speak out. Perisic had been chief of staff since
1992 and was responsible for shelling Mostar, Bosnia, an area that
the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is checking as
a possible war crime.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Milosevic's party, Ivica Dacic, said Perisic had
been chief of staff for Milosevic for too long to make such a
commentary. ``This is all part of a political fight and political
games and shows that there was reason to replace him from his
post,'' Dacic said.

 &HT;    Olympic hopes ride on Winnipeg performance
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The central Canadian city of Winnipeg once was known
as the Gateway to the West and the North. For the next 2 1/2 weeks,
it will be a gateway to the far, far south: Sydney, Australia, to
be exact.
</P>
<P>
   As host of the XIII Pan American Games, Winnipeg will provide an
Olympic warmup for some of the 5,250 athletes from 42 countries in
41 sports. For others, it's a regional qualifier for the 2000
Games. Baseball, team handball, field hockey and triathlon are
among the 15 sports with Olympic berths at stake.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, in which the U.S. is sending pro players for the
first time (albeit minor-leaguers), the top two teams qualify. In
team handball, which has 12 metro Atlanta players from the locally
based men's and women's squads, only the champion goes to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely do or die,'' said Darrick Heath of Atlanta,
who still has a ``sour feeling'' from the 1991 Pan Ams, when the
U.S. men failed to qualify for Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the U.S. got an automatic bid as host country. ``Now we
want to earn our right to to go the Olympic Games,'' Heath said.
``We don't want our cards to be (automatically) punched.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. brings the largest delegation to the Games: 704
athletes, including 120 Olympians. With 35 competitors, Georgia
ranks fourth among states in number of athletes behind California
(145), New York (45) and Texas (43).
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Brazil also are sending large contingents. How many
return home to Cuba is another matter. A shooter bolted Tuesday as
soon as the team arrived, following the lead of four basketball
players who defected at the Tournament of the Americas last week in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not asked for any extra security measures from us,
nor have we offered,'' Pan Am Games press secretary Brian Koshul
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We don't have defectors in Canada. They are
`applicants for refugee status.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Koshul said anyone encountering such applicants should take them
to the nearest police officer. ``We told all our volunteers, `Don't
put them in the trunk of your car, don't take them home for
dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians will be accommodating in other areas. In
equestrian events, the riders are keeping close to their horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's pretty spread out, so they have us staying in
some campers,'' said Lynda Alicki of Monroe, who will compete in
dressage on her horse Impressario. ``It's more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to sell more than 500,000 tickets to events that
include several not on the Olympic schedule, such as water skiing,
racquetball, roller sports and karate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pan Am Games boasts a potential viewing audience of
400 million, Atlanta viewers will have to speak Spanish if they
want to understand the commentary. Univision is the only network
carrying the Games in this country. ESPN2 will show a two-hour
highlight package after the closing ceremonies, but negotiations
with ESPN for daily coverage fell through.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC got the long-term contract for the Olympics, Koshul
said, ``all interest faded from the other (networks).''
</P>
<P>
   The Games were a tough sell to TV because of lesser known
athletes from the U.S. in about 40 percent of the events.
</P>
<P>
   The top names are preparing for the World Championships in track
and boxing and the Pan-Pacific Championships in swimming.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S. gold came Thursday in the men's kayak 1,000, with
a crew of Stein Jorgensen, John Mooney, Peter Newton and Justin
Piasecki finishing nearly three seconds ahead of Cuba on Lake
Minnesdosa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women won a bronze medal behind Canada and Cuba in the
women's kayak 500 with a team that included Julia Sorzano, Kathy
Colin, Tamara Jenkins, and Alexandra Harbold.
</P>
<P>
   Other canoe-kayak winners were from Argentina and Cuba. Overall,
Argentina and Canada won two golds and Cuba had the most medals,
five.
</P>
<P>
   At the last Pan Am Games, in Argentina four years ago, the U.S.
won 425 medals, including 170 gold, followed by Cuba with a total
of 238.

 &HT;    HBO, King reach deal on Holyfield-Lewis
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ HBO and promoter Don King _ who a month ago were at
serious odds _ have come to terms on a contract agreement for a
heavyweight championship rematch between Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis on Nov. 13 at Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   King still has to work out some issues with Lewis' promoters
before a deal is finalized, but those obstacles are deemed minor
and should not prevent the two from settling their controversial
draw earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've agreed with Don on everything we need,'' said Lou
DiBella, the cable network's boxing vice president Thursday night.
``We don't have a contract. We haven't even drawn one up, but we
have a handshake agreement. Our business with Don is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Holyfield attorney Jim Thomas was pessimistic a
deal could be struck, mostly because of HBO's demand that King
remove himself from the proposed fight if he was indicted on
federal charges of arranging fights, kickbacks and selling rankings
to the IBF. King contended such a restriction would have no bearing
on the appeal of the rematch, and he would not give way.
</P>
<P>
   However, that stipulation was rescinded weeks ago. According to
reports, HBO, which has exclusive rights to Lewis fights, said it
is willing to take care of Lewis' purse for the rematch ($15
million), while King handles Holyfield's take ($15 million) and
other expenses _ even if King gets indicted. That concession opened
the way for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions in the last week between King and HBO have brought
so much progress that Thomas said early Thursday that he was
``guardedly optimistic'' his client and Lewis would battle again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are still some open issues, there's progress
being made,'' Thomas said. ``I'm guardedly optimistic that
something can be done in the next week to 10 days. There has
definitely been progress made in the last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicated the rematch and unification title bout
would take place at the new Mandalay Bay Hotel on the Vegas strip
on either Nov. 6 or 13. However, DiBella said the Mack Center _ the
home basketball venue for UNLV _ will be the venue on the latter
date.
</P>
<P>
   Said DiBella: ``It's all just a matter of time now.

CHINA BANS BUDDHIST LAW MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Adds graf 18, with a reaction from the State Department.)  (lh) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China intensified its offensive against the Buddhist
Law spiritual movement Thursday, announcing a ban on the
organization and unleashing a barrage of charges against its
founder that revealed how seriously the government takes the sect
as a challenge to its rule.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ban on the group, known in Chinese as Falun
Gong, had been rumored since the police rounded up more than 100
leaders of the sect in several Chinese cities earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the ferocity of Beijing's campaign, aimed at a group of
mainly middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing
exercises and meditation, suggests that it regards Falun Gong as
more than a movement of physical and moral uplift. At a time when
China's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising, officials
here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous
political force.
</P>
<P>
   After Beijing handed down its edict Thursday afternoon, it began
an extraordinary public-relations assault on the group and its
founder, Li Hongzhi, through state-run television and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Civil Affairs accused Falun Gong of ``inciting
and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability.'' In
an editorial scheduled for publication on Friday, the Communist
Party newspaper People's Daily said Li was pursuing a hidden
political agenda that posed a ``massive threat'' to Chinese
society.
</P>
<P>
   State media also accused Li of misleading followers about his
birth date, so that he could claim to be a reincarnation of
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism and of accepting payments for
supposedly miraculous cures.
</P>
<P>
   Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk who left China for the
United States last year, fashioned his sect from an eclectic blend
of traditional breathing exercises, as well as elements of Buddhism
and Taoism. His followers say they disavow politics and embrace
Li's teachings for their physical and spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   But Falun Gong deeply unsettled China's rulers when 10,000 of
its adherents materialized on April 25 in front of the compound
that houses President Jiang Zemin and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, held to demand official recognition for the group,
demonstrated that this obscure spiritual sect was in fact a highly
organized movement with an international network capable of
mobilizing thousands of people and putting them under the noses of
China's top leaders without a whisper of warning.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the detentions spread this week, thousands of Falun
Gong followers massed in front of government offices in Dalian,
Guangzhou and 28 other cities to protest the government's
crackdown, according to members of the group and a human rights
organization in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The wall-to-wall coverage of the ban in the state-run media
underscores that the government is determined to stamp out Falun
Gong. But with a large and rapidly growing membership _ estimates
range from the government's figure of 2 million to the group's
claim of 100 million followers worldwide _ a fluid structure, and
an appreciation of the power of the Internet to pass information,
Falun Gong could prove an elusive quarry for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to make us stronger,'' said Sophie Xiao,
a spokeswoman for Falun Gong in Hong Kong. ``People are not
simple-minded. Educated people will hear about this group and check
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of protests following Thursday's
announcement. Late Thursday afternoon, hundreds of police and
troops still circled Zhongnanhai, the leaders' compound, which has
been a fortress since the crackdown began on Monday night. The
police continued to stop traffic on the western edge of the
complex, where Falun Gong members held their rally in April.
</P>
<P>
   A former Chinese official said police in Beijing had released
several hundred people _ most of them women _ who had been detained
as they massed near Zhongnanhai on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials were clearly concerned about how the ban would
be received abroad. Shortly before the announcement was made
public, a high-ranking government official briefed foreign
correspondents here on why the government felt it necessary to take
such Draconian action.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Beijing
had moved against Falun Gong because of ``the danger it posed to
our country and our people. Any responsible government would do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   He said members of the group had harassed government offices and
pro-Beijing news organizations. And he said the government had
evidence that Li had been in Beijing for the three days prior to
the April rally in front of Zhongnanhai. Li, he said, had been
instrumental in planning it.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said
the United States was disturbed by China's decision to ban Falun
Gong and was urging China to abide by international human rights
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The strident tone and sheer volume of the denunciations of Falun
Gong baffled some experts in Chinese politics. Why, they asked,
would the government pour so much energy into fighting a group
which, by its estimates, has 2 million members _ far fewer than the
100 million the group claims?
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, a few months ago hardly anyone had heard of it, and
no one was saying it was a threat to the state,'' said one
political scholar in Beijing, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``I think the party leaders felt personally insulted by the Falun
Gong protest. It made them look like fools.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A former government official said Thursday that the unexpected
demonstration last April particularly unnerved Jiang. In briefings
with government officials earlier this week, this person said, a
senior leader quoted Jiang as harshly criticizing Li and the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said there were plenty of reasons for Beijing to worry
about this kind of group. With its mixture of martial arts and
mysticism, Falun Gong appeals to people who have felt adrift since
Deng Xioaping began reforming the Chinese economy and relaxing
social controls in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Popular groups like Falun Gong played a profoundly disruptive
role in the final decades of the last imperial dynasty. And as the
communist government approaches the 50th anniversary of its rule,
on Oct. 1, China's economic engine is sputtering. With China
embarking on an ambitious campaign to overhaul its state sector _
one that has already resulting in huge layoffs _ Beijing is bracing
itself for widespread unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that the government may feel vulnerable abounded in the
flood of official denunciations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must fully recognize the massive threat that the rampant
spread of the Falun Gong organization is to the party, government,
and people,'' said the editorial prepared for Friday's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
   In a 70-minute documentary that has been rerun almost nonstop
Thursday on state television, Falun Gong was portrayed as a
pernicious cult that leads members to mental instability, madness,
even murder.

LITTLE ASIAS, ACROSS DIXIE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL KOTKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Where can you find immigrant entrepreneurs from Asia
revitalizing urban neighborhoods today?
</P>
<P>
   Try the South.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale Asian immigration is a relatively new phenomenon in
the states of the former Confederacy, beginning in earnest only in
the 1970s, after the Vietnam War ended. The first clusters appeared
in the big metropolitan regions of Atlanta, Dallas and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, the Asian population in the South was growing
rapidly, increasing by almost half from 1990 to 1996, to nearly 1.5
million. And with the immigrants came the same entrepreneurial
culture that has been at work in older Asian-American communities
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Asian immigrants now head south for many of the same reasons
that other business people do: low housing costs, rapid economic
growth and a generally pro-business political environment. Nowhere
is that more evident than in Houston, which over the last
quarter-century has become home to the South's largest
Asian-American business community.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's wave has been led by people like Don Wang, founder and
chief executive of Metrocorp Bancshares, the parent of Metrobank,
the largest of the city's six Asian-American-owned banks. When he
came to Houston in the early 1970s, Asian-owned business barely
registered in the dizzying energy-led boom.
</P>
<P>
   As the boom fizzled, Houston began bleeding population, with
140,000 residents, mostly white, leaving the region in the 1980s.
But Asian and other immigrants began arriving in growing numbers.
The city's Asian-born population swelled from 2,500 in 1965 to
67,000 in 1990, and demographers expect the 2000 count to be
100,000-plus, or more than 7 percent of the city's residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 70s, oil made Houston boom, but it also brought in
immigrants,'' said Wang, whose bank, now 12 years old, is now the
fourth largest based in Houston. ``When the oil crisis came,
everything dropped, but it actually was our chance to become a new
city again.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the American-born residents who left town during
the oil bust, he said, Asian immigrants saw the region's slump as
an opportunity to acquire real estate, buy homes and start
businesses in fields like food processing, distribution and
electronics assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The results are most striking in Houston's close-in suburban
districts, just outside the Interstate 610 loop. The Bellaire Road
area, once a declining working-class neighborhood of aging shopping
centers, has become widely known as Houston's new Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded with Asian-owned banks, including Wang's, and an array
of Asian-oriented grocery stores, restaurants and business service
firms, It looks and feels less like the Texas oil patch than like
Flushing, Queens, or the San Gabriel Valley east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we still have one fried-chicken place left somewhere
around here _ it's kind of the last outpost of the native culture
lost amid the new Chinatown,'' Chao-Chiung Lee said over dim sum in
one of the area's many Asian-oriented mini-malls. Lee is president
of Stoa International Architects, which has designed many buildings
in the area,
</P>
<P>
   Asian immigrants have also been responsible for the rapid growth
of the adjacent Harwin corridor. Once a forlorn strip of office and
warehouse buildings, the area has been transformed into a
car-friendly bazaar for off-price goods for much of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Discount furniture, novelties, luggage, car parts and electronic
goods are sold by more than 800 shops owned largely by Chinese,
Korean and Indian merchants, up from roughly 40 a decade ago. In
that time, commercial property in the district has more than
tripled in value, and vacancies have dropped from nearly 50 percent
to the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American businesses have also contributed to a turnaround
in some long-depressed parts of the city center, including the
vicinity of Houston's tiny original Chinatown. Among the most
successful of the food processors, grocery companies and
restaurants now there is Kim Son, a large Vietnamese restaurant
founded by seven members of the La family, who escaped their
homeland and survived a harrowing stay in a refugee camp in
Indonesia before reaching Houston, nearly penniless, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the seven began working 12-hour, minimum-wage shifts at
a convenience store, and within two years the family had
accumulated $20,000 in savings, according to Tan La, now 39. In
1982, La, his parents and his siblings used their savings to open a
small restaurant, which grew rapidly even while Houston's economy
was sputtering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times were tough, but people were still eating,'' he said.
``Maybe it was that the price was reasonable, very affordable. The
regular Houstonians kept coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, with Houston on the rebound, the regulars keep flocking
to the downtown restaurant, which now sprawls over 11 times its
original space. Branch restaurants in two other locations,
including one in the affluent, mostly white Galleria district, lift
the family business's annual sales above $7 million; 200 people
work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is really changing,'' La said with a slight smile.
``People want to come downtown now. It's become a very good
environment. It has to do with us but also with these Texans _ they
are adventurous and like to try new things.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Bush lays out first major policy proposal
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the first major policy speech of his
front-running presidential campaign, Gov. George W. Bush said
Thursday that Washington should scale back many of its own social
programs and instead use taxpayer dollars to arm religious and
community groups that are better-equipped to transform lives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an Indianapolis Methodist church, Bush fleshed out
his ``compassionate conservatism'' _ maligned by some as squishy
and meaningless _ with policy specifics and for the first time laid
out a clear vision of how the philosophy would guide him as
president. The mayor of Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith, is Bush's
chief domestic policy adviser and has attracted national attention
for his empowerment of religious and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   The most far-reaching, and potentially problematic, proposal
would allow religious and community groups to compete for public
money to provide all social services now delivered by government.
Bush also proposed $8 billion in tax incentives to encourage people
to contribute more to charity, and an expansion of federal tax
deductions and new state tax credits for charitable contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered the most extensive explanation yet of his
``compassionate conservatism,'' distinguishing himself from
conservatives who believe that ``if government would only get out
of the way, all our problems would be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this campaign, I bring a message to my own party. We must
apply our conservative and free-market ideas to the job of helping
real human beings _ because any ideology, no matter how right in
theory, is sterile and empty without that goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a kindness in our justice. There must be mercy
in our judgment. There must be a love behind our zeal. This is
where my campaign is headed.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite ``grand gestures and honorable aims,'' Bush said,
government-led efforts to eradicate poverty have failed because
they can't ``put hope in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our
lives.'' As president, Bush's father praised private charitable
works as ``a thousand points of light,'' but the younger Bush said
government must do more than encourage volunteerism. Instead, he
pledged to spend taxpayer dollars to support religious and
community groups that address social problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance where my administration sees a
responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based
organizations, charities and community groups that have shown their
ability to save and change lives,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be the failed compassion of towering, distant
bureaucracies,'' he added. ``On the contrary, it will be government
that serves those who are serving their neighbors. It will be
government that directs help to the inspired and the effective. It
will be government that both knows its limits, and shows its
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has aggressively implemented the ``charitable
choice'' provision of the 1996 federal welfare reform law, which
allows states to funnel taxpayer dollars to faith-based groups for
welfare-to-work programs. Even before the federal changes, Bush
formed a task force to examine ways to empower faith-based groups,
and he has signed bills easing the regulatory burden on private
groups that provide social services with or without government
money.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Workforce Commission and the Department of Human
Services _ which together are responsible for implementing welfare
reforms _ have established the most connections with faith-based
groups. They provide child care, mentoring, job counseling,
tutoring, parenting classes and a myriad other services for people
trying to make the transition from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's speech, Bush mentioned one faith-based program
connected to the Department of Criminal Justice by name:
InnerChange, a voluntary program for inmates in one unit of a Sugar
Land prison, is a Bible-based rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emphasized that his administration ``will never ask an
organization to compromise its core values and spiritual mission to
get the help it needs.'' But some are troubled by the possible
pitfalls _ for both religious groups and government _ that come
with closer partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution's ``establishment clause'' states that
government must be neutral in matters of religion, and some argue
that direct payments to institutions with a clear religious
purpose, such as churches, synagogues and religious schools, is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that there should be no way that local
congregations can provide these important services. In fact, we
think often times it's the most cost-effective, sensible way to do
it,'' said Oliver Thomas, a Baptist preacher and civil rights
lawyer who advises the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there should be some conditions and regulations that
prevent establishment clause violations and allow us to maintain
both principles, that is social concern for our less fortunate
neighbors as well as our ongoing commitment to the separation of
church and state. We shouldn't be asked to sacrifice either one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that government funding of religiously affiliated
charity groups with nonreligious functions, such as Catholic
Charities and Lutheran Social Services, passes constitutional
muster. In Thursday's speech, Bush didn't delineate between
explicitly religious groups and religiously-affiliated ones, nor
did he mention safeguards to ensure that government money is being
used effectively and not for proselytizing or other religious
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also noted that the ``charitable choice'' law requires
that the government provide nonreligious alternatives to sectarian
social services, a fact that Bush also mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats opposed the ``charitable choice'' provision of
the welfare bill when it was proposed by a Republican senator,
fearing that it would blur the line between church and state. But
in recent months, the idea has gained popularity among members of
both parties. Two months ago, Democratic front-runner Al Gore
endorsed ``carefully tailored partnerships with our faith
community'' in a speech at a Salvation Army adult rehabilitation
center in Atlanta. Like Bush, Gore called for an expansion of the
``charitable choice'' provision of the welfare law.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Bush's Republican rivals also support an increased
reliance on faith-based groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor will make a great future president _ of the
American Red Cross,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for GOP
candidate and former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. ``Many of
these ideas, especially on taxes, are things that Elizabeth Dole
instituted at the Red Cross.'' Fleischer called Bush's proposals
``a series of good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Gary Bauer said many faith-based groups are
``fighting poverty more cost-efficiently and more effectively than
government.'' But he warned that ``we must continue to fight for
much lower taxes and much less government even while helping
poverty-fighting programs reach their full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to redirect tax dollars to anti-poverty
programs,'' Bauer said. ``We must also strenuously reduce taxes and
the size of government.''

IF THE PRICE ISN'T RIGHT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Congratulations! You've just been offered a terrific job with
a company you've always admired. The problem is that the salary
offer is very low _ not only when compared with industry averages,
but also in relation to other salaries at the same company. Sure,
the offer is somewhat higher than your current pay, but relocation
expenses and higher living costs in the new city will eat up the
difference. Should you push for more money, or would that hurt your
chances of getting that dream job?''
</P>
<P>
   First things first. Have no fear about asking for more money,
experts advise. Unless the person making the offer is from another
planet, she expects you to do so. If you don't, she might wonder if
you're the prize catch she thought you were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' said Leigh Steinberg, a sports agent in
Newport, Calif., who negotiates pay packages for a living. ``If you
are selling a car for $10,000 and someone walks up to you and says,
`10,000? Sure, that sounds like a great price,' and you execute the
sale, you will have a really sneaking suspicion that you
underpriced the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg advised assembling an ``aggressive'' but ``not
completely irrational'' counteroffer to the company. ``Research is
key,'' he said. But don't just look at pay scales; study the person
across the desk. ``Look at the negotiating style of the person,''
he said. ``Do they have a reputation for playing tough until the
last minute? A reputation for bullying and blustering?''
</P>
<P>
   That information will help you prepare for the coming face-off.
``You cannot let yourself be intimidated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A practice run can prove particularly helpful for people who are
uncomfortable with confrontation, he said. ``Have somebody who
talks loudly argue this out with you ahead of time,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   In the actual negotiations, use your research to show exactly
why you deserve a higher offer, in line with industry standards.
``Everyone wants to think of themselves as fair,'' Steinberg said,
so mentioning your pay concerns to the employer will make her feel
a need to respond. Maybe she doesn't have a lot of negotiating room
on salary, but perhaps she can find other sweeteners, like a
signing bonus or extra vacation.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how frustrating the process, keep your cool, said Tom
Wallace, a New York literary agent. Too often, Wallace said, people
view such negotiations as a personal rather than a business matter.
``The adrenaline starts flowing,'' he said. ``They get all red in
the face.''
</P>
<P>
   But an emotional response only undermines your position. When a
client becomes upset over an offer, Wallace said, ``I remind them
it's not meant to be a slap in the face and that we'll just say
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the negotiations, remember the minimum salary you'll
accept. If it's offered, take it, Steinberg advised, but try to
arrange for a salary review in a few months or set up performance
goals that will prompt a bonus or pay increase. If this really is
your dream job, he said, you may want to get your foot in the door
now, then prove your superior value. &QL;

   Montblanc's Clean, Well-Lighted Place &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an era of megabytes, a pen may not seem a very exciting
personal acquisition. And why buy one that costs somewhere between
$175 and $125,000? The answer, according to Montblanc, the German
maker of luxury pens is in a ``de-acceleration studio'' at its new
Manhattan store at 834 Madison Avenue, at 69th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The room, where windows are soundproof, computers are absent and
cell phones don't work, is a place ``to slow down,'' a ``spa for
the mind,'' Montblanc says. De-accelerators can listen to compact
disks, sip coffee and peruse first-edition books. They can also try
the pens _ including a $425 classic black fountain pen and a $695
stainless-steel version _ by writing letters on special paper. And
they can order custom-made pens, perhaps a $125,000 gold model
studded with diamonds, or design their own.
</P>
<P>
   If you trade in your Bic, you'll join more than 200 notables,
from President Clinton to Madonna, whom the company lists as
Montblanc owners. And who's not listed? Bill Gates.

   Taking More Chances in Trusts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans who create charitable remainder trusts _ which give
the donors income for life and pass their assets to charity at
death _ are taking bigger investment risks these days, new data
from the Internal Revenue Service show.
</P>
<P>
   The annuity version of this trust pays the donor a fixed
percentage each year. A riskier unitrust, usually invested in
stocks or mutual funds, has varying payouts.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, the number of annuity trusts grew more than
25 percent, to 20,424, while their assets grew 86 percent, to $8.4
billion. But the number of unitrusts grew more than twice as fast _
59 percent, to 61,764 _ and their value more than doubled, to $52.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey W. Comfort, president-elect of the National Committee on
Planned Giving, said the data show that ``investors in general, not
just people who make gifts to charitable remainder trusts, have
become more adjusted to investing for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The amounts donated to another kind of trust, called a
charitable lead trust and used by the very wealthy to minimize
estate taxes, fell 31 percent. In these trusts, assets like stock
in a family-owned company are donated, the income goes to charity
for 20 years, and the property then goes to the donor's heirs. The
number of lead trusts grew 21 percent, to 3,162.

   To the marketers promoting Jaguar for Men, the fragrance smells
like a blend of ``lavender, grapefruit, tangerine, basil, bergamot,
thyme, gardenia and black currant leaves'' with undertones of
``musk, fern, leather, amber and tobacco.'' In other words, it
smells like money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parfums Jaguar, a licensee of the automaker, sold more than $2
million of fragrance products last year, ranging from Jaguar
deodorant to Essentially Jaguar, a new scent for women on the
prowl.
</P>
<P>
   Other makers of high-end automobiles _ Ferrari, Bugatti,
Corvette _ also play the fragrance game, typically receiving an
annual licensing fee plus a small percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   The match of cars and colognes was made in fragrance heaven,
insisted Victor Zast, who negotiated a deal to produce Corvette
Cologne when he was an executive at Coty Inc. ``A car is seen as a
man's mistress, a way to play out a fantasy,'' said Zast, who is
now president of Private Perfumery, which manufactures
private-label products. ``And fragrance sales are based on hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Gian Luigi Longinotti-Buitoni, president of Ferrari North
America, agrees. ``The licensed product must inspire the same
emotions as the car _ speed, adrenaline pumping,'' he said. ``I'm
not selling cars; I'm selling a dream.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it a pipe dream? Longinotti-Buitoni, who wears a cologne
called Aqua Di Parma, admits that many people who buy Ferrari
fragrances can't afford Testarossas. Though, he points out,
``excitement is not bound by the dollars in the consumer's
pocket.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annette Green, director of the Fragrance Foundation, an industry
association, says she thinks that auto-fragrance tie-ins raise a
car's brand recognition among women. Further, Ms. Green said:
``Fragrance marketing depends on a visual image because you are
dealing with an ephemeral product that has none. Stores and fashion
designers have their names on fragrances; cars are the next level
of possibility.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to get spritzed with ``Reliable'' by Renault
when you walk into Bloomingdale's. Zast would seek marketing
alliances only with ``automobiles that convey an image which
transcends the car itself,'' like Land Rover, which he describes as
``rugged, adventurous.'' And how about Volvo eau de toilette for
soccer moms? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a fragrance,'' said Dan Johnston, a spokesman for
Volvo, ``it might be called `Sexy but Safe.''' &QL;

BEYOND THE SAVINGS RATE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (af) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government's announcement last month that the savings rate
was the lowest since the Depression has prompted much unease. After
all, in a time of such plenty, how can Americans not be putting
away some of their surplus to prepare for harder times?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not only just that we are spending everything we
earn. Actually, the savings rate is negative, meaning that we are
spending more than we earn. One report says baby boomers,
especially, are misbehaving, having outstanding debt equal to 95
percent of annual personal income. Are we embarrassed yet?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe we don't have to be. William G. Gale of the
Brookings Institution says that if capital gains were figured into
what we save, then the savings rate would be at its highest in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   The key here is that saving money isn't the only way to build
wealth. If you already own stock, you've generally seen its worth
soar over the last decade. And if you already own a home, chances
are its value has grown, too. The effect of such gains is that you
don't feel so compelled to save a big part of your paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The buildup of wealth ``has a tremendous influence on what
boomers do during their working lives,'' said John Gist, associate
director of the Public Policy Institute at AARP, co-author of a
study on boomers' saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they know they'll also have a pension, Social Security,''
Gist said, ``that affects how much of their income they'll save.''
</P>
<P>
   Boomers' wealth has indeed climbed steadily. Gist said that from
1984 to 1994, the latest year for which data are available, the
median net worth of boomers _ those born between 1946 and 1964 _
more than tripled, from $12,989 to $41,500 (all figures in 1994
dollars). In 1994, boomers' median wealth equaled 130 percent of
their annual salaries, versus 46 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   These are strong numbers, and capital gains are a huge part of
them. Gale and John Sabelhaus of the Congressional Budget Office,
have found that since 1995, capital gains have accounted for more
than 80 percent of growth in household net worth.
</P>
<P>
   The most comfortable beneficiaries of rising home and stock
prices have been older boomers _ those born by 1954. Gist has found
that those born later don't have the savings that older boomers had
at the same ages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, when many older boomers were in their 30s, they had an
average net worth of about $34,000, in 1994 dollars, according to
Gist. In 1994, when the younger boomers were in their 30s, their
net worth was $23,000, on average.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the older boomers are necessarily smarter. They
were just lucky enough to hit their economic stride when housing
was cheaper and income growth was stronger. They also tended to
marry younger, a factor that leads to higher savings. Ten years
later, those advantages have resulted in fat 401(k) plans and high
home equity.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1982, as stocks were climbing, older boomers ``were
starting to make very good money,'' said Ray Ferrara, of Provise
Management Group, a financial planning firm in Clearwater, Fla.
``The younger baby boomers are just now 35 and just starting to
make some decent incomes, but not as good as their older
brethren.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Gonzalez of Tampa, Fla., and her husband, David, are
younger boomers who are trying to save for a home, but it's slow
going. Although they started putting money in a universal variable
life insurance policy, which has investment value, more than 10
years ago, they didn't do much else. In the past year, they
enrolled for the first time in 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have enough money to pay our bills and have a bit of a
balance in our checking account,'' said Ms. Gonzalez, 39, a
customer service representative in the travel division of American
Express. ``We don't have a savings account or anything like that.
I'm putting some money aside, but I'm not going to kill myself now
to put every single cent I have into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains that have helped the older boomers make up for
a low savings rate, of course, could be our fool's gold. Who can
predict where markets will be by the time we retire? But we always
have been a confident generation. &QL;

 &HT;    Bush clarifies compassionate conservative agenda
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Not many Republican presidential candidates have
visited Cincinnati's predominantly black Evanston neighborhood, but
Texas Gov. George W. Bush made it the first stop of his Ohio
campaign Thursday before heading downtown to pick up a record $1
million at a hotel fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sending a message to people _ my program and my message
and my vision of America includes everybody,'' Bush said, after
perspiring through his white shirt during an anti-drug presentation
at Hope Temple Ministries, a storefront church with no windows or
air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message is to reach out across so-called traditional lines
and try to speak to people that need to be spoken to.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering that message costs money. Bush's Ohio backers did
their best to help out by selling enough tickets to the
$1,000-a-person fund-raiser at the plush Hall of Mirrors ballroom
at the Omni Netherland Hotel to raise $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Republican Chairman Robert Bennett said it was the most
money ever raised in Ohio at a single event during a primary
campaign _ more even than Bush's father, former President George
Bush, or even former President Ronald Reagan raised during their
primary campaign visits to the Buckeye state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored and thrilled,'' Bush, 53, told the 400
contributors who actually attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   At the church and in the hotel ballroom, Bush expounded on the
``compassionate conservatism'' that he has tried to make the
hallmark of his tenure as Texas governor and of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the church, Bush listened intently as the pastor, the Rev.
Carolyn Ford Griffith, told him and the small crowd _ about 40
adults and as many children _ that fighting drugs requires people
to unite across color lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a black issue. This is not a white issue. This is
not a red issue. This is not a yellow issue,'' said Griffith. Bush,
who wore no coat, seemed almost ready to oblige when she said to
fight drugs ``we've got to take the ties and coats off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I wore my tie,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors like Griffith and the 20 members of her church are the
soldiers in what Bush called the ``armies of compassion.'' His
message calls for churches and government to unite to solve social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The sweltering church, with its hand-lettered signs, contrasted
with the ballroom at the downtown hotel, which featured a high
ceiling and a gilded balcony railing. Bush, for the most part,
delivered the same message to the mostly white contributors as he
had to the mostly black church group.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity alone is not enough for America, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of prosperity is to make sure the American dream
touches every willing heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compassionate conservatism, said Bush, means confronting
illegitimacy and providing support for women having babies.
</P>
<P>
   Government has a role to play in improving society, but a
limited role. Churches and neighborhoods are the source of
America's problem-solving ability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of American never has been measured by cities of
gold but by citizens of character,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromptu press conference after the church visit, Bush
said that he was ``amused'' by charges that he is echoing some of
Vice President Al Gore's campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that any debate with Gore must wait until he wins the
Republican nomination and Gore wins the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit was the first of three major Ohio fund-raisers in
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, President Clinton is scheduled to attend a fund-raiser
for the Democratic National Committee at the home of Cincinnati
attorney Stanley Chesley. Next Thursday, Gore is to be in Cleveland
for a fund-raiser.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ The ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., a
reluctant celebrity who had found snatches of privacy aboard kayaks
and yachts, were committed to the deep Thursday afternoon during a
Roman Catholic ceremony carried out beyond the reach of long-range
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   His final rest came within sight of the beaches where he had
spent childhood summers hunting for pirate wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Three wreaths of red, yellow and white blooms trailed a Navy
destroyer, the USS Briscoe, after the committal of Kennedy, 38; his
wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette, 34, to the Atlantic Ocean, about 3 miles from the spot
where Kennedy's plane crashed Friday night as they approached
Martha's Vineyard Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The prayerful gathering of 15 family members on the Briscoe's
stern followed the wishes of Kennedy, who pulled off a private
wedding three years ago and had been schooled to avoid prying
lenses by his mother, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tanned vacationers lined docks and breakwaters all
around Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod. Out of earshot and unable to
see the ceremony, they joined in the salute by doing what so many
had done all of Kennedy's life: They peered silently.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps a fitting send-off for a man whose public face was
the sum of so many fleeting images, Mario Piaggio, 45, rode in a
moving car as he videotaped the backs of people lining a road as
they tried to spot Kennedys a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   To the end, people viewed the son of the former president as
public property. Andrea Sciarretta, 13, said she had been dismayed
that Kennedy would not be buried with his parents at the eternal
flame in Arlington National Cemetery. ``But then I remembered how
much he loved the ocean,'' she said. ``So it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Navy for the commitment at sea was possible only
because of a special dispensation from Secretary of Defense William
Cohen in response to a request from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, John
Kennedy's uncle. Usually such ceremonies are reserved for active or
retired military members, their spouses and dependent children. A
Defense Department official said the service itself did not follow
military protocol, but instead was a religious service designed by
the family.
</P>
<P>
   The big ship steamed past the clanging buoys of Vineyard Sound,
then paused on the eastern edge of the crash site, just west of a
beach in the Aquinnah (formerly Gay Head) area of Martha's Vineyard
that Mrs. Onassis had willed to her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those on shore said that they found burial at sea, as
the committal ceremony is usually called, to be a comforting finale
for this dashing risk-taker who seemed more eager to rappel solo
down a cliff than to hang out with the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming to Martha's Vineyard, and now they're here,''
said Joan M. Tessier, 68, who was digging in the sand with three of
her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle F. Henley, 32, a crossing guard watching from shore,
said she was glad Kennedy has no gravesite that could become a
shrine for tourists. ``It would have been like Graceland,'' she
said. ``Now, no one can bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The committal at sea, which is rare for an American public
figure, reflected the close connection to the water that is held by
this political family, so often photographed on piers and beaches.
Kennedy's father, President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated
before his son turned 3, had spoken of humans' ancient connection
with the sea, noting in a 1962 speech that ``we have salt in our
blood, in our sweat, in our tears.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A larger, though still intimate, memorial service for Kennedy
and his wife is planned for Friday in New York City at the Church
of St. Thomas More, which seats 350. Edward Kennedy is scheduled to
deliver the eulogy. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette, an
investment banker, is to be held Saturday in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, though, was just for the families, with Edward Kennedy
carrying his nephew's remains aboard the destroyer. The Federal
Aviation Administration closed air space for 10 nautical miles
around the Briscoe, and any boats that tried to approach were met
by a Coast Guard crew and the barked instruction, ``One mile,
captain!'' A boatload of photographers wielding fishing poles
failed to fool the Coast Guard. So all that was seen of the
ceremony during the hours-long live coverage on local and
cable-news stations was a long-distance shot of the Briscoe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Bessette family arrived early Thursday morning at the
Kennedy family compound here. At about 8:30 a.m., the two families
boarded a motorcade of sport-utility vehicles for the 22-mile trip
to the Coast Guard station at Woods Hole, on the Vineyard Sound.
The families mingled beneath three sea-blue pavilions, then a Coast
Guard cutter ferried the mourners out to the Briscoe. It was moored
about three miles away, giving the impression of a military
occupation of the tiny harbor at Woods Hole.
</P>
<P>
   The cutter tarried on the starboard side until a loudspeaker on
the Briscoe boomed a formal welcome that included the command:
``Approach!''
</P>
<P>
   The cutter, Sanibel, pulled aside the ship, steep stairs were
lowered, and mourners scrambled up. Black smoke puffed into a
cloud-specked sky as the Briscoe fired its engines.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, mourners in dark clothes joined Navy
officers in dress whites on the fantail, or back deck. The ashes
were released from the stern. A billowing flag, lowered to
half-mast, was raised as the ceremony ended and the Briscoe began
returning to harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The families, who mingled at a reception aboard the Briscoe
after it had returned to the Vineyard Sound, were on the water for
close to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Two Navy chaplains and a Catholic priest presided. Until 1963,
cremation was not permitted by the Catholic church, because of its
belief that the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, according to
the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The rule was relaxed
by the Vatican in part because of the scarcity of cemetery space in
some countries with large Catholic populations, according to a
spokeswoman for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, did not attend
the service and was seen leaving the compound with a priest late
Thursday afternoon. It was the wedding of one of her daughters,
Rory Kennedy, that was John Kennedy's destination when his plane
crashed. Among those attending the service were Mr. Kennedy's
sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and several cousins,
including William Kennedy Smith, Maria Shriver and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a note that could comfort relatives, yet came as a reminder
of an investigation that is expected to continue for many months,
the Massachusetts medical examiner's office announced Thursday that
autopsies overnight had shown that all three victims had died
instantaneously. The official cause of death was ``multiple
traumatic injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy of Kennedy showed no signs of a sudden medical
incapacitation. Also, no mechanical problem with the plane has been
found, bolstering the emerging consensus among aviation experts
that Kennedy may have become disoriented, possibly due to
visibility conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy requested that the customary photographs not be
taken during the autopsy so they could not be leaked to tabloids,
according to a family source.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Thursday's ceremony, the USS Grasp, the Navy salvage
ship that retrieved the body's, remained moored over the wreckage
as divers continued to recover chunks of the mangled craft.
Investigators said the plane was found upside down, with the roof
and wings sheared off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But these details all seemed very far off Thursday, as people
thronged lighthouses and drawbridges to peek at the Briscoe. Four
youngsters on their way home from summer school gathered daisies
and roses from residents' flower beds and tossed them under the
wheels of the family motorcade as it left Woods Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Friedman, 9, talked about all the good things Kennedy
might have done if he had lived. Daniel Walker, 10, thinks he would
have been president. But Kennedy surely would smile at the
assessment of Alex Fraenkel, 13, who declared, ``He would have made
it, even without being a Kennedy.''

COMPAQ SELECTS LITTLE-KNOWN INSIDER TO TAKE COMPANY HELM
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After looking at about 75 potential candidates, the Compaq
Computer Corp. said Thursday that it had chosen its relatively
unknown chief operating officer, Michael D. Capellas, as its
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas, 44, joined Compaq a year ago as chief information
officer and was promoted to chief operating officer only last
month. In May, Compaq dismissed its previous chief executive,
Eckhard Pfeiffer, as the company's performance teetered and lost
ground to the Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were generally skeptical and disappointed that Compaq
did not choose someone with a track record similar to that of
Carleton S. Fiorina, the Lucent Technologies executive named
earlier this week by the Hewlett-Packard Co. as its new chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most prominent reaction to Capellas is, `Who?''' said
Richard A. Shaffer, principal of Technologic Partners, a publishing
company.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarthy, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Inc., said Compaq might not have been able to attract the most
experienced executive because its chairman, Benjamin M. Rosen, the
venture capitalist who helped start Compaq in 1983, will remain in
that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capellas doesn't have the star power that people had hoped
for,'' McCarthy said. ``A cynic would say that Compaq couldn't find
anyone outside who wanted the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said, however, that Capellas became the board's first
choice after it had considered 75 potential candidates and
interviewed 12 of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at people from all sorts of backgrounds and quickly
decided that knowledge of the industry was paramount,'' Rosen said
in an interview Thursday. ``Other people would have learning curves
of three months, six months or a year. Michael is working
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said that he had been impressed with the speed at which
Capellas had taken to reorganizing Compaq during the last few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we picked Michael as COO, he locked the entire
management team in a room for three days and didn't let them out
until they agreed on how they would revitalize the company,'' Rosen
said. ``That told us something about his energy and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen denied reports that his first choices were not interested
in the position. ``There were a lot of people who said they were
interested in this job,'' he said. ``And there were people who
publicly took themselves out of the running whom we never
considered.''
</P>
<P>
   A certified public accountant, Capellas started his career with
the Republic Steel Corp. and then spent 15 years with Schlumberger
Ltd., the big oil services concern, working in financial and
corporate information systems positions. Since leaving Schlumberger
in 1996, Capellas' career has been a whirlwind. He worked for six
months in a small Boston consulting firm, with SAP America and at
Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   At Oracle, Capellas supervised the company's products and sales
to the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a solid manager and I would hire him in a heartbeat,''
said Robert Shaw, Capellas' boss at Oracle and now chief executive
of USWeb/CKS, an Internet services company. ``He would sit back,
listen, ask the hard questions and then make a decision. He didn't
`meeting' something to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems Inc., a
software company that does a lot of business with Compaq, said that
he had been very impressed with Capellas in his dealings with him
over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a big-picture guy,'' Siebel said. ``He understands the
problems of large corporations and how to sell to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of Capellas' initial challenge will be to bring
order to the sprawling line of high-end corporate systems Compaq
inherited with its acquisitions of Tandem Computers and Digital
Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas said Compaq would keep the product lines from both
companies as well as Compaq's own line of high-end servers. But
next month it will pare the number of computer models it offers to
help reduce inventory costs and to make its offerings clearer to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, he said the company would refocus all of its
efforts around building hardware that can be used with the
Internet. The larger machines will be aimed at companies running
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer business will be focused on workers who
connect to the Internet at their desks. And Compaq's Presario line
of home computers will be expanded to include cheaper ``Internet
appliances'' that will be intended exclusively for Web surfing.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these areas, he said, Compaq will supplement hardware
sales with services. For big companies, this means custom
programming and operations assistance. For consumers, the company
hopes to offer Internet access and online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he hinted that Compaq would be more
discriminating in the markets it goes after than the very ambitious
expansion program led by Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want profitable growth,'' he said at a meeting with
investors. ``That doesn't mean growth at all costs.'' &UR;  &LR;

MOVING COMPANY SAYS WAL-MART HEIRESS WON'T PAY HER BILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After schlepping stuff from a posh Manhattan
apartment all the way to a sprawling Texas ranch, a moving company
is dragging one of America's richest women into court.
</P>
<P>
   United Van Lines is suing Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton,
asserting that she stiffed the company on a $14,000-plus moving
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Walton contends that the movers damaged her property when they
trucked it in January from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to Palo
Pinto County, Texas. The daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton,
Alice Walton is tied with her mother as the country's richest
woman, with an estimated $16 billion apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was significant damage done to some of Ms. Walton's
personal property,'' said Jay Allen, a spokesman for the Walton
family in Bentonville, Ark. ``The bill is in dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen declined to say what was damaged but suggested the
property has significant personal and financial value _ probably
not purchased at Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a toaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   United Van Lines filed the suit Wednesday in federal court in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transportation charges accruing from the interstate
transportation of Defendant Walton's personal property and
household goods are $14,323.84, of which none has been paid,'' the
suit states.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hallman, a Dallas attorney for the Missouri-based moving
company, declined to discuss the suit. He said he could not respond
to Walton's damage allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't comment on litigation in public,'' Hallman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute apparently was the only bump in the road between New
York and Texas. Walton said she had no trouble pulling up stakes at
one of Manhattan's poshest addresses for decidedly down-home
Mineral Wells.
</P>
<P>
   An avid horsewoman who wanted to be close to Fort Worth's
cutting horse scene, Walton said she never really lived in
Manhattan. She resided on a ranch in northwest Arkansas and used
the New York apartment ``just for business.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-floor apartment she quit, at 39 East 79th St., sits on a
Madison Avenue corner a block from Central Park and near the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a circular staircase, park views
in every major room and a 15-foot ceiling in a space that once
served as Emily Post's ballroom, according to information listed
with a Manhattan real estate agency.
</P>
<P>
   Walton put the seven-room, 2,800-square-foot apartment up for
sale. She is asking $3.3 million, and she is not looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love being down here,'' Walton said Thursday as she prepared
to ride Scatter Hickory, a 6-year-old gelding, in the National
Cutting Horse Association Summer Cutting Spectacular at Will Rogers
Memorial Coliseum in Fort Worth. She declined to discuss the flap
with United.
</P>
<P>
   Walton isn't exactly roughing it in her new digs. Located along
the Brazos River and U.S. 281, her ranch covers 3,200 rolling
acres. The single-story, white stucco main house has cathedral
ceilings, Southwestern tile and marble. The home is 4,432 square
feet, Palo Pinto County Appraisal District records show. The
property is appraised at more than $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those luxuries aside, Walton is clearly kin to the Wal-Mart
founder, who was famous for driving a beat-up pickup even after his
discount department stores made him fabulously wealthy. Walton came
off like a regular gal Thursday, dressed in a white straw hat, a
western shirt and dirty boots.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting ringside in the coliseum, Walton happily dug into a
hamburger before saddling up. She showed no sign of longing for the
``light Italian'' restaurant across the street from her New York
apartment. Serafina's has frescoes on its walls and shaved Parmesan
on its arugula salads. But not a horse in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Walton said Wednesday, ``is my speed here.''

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Along with 10,000 other lucky souls, I
recently received a brand-new personal computer for the low, low
price of nothing. The only catch is, it is trying to wrest away
control of my brain.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, called a Free-PC and sent by a company of the same
name in Pasadena, Calif., is part of a new concept in computer
distribution. Users pay not a dime for the PC, but they have to pay
it attention, specifically to the perpetual presence of advertising
on an inch-wide vertical strip on the right edge of the screen and
an inch-and-a half strip along the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Colorful high-tech enticements swirl with animation, pleading to
remove me from the task at hand, be it word processing, surfing the
Net or sending e-mail. If Times Square and the Home Shopping
Network were to mate, the offspring would look like this screen _
as if, at any moment, Michael Jordan might pop out and try to sign
me up for MCI.
</P>
<P>
   But the masses seem amply ready to ante up their eyeballs. After
Free-PC Inc. announced earlier this year that it would give away
10,000 PCs with Internet service, more than a million people signed
up. In applying, they had to answer 37 personal questions online
(about marital status, pet ownership, entertainment tastes and so
forth), so Free-PC could load up their computers with focused
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The winners were chosen at random (the company agreed to supply
my computer separately), and Free-PC plans to study the launch to
determine whether to dole out more.
</P>
<P>
   But are we ready to stare down Madison Avenue 24 hours a day,
and have it stare right back, especially during intimate moments
spent writing love letters or playing Tetris?
</P>
<P>
   W. Frank Johnson thinks so. ``If this doesn't work for you, I'll
take it off of your hands,'' said Johnson, my Federal Express
delivery man, when he brought my PC. Expressing an oft-heard
sentiment among Free-PC believers, he said the constant flow of
advertising was a small price to pay for an otherwise free ride,
and that, besides, you could always try to ignore the pitches.
</P>
<P>
   I concede, at least, that a new, free computer can be a sweet
deal. The Free-PC offering is a Compaq Presario with a 333
megahertz processor, 4.5-gigabyte hard drive and 56K modem. That's
a $500 value, plus unlimited Internet service that usually runs
$19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Given the falling prices of PCs, other companies like
Intersquid.com and Direct Web, are giving them away, too, but their
deals require paying for monthly Internet access. For now, Free-PC
is the only company that trades a machine and the service for a bit
of your subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   As for the machine, in a few days of tests it performed on a par
with any other new PC, meaning that it crashed periodically and for
no apparent reason. On several occasions, I could not log on to the
Internet, the computer froze when more than one window was open,
and some bug interfered repeatedly with the most important activity
on any computer _ playing solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I couldn't get Free-PC's technical support on the phone;
the number was busy each of the four or five times I called over
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on an advertisement occasionally brought up the wrong
Web sites. In one case, I clicked on the commercial for a home loan
service and wound up at a site advertising software to eliminate
computer bugs. (In addition to its other features, the Free-PC
evidently comes with a strong sense of humor.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the advertising, I can say one thing with certainty:
There is plenty of it. And it squeezed the rest of the viewable
screen from 14 inches diagonal to about 11. As a result, while the
ads are vivid (and from the likes of Amazon.com, Ebay and CDnow), I
sometimes had to squint to see smaller type _ the Web addresses I
entered, for example. After an hour, I would have gladly clicked on
an ad for eye drops.
</P>
<P>
   And when I called up a Web page that included a banner ad, half
to two-thirds of the screen was filled with blinking, animated
commercials. It was akin to watching ``Must See TV'' in the center
of the screen while Honda hawked the Accord on one side and Taco
Bell touted the Burrito Supreme on the other. To me, it was more
like ``Must Smash TV.''
</P>
<P>
   I would like to report that I was immune to the advertisers'
temptations. But that would make it difficult to explain how I
wound up on CDnow, checking out the new Liz Phair album, and
exploring air fares on Farefinder. In a moment of boredom, I also
considered filling out an application, found on a mortgage site, to
refinance a home. (That would have been particularly odd, since I'm
not a homeowner.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my susceptibility explains why some advertisers are
ecstatic about the prospects. ``The most valuable real estate in
the world is the computer desktop,'' said Rich LeFurgy, chairman of
the Internet Advertising Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On a subsequent delivery, Johnson, the Federal Express man, took
another look at the Free-PC and said the ubiquitous advertising
wouldn't bother him a bit. ``Our brain is capable of ignoring the
advertising,'' he told me confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I said to myself, that's what I used to think, too. Now
tell me where to sign for my new Liz Phair CD.

ALBANY DEAL ON SPENDING CLEARS THE WAY FOR A LONG-DELAYED BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders
removed the last major obstacle to a new state budget Thursday,
reaching agreement on a plan to spend more than $700 million on
school repairs, new housing for the mentally ill, highway projects
and a smattering of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends a bitter and protracted stalemate and clears the
way for the adoption of a new $73 billion budget that rejects many
of the cuts Pataki had sought in education and health care. It
keeps $1.8 billion in a reserve fund to hedge against a downturn in
the economy and to make up for revenue lost to future tax cuts.
Pataki had insisted on the reserve fund as part of any final budget
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was due April 1, but for the 15th straight year,
state leaders failed to meet that deadline. The record for a state
budget delay came in 1997, when it was 122 days past the deadline.
As of Friday, the budget is 114 days overdue. The Legislature is
expected to begin the final work next week, according to aides to
Pataki and legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very happy occasion,'' said Senate Republican
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno on Thursday morning during a hearing
with members of the both houses of the Legislature. ``We are making
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Thursday by Pataki, Bruno and Democratic
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver resolves the most divisive issues
that had held up a final budget agreement. But aides to Pataki and
legislative leaders cautioned that some details still had to be
worked out. The process could also be slowed down by the arduous
task of translating the deal into the arcane language of
legislation, a process that often leads to blow-ups that can derail
a deal, if only momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   The additional spending that the leaders agreed on, totaling
$710 million, is not expected to have a significant impact on this
year's final budget, largely because it is based on borrowing and
tax cuts that will take effect in future budget years, legislative
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan sets aside $250 million to pay for new tax cuts, most
of them having been sought by Pataki and his Republican allies in
the Senate. The majority of those tax cuts, about $150 million,
would apply to banks and insurance companies, legislative aides in
both parties said. The remaining $100 million in tax cuts is still
being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, $145 million would be spent to repair
schools; $50 million to build supervised apartments for the
mentally ill; $15 million to add new publicly financed day care
slots for low-income families, and $15 million to provide
affordable housing for the poor. Those proposals are supported, for
the most part, by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes about $235 million to pay for programs
championed by the Republican majority in the Senate: $160 million
for highway projects, mostly outside New York City, and $75 million
for a job development plan to help beleaguered upstate communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring any unforeseen problems, we expect the budget to be
resolved relatively soon,'' said Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for the
governor. ``Hopefully, the entire budget will be done within the
next 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations over this year's budget were thwarted by the
deep level of mistrust that has grown between Pataki and Silver.
Last year, both houses of the Legislature passed a spending plan
that provided large election-year increases to all sorts of
constituencies. But Pataki vetoed $1.6 billion in programs, mostly
those supported by Silver and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Silver sought to prevent that from happening again this year.
But Pataki did not give any assurances that he would not make
widespread use of his veto pen until last week, when he and
legislative leaders agreed on the broad outlines of a $73 billion
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The deal spends about $1.1 billion more than Pataki had proposed
in January but allows the governor to achieve one of his main
objectives in the budget: saving $1.8 billion from the budget
surplus that accumulated in the fiscal year that ended March 31.
Pataki wanted the savings to pay for tax cuts that have been
enacted into law but take effect in future years.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki's Democratic rivals have some things to cheer about
in the final budget deal. Democrats saved one of their most
cherished programs: one that pays for prekindergarten classes,
all-day kindergarten and smaller class sizes in the early grades.
Pataki had proposed eliminating the program and replacing it with a
smaller block grant that school districts could use as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the future of the program is unclear, because Pataki has
refused to make it a permanent program, as Democrats have demanded.
The budget will also increase overall aid to school districts by
$910 million, an 8 percent increase over last year.

PAUL FLATO, JEWELER TO STARS ON SCREEN AND OFF, DIES AT 98 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Flato, the innovative American jeweler whose diamonds were
worn by Hollywood stars like Greta Garbo, Rita Hayworth and Merle
Oberon, died Saturday in a nursing home in Ft. Worth. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, he counted both socialites and movie stars as
clients and his creations were seen in a number of films.
</P>
<P>
   Flato jewels adorned Merle Oberon in ``That Uncertain Feeling,''
Rita Hayworth in ``Blood and Sand'' and Greta Garbo in ``Two-Faced
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Flato began his career as a watch salesman in New York in the
early 1920s and soon opened his own jewelry business on East 57th
Street in Manhattan. Within a short time he was one of the
best-known jewelers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first of the major American jewelers to do highly
imaginative work on a par with European jewelers,'' said Penny
Proddow, a jewelry historian and co-author with Marion Fasel of
several books, including ``A Century of Spectacular Jewelry''
(1996). ``He would take his ideas to his four designers _ they were
his hands _ and they would go on from there to his workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 drawings, from his peak years in the late '30s and
early '40s, sold at a Christie's auction in 1994 for almost
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Inspiration came from everything from a fallen leaf to museum
paintings and furniture. A compact for Elizabeth Arden took shape
in his mind after he saw a rush-bottomed chair in the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   He fashioned platinum and diamond jewelry in flowers, ribbons
and scrolls. An apple blossom necklace for Lily Pons, the opera
singer, wrapped around the neck and opened in the front with
diamond blossoms cascading on either side. A rose became a rambler
that twined around the wrist on a baguette-cut diamond stem
sprouting rose-cut diamond buds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating ``important'' pieces, Flato was an early
proponent of whimsical jewels. Among them were a diamond ``corset''
bracelet, with garters in rubies and diamonds, based on Mae West's
undergarment; a bracelet, aptly named the ``gold digger,''
featuring a gold pickax, and black enamel sign language initial
clips for Katharine Hepburn, among the many pieces he did for the
1938 film ``Holiday.'' A compact for Gloria Vanderbilt was studded
with gold and enamel angels, including an angel on a chamber pot. A
pair of little brooches of gold feet with ruby toenails was
originally made for Irene Castle, a play both on her maiden name,
Foote, and her dancing career.
</P>
<P>
   Flato was born in 1900 in Shiner, Tex., and attended the
University of Texas in Austin. He moved to New York in the early
1920s to attend medical school, but his plans were thwarted when
his father, a Texas cattleman, ran into financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, Flato was convicted of fraudulently obtaining and
disposing of jewels from colleagues. He spent many of his last
years in Mexico, where he first went in 1945 after pleading guilty
and serving 16 months in a federal prison for obtaining jewels on
consignment from fellow jewelers and pawning them.
</P>
<P>
   He lived there for almost eight years, fighting extradition on
further charges of grand larceny and forgery involving more than
$60,000 in gems that had been entrusted to him by dealers. He
returned to the United States in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he returned to Mexico, opened a jewelry shop in Mexico
City and spent two decades there, returning to Texas in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Flato is survived by three daughters, Catharine Dennis of
Dallas, Barbara McCluer of Ft. Worth and Susan Flato of Manhattan;
a grandson and six great-grandchildren.

MEMORIAL MASS PAYS TRIBUTE TO CRASH VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city paid mournful tribute to John F. Kennedy Jr.
Thursday night as 1,000 people crowded into a memorial Mass at a
downtown Manhattan church. Nearly 3,000 more waited outside for the
street procession that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Emerald Isle Immigration Center, one of the city's
Irish-American groups, organized the service as a ``people's Mass''
for mourners who are not invited to this morning's family Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had any idea so many would turn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't realize the extent to which not just the Irish
community but the New York community considered him family,'' Rev.
Colm Campbell, of the Irish Apostolate, said from the pulpit of Old
St. Patrick's Cathedral, a grand 200-year-old Gothic structure on
the edge of SoHo and Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're overwhelmed but also delighted that you're here,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   A bagpipe band from Queens, the Pipes of County Tyrone, which
was founded in 1933, played as the mourners entered the church, and
again, an hour later, as they marched out in single file, past the
apartments, cafes and along Mott, Prince and Mulberry streets.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds lining the sidewalks _ five and 10 deep _ stood
solemnly behind police lines, some of them taking pictures or
videos of the priests and people walking by, some crossing
themselves, a few saluting.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass inside the cathedral, Irish tunes _ ``My Lagan
Love,'' ``The Culain,'' ``Danny Boy'' _ alternated with church
hymns.
</P>
<P>
   Three candles burned on the alter, representing baptismal
candles for Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, who all died in Friday night's plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent Shriver, John Jr.'s uncle, sat quietly in a front pew,
representing the family. The other thousand in attendance were, by
and large, just New Yorkers who somehow felt they had known ``John
John'' _ as one of the priests repeatedly called him in his eulogy
_ all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this kid grow up,'' said Lenore Smith, 49, a clerical
worker for the city who _ like many of those who made it inside the
church _ had stood in line for two hours before the service. ``He's
a guy you didn't hear anything bad about _ no scandals, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I met with John Kennedy,'' said Lesliann Scott, who came in
from Brooklyn. ``I passed him once on the street and said 'Hi.' He
said 'Hi' back to me, very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Walsh, a court reporter who lives on Long Island, had met
Kennedy several times when he was an assistant district attorney.
``I was at RFK's wake at St Pat's. I can't believe I'm at this St.
Pat's for John Jr.,'' she said. ``I had to be here, out of respect
for what the family has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who eulogized him from the pulpit evoked grand, even
romantic imagery. ``If the Kennedy family is America's royalty,
then John Jr. was the people's prince,'' said Carolyn Ryan,
executive director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never asked what we could do for him,'' she went on,
paraphrasing the famous phrase from President Kennedy's inaugural
address, ``but what he could do for us, for he was one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Cook, an Atlanta architect who said he was a close friend
of Kennedy's, called him ``our generation's most shining light''
who ``would want to compel each of you to be the hope of your
generation, in whatever way for you is best.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Keith Fennessy, pastor of the cathedral, quoted Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's line after President Kennedy was killed _ ``Part
of being Irish is knowing that someday the world will break your
heart'' _ and added, ``We all feel very Irish tonight.''

 &HT;    Man worms way into fertilizers
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Tony Barrier believes in earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a former construction worker invest $200,000 of
his own money in a business that most would consider for the birds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing something very positive for the agriculture and
horticulture industries,'' said Barrier, whose Lake Worth-based
Earth Care Products Inc. produces and sells earthworm castings as
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The castings, or excrement, are rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium. Most important, they are 100 percent natural.
</P>
<P>
   Barrier, who is the company's sole employee, sells three
products under his Gold Worm brand at about 50 retail outlets in
Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Worm products include potting and lawn mixes.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-pound bag of Gold Worm castings retails for between $7 and
$10. While the cost of a 50-pound bag of inexpensive chemical
fertilizer is also in the $10 range, much of that is filler used to
help move it through a spreader.
</P>
<P>
   ``My product has no fillers,'' said Barrier, who started the
business about two years ago after buying about 300,000 African
night crawlers from a Kentucky farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Today he has an estimated 1 million worms, which are nestled in
drawers stacked in metal shelving units on a farm west of Delray
Beach. The worms live in and eat a mix of ground Florida peat and
grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have voracious appetites,'' Barrier said. ``They eat
their weight every day.''
</P>
<P>
   After about two weeks, the food has turned to mostly castings.
At that point, the drawer's contents are fed into a rotating mesh
cylinder that separates worm castings from uneaten food and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The odorless castings are dried and bagged for sale, the food is
recycled and the worms and eggs are dumped into a drawer of fresh
food to begin the cycle again.
</P>
<P>
   The worms reproduce rapidly, so there is no need to buy
additional night crawlers. In fact, Barrier has sold some to bait
shops for extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Earthworm castings are produced commercially in California and
in the Midwest, but Barrier said he's the only producer in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Earth Care Products had revenue of about $110,000 this past
year, and Barrier expects that to reach $250,000 by spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The business, which produces about a ton of castings a day, is
finally making a profit, Barrier said. He hopes to get a bank loan
or investor to help expand production and move the business to land
he bought west of Lake Worth.

17 COMPANIES WERE BIG SITES OF BUSH GIVING

   WASHINGTON _ Individuals connected with 17 corporations or firms
combined to give $50,000 or more to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
with the partners, associates and employees of one Houston law firm
contributing a total of $184,850 to Bush's presidential campaign, a
study released Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Bush campaign has raised a record $37 million in
just four months. Three of Bush's Pioneers, supporters who each
pledged to raise at least $100,000 in contributions, work with the
Houston law firm Vinson &AMP; Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics,
revealed Thursday that employees of at least 22 organizations
coordinated their giving to donate $50,000 or more to several
presidential candidates. Leaders of the center, a nonpartisan study
group based here, said the information demonstrated a sharp rise in
the use of coordinated contributions. Some employee groups gave to
more than one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Vice President Al Gore received at least $50,000
from individuals and political action committees connected to four
corporations, the study said. Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey
senator who has closed the fund-raising gap with Gore, got at least
$50,000 each from six organizations, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Worldwide, the accounting business, ranked second among
Bush's contributors, with $120,450 coming from its employees. Gore
received $114,200 from individuals linked to the accounting firm
Ernest &AMP; Young, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, a maker of assault rifles resigned Thursday
as Bush's chief fund-raiser in Maine after reporters inquired about
him. The official, Richard Dyke, the owner of Bushmaster Firearms
in Windham, Maine, said he offered his resignation, which was
accepted, because he did not want to become a distraction for
Bush's campaign.

SHOE MAKER K-SWISS NEARLY TRIPLES 1998's 2ND QUARTER TAKE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Athletic shoe maker K-Swiss Inc.
said Thursday that second-quarter net earnings nearly tripled
compared with the like year-ago period, easily beating analysts's
expectations by about 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the three-month period ended June 30, net earnings were
$6.74 million, compared with $2.26 million earned in the same
period last year. Diluted earnings per share were 58 cents, up from
20 cents last year and well above the 46-cent estimate of analysts
surveyed by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Per-share earnings reflect the two-for-one stock split
distributed March 26 to stockholders of record as of March 15, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the period were $67.17 million, up nearly 64
percent from $41.02 million, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, worldwide revenues increased nearly 64
percent to $67.17 million and domestic revenues jumped 71.3 percent
to $62.91 million.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the company, based on the western edge of Los
Angeles County, attributed its record earnings to a new marketing
campaign, product segmentation and expansion.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss shares increased $1.3125, or 3 percent, to $46 on
Thursday. The earnings were released after the market closed.

HOUSE WITHHOLDS FUNDS FOR F-22 FIGHTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The F-22 fighter jet was defeated in battle in
Congress on Thursday night, as the House voted overwhelmingly for a
military spending bill that withholds $1.8 billion to buy the first
six of the 21st-century warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But the war is not over. The fight over the $70 billion F-22
program now moves to a House-Senate conference, which may not take
place until September.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Thursday night's 379-45 vote for the $266
billion military spending bill ``was the vote on the F-22,'' said
Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., and the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, who led the fight
to remove the funds for the planes from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill passed on Thursday night spends about half the
money available to Congress to finance federal agencies. It
provides a $15.5 billion increase over the appropriation for the
1999 fiscal year _ a huge rise in comparison to the cuts and
freezes being imposed on most domestic spending bills this year,
and $2.8 billion more than what the White House and the Pentagon
requested. It includes $90.2 billion for research, development and
purchase of new new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a number of measures intended to increase military
readiness, recruitment and retention. It would boost pay for 1.4
million active-duty military personnel by 4.8 percent and add
nearly $600 million for recruiting and retaining personnel and
improving the quality of their lives in service.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would spend the $1.8 billion intended to buy the
first six F-22s on pay hikes and bonuses for Air Force pilots, on
additional F-15 and F-16 jets, models already in the arsenal, and
on developing the Joint Strike Fighter, one of three new fighter
aircraft that the Pentagon wants to build.
</P>
<P>
   That decision underscores the House Appropriations
subcommittee's position that military priorities need to be
redirected from an intense focus on a few hugely expensive
high-tech programs to basic requirements like spare parts, training
and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming days, the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, the
giant military contractor that makes the F-22, will lobby Congress
heavily, as they have all week, to get the money back, using
classified briefings and reminding members of the jobs and money
that the plane creates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, the Air Force persuaded House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, who had opposed the money for the planes until that
moment, to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his position,'' said his spokesman, John Feehery.
``He met with the Air Force and he felt they made a compelling
case. He's willing to take another look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, the core supporters of the F-22 in the
House, knowing they were outnumbered, did not even put up a fight.
They had planned to offer an amendment restoring the funds, but did
not. Their debating was desultory. Some read prepared speeches that
lifted lofty language from Lockheed Martin's promotional materials
for the futuristic fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were more blunt. The F-22, said Rep. David Obey of
Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, is a ``billion-dollar cancer eating a hole in the Air
Force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved the money for the first of the fighters;
key senators say they will fight for the program, and President
Clinton and Defense Secretary William Cohen say they want the money
restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my intention to try to persuade the Senate'' otherwise,
Lewis said. ``It will be a head-on collision, in some ways, and a
full-scale debate.''

MICROSOFT TELLS ANALYSTS THE FUTURE IS GOOD, SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In summing up its year for financial analysts and
investors Thursday, a supremely confident Microsoft Corp. gave few
indications that it felt embattled in its legal struggle with the
Justice Department over antitrust issues. In fact, it defiantly
asserted that these are the best of times for the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting for analysts, the company has
traditionally warned Wall Street of potential doom and gloom on the
horizon. But this year, on the heels of a fourth-quarter report
showing overall margins of about 38 percent, the usual warnings
seemed to lack conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Asia we saw 20 percent revenue growth this year,''
said Jeff Raikes, a Microsoft group vice president. Over all, the
company's revenue grew by 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's president, Steven Ballmer, said that 99 million
Windows-based personal computers were sold in the last year, a
global growth rate of 14 percent. The numbers appeared to overwhelm
even the normally unflappable Ballmer, who is one of Gates' closest
business associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we were a little naive about what was possible,'' he
said. Indeed, Raikes began the morning with an impassioned defense
of the traditional PC business, noting that attempts by competitors
to build alternatives to the desktop PC have all failed.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the explosive growth of the Internet is
presenting the company with new challenges, but insisted that the
Windows PC market remained unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe in the power of the computer at the center, but
we also believe in the power of the computer in the hands of the
people,'' Raikes said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also announced early Thursday morning that it was
mounting an all-out attack on a market currently dominated by
America Online _ instant-messaging software.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual shift, Microsoft said it had reverse-engineered
the proprietary communication standard used in America Online's
popular Instant Messenger program.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online angrily denounced the product, saying it went
far beyond reverse-engineering _ the practice of writing new code
to mimic the behavior of a program or piece of hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is akin to the practices of hackers,'' said Ann
Brackbill, an America Online spokeswoman. She said that the
Microsoft Messenger program violated proprietary information and
that her company was considering its response.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Microsoft's presentations appeared to contradict each
other. Both Ballmer and Raikes repeatedly said that the company was
facing its fiercest competition in many years. Yet other Microsoft
executives cited industry data indicating that the company was
handily vanquishing its competition.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in its core corporate sales areas, a Microsoft
executive said that in the last year Microsoft's NT operating
system for corporate computing had outgrown competition from both
Novell and Unix operating systems by rates of two to one and three
to one.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ballmer took particular note of Linux, a free
version of the Unix operating system that is widely seen as a
significant competitive threat to Microsoft, particularly among
corporate users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unix phenomenon is scary,'' he said. ``It doesn't go away.
Linux is a serious, albeit crazy, implementation of Unix on the
Intel platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent reports that Microsoft has begun experiencing an
increasing rate of departure of executives, the company insisted
Thaursday that its overall corporate attrition rate is only 7.4
percent annually, less than half the nationwide 15.3 percent
average for high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer appeared frustrated Thursday that analysts did not
appear to be accepting the company's attempts to lower financial
expectations for the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   When the company polled the analysts in attendance, 44 percent
said they believed the company's revenues would grow by more than
25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on. It's outlandish and crazy,'' Ballmer shouted at the
audience. ``We have more competition than ever before. We have the
law of large numbers to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the remarkable performance in its core software
businesses, Greg Mafei, Microsoft's chief financial officer,
displayed a chart indicating growing losses in consumer and
electronic-commerce businesses. ``We are still searching for
profitability, and the trend has not been positive to date,'' he
said.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The timing of the unveiling could not be any more perfect, if I
do say so myself.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy news and memorials crowd the airwaves; cable and network
news' viewership has skyrocketed. The second anniversary of
Princess Diana's death looms on August 31st; expect a rash of
retrospectives. TWA Flight 800 crashed in Florida almost three
years ago to the day. No doubt this will be marked by yards of
videotape featuring the ashen-faced next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   You will see all these stories and more on Dateline, Larry King
Live, 20/20, 48 Hours and Geraldo Live. Sadly, those shows end
after a mere hour, at most.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine if the coverage went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty fours, seven days a week, I am talking. Imagine nothing
but disaster and death, celebrities and death, bad graphics and
death.
</P>
<P>
   That's my dream, soon to be a reality.
</P>
<P>
   I call it The Tragedy Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The line of investors forms to the right. The line of brain-dead
potential viewers already stretches, one couch at a time, from sea
to shining sea.
</P>
<P>
   As the channel's creator and self-appointed CEO, allow me to
kick things off with the following brief press release:
</P>
<P>
   ``Set to begin broadcasting ASAP, The Tragedy Channel will
feature the same `wall-to-wall tragedy coverage' viewers have come
to expect from the networks, only better. We'll shove even more
cameras in even more grieving faces, ask `How does it feel?' even
more often, and use even grimmer slow-motion montages of the
deceased. There's absolutely no way this can miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not with the Tragedy Channel's fancy new logo.
</P>
<P>
   NBC can have the peacock. We've got the vulture.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Tragedy Channel programming line-up has started to
take shape. Mornings, adults and kids in need of a downer to start
the day can begin with a cartoon _ Good Grief, Charlie Brown _ in
which all your favorite Peanuts characters try to ``get closure''
after one untimely passing or another.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the Tragedy Channel's game show, the certain hit Name
that Epitaph. An excerpt from the pilot episode:
</P>
<P>
   Host: ``For $100, his gravestone reads `The Father of American
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant 1: ``Who is Walter Camp?''
</P>
<P>
   Host: ``You are absolutely right!''
</P>
<P>
   Gives you chills, I know. Of course, these days what doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   Afternoons, we'll go with As the World Burns, featuring tales of
tragic house fires, followed by Murder, He Committed and CRASH, a
series devoted entirely to Princess Diana car crash conspiracy
theories.
</P>
<P>
   Evenings, we'll begin with Dateline reruns _ they already fit
perfectly into the Tragedy Channel format _ then segue to Amazing
Videos of Death. After that, we'll air our lone sitcom _ Just
Assassinate Me _ then your regularly scheduled local news, followed
by our nightly sports wrap-up show, The Police Blotter, hosted by
Marv Albert.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in late-night reruns of Di's funeral and repeats of all the
relevant JFK Jr. memorial services and I think that about covers
it. Finally, this country will have exactly what it craves:
Tragedy, morning, noon and night.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking we'll use a steady diet of Frank Sinatra and John
Denver as theme music, and that, for a big name, we might be able
to lure away ABC's star anchorwoman, Diane Sawyer _ after she
returns from her JFK Jr.-inspired grief leave, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Your new CEO's fearless prediction: The Tragedy Channel
immediately trumps wrestling in the cable Nielsens and quickly
becomes the darling of the television industry. You'll pardon me
now, I hope, because I have to go focus group our first
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   I borrowed the tagline from Ronald Reagan's old campaign ads.
Who could resist it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tragedy Channel. It's mourning in America.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ The freshly painted hardwoods of Staples Center
will be christened by the Clippers _ not the Lakers _ when the
1999-2000 NBA season begins Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers host the Seattle SuperSonics on Nov. 2, according
to the NBA schedule released Thursday. The Lakers play that night
at Utah, then return home for their Staples debut on Nov. 3 against
the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   The co-tenants will play just one doubleheader, on Jan. 17 _
Lakers-Sonics at 12:30 p.m., Clippers-San Antonio Spurs at 7:30.
There will be five NBA-NHL doubleheaders, all involving the
Clippers and Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers and Clippers won't play for home-turf bragging
rights until Dec. 14, the first game in a series of four.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers don't face the defending NBA champion Spurs, who
eliminated them from the playoffs, until Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   New Lakers coach Phil Jackson takes on his former team for the
first time on Nov. 19, when the Chicago Bulls and No. 1 draft pick
Elton Brand come to Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lakers Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell make their first
return to L.A. on Jan. 7, with the Charlotte Hornets. But the real
homecoming week is in February, when the Lakers begin a six-game
road trip with consecutive stops in Chicago (Jackson), Charlotte
(Glen Rice) and Orlando (Shaquille O'Neal).
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' longest road trip will take them through seven
cities in 10 days in February _ Miami, Orlando, Charlotte, Chicago,
New York, Philadelphia and Minnesota.

UMPS UNITE AS BASEBALL HIRES BACKUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Undaunted by the prospect that their careers could end any day,
major league baseball umpires contended Thursday that they had
stemmed the tide of defections from their ranks. At the same time,
however, Major League Baseball began hiring minor league umpires as
replacements for major leaguers who are resigning as of Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball's highest-ranking officials met with commissioner
Bud Selig in Milwaukee to discuss all the issues raised by the mass
resignations, 51 umpires held a lengthy conference call with their
leader, Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 50 umpires on that phone call today and not one
dissenter,'' Joe West, a 22-year National League veteran, said.
</P>
<P>
   By holding together, though, the umpires may simply be laying
the groundwork for a mass exodus if Major League Baseball accepts
their resignations, which it is expected to do in the very near
future. That step was one of the primary topics of discussion in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips himself disclosed the news that 10 minor league umpires
had been hired, but he said officials were acting on his
long-standing request to hire new umpires to bolster the staffs of
the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   When that explanation was repeated to a baseball official, he
said, ``These guys are being hired to replace umpires, not for any
other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires, who have served as fill-ins in both leagues this
season, include C.B. Bucknor, Greg Gibson, Mark Wegner, Brian
O'Nora, Ron Kulpa, Fieldin Culbreth and Brian Runge, son of Paul
Runge, a former umpire himself and the National League's executive
director of umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the position of union umpires remained fluid.
</P>
<P>
   After its conference call, the union, known as the Major League
Umpires Association, announced that three umpires who had not
previously joined the resignation ranks signed letters of
resignation. Greg Bonin of the NL and Drew Coble and Ted Hendry of
the American League had not attended the umpires meeting in
Philadelphia last week and thus did not resign at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The union also announced that Greg Kosc, an AL umpire, asked the
league to reinstate his resignation and disregard the letter in
which he rescinded his resignation. It had not been previously
known that he had rescinded it.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he spoke Thursday to two other umpires who he said
were reinstating their resignations. He declined to identify them,
but another umpire said one was Larry Barnett, who in his 31st year
is the senior AL umpire.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips also acknowledged that Tim Welke of the AL had
resigned Tuesday from the union's board of directors and rescinded
the resignation letter he signed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he resigned because he thinks I have used minor league
umpires in support of the major league umpires effort,'' Phillips
said. ``That is exactly the opposite of what could be true. I have
advised the minor league umpires to be very temperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rippley, a member of the board, said he didn't believe
Welke's departure ``is critical to our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a very large nucleus of people who understand
what's going on,'' he said. ``Some people have rescinded on a lot
of hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires who haven't rescinded their resignations face the
prospect of ending their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problems with that at all,'' Rippley, an NL umpire
since 1983, said when asked if he was prepared for that
development. ``I knew what I was getting into when I signed that
thing and I understood what the ramifications could be. I'd rather
go out and seek other employment than work in the conditions
they've put us in. If it comes to that, I'll have to live with my
decision and go on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   West said umpires were making contingency plans. ``We're
preparing for the worst,'' he said. ``We like our jobs; we enjoy
umpiring. But we knew going in what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And if his resignation were accepted and he never worked as an
umpire again? ``I'd have to sing a lot of sad country songs then,''
the North Carolinian said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McClelland, an AL umpire, had been identified by another
umpire as one who had not signed the resignation letter. But
Thursday McClelland said he was solidly in support of Phillips and
the resigning umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no animosity amongst the umpires,'' he said in
Boston. ``We want solidarity and we are trying to get the two
negotiators to the bargaining table.'' He referred to Phillips and
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Several umpires said Thursday that one of the reasons they have
taken this action is to induce baseball officials to begin
negotiating a labor contract to replace the one that expires Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they'd have a contract for us to look at by July 1
and it didn't happen,'' West said. Baseball officials have denied
that the umpires were promised a proposal by that date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to sit down and negotiate,'' West said. ``We want to
protect the assets we've gained over 28 years of negotiations. When
the contract ends Dec. 31, no one's going to care. We need to
establish an open line of communication with baseball. If they
don't want us, they've got to replace a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting in Philadelphia last week, West added, some
umpires favored taking the even harder approach of saying they were
resigning this weekend. But, he said, the umpires decided they
would give baseball more time to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he had heard nothing from Major League Baseball.
Officials have deliberately been silent since the umpires announced
their resignations, figuring the longer they remained quiet the
greater the chance umpires would change their minds and rescind
their resignations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in the House put down their marker
Thursday in the debate over how to allocate projected federal
budget surpluses, passing the largest tax cut in nearly two decades
despite a veto threat from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which would cut taxes by $792 billion over
the next decade, passed on a largely party line vote of 223-208.
Four Republicans voted against it, and six Democrats voted in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome averted a major defeat for Speaker Dennis Hastert
and the rest of the Republican leaders, who scrambled throughout
the day on Wednesday to keep the bill from being derailed by
objections from a dozen or so moderates within their own party.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates said the tax cut was too big and left none of the
surplus for debt reduction and needed spending, but most of them
voted for the bill in the end after adding a complex and hastily
written provision that makes a portion of the tax cut contingent on
reducing the interest payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for personal income tax rates to be cut gradually
by 10 percent over the next decade, and for the top rate on capital
gains to be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It would also phase in a repeal of the tax on large
inheritances, create a deduction for health insurance expenses, cut
a variety of business taxes and reduce the so-called marriage
penalty, which leaves many two-income couples paying a bigger tax
bill than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Mr. President, we say, what's wrong in letting American
taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money,'' Hastert said at a
Republican pep rally after the vote. ``We trust them to spend it
right, and we think you should too.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill stands almost no chance of becoming law. But it
represents the opening bid by conservatives as they head toward
negotiations with the Senate, which is moving toward passage of its
own, somewhat less partisan, tax cut, and with Clinton, who despite
his veto threat has opened the door to some tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is among the most ideologically charged and
politically potent facing Congress and the Clinton administration
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1920s has the federal government had a realistic
prospect of taking in more money than it spends over a sustained
period. Current estimates show the government running a surplus of
$2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, permitting both parties the
luxury of setting out wish lists that reflect their basic
philosophies about the size and role of the federal government,
their approaches to long-term challenges like assuring the solvency
of Social Security and their strategies for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond ideology and politics, there is also economics. Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and usually one of
Washington's most outspoken proponents of tax cuts, undercut the
Republicans Thursday by suggesting that Congress should hold off on
a big tax reduction while the economy is strong and concentrate
instead on paring the national debt. Big tax cuts typically
stimulate economic growth, and the Federal Reserve is already
concerned that the economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is not right,'' Greenspan said in response to a
question at the House Banking Committee a few hours before the vote
on the tax bill. ``I think we will need a very important reduction
in marginal tax rates and in the capital gains tax rate at some
point in the future when this economy inevitably falters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor, Republicans swept aside criticism of their
tax-cutting plan. Sending excess revenues back to the taxpayer,
they said, was the best way to advance their goals of reducing the
power of the federal government and increasing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If the surplus is not used for tax cuts, they said, Democrats
would inevitably use it for new spending programs. Even with a big
tax cut, Republicans said, there is already more than enough money
sloshing around Washington to pay for domestic and military
spending and deal with the long-term problems in Medicare and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing that most voters rank tax cuts behind
Social Security, Medicare and debt reduction as the best use for
the surplus, Republicans said a broad-based tax reduction would
help the party recapture the conservative fervor of Ronald Reagan's
first term as president, when Democrats in Congress acceded to an
even bigger tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats believe they know best how to spend money by
spending it with government,'' said Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the
author of the Republican bill. ``We believe the people know best
how to spend their own money. And what this debate is really all
about is downsizing the power of Washington and upsizing the power
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats replied that the Republican plan was built on
assumptions about future surpluses that might never materialize,
risking the return of budget deficits and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   They said that by using nearly all of the portion of the surplus
available for tax cuts _ the $996 billion over the next decade that
does not come from excess Social Security revenues _ Republicans
were missing the country's best chance to do more to shore up
Social Security and Medicare and to invest in education, health
care, the environment and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Democrats said, the Republican tax cut is
disproportionately tilted toward the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said the Republicans were
pandering to their conservative base with an irresponsible bill
that they knew would never be signed into law. The Republicans'
intention, Rangel said, was to create a ``Christmas tree'' and cast
Clinton in the role of Scrooge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your bill is what we call in Harlem a trip to nowhere,''
Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also kept up the pressure on the Republicans, repeating
his veto threat for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this plan that's being voted on in Washington
will not enable us to pay off our debt,'' Clinton said Thursday
during a trip to Lansing, Mich. ``It will not do anything to add to
the life of Social Security and Medicare. It will require huge cuts
in our other investments and taking care of our kids. And I will
veto it if it passes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the frantic bargaining between the Republican leadership
and their moderates on Wednesday, there was relatively little drama
in Thursday's vote. Most of the moderates who had threatened to
defect said they were satisfied that the leadership had taken their
concerns seriously and had agreed to their demand that the largest
component of the tax cut _ the phased-in reduction in personal
income tax rates _ take effect only if regular progress is made in
bringing down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But there was considerable confusion on both sides of the aisle
about just how the contingency would work in practice, and whether
it was anything more than an expedient way of holding the fractious
Republican majority together for a few hours to get the tax bill
passed. Even some of the moderates said they did not expect the
provision to survive when the House and the Senate reconcile their
tax-cut bills in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The four Republicans who voted against the bill were Reps.
Michael Castle of Delaware, who had led the moderate revolt; Jack
Quinn of New York; Greg Ganske of Iowa, and Constance Morella of
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The six Democrats who voted in favor of the bill were Reps.
Sanford Bishop of Georgia; Virgil Goode of Virginia; Ralph Hall of
Texas; Gary Condit of California; Pat Danner of Missouri, and Ken
Lucas of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the House did not vote. They were Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., who was attending services for his cousin, John F.
Kennedy Jr.; Jim McDermott, D-Wash., and John Peterson, R-Pa. There
is one vacancy among the 435 seats in the House.

INDUSTRIAL GIANT EMPLOYS PRE-EMPTIVE STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Seven weeks ago, Wall Street digested most of the
impact of Friday's release of second-quarter earnings from
industrial conglomerate Unova Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Unova, in a move that has grown increasingly popular among
publicly held companies facing the prospect of lower-than-expected
results, announced pre-emptively on June 7 that the period's
profits would come in at 6 cents a share, well short of the 14
cents a share consensus at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The company cited glitches the new computer system at its
Intermec data-collection subsidiary in Everett, Wash., and said the
problems could stretch into the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Following the announcement, the stock lost $1 to $13.375 in the
next session and has since declined an additional 8 percent. It
closed Thursday at $12.4375, up 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wall Street has aligned its consensus estimate
with the company's forecast of 6 cents a share. Last week's
appointment of industry veteran Larry D. Brady as president and
chief operating officer had little impact on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Liptak of McDonald Investments, who downgraded the stock
last month to ``hold'' from ``aggressive buy,'' said this week
Unova will benefit over the long term from Brady's presence because
of the diversity of its separate business units. He also said
Brady, the former president of Chicago-based FMC Corp., is likely
to participate in Friday's conference call with analysts but added
that he expects no significant announcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady probably doesn't even have business cards yet,'' Liptak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unova earned $3.46 million, or 6 cents a share, in the first
quarter on revenues of $493.4 million. It is one of the nation's
largest producers of machine tools through its industrial
automation division, while its high-tech operations produce
data-collection, mobile computing, wireless network and radio
frequency identifier devices.
</P>
<P>
   The company relocated its headquarters last year from Beverly
Hills to an office complex in the western San Fernando Valley
earlier this year.

IS OVITZ TAKING OVER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a coup for Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago he might have been the darling of most NFL
owners, but he was a comparative Los Angeles outsider next to the
rival Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr. group.
</P>
<P>
   It was Roski and Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas who championed
the Coliseum back when it was viewed as just short of a war zone by
most NFL owners. Somehow, they turned a lost cause into favored-son
status. Dan Quayle should hire these guys.
</P>
<P>
   But now as it all seems to be falling together for Los Angeles,
it may be coming apart for Roski and Broad. And it's mostly their
own fault.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there is a united plan to bring the NFL back
to Los Angeles. No competing sites or site plans. There is, at
least momentarily, local harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and partner Ron Burkle have joined forces with Roski and
Broad under Gov. Gray Davis' designated deal-maker, Bill Chadwick.
On Wednesday a ``This-really-is-our-final-Coliseum plan'' will be
presented to NFL owners in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Only now as the deal grows close, as the NFL talks of
contributing $150 million to the site, as Chadwick begins to make a
case for some public funding to state-owned Exposition Park, and
the two former rivals make happy, it is hard to fight the feeling
the league is now in position to get what you suspect it always
wanted:
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz as your new Los Angeles franchise owner.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hollywood super agent always has had numerous
admirers among owners and league officials. They love his grand
ideas, his flash, his enthusiasm and his Tinsel Town connections.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has gone to extraordinary pains to keep Ovitz in the
franchise game, when by all logic, he should have been eliminated
long ago. Ovitz put his time, money and preparation into bringing
the NFL to Carson. When the league selected the Coliseum, they
still left the site plan and ownership open. It would have been
easy, and maybe the right thing to do, to have also chosen
Roski-Broad as the ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the NFL threw it open. In six weeks, Ovitz put together
a new Coliseum renovation patterned after the Roman Coliseum and
included multi-tiered parking garages.
</P>
<P>
   When Chadwick emerges with his we-are-one pitch to owners next
week, the stadium design will be modeled after the Ovitz plan and
include multi-tiered parking garages. See a pattern here?
</P>
<P>
   The one important thing Ovitz could not offer the NFL was local
political support. That's what Roski had built up around his
Coliseum project for the last two years. That's why he was given an
exclusive development deal at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? When the two groups agreed to merge into one stadium
and site effort, Ovitz immediately inherited all that political
support. His greatest weakness, the one thing that might have
proven his undoing, was now a strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a joint effort,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``It's not about
ownership right now. It is a premature conclusion to determine this
effort benefits one group over another. Any disconnection may
result in a different level of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Few suspected the team owner at the Coliseum might well be
Ovitz, a downtown dark horse helped to the front by his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   First, Broad and Roski agreed to drop the exclusive agreement.
Then they gave Ovitz all their political backing and connections.
Not even the NFL could have orchestrated such a scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Inadvertently, Broad and Roski undermined their own strength and
helped set up Ovitz and those owners who have been behind him all
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Broad said. ``I think it's a level playing
field. I have confidence that the commissioner and his executives
and the owners will make the right decision for the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence in our ownership group and the merit in
what we've brought. I think it's our job to convince the owners
we've got merit.''
</P>
<P>
   But why would Broad and Roski agree to a merger that seems so
one-sided?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think the beneficiary of all of that are the
people of Southern California,'' Broad said. ``We gave up our
exclusive and two years of work because we believe that working
together, we have a better chance of getting the job done than
being divided and having the franchise go off to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   All true, of course. And it would be extremely foolish to write
off Broad, a powerful, resourceful and extremely rich man, the
latter of which the NFL is taking respectful notice. He has owners
who do support him.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, league owners are an extremely unpredictable and
incongruous group, connected by ego, wealth and power. There are no
certainties with the nation's strangest millionaires' club.
</P>
<P>
   And Ovitz has yet to demonstrate he can personally come up with
the 30 percent required by the league to become majority owner. If
the expansion fee is $500 million, that's $150 million up front,
not counting franchise startup costs and a contribution to building
and parking improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz is no pauper, but Broad's first name is almost
``Billionaire.'' Yet it's hard to believe Ovitz has gotten into the
game this deeply without being able to come up with the money.
</P>
<P>
   The league has to make a final ownership call by the
self-imposed deadline of Sept. 15. If Los Angeles has been unable
to close the deal by then, the NFL threatens to go to Houston for
its 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, this new unified effort will probably come to
an end in Chicago next week. If the league gives approval to the
stadium, site and financing plan, then it has to set a franchise
fee and select a single owner.
</P>
<P>
   If it is finally Ovitz, you would like to think he will find a
place for Roski in his ownership group, already 10 members strong.
For now, it all appears to be falling together in that direction.

RIVERA GETS BACK ON TRACK AS YANKS BEAT DEVIL RAYS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A blown save confuses Mariano Rivera in the way an
incorrect answer might confound a math genius. Rivera will ponder
and fret over failure, for in his mind all the factors should add
up: he is better than the hitters and his stuff is overwhelming
and, therefore, he should succeed. A plus B equals C.
</P>
<P>
   After blowing save opportunities against the Mets and the Braves
on successive weekends, Rivera silently puzzled. But for now,
everything seems in order with the Yankees' closer. Rivera pitched
the ninth inning Thursday to preserve a lackluster 5-4 victory
against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams smashed a two-run homer, his 15th home run of
the season, and Andy Pettitte collected his seventh victory in 14
decisions, before 40,557 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees (57-37) will play Cleveland in a three-game series
at the Stadium beginning Friday night, perhaps the last time the
rival American League powers will play any meaningful games during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' first and only trip to Cleveland this year won't
occur until September, at which time the Yankees and Indians will
likely have clinched or will be close to clinching playoff berths.
Both teams could well be using fringe players by that time, to rest
their regulars for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hargrove, the Cleveland manager, had considered starting
Dwight Gooden on Friday night against the Yankees' David Cone, in
what would have been a matchup of former Mets. But Hargrove instead
decided to start the knuckleballer Tom Candiotti.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen could be a bit of a mess Friday night.
Rivera has pitched in three consecutive games and Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager, said that depending on how Rivera feels, he will
be inclined to give his closer a day off.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera grinned when Torre's words about a possible day off were
passed on. No, Rivera said, ``I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton has had only two outings in the last 12 days and
pitched poorly Thursday, and the other left-handers, Allen Watson
and the rookie Ed Yarnall, are starved for work.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has been with the Yankees for more than a week and has
yet to appear in a game, and Yarnall has had one outing in two
weeks. (Yarnall could be headed back to Class AAA Columbus as soon
as Saturday, when outfielder Shane Spencer may be activated off the
15-day disabled list.)
</P>
<P>
   Rivera converted 21 of his first 22 save chances this year, but
he squandered a lead against Detroit July 6 and blew two of his
next four opportunities as well.

NORTHERN RIM DOMINATES HIGH-TECH GROWTH IN L.A. AREA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The finalists are in, and San Fernando
Valley-area companies once again dominate the annual Deloitte &AMP;
Touche LLP listing of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies
in the five-county Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley and neighboring Ventura County have a combined 22
companies on the list of finalists, including six from Camarillo,
at the outer rim of the survey in Ventura County; five from
Calabasas, just outside L.A. city limits; and four from Chatsworth,
a Valley community comprising the city of L.A.'s northwestern
reach. Los Angeles has more companies on the list than any other
city in the region, thanks in part to Chatsworth's representation;
Camarillo has the second-most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe technology companies are the industry of the future
here in Los Angeles,'' said Gary Dickey, a partner in Deloitte &AMP;
Touche's Los Angeles High Technology Group. ``There are a lot of
high-growth companies operating here in our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche, one of the country's largest professional
services firms, will rank the 1999 Los Angeles Technology Fast 50
companies by revenue growth for a September award presentation.
</P>
<P>
   MRV Communications in Chatsworth was the top Valley company last
September, grabbing third overall with a 2,136 percent earnings
growth over five years. It's on this year's list as well.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees include both privately held and publicly traded
companies. Among the publicly traded companies, their size varies
from L.A.'s MiniMed (with a market value of approximately $2.3
billion) to Sound Source Interactive of Calabasas ($2.4 million).
</P>
<P>
   In order to make the list, technology companies must be in
business at least five years, cannot be a subsidiary or division of
another firm as of the end of the 1998-99 fiscal year, and must
have 1994 revenues of at least $50,000 and 1998 revenues of $1
million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes companies headquartered in Los Angeles,
Orange, San Bernardino, Ventura and Riverside counties.

VIOLENT? SEX IST? UPN GOES TO THE MAT WITH THE WWF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BIIL GOODYKOONTZ   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``EDITOR'S NOTE: Republic ``TV writer Bill Goodykoontz is
attending a three-week confab in California of the networks and the
nation's TV critics to preview the fall season''.'' &QL; 
UPN has wrestled with a programming plan for most of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting, then, that the struggling network is pinning its hopes
for the fall season on the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad plan. What other star could UPN hitch its wagon
to? ``Shasta McNasty''? Not for more than two or three episodes,
probably.
</P>
<P>
   But the wildly popular WWF, with such stars as the Rock, Chyna
and Stone Cold Steve Austin, could wrangle a few viewers UPN's way.
Having lost nearly a third of its audience in the past year, the
network could use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Smackdown!'' will be shown at 7 p.m. on Thursdays on
Channel 45 (KUTP), beginning Aug. 26. And if you're worried that
the WWF is violent and sexist and a bad influence and all that,
Dean Valentine, president of UPN, begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe there is anything sexist or violent about
the WWF,'' Valentine told a group of critics gathered Monday in
Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, there is a little bleeding. Not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'd be hard-pressed to really think that the fact that
they show occasional _ some occasional _ blood is a danger to the
republic,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   All right, all right, so one character is a pimp who brings
``ho's'' into the ring. Sexist? That?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not exactly sure why that's sexist,'' Valentine said,
``but I do believe I've seen that character on a number of other
entertainment shows as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said all this with a straight, if occasionally
reddening, face. But no matter what you think of the WWF, it is a
huge hit with young men, and that is just the audience the UPN has
unapologetically decided to go after.
</P>
<P>
   This time anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We function as an alternative network,'' Valentine said, ``and
I think we probably do best to build on the strengths that we have,
which is, basically, younger people who are sort of traveling
across the dial and checking out new things, and building on that
audience towards something broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, broad. As in broad comedy, perhaps. That's where ``Shasta
McNasty'' comes in. Critics haven't gotten preview tapes (part of
the pilot is being reshot to incorporate the company gravy train,
the WWF, into the story line), but UPN did make available several
clips. The story concerns three guys hoping their band takes off
while they bum around New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always trying to get jobs,'' Neal Moritz, the
executive producer, said. ``Basically, what we did was create a
show that was kind of ``The Monkees'' ``Meets the Beastie Boys.''
It was a jumping-off point, and, in tone, it's the same as
``Something About Mary'' or ``Waterboy'' or any of the Adam
Sandler-type movies. It has a broad sense of humor that young
people, in our showing the preview and showing some early cuts,
have really liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The available clips include an extended gag involving a parrot
who bites a character's crotch, which leads to the character
screaming, smashing the bird around an apartment, miming what looks
like a sex act with it, etc. Hilarity ensues. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shasta McNasty'' apparently was a hit with advertisers though.
And someone is buying all those tickets to Adam Sandler's movies.
Plus the scene includes a helpful on-screen assurance that a real
parrot wasn't used in filming.
</P>
<P>
   Other new UPN shows include:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _``Secret Agent Man,'' a promising offbeat comedy that, in
clips, suggested a healthy dose of ``Men in Black'' mixed with a
dash of ``Get Smart.'' But the producers suggested that almost none
of the elements of the clip shown to critics would be retained, so
who knows?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _``Grown Ups,'' a comedy starring Jaleel White (you know him as
Urkel, if you know him) as one of three young adults trying to do
that most sitcom of things, make their way in the ``real world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _``The Strip,'' an action series about two former Las Vegas
detectives who go to work as a security team for a casino owner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _``The Parkers,'' a spinoff of ``Moesha'' that finds Kim
Parker, Moesha's friend, going to college with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   But let's face it, ``WWF Smackdown!'' is UPN's big-ticket item.
To hear Chyna, one of the WWF wrestlers, tell it, how could it not
be?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't insult the audience's intelligence,'' she said,
seconds after flexing for cameras in a black ``Lick my boots''
T-shirt. ``What we do is entertainment. We give people
action-adventure. We give them soap opera. We give them story
lines. We're unbelievable athletes. We're larger-than-life men and
women _ sexy women with their boobs hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something for everybody in our show.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who is a young man especially. &QL;

SEC SETTLES 4 CASES OFFERING `FREE STOCK' 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on
offers of so-called free stock, an increasingly popular method of
attracting investors to Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Companies offer the stock to people who provide information
about themselves or agree to pass the offer along to others.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the SEC settled four enforcement actions against
four promoters and two Internet companies that it said offered and
distributed free stock through World Wide Web sites without
properly registering the securities being offered and without
providing investors adequate information on the company.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, to obtain shares visitors to a company's Web site
were required to sign up and to disclose personal information.
Those who signed up were offered additional shares if they referred
others to the site who also signed up, or if they provided links to
the site from their personal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not that the companies were giving away shares.
That is legal in certain circumstances. Rather, the SEC said, the
problem was the assertion that the stock was free. By requiring
investors to provide information about themselves that could be
used for marketing or driving others to a Web site that sold
advertising, they were, in effect, exchanging the shares for
something of value, an action that requires the stock to be
registered with the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said that
even at a time when companies were having little trouble selling
stock, the allure of free shares was a powerful promotional
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a useful mechanism for attracting traffic to a Web site,
and that has real value,'' Walker said. ``It enhances the product
and raises credibility. And if you are looking to create publicity
for your venture, free stock helps to create interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Circulating free-stock offers by e-mail has drawn attention on
Capitol Hill. In April, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., received
several e-mail messages with offers of free stock. He responded by
urging the SEC to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's administrative actions resulted in no fines.
Without admitting or denying the findings, the parties agreed to
cease and desist from future violations of stock-registration
requirements. In addition, two promoters who worked with two of the
companies agreed to refrain from violating the fraud provisions of
federal securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four cases also involved false assertions, the SEC
said. In one, a company that called itself the American Space
Corporation offered its shares and promised that it intended to
engage in space exploration and medical research.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC brought action against Joe Loofbourrow, of Oklahoma
City, for statements that the shares of American Space had a value
of $1 each. In fact, the agency said, the company was never
incorporated and had no offices, employees or contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A telecommunications marketing company called Web Works
Marketing.com, based in Rush, N.Y., told visitors to its Web site
that by registering on line or signing up for long-distance
service, they could receive shares worth more than $38 each _ and
which could grow in value, after a future public offering, to be
worth $200.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that it had more than 10,000 customers and
a contract with a Virginia-based long-distance service. The SEC
brought action against the company and Trace D. Cornell, its
founder, who ran the company from home. The SEC said that no
contract existed between Web Works and the long-distance provider,
that Web Works had only 35 customers who had generated less than
$30 in revenue and that it had taken no steps for a public stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   From March through May, an on-line auction site called
WowAuction.com, of Woodstock, Ga., offered stock to viewers who
registered with the site, and said that the company would conduct a
``direct public offering'' during the third quarter of this year,
the SEC said. The commission's cease-and-desist order named both
the company and Steven M. Gaddis Sr.
</P>
<P>
   In April, at least 200 investors registered for free shares in a
fourth company, called Kinesis International Inc., which promised
extra shares for referrals of additional registrants. The SEC's
action also cited a promoter named Theodore Sotirakis, of Staten
Island.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO IMPROVE METHADONE TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with the system for dispensing methadone, the
Clinton administration on Thursday proposed creating a national
accreditation of methadone treatment centers as a way of holding
them more accountable for keeping addicts off heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The administration further proposed that a way be devised to
accredit hospitals and doctors so that they could prescribe
methadone, which may now be dispensed only by the treatment
clinics. The hope is that this would expand access to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   These two proposed regulations were among several offered by the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which said it
was acting to strip methadone of its stigma as a heroin replacement
and recast it as an effective public health remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calling for national accreditation of methadone
centers, which are now certified only by states or locally, would
change the focus of the 900 or so clinics from record-keeping and
enforcement of bureaucratic rules to encouraging addicts to seek
and stay in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Methadone users have long complained about the indignity of
lining up daily to drink a plastic cup of cherry-colored liquid
methadone under supervision and sometimes give a urine sample to
prove that they are not secretly using drugs. Clinics have also
been criticized for not tailoring treatment to the needs of the
individual with a more comprehensive array of services, from
psychological counseling and remedial education to job training,
that would address the reasons why an addict might have used heroin
in the first place. The rule on their national accreditation would
try to fill vacuums like those by upgrading standards and offering
the addict more options.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another regulation would underscore the public health
problem posed by heroin addiction by shifting government oversight
of drug treatment programs to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration, an agency of the Department of Health and
Human Services. At present, the Food and Drug Administration is
charged with enforcing rules that date back nearly 30 years and
seem more concerned with preventing addicts from reselling
methadone than with helping them stay off drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These improvements should improve the quality of methadone
treatment and make it more accessible so that more addicts stop
abusing heroin and living a criminal existence,'' retired Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said in a statement announcing the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey described the proposals as nothing less than ``a
fundamental shift in the way we approach drug abuse in our
nation.'' He said 180 clinics would be evaluated over the next 18
months to determine the standards for accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals still have several hurdles to leap. Comments will
be invited for four months, followed by a formal public hearing
before the Department of Health and Human Services. The department
will then produce the final rules, expected early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Newman, the president of Continuum Health Partners, a
consortium of New York City hospitals that includes Beth Israel and
St. Luke's-Roosevelt, said he saw nothing in the proposals to
suggest that they would achieve the goal of providing drug
treatment for everyone who needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never understood why this one medication alone among
all the medications in the American pharmacopeia should be singled
out for physicians to have special approval,'' Newman said. ``Any
doctor can prescribe morphine for pain to any heroin addict. What
they can't do is prescribe methadone.''
</P>
<P>
   Joycelyn Woods, executive vice president of the National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates, said the proposals reflected what
the government should have done with methadone at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never done right, because it was never thought of as
medical treatment,'' said Ms. Woods, who herself uses methadone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to this as the beginning of the end of
getting rid of this awful system we have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 810,000 Americans are addicted to heroin. But only
179,000 are enrolled in methadone clinics, according to the
American Methadone Treatment Association.
</P>
<P>
   A perception persists that methadone is just a substitute drug
for heroin. Eight states _ Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, New
Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia _
prohibit methadone, forcing addicts there who want to get off
heroin to commute to other states.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would not stop the states from banning
methadone. But McCaffrey said that improving the standard of care
would foster a climate of greater acceptance. ``Once this merges
into the mainstream of medical practice,'' he said, ``the political
viability of allowing methadone will increase.''

POWERFUL INDIANS LIMP INTO BIG SERIES AGAINST YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ They are a fragile team, these Cleveland Indians,
much more fragile than a team sporting the best record in the major
leagues should be. They have endured serious injuries, sloppy
pitching and nearly two months of ordinary play.
</P>
<P>
   Peek at their overwhelming lead in the American League Central
and listen to another raucous sellout at Jacobs Field hollering for
Kenny, Omar, Robbie, Manny and a dynamic offense, and it might be
possible to overlook the instability that has crept up on the
Indians. But it exists. The Indians are not dominant now. A little
wounded and a little worried, but not dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians rushed out to a scintillating 29-10 start and have
been able to cruise with a record barely over .500 since then
because their division does not include another winning team. While
the Indians earned their prominent position by playing incredibly
well in April and May, and can crawl to the post-season, they are
limping at a time when general managers consider tweaks before the
July 31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   So as the Indians prepared to play a revealing three-game series
against the New York Yankees beginning Friday at Yankee Stadium,
they could use a No. 1 starter, a reliable left-handed reliever and
solid medical reports on several players by September to have a
strong chance to challenge the Yankees in October. Despite potholes
of their own, the Yankees seem steadier, even to some Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I think they got a better team than we do,''
Manny Ramirez said. ``But we're just going to go out there and play
hard against those guys because they're really tough.''
</P>
<P>
   For a player who rarely speaks to the news media, Ramirez
uttered a lot. When it was mentioned to Ramirez that Cleveland
(58-36) actually has a better record than the Yankees (57-37) going
into the Indians' game Friday night, the slugger did not try to
alter his comments about the defending World Series champions being
superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the record doesn't matter,'' Ramirez said. ``What
about if you win 100 games and you don't get the ring? That's not a
big deal. It doesn't mean a thing until you get the ring. I'd
rather win 70 games and make the playoffs and win the whole thing.
That's what people will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Thome was informed of Ramirez's strong words, his eyes
bulged and his mouth opened with no words emerging. Finally, he
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree, without playing possum,'' Thome said. ``To be
honest, I think it's very, very comparable. Little things have
happened. Either way, a break goes here or a break goes there and
we're in it or they're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Indians have the highest batting average in the
major leagues and have scored the most runs of any team in the
American League, they are always dangerous. But their 8-10 record
in July already equals the most setbacks they have endured in a
month and they have dropped 15 of their last 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians and the Yankees are the two elite teams in the
league and have flip-flopped in winning the American League
Championship Series during the past four years, with New York
winning the World Series in 1996 and 1998, and Cleveland losing it
in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have had their starting lineup intact for only four
games, and that will not change soon because catcher Sandy Alomar
Jr. (left knee), third baseman Travis Fryman (right knee) and
outfielder Wil Cordero (left wrist) could be lost until September.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Karsay, who has been the most valuable reliever, has a
strained left rib-cage muscle and might miss another week, and
Jaret Wright, who hid his strained back from the Indians, was
placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday. Amid the slump,
manager Mike Hargrove searched for positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team goes through something like this,'' Hargrove said.
``We didn't in '95, and the Yankees didn't last year. In normal
situations, teams go through this. You got to hang with it and
grind it out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Without Wright, Hargrove had to choose between Dwight Gooden,
who has not won in two months and whose career is in jeopardy, and
Tom Candiotti, the knuckleballer whose career was over until the
Indians signed him last month, to start on Friday. Hargrove told
Gooden on Wednesday night he would start but switched to Candiotti
Thursday because his knuckler is more of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   When Hargrove was asked how comfortable he is with a rotation
that is 37-23 with a 5.21 earned run average, he asked, ``How
comfortable are you getting with it?'' There was silence, then
laughter. ``That's your answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While general manager John Hart has said that players should not
expect him to swing a deal, he is interested in the Oakland
left-hander Kenny Rogers to help conquer the Yankees. Bartolo Colon
is 4-0 with a 2.99 ERA this month and, after he fired 98 mile per
hour fastballs past the Astros Tuesday, Craig Biggio said: ``I
heard they're looking for a No. 1 starter. What the heck is wrong
with that guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nagy has won 11 games and Dave Burba whiffed 13 against
Toronto on Wednesday, but Hargrove realizes they are No. 3 and No.
4 types and, despite Colon's resurgence, the manager sounds eager
for another arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look for the rotation to settle in and we're in the latter
part of July and it hasn't happened,'' Hargrove said. ``That's not
too comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   Thome said he ``could feel'' how confident the powerful Yankees
were last year and that gave them ``an edge'' in the ALCS. He
stressed that the Indians cannot coast through the regular season,
which they did with a massive lead in 1998 by finishing the second
half 39-37, or the possible collision course with the Yankees could
prove disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to get comfortable, but we can't get
complacent,'' Thome said. ``That's one thing we're doing
differently. We have a different feeling. We learned from our
experiences in the past.''

REFUGEE HAS RACQUET AND A PLAN TO RETURN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three months ago Shkumbin Mustafa, 22, who claims the
title of Kosovo's tennis champion, was watching bombs fall on his
hometown, the capital, Pristina. Now he's a pro at the children's
camp at Green Hollow Tennis Club in East Hampton, N.Y., living at
the manager's house on Three Mile Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good refugee gig, one might be inclined to say,
unpleasantly, were it not that Mustafa, with his bodice-ripper
physique and shoulder-length hair, is such a sweet and curiously
apolitical guy. He insists that he will go back to Kosovo after he
finishes his college education, and he talks about one day building
a tennis camp _ like this one _ for the kids back home.
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived in New York with only $1,300, a $350
resettlement grant from the U.S. government and a few pair of
jeans, there is, of course, the problem of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't have any private clients,'' says Mustafa, who
has been at Green Hollow all of 12 days. ``I must now devote myself
to finding private clients. That's where the money is.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha! So Mustafa will be staying here, devoting himself to
finding a woman with money and even longer hair than he has,
embracing with passion not just the good life, but the really good
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way. I'm going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Having trouble with the notion of a refugee tennis pro?
</P>
<P>
   So are the children at Green Hollow. They tell Mustafa he can't
be a refugee _ he's too smart; refugees have to be homeless people.
This bothers Mustafa, who was sports editor of Koha Ditore, which
is, to borrow from his resume, Kosovo's ``most eminent'' daily
newspaper. Mustafa also worked in Macedonia this past May as a
translator and troubleshooter for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't heard of a Kosovo tennis presence?
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa _ whom his boss at the club, Charles VanDercook,
compares to a Division 1 college player _ will tell you frankly
that the Kosovo Tennis Federation, a group he formed with his
friends in 1995, was an often unacknowledged force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't recognized by any state as a state, so we did not
have the opportunity to play other tournaments,'' says Mustafa, who
is an Albanian Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   The status of his organization is confirmed, or if you will,
denied, by the Yugoslavian Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no and we have never had a Kosovo Tennis Federation,''
Drazana Puskovic, the technical secretary of the federation says
from Belgrade. ``It does not exist without Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Ms. Puskovic perhaps aware, then, of Mustafa or any players
from the Kosovo area?
</P>
<P>
   She says she has not heard of Mustafa. ``I know we don't have
any Albanians from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless of course, you consider _ in the amateur realm _ Mustafa
and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa's father was a journalist who had been imprisoned for
leading antigovernment demonstrations before Mustafa's birth and
who today edits an Albanian newspaper in Macedonia, and his mother
is a teacher in Pristina. Mustafa, who makes a point of saying that
he has many Serbian friends, insists at first he did not have
problems as an Albanian in Serb-dominated Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa played soccer and basketball from the time he was a
child. Tennis, while popular in some parts of Yugoslavia, was not
well known in Kosovo. Seeing the game on television, Mustafa and
his friends decided they wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   The amenities?
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we don't have any real tennis courts in Pristina,''
says Mustafa. But, he said, a city about 50 miles away ``had two
clay courts, which was a big deal for us. We had courts in the
school, regular asphalt court, and we drew the lines ourselves. We
got books for the proportions and bought some nets. I borrowed a
racquet. A racquet was $100. My parents, together, had a paycheck
of $300 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early courts of the nascent Kosovo Tennis Federation
did not even have proper tennis nets _ with nets rare in Pristina,
Mustafa and his friends bought the webbing used in building
construction and strung it in the street, between two trees.
Nonetheless, by 1997 the Kosovo Tennis Federation had clubs in five
cities. A year and a half ago, the playing ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't play the Serbs, the way they treated the
Albanians, the people in Kosovo,'' Mustafa says. ``We couldn't play
with massacres. We had to leave tennis behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics does impede, after all?
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a fine high school, but the reason I could was it
was such an old building, the Serbs did not want to go,'' Mustafa
says. ``If we wanted to use an indoor sports facility and we were
Albanians we had to pay a lot of money to go. The Serbs could go
without paying anything. Sixty dollars an hour for basketball. We
were 15 kids, but it was still too much.''
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO bombing of Kosovo this spring, Mustafa spent 15
days under attack with his family in Pristina. Their apartment was
unharmed. In June, after fleeing with his family to Macedonia,
Mustafa arrived at Kennedy Airport on his own, in a plane of
refugees, and moved in with friends in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Life now is fine: days on the tennis court with children,
evenings in a house on the bay. He has no illusions about going
pro; it's too late for him. But in two or three years, he will go
back. Build a tennis camp, give the children a chance he never had.

ASHES OF KENNEDY, WIFE, SISTER-IN-LAW SCATTERED NEAR CRASH SITE 
</HEADLINE>

   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ Between a beach he loved and the site where
his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes
and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to
the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
</P>
<P>
   In a private, closely guarded ceremony aboard a US Navy
destroyer, the remains of Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, her 34-year-old sister, were laid
in the choppy Atlantic Ocean. The ceremony occurred in view of the
shorefront estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, and near where his small plane plunged into the sea last
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the mercies of God, a Roman Catholic priest and two
Navy chaplains presided over a brief, solemn ceremony on the deck
of the USS Briscoe. Meanwhile, three miles away, the USS Grasp, a
Navy salvage ship continued retrieving the wreckage of Kennedy's
shattered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   One to three members at a time, the grieving family members cast
the ashes to the ocean. A Navy brass quintet played, but the
familiar strains of Taps was not heard at this non-military
ceremony rarely allowed on a Navy ship for a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   All along the shoreline of southwestern Martha's Vineyard,
vacationers and Vineyarders, gripped for days by news of Kennedy's
disappearance and the grim discovery of his remains, watched with
the drama from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel devastated,'' said Pat Mutolo, a vacationer from
Rochester, N.Y., whose voice broke with emotion as she watched the
Briscoe's progress. ``I woke up to the news Saturday morning and
said, `Oh, my God.' No family deserves this.''
</P>
<P>
   The service, which concluded nearly a week of intense emotions
after JFK Jr.'s plane was reported missing last Friday, began at
9:30 a.m. as the funeral party, led by Kennedy's uncle, US Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, left the family compound at Hyannis Port for
Woods Hole. There, the Briscoe, a guided-missile destroyer
transported them to the burial site.
</P>
<P>
   The warship moved at a processional pace past the jagged Gay
Head cliffs and the beaches where bits of Kennedy's airplane were
found.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which began shortly before noon, was witnessed by
about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including
Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters'
mother, stepfather and sister.
</P>
<P>
   The party listened as the clergymen conducted the moving ritual
of committing human remains to the sea. Kennedy's sister and uncle
spoke at the somber service, which fulfilled John Kennedy Jr.'s
wishes to be buried at sea _ and away from the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by Coast Guard vessels, the crew of the Briscoe ensured
that privacy in a strictly enforced security zone that kept the
news media, in chartered boats and TV helicopters, far away.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the use of the Briscoe,
which was diverted from maneuvers in the North Atlantic to become
the platform for a nationally riveting funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were recovered
Wednesday afternoon, and their ashes scattered less than 24 hours
after Navy divers lifted the bodies feet from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapid turn of events, hundreds of mourners and the
curious lined the southwest shoreline of Martha's Vineyard from Gay
Head to the wild beaches along Moshup Trail, near the estate that
Kennedy and his sister had inherited from their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cami Stephens of Hyannis, watching the Briscoe return to Woods
Hole, said she wanted to bid farewell to Kennedy, someone she knew
and admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down-to-earth _ someone who'd get coffee up the street,
someone who'd say `Hi,' '' explained Stephens, who said she has
been part of many get-togethers at the compound in Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his family ``would make you feel like you were
someone,'' she said. ``This, to me, it's like a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The mourners arrived in Woods Hole about 9:30 a.m. and were
quickly transported to the Briscoe by the Coast Guard vessel
Sanibel. Close to 10 a.m., the Briscoe pulled up anchor and began
its journey around Gay Head in choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:20 a.m., four miles off the southern shore of Martha's
Vineyard, the ship stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crew then completed preparations for a ceremony that lasted
roughly 30 minutes. The service was attended by dozens of Briscoe
crew members outfitted in dress-white uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the mourners returned to Woods Hole at 3:30
p.m. Sen. Kennedy and the funeral party then proceeded to Hyannis
Port for a private reception. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of
assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s
cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a fledgling pilot, was at the controls of a
newly-purchased, high-performance airplane from Fairfield, N.J. to
Martha's Vineyard last Friday just after sunset, en route to a
cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight _ and less than 20
miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport _ Kennedy's plane vanished
from air-traffic control radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Though the exact cause of the crash is not yet known,
authorities believe Kennedy lost control of the single-engine
airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the
murky night sky. The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying
corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision,
aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting
the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast
Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology
government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras,
Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early
Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped
into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have
been sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies
of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette. At 7:15 p.m. that night, the
remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne,
where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard J.
Evans and Dr. James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims'
families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies,
fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid
press or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial Mass for Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette is scheduled
for 11 a.m. Friday at St. Thomas More Church in New York, where
Kennedy's mother often prayed. President and Hillary Clinton plan
to attend. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette is set for 7 p.m.
Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.

airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the
murky night sky. The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying
corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision,
aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting
the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast
Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology
government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras,
Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early
Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped
into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have
been sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies
of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette. At 7:15 p.m. that night, the
remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne,
where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard J.
Evans and Dr. James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims'
families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies,
fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid
press or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial Mass for Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette is scheduled
for 11 a.m. Friday at St. Thomas More Church in New York, where
Kennedy's mother often prayed. President and Hillary Clinton plan
to attend. A memorial service for Lauren Bessette is set for 7 p.m.
Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.

CLINTON AIDES SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO AN IMF SALE OF SOME GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with mounting opposition in Congress, the
Clinton administration began backing away Thursday from plans to
have the International Monetary Fund sell a portion of its gold
reserves to finance debt relief for some of the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan, a legacy of former Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin, calls for the IMF to sell up to 10 million ounces
of gold on the open market. But gold prices have been falling, in
part because of the IMF plan and a sale by the Bank of England, and
mining companies and gold-producing countries have lobbied to kill
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Treasury official, briefing reporters Thursday, gave
the first public acknowledgment that Congress was unlikely to
approve the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are exploring whether there are alternative ways of
mobilizing IMF gold reserves that would avoid any impact on the
gold market and would be acceptable to the IMF's membership _ would
command the support of Congress,'' he said. But the official
declined to specify what kinds of alternatives the Treasury was
considering.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep.
Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said he opposed the plan to sell the gold. He
said he feared that the sale would hurt many of the same countries
that the United States was trying to help, including nations like
South Africa that rely heavily on gold sales.
</P>
<P>
   The initial logic of the sale was to turn a nonproductive IMF
asset, a portion of the gold that the international lending agency
was given after it was created more than 50 years ago, into an
income-producing asset. The money from the sale would be invested,
with the proceeds used to help pay off the debts of the most
indebted countries. Leaders of the Group of Seven industrial
nations approved the plan in June.
</P>
<P>
   But under the rules of the IMF, sale of the gold requires the
approval of 85 percent of the monetary fund's members. Washington
controls an 18 percent share of the fund, and Congress determines
how the United States' vote is cast. Approval by the banking
committee would be necessary, and Leach said Thursday that he had
determined that would not happen.

ANNE WOOLLIAMS, 72, TEACHER AND A LEADER OF STUTTGART BALLET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Woolliams, a British ballet teacher who played a major role
in the international success of the Stuttgart Ballet and who became
artistic director of the Australian Ballet and the Vienna State
Opera Ballet, died in Canterbury, England, on July 8. She was 72
and lived in Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her husband, Jan Stripling, a former
principal dancer with the Stuttgart Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woolliams, who was trained in England and Germany as a
dancer, gained her reputation as a distinguished ballet mistress
and teacher during her years in Stuttgart from 1963 to 1975. John
Cranko, who left the Royal Ballet in Britain to head the company in
what was then West Germany, made her his assistant from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrival in Stuttgart, he and Ms. Woolliams
founded the Stuttgart Ballet School, the first school in West
Germany with an integrated program of ballet and academic classes.
</P>
<P>
   As company teacher and ballet mistress, Ms. Woolliams taught
many of the company alumni who now direct major companies,
including Jiri Kylian, William Forsythe and John Neumeier. Cranko
named Ms. Woolliams assistant director in 1969, the year the
Stuttgart Ballet made its highly acclaimed debut in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Folkestone, England, on Aug. 3, 1926, Ms. Woolliams
studied modern dance as a child in Germany and ballet in England
with Judith Espinosa, Noreen Bush, George Goncharov and Vera
Volkova. In London she danced, in 1943, with the Kyasht Ballet and
then the Russian Opera and Ballet Co., the St. James Ballet and in
the film ``The Red Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1958 to 1963 she taught at the Folkwang School in Essen,
West Germany, headed by Kurt Jooss, choreographer of the famed
anti-war ballet, ``The Green Table.'' Ms. Woolliams danced with the
Jooss company, where she was also company teacher. Reflecting on
her training in both ballet and German Expressionist dance, Ms.
Woolliams once said that ``dance is the greatest expression of art
through movement and cannot be confined to one form.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cranko's death in 1973, Ms. Woolliams staged his ballets
around the world and remained in Stuttgart until 1976 when she was
invited to become artistic director of the Australian Ballet. Ms.
Woolliams returned to Europe in 1987. She served as artistic
director of the Vienna State Opera Ballet from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Wendy
White-Tomson, and a brother, James, both of Kent, England.

GINA BERRIAULT, 73, WRITER OF NOVELS AND SHORT STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gina Berriault, an award-winning writer of short stories and
novels, died on July 15 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae,
Calif. She was 73 and lived in Sausalito, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She died after a brief illness, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   With her terse prose, emotional precision and deft storytelling,
Ms. Berriault was often heralded as ``a writer's writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 1996 collection of 35 short stories, ``Women in Their
Beds,'' received critical acclaim and won the 1997 National Book
Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Fiction Prize and the Rae
Award for the Short Story. Tobin Harshaw, reviewing it in The New
York Times Book Review, wrote: ``One struggles to find a sentence
that is anything less than jewel-box perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Arline Shandling in Long Beach, Calif., to parents who had
emigrated from Latvia and Lithuania, Ms. Berriault spent much of
her childhood in Los Angeles, where her father wrote and edited
trade magazines. After his death when she was a teen-ager, she took
over his work to help support her family.
</P>
<P>
   She married John Berriault and settled in the San Francisco Bay
Area, writing stories and magazine articles while raising a
daughter. By the late 1950s, she had collected a bevy of awards in
the short-story field, among them the Paris Review's Aga Khan
fiction prize and two O. Henry awards.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ``The Descent,'' was published in 1960. Set in
America in 1964, the story described the conflict between the
secretary for humanity, a newly created Cabinet post, and a group
of people who believed that moving to underground shelters would
manifest ``prepared togetherness.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second novel, ``Conference of Victims,'' about the suicide
of a congressional candidate, was published two years later, and
was revised and republished in 1998 as ``Afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Her other novels include ``The Son'' (1966), about an incestuous
relationship between a mother and her son, and ``The Lights of
Earth'' (1984), about a woman and her married lover. She also
published two other short-story collections, ``The Mistress''
(1965) and ``The Infinite Passion of Expectation'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Her short story ``The Stone Boy,'' which she adapted for the
screen, was made into the 1984 film starring Robert Duvall and
Glenn Close. She had recently completed a fable, ``The Great
Petrowski,'' that was to be published with her own illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Julie Berriault of Mill Valley,
Calif., and her companion, Leonard Gardner of Sausalito.

TRUDI SCHOOP, 95, PIONEER IN THERAPY USING DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trudi Schoop, a popular Swiss-born comic dancer who became a
pioneer in the use of dance movement to treat mental illness, died
on July 14 at her home in Van Nuys, Calif. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1930s, Miss Schoop was often called a female
Charlie Chaplin because of the way she, like Chaplin, could combine
merriment with pathos. But in the mid-'40s she gave up performing
to explore ways in which dance could serve as therapy for
schizophrenic patients.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Zurich newspaper editor, Miss Schoop was
essentially self-taught, although she did take some ballet and
modern-dance lessons after she had already established herself as a
performer. By the early '30s she was spending much of her time
traveling with her company, and she made several American tours
under the auspices of the impresario Sol Hurok.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Schoop specialized in comic suites based upon the
misadventures of a central figure. She played a male character who
was frequently likened to Chaplin's Little Tramp in ``Fridolin on
the Road.'' Reviewing its New York premiere for The New York Times
in 1935, John Martin called Miss Schoop ``agreeable and clever,''
but also ``obvious and naive.'' Two years later, he was more
enthusiastic about ``Blonde Marie,'' finding this depiction of an
awkward but endearing servant girl notable for its ``great gusto
and good humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Schoop remained in Switzerland throughout World War II,
often performing in anti-Fascist cabaret shows. When the war ended,
she resumed touring, offering a New York season in 1947. Soon
thereafter she settled in the Los Angeles area and began a second
career as a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Working with several California medical institutions, including
Camarillo State Mental Hospital, she developed what she called
``body-ego technique,'' which used movement to help lead patients
out of isolation so that they could respond to, rather than shrink
from, human contact.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

 EDITORIAL: THE SILENCE ON UNDERAGE DRINKING  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 23:
</P>
<P>
   An important public health cause suffered a setback recently
when the House appropriations Committee killed a sensible plan to
include anti-drinking messages in federal efforts to discourage
youngsters from using illicit drugs. The full Senate defeated a
similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's
director of national drug policy, was among those arguing against
the legislation. It would have given his office the clear authority
it now lacks to include underage drinking among the advertising
campaign's targets. McCaffrey has said that underage drinking is
the biggest drug problem among adolescents, and he does not dispute
the evidence showing a close link between early drinking and
subsequent dependence on illicit drug use. Nor does he question the
need for a campaign warning teen-agers about the dangers of
drinking. But like many lawmakers who voted against the bill,
McCaffrey said he was concerned about ``diluting'' the campaign's
basic anti-drug message.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug campaign would be greatly strengthened by
including ads designed to dissuade teen-agers from the early
drinking that can become a gateway to other drugs. If lawmakers
believe there is not enough money in the budget to target underage
drinking, they should provide more funding for the program rather
than impose an advertising blackout.

 &HT;    Cox turns to bullpen to end skid
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Mired in a five-game losing streak, the Braves couldn't
take anything for granted, not even against the lowly Florida
Marlins. Not even with a 4-0 first-inning lead. Especially not with
rookie Odalis Perez starting.
</P>
<P>
   By the bottom of the first inning, when a 4-0 lead had shrunk to
4-3, Perez was on his way to the shortest outing of an Atlanta
starter this season. But impatience with Perez and reliance on the
bullpen paid off in a 6-3 victory that ended the Braves' longest
losing streak in three years.
</P>
<P>
   They headed to Philadelphia for a doubleheader today happily
after moving to 3-5 on this road trip and keeping their narrow lead
over the Mets at two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were beaten by Marlins starter Alex Fernandez on July
6, but this time they played it smarter early and caught him less
sharp. They made him work hard in the first inning, inducing 25
pitches, to take a chunk out of his 100-pitch limit as he continues
his comeback from shoulder surgery. They got 11 hits and six runs
off him and made sure he was up to 98 pitches by the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss tripled on a 3-2 pitch to lead off the game and give
the Braves the jump start they needed. Keith Lockhart followed with
sacrifice fly, and four batters later the Braves had a four-run
lead, aided by Javy Lopez's two-run single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves managed a couple of more runs off Fernandez on a
two-run double by Randall Simon in the third and an RBI single by
Ryan Klesko in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The starts seem to be getting progressively worse for Perez,
whose 17th major-league start lasted only 10 batters and 43
pitches, only 23 of which were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who hasn't won since June 8, went to the mound in the
bottom of the first with a four-run cushion, yet blew it. He loaded
the bases on two singles and a four-pitch walk. Three consecutive
balls to Mark Kotsay later, Perez was in a heap of trouble. Kotsay
rifled a 3-1 pitch off the scoreboard in left center to cut the
lead to 4-2. Preston Wilson's sacrifice fly made it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk, a fielder's choice on a tough play by Weiss and
Castillo's single in the second inning, manager Bobby Cox had seen
enough. Five Braves relievers, starting with a 3 2/3-inning stint
by Kevin McGlinchy, then held the Marlins scoreless on two hits for
7 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones left the game in the first inning after getting
hit on the back of the right arm by a Fernandez pitch. X-rays on
Jones' arm were negative and trainer Dave Pursley called it a bad
bruise, one that might keep him out of the lineup for a couple of
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 23:
</P>
<P>
   In 1799 a London cartographer named William Heather prepared a
map of coastal New England. On Heather's chart the Atlantic Ocean
is a blank, a generality of uninked paper. But Martha's Vineyard
and Nantucket, home of fishermen and whalers in those days, are
surrounded by shoals of numbers, each one the result of a
depth-sounding taken with lead and line paid out over the gunwales
into a troublesome, unsteady sea. To that same sea, so well sounded
and still so restless two centuries later, the Kennedy and Bessette
families have restored the ashes of their children, John F. Kennedy
Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   The flat summer light on the water, the deep, metallic vibration
of the Navy destroyer USS Briscoe under power, the swift lessening
and final disappearance of what the families gave back to the ocean
current _ these are things we can only imagine. But the grief of
the Kennedy and Bessette families requires no imagining, nor does
their desire to console themselves with ceremony. For people of a
certain age, it was impossible to watch that ship without
remembering the sight of a flag-draped coffin being drawn by horses
through the streets of Washington nearly 36 years ago. The
procession replays itself in the mind with preternatural clarity,
right down to the chill in the air, the weightless sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   But where that interment honored the public and national loss,
this one brings us closer somehow to the mystery of death, which is
something we all honor privately, if in common. This interment
dramatizes both the dissolution of the body and, in a sense, the
immensity that reclaims the body.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more forcible emblem of the unknown than the sea, no
clearer demarcation of the abruptness with which life passes into
death than the border between the warm, moist July air on Nantucket
Sound and the cold ocean current on which it rides. Consigning the
ashes of these three young people to the sea in which they died is
a way to express not only grief for the dead but the humility of
the living too.
</P>
<P>
   Sailor after sailor has taken a measure of the home waters
around Martha's Vineyard, but there is obviously no sounding death.
Like the blank Atlantic on William Heather's chart, it is
featureless. We build upon its shore, we walk its beaches. From
time to time we stop looking inland, where life is, and turn to
look out over an immensity that frightens us and gives us, at the
same time, a certainty in which there is much consolation. The
moment passes, but grief remains part of us.

MEDICARE COMPETITION PROJECT FOR KANSAS CITY AND PHOENIX DELAYED A
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A federal panel on Thursday postponed for one
year a plan to require Kansas City and Phoenix health maintenance
organizations to bid for Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year demonstration project was to have started Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The project is designed to determine whether the government can
save money by subjecting Medicare HMOs to market competition. It
has faced opposition in both cities from health insurance plans and
doctors who say it would cause widespread disruption of services to
beneficiaries in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, about 55,000 Medicare beneficiaries
belong to HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   All four senators from Kansas and Missouri lobbied Medicare for
the one-year postponement.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also supported an amendment to a patients' rights
bill passed by the Senate last week that would bar Medicare from
using Kansas City or any part of Arizona as competitive-bidding
demonstration sites. The bill awaits action in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee, which oversees the
demonstration project, had rebuffed requests by leaders of the
Phoenix project for a one-year postponement.
</P>
<P>
   But at a meeting Thursday at the Kansas City Airport Marriott
hotel, the panel heard requests from both the Phoenix and Kansas
City advisory committees for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both the Kansas City and the national committees
expressed concern that there was not enough time left this year to
educate beneficiaries and doctors about the changes the
demonstration project would make in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   They also questioned whether Medicare was adequately prepared to
help beneficiaries if competitive bidding forced large numbers of
them to change HMOs or seek new doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is an important project,'' said James Cubbin,
executive director of health-care initiatives for General Motors
and chairman of the national panel. ``This (delay) will give the
project more time to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jantsch, president of the Metropolitan Medical Society
of Greater Kansas City, a doctors group that lobbied heavily for
the delay, said she was pleased with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognized the local folks are so important to this
process,'' she said. ``Physicians do want to be involved in this
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   But E.J. Holland Jr., chairman of the advisory committee guiding
the project in Kansas City, said the postponement ended the bidding
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kills it,'' said Holland, vice president for corporate
benefits of Sprint Corp. ``It's nothing about health-care policy.
It's all about politics. It's a messy process, but it's the way
things are done in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration project was mandated by Congress in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to determine whether market competition
could help save the financially ailing Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, Medicare HMOs are paid a monthly amount set
by the government to take care of each patient they enroll. These
fees vary by location and are based on the average local costs of
traditional fee-for-service Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have criticized this method, saying it often pays
HMOs far more than it costs to take care of patients. In cities
such as Miami and Los Angeles where payments are particularly high,
Medicare HMOs have been able to offer their members benefits that
are lavish compared with fee-for-service Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration project aimed at changing this system by
having HMOs bid on a single package of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The standard package for Kansas City would have included
coverage of prescriptions drugs, a benefit not provided in
fee-for-service Medicare. Also included were office visits to
primary-care physicians for $12, and a $70 allowance for
eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   These benefits are generous compared with those received by
Medicare beneficiaries in many other areas, said David Durenberger,
a former U.S. senator from Minnesota and member of the
demonstration project's national advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seniors ought to be outside the door saying, `Don't
delay.' They don't realize how good (a benefits package) they'd be
getting,'' Durenberger said. ``For Kansas City, it would be ... a
mistake not to be the first to do competitive bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Durenberger said he did not think it was necessary to delay the
project, but ``there are powerful forces in health care that do not
want to bid on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors dislike managed-care plans such as HMOs,
Durenberger said. Health plans do not like competing on price. And
many politicians are uninformed about the issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no champions for change,'' Durenberger said.

MACHINISTS UNION RATIFIES TWA PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Machinists union at Trans World Airlines
ratified a new agreement Thursday, ending a stormy bargaining
process that began 29 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the International Association of Machinists union,
which represents more than 16,000 TWA employees, approved separate
18-month contracts for three employee groups: mechanics and ramp
workers, flight attendants and passenger-service employees.
</P>
<P>
   Airline analysts said the new contract, which was tentatively
approved last month, was necessary for the St. Louis-based carrier
to recover from its financial predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, among other things, allows TWA to fly jets
designed for regional flights as a way to improve efficiency and
add business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive that they came to an agreement'' with the
Machinists, said Brian Simpson, vice president of the Boyd Group,
an aviation industry consulting firm in Evergreen, Colo. ``The last
thing they need is continued labor uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would disclose the results of the voting. TWA also
declined to disclose the value of the contract, although one
analyst estimated that it will cost the airline $150 million to
$200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was criticized by many of TWA's 2,300 mechanics in
Kansas City. They complained that the new contract did not
immediately improve pension benefits and bring wages to industry
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people are looking forward to living under this
agreement for 18 months,'' said Roy Gardner, vice president of
Machinists Local 1650 in Kansas City. ``But the short length of the
agreement possibly will be a benefit for us. We can try to get
improvements in wages and pension we didn't get this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Compton, TWA's president and chief executive officer,
thanked and congratulated the employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the green light we needed to move ahead with our plans
for the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA released its second-quarter financial results Wednesday,
showing a $6.21 million loss for the period. The company said it
lost high-paying business travelers who were concerned with the
possibility of TWA being struck by the Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   The bargaining entered a 30-day strike countdown in May before a
tentative agreement was reached last month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, employees will receive double-digit
wage increases by August 2000: for mechanics, 11.8 percent; ramp
workers, 11.7 percent; passenger-service employees, 15.5 percent;
and flight attendants, 20.5 percent. However, all wage gains fall
short of current industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics also will receive $10 million in payments related to
grievances, but the first payment is not due until November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants will receive a back-pay award that they
have been seeking payment on through the courts. Under the new
contract, the first payment will come Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The union softened its stance on reaching industry-standard
wages by agreeing to the new contract. However, union officials
said last month that the short length of the agreement, which
expires Jan. 31, 2001, will allow the union to try to obtain a
better long-term pact during the next bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   The company softened its desire to get more work-rule changes
with the tentative agreement. Compton said Wednesday, however, that
the new agreement provides some improvements in that area.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said recently that the shorter length of the
contract also gives the union a chance to assess the direction of
TWA under Compton, who replaced Gerald Gitner as chief executive in
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view this as who wins,'' said David Levine,
contributing editor to PlaneBusiness, an industry financial
newsletter. ``It's not about winning, it's about making livable
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, TWA will continue to try to turn around its
operations. The carrier has embarked on an ambitious fleet-renewal
program that it hopes will reduce fuel and maintenance expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after years of downsizing, TWA said it anticipates
growing in the coming years. TWA announced plans to expand its
service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in November.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract also allows TWA to return to the issue of
Kansas City's overhaul base. In the new contract, the airline
pledges to seek a long-term lease renewal at the overhaul base. The
current lease expires at the end of May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, talks between TWA and the city have bogged down in
recent months as bargaining heated up on the new contract. TWA most
likely will need city or state financial assistance to make
renovations to the overhaul base in any long-term lease renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company said it would work diligently with the city to
renew the lease,'' said Gardner of Local 1650. ``We're looking
forward to being able to keep our work here.''

SPRINT REPORTS RECORD RESULTS IN SECOND QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sprint Corp. on Thursday reported record
second-quarter financial results thanks to growth in its
long-distance and local telephone business and its PCS wireless
group.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's FON group, which includes its long-distance and
local-telephone businesses, earned $386 million, or 44 cents per
share, in the period that ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The results matched most Wall Street forecasts. Last year's
second-quarter profit was $364 million, or 41 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $4.24 billion from $3.95 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS Group, whose results are reported separately, lost
$555 million, or $1.25 per share, compared with a loss of $153
million, or 98 cents a share, in the same quarter of 1998. The
results reflect expenditures of $450 million as the company
continued to expand the network.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS ended the quarter with nearly 4 million customers,
with 617,000 customers added in the second quarter. Average monthly
revenue per user was slightly more than $54 in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint shares fell 1 9/16 to 51 5/8, while Sprint PCS fell 2
9/16 to 55 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's long-distance calling volume rose 24 percent from the
second quarter of 1998. That contributed to a 24 percent increase
in operating earnings to $400 million from $322 million a year ago.
Long-distance revenue was $2.67 billion, up 10 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In its local telephone business, Sprint reported a 4 percent
rise in operating income, to $375 million from $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Westwood-based Sprint credited two of its residential calling
plans _ Sprint Sense AnyTime and Sprint 1000 _ for the growth in
residential long-distance customer minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their core operations continue to perform well as they invest
for future growth,'' said Guy Woodlief, an analyst with Prudential
Securities Inc. ``Sprint's results will at least hold their own
against any of the other large players.''
</P>
<P>
   For the six months that ended June 30, Sprint's FON Group earned
$792 million, or 90 cents per share, compared with $716 million, or
81 cents per share, in 1998. Revenue rose 7 percent to $8.42
billion from $7.84 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS Group in the first six months lost $1.18 billion, or
$2.70 per share, compared with $812 million, or $1.95 cents per
share, in the first half of 1998. Revenue increased to $1.34
billion from $468 million in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   - Sprint said it expected to spend $600 million to $700 million
more this year to pay for its Overland Park headquarters campus and
its unprofitable Global One joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and its two international partners are discussing ways to
restructure Global One.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are higher that it will come out more favorable for
Sprint than the existing arrangement,'' Woodlief said.
</P>
<P>
   - The company also expects to have capital spending of $2.8
billion in 1999 for its local and long-distance phone operations,
Chief Financial Officer Arthur Krause said on a conference call
with analysts and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for a new technology, known as Integrated On-Demand
Network or ION, will be $600 million to $700 million. ION will
offer local, long-distance and high-speed data services to
customers for one monthly rate.
</P>
<P>
   - Sprint said its PCS wireless phone business expected to add
more than 3 million customers this year.

APPRAISAL FIRMS JOIN TO BEGIN NATIONAL CONSULTING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nunnink &AMP; Associates, a Westwood, Kan.-based
real estate appraiser, has joined with 24 regional appraisal firms
to establish a national real estate valuation and consulting
company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, called Integra Realty Resources, will be based
in New York, and Kevin K. Nunnink will be the company's first
chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
   Integra will begin operations Aug. 1 with 355 employees,
including 247 appraisers, said spokeswoman Peggy Mackinnon. The
company will have 31 offices in 22 states.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnink said each of the local appraisal firms would combine its
name with Integra until the Integra brand name was well known.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnink said he probably would serve as Integra's president
until the company hires a chief executive. Nunnink will remain in
the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   The firms are uniting to provide higher-quality appraisal
services to national clients, Nunnink said. The one-company
approach is an attempt to harness local experts in real estate
markets across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the firms had been working in a looser affiliation,
but the single-company approach creates strict guidelines that each
firm must follow.
</P>
<P>
   Nunnink said large accounting firms and other competitors have
appraisers with top-notch credentials, but often they drop those
experts into cities they don't know extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   Integra will compete by providing local experts in markets coast
to coast, Nunnink said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of appraising skills with local market knowledge
is important to many clients served by the firms uniting under the
Integra brand, Nunnink said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those clients package real estate loans into securities
and sell them to investors, so the clients want a reliable system
that meets the standards of credit-rating agencies.

EDITORIAL: TROUBLE OVER TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, July 23: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering with the status of Taiwan is the diplomatic equivalent
of handling nitroglycerin. President Clinton seemed well aware of
the dangers as he carefully picked his words this week in
commenting about heightened tensions between Taiwan and China.
President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan would do well to follow Clinton's
example. Unhappily, he shows no sign of doing so, and Thursday
declared that negotiations between Taiwan and the mainland would
not move forward until Beijing acknowledged the island as a
separate state.
</P>
<P>
   Lee unconvincingly insists that this represents no change in the
``one China'' framework that has allowed the two governments to
coexist peacefully for decades. But he has deliberately chosen
language that plays to Beijing's deepest anxieties about the
permanent partition of China into two independent countries.
Beijing has responded with military threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton at his news conference urged both sides to avoid
escalating tensions and rightly characterized military conflict
between China and Taiwan as ``unthinkable.'' He dispatched Stanley
Roth, the State Department's top Asia hand, to Beijing to remind
Chinese leaders of America's insistence on peaceful handling of the
Taiwan issue. Richard Bush, in charge of America's unofficial
relations with Taiwan, has flown to Taipei to convey Washington's
irritation with Lee, whose statements have disrupted promising
China-Taiwan talks and unsettled the western Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Lee defends his remarks by arguing that they reflect the reality
of Taiwan's freedom from mainland control and asserting that Taipei
must have equal standing with Beijing before it can negotiate
issues like reunification. Such declarations may appeal to
Taiwanese voters. But that cannot justify risking a crisis across
the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's response is rash. Threatening Taiwan with blockade or
invasion is not the way to persuade its people to support
reunification. Washington's relations with Beijing rest not only on
the doctrine that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single
China but also on America's insistence that the reunification issue
be resolved peacefully. Lee should drop his talk of separate
states, and Beijing should abandon the idea of reunification by
military force.

POLITICIANS SHOULD PRACTICE WHAT THEY PREACH ABOUT DIRECT
MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A direct-marketing veteran recently made a point well worth
taking when he accused Congress of being disingenuous by making
horror stories from senior citizens the centerpiece of a probe into
sweepstakes mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only direct marketers who've managed to get my
(87-year-old) father to part with large sums of his retirement
money are the very regulators looking into the sweepstakes
business,'' Don Nagle wrote in a guest column for DM News. ``My
father is routinely targeted by politicians who send him very
personal letters ... and his generous support enables them to be
re-elected again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting view because solicitations for campaign
contributions often are as deceptive as sweepstakes mailings. They
imply the candidate has the potential contributor's best interests
at heart, but most Americans have about as much chance of winning a
sweepstakes as they do of having politicians do something
constructive in their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle could have buttressed his point by including a jab at the
mailings the elderly receive from organizations presenting
themselves as would-be saviors of Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a month goes by without a call or letter from an elderly
reader inquiring about the legitimacy of a solicitation from such a
Washington-based group. The inquiry usually is accompanied by a
lament to the effect that he or she really can't afford to
contribute, but if doing so helps save Social Security or Medicare,
it might be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle says nobody in his experience has specifically made the
elderly targets of a sweepstakes marketing blitz. The sad truth,
however, is that examples of marketing abuse of the elderly are
relatively numerous because the aged are often more easily duped by
those who are conscience-challenged. This is why any effort to
protect the public from unscrupulous marketing types should include
firms that make the elderly targets by design.
</P>
<P>
   One of the television newsmagazines this week featured the sad
tale of an elderly woman who had spent more than $70,000 over
several years in a quest to win a sweepstakes bonanza. It was a
heart-wrenching story, made all the more so by pictures of her
being crowded out of her living space by magazines and other
sweepstakes-generated debris.
</P>
<P>
   As depressing as it all was, though, the thought occurred that
this effort to indict the sweepstakes industry was as pointless as
it was grotesque. If this unfortunate soul hadn't wrecked her life
chasing sweepstakes prizes, she no doubt would have become a
willing accomplice in some other enterprise designed to separate
her from her money, whether legitimate or not.
</P>
<P>
   An unfortunate reality is that those inclined to respond to
sweepstakes pitches probably fit the profile of those who are
easily scammed. Another unfortunate reality is that as long as the
elderly are perceived as easy marks, they'll be targets for the
unscrupulous.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress really has the elderly's best interest at heart, it
should embrace higher standards for its own direct-mail efforts to
raise campaign funds. It wouldn't be a bad idea, either, to extend
its probe to those in Washington who try to fleece the elderly by
making empty promises.

HERSHISER GETS 200TH WIN AS METS ROLL PAST EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Orel Hershiser had a special feeling when he got his
199th career victory, because it was his 100th after shoulder
surgery that nearly ended his career.
</P>
<P>
   But Hershiser will have fond memories as well of his performance
Thursday night. The 40-year-old right-hander became the 95th
pitcher in major league history to reach the 200-victory plateau.
Hershiser did it by tossing seven strong innings in the New York
Mets' 7-4 victory over the Montreal Expos before 8,044 at Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who had also beaten the Expos for No. 199, improved
his record to 200-140 over 16-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (56-41) pulled a season-high 15 games over .500, but
remained two games behind the first-place Atlanta Braves, who ended
a five-game losing streak Thursday night by beating the Florida
Marlins, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser's first victory came on April 4, 1984, when some of
his current teammates were not even in high school. He reached No.
200 with a flourish. Not only did he allow just two runs on six
hits to become the Mets' first 10-game winner, but Hershiser (10-7)
also singled twice, scored a run and stole a base for the first
time in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser almost helped the Mets make some history of their own.
He singled to left in the bottom of the second inning and made a
big turn rounding first base, but then decided not to try for
second. The Mets in that inning came one double short of tying the
63-year-old major league record for most doubles in an inning:
seven, set by the Boston Braves in St. Louis in the first game of a
doubleheader in August 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had already scored three runs in the inning off Dustin
Hermanson on consecutive one-out doubles by Robin Ventura, Brian
McRae and Roger Cedeno, followed by Rey Ordonez's sacrifice fly, to
erase a 1-0 deficit. Following Hershiser's single, Rickey
Henderson, Edgardo Alfonzo and John Olerud all doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who had flown out for the first out of the inning,
struck out for the final out. But between his bookend outs, the
Mets had strung together six doubles and a single in seven official
at-bats against Hermanson (3-9), who is still looking for his first
victory since May 8.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, who pitched his way into the seventh, retired 14 Mets
in a row after Olerud's double. But it was too little, too late.
And Montreal manager Felipe Alou is still looking for the team's
first victory from a starter since June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, meanwhile, had been looking for his 200th victory
since July 6, when he tossed five scoreless innings at Shea Stadium
against the Expos on one day's rest in a 10-0 victory. That was
three starts ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who stole his eighth career base (in the seventh on
the front end of a double steal with Alfonzo), is third among
active pitchers in victories, trailing only Roger Clemens (242) and
Greg Maddux (212).
</P>
<P>
   One night earlier, Henderson passed Willie Mays for fifth place
in career runs scored. Henderson scored the 2,064th and 2,065th
runs of his career Thursday night and is still looking for his
1,000th run batted in, something he undoubtedly would have had, had
Hershiser been standing on second in the second and not on first.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser and Henderson are the same age. When it was suggested
to Hershiser before the game that maybe they should start a club
for 40-year-olds, the pitcher just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What? For 40-year-olds that have accomplished something?'' he
replied. ``There are a lot of those guys out there. Just not in our
profession.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Future of Georgia plant may hinge on F-22
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For eight years, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Marietta
plant, once dubbed the ``airlift capital of the world'' because of
all the cargo planes built there, has been preparing for a new
role.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the company won the primary F-22 fighter contract
in 1991, work began on a complex of new facilities for the
high-tech job of developing and building the world's hottest
fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Today those facilities include special buildings to apply the
jet's secret radar-resistant paint, test its stealth
characteristics and make sure its advanced engines and avionics
work properly. They also include the F-22 final assembly line, at
the end of which a huge banner proclaims: ``Through these doors
pass the most awesome fighters in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote by the U.S. House to eliminate initial
production funding for the plane raises the possibility that all
the preparations could be for naught. Unless the F-22 production
money is restored in House-Senate budget negotiations, the program
will be in jeopardy of cancellation, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and others contend.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a major blow to Lockheed Martin and raise more
fundamental questions about the future of the entire Marietta
plant, two industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the unlikely event that the F-22 is killed, it would be
very, very bad news for the Marietta operation,'' said Richard
Aboulafia, director of aviation for Teal Group, a consulting
company.
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia thinks the debate in Washington will end in a
compromise to save the program.
</P>
<P>
   But if it doesn't, he added, losing the F-22 might prompt
Lockheed Martin, already beset by other business problems, to
restructure its aircraft business. That business is now split
between Marietta and plants in Fort Worth, Texas, and Palmdale,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make an awful lot more sense to consolidate the
Georgia and Texas operations,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet, of JSA
Research, ``and without (ex-House Speaker Newt) Gingrich or (former
U.S. Sen. Sam) Nunn in Washington, the Marietta plant has lost a
lot of clout.''
</P>
<P>
   It's already been a rough year for the Marietta plant, where a
layoff of 2,000 workers is under way as part of a drive to cut
costs on both the F-22 and the C-130J cargo plane program.
</P>
<P>
   Until the House revolt against the F-22, however, the plant's
biggest political hurdle was building a steady stream of orders for
the C-130J. While significant, that was seen as a short-term
problem, since the Air Force plans to buy more than 150 of the
planes, starting around 2004, to replace older models.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is lobbying for accelerated C-130J orders so it
can sustain production in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the House, while killing F-22 production money, also
funded orders for eight C-130J refueling tankers for the Marine
Corps. Neither the Pentagon nor the White House, which support full
F-22 production funding, asked for any C-130Js.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin executives have made it clear they don't take
much consolation in House-added C-130J orders that come at the cost
of the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   They won't comment on the long-term effect of an F-22
cancellation on the Marietta operation. They have hotly disputed
previous suggestions that the plant might be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   For now, employees whose careers may be affected by the F-22
debate can only watch and wait, said Wayne Myrick, president of the
plant's Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   The plant employs 9,000 workers, including 1,700 tied directly
to the F-22 program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a funding issue that will be working its way through
the political process in Washington, and until that's over we don't
know how it might affect our employees,'' Myrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rank and file are pretty attuned to this,'' he added.
``They take it as a threat to their jobs. They're very concerned
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin has a two-thirds share of the F-22 program, with
development, major assembly and ground testing based in Marietta.
The Fort Worth plant assembles mid-fuselage sections for the plane,
while Boeing Co. makes wings and tail sections. Those components
are shipped to Marietta for final assembly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three test versions of the plane have been finished,
with more in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Lockheed Martin and Boeing, more than 1,000 other
businesses supply parts or services for the program.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Orton Industries of Atlanta, which supplies
components for a facility at the Marietta plant where stress tests
are conducted on the F-22 airframe. Orton President James Alexander
said the company's contract runs only one more year and is not
directly tied to production of the airplane. Still, he said, he is
closely watching the F-22 debate and fears ``a ripple effect'' if
production is put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always hidden levels of impact from a program like
this,'' Alexander said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: HOW THE RACIAL LITERACY GAP FIRST OPENED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ill., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My great-grandfather John Wesley Staples (1865-1940) was vain
about writing and scribbled even grocery lists theatrically,
gesturing grandly with the pencil and pausing between words to lick
its point. A fuss over a shopping list seems ridiculous _ until you
consider that John Wesley was born in the slaveholding South, where
educating black people was illegal until after the Civil War and
where aggressively literate blacks were seen as subversive and even
dangerous well into the 20th century. Modern writing on the role of
race in academic achievement generally discounts this history. But
the only way to grasp the extent of the problem is to acknowledge
that black literacy was obstructed as a matter of law for more than
a century.
</P>
<P>
   John Wesley's father, also named John, was enslaved in Virginia
in 1831, when the black Baptist firebrand Nat Turner led the bloody
slave rebellion that terrified the whole of the plantation South.
Slave owners blamed black literacy for the plot, and pursued what
historians have since described as a program of ``compulsory
ignorance'' to prevent slaves from colluding through written
material. A Virginia state law passed in the year of the rebellion
forbade schooling, not just for slaves but for free Negroes as well
_ forcing parents to exile their children into Northern states in
order to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   When free Negroes petitioned for relief, the Legislature passed
a deliberately vindictive statute, banishing from the state any
child who left Virginia for the purpose of learning to read and
write. Similar laws were passed quickly throughout the South and
took an enormous toll. By the time John Wesley was born, only one
in 10 Negro adults were literate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compulsory ignorance'' created a legacy of alienation from
books and reading that has had a lingering effect on
African-American achievement. The most pernicious fallout was a set
of preconceptions _ often held by both blacks and whites _ that
defined brawn work as black and brain work as an exclusively white
activity. Of the many obstacles to academic excellence,
expectations based in race have proved to be one of the most
important _ and least-studied _ factors.
</P>
<P>
   This could change with a forthcoming report from the National
Task Force on Minority High Achievement, sponsored by the College
Board. Many studies have scrutinized academic achievement among
impoverished black students. But the task force study, one of the
first of its kind, has ventured into affluent areas like Evanston,
Ill., and Berkeley, Calif., to examine a disturbingly persistent
achievement gap between blacks and whites who are essentially of
the same class and economic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article by The Times' Pam Belluck examining the task
force's work in Evanston shows that the fallout of enforced
illiteracy is still evident not just among the black poor but in
the black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Black students who excel at school typically struggle with
racial stereotypes and conflicted notions of ethnic identity. Some
students absorb the broader society's view that they can never be
first-rate students and give up trying. Those who excel are
routinely attacked by their friends for ``selling out'' and
becoming ``white.'' Still others find themselves confronted by
teachers and counselors who cannot conceive of them as academically
inclined and discourage them from taking advanced courses.
</P>
<P>
   Black families that urge their children on are historically less
well equipped than whites to provide necessary supports. For one
thing, the black parents are most often first-generation college
graduates _ who grew up in households without books or systems that
could support first-rate academic achievement. The current crop of
black high achievers, then, is battling hostile cultural conditions
_ and traveling a course that no one in the family has traveled
before.
</P>
<P>
   The National Task Force on Minority High Achievement will study
these students at school, at home and among their peers _ in an
attempt to produce more of them, more quickly. But what is already
clear is that the leap from averageness to excellence for children
of the black middle class will require discarding attitudes and
preconceptions that were hundreds of years in the making.

ADS AT SAFECO FIELD AS EYE-CATCHING AS NEW BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For anyone watching Ken Griffey Jr. prowl center field
during the past week, the message above his head couldn't be
missed: ``Longs Drugs. Sun glasses 50 percent off everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun glasses? Connected with Seattle baseball?
</P>
<P>
   It's just one sign of how much times have changed for the
Seattle Mariners both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Kingdome for their new $517 million open-air
facility across the street, the Mariners have added at least a
dozen advertisers and sponsors, and the new names and products are
just about as eye-catching as the stadium itself.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 75 companies are listed as Safeco Field sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics argue that the new stadium is far too
commercialized for a facility financed in large part by public tax
dollars, some of the advertisers believe they have already gotten
their money's worth and more.
</P>
<P>
   Tully's Coffee, for example, out-bid Starbucks to be the coffee
provider at Safeco, and company president Tom O'Keefe couldn't be
happier with the result.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Tully's advertising on the main scoreboard, but it
sponsors the hand-operated scoreboard in left field with its logo
on the outfield wall, is part of the revolving signs behind home
plate and has outlets throughout the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe hopes that Mariners fans and viewers begin to associate
Tully's with the team just like Seattle is associated with coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners really have a variety of levels of attractions
for somebody like ourselves,'' O'Keefe said. ``Certainly the
regional marketing-advertising aspect is incredible. We are in
Western Washington and soon to be in eastern Washington, Idaho,
Oregon and Vancouver, B.C.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Keefe also sees national and international exposure coming
from the company's affiliation with the Mariners and Safeco Field.
He noted that he was in Taipei on business recently and saw his
company's name during the Mariners' broadcast via ESPN
International cable TV. For him, the advertising means that when
the games or highlights are shown around the world, Tully's will
likely have one of its ads on display as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that in the short homestand since the opening of
Safeco Field, we may have already paid for our annual sponsorship
via the national exposure we've received on TV to date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Aylward, the Mariners vice president of business and sales
who held a similar position for the Orioles in Baltimore and for
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before coming to Seattle, said moving into
the new stadium has given the team a variety of sponsorship and
advertising vehicles it never had in 22 years in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked long and hard and beefed up our corporate marketing
staff in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that
Safeco Field gives a team,'' Aylward said. ``I'd like to think
that, looking around there, we did a pretty fair job.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward noted that most companies don't just sign on to
advertise in the stadium. The team also has packages that allow
sponsors to be part of the team's game programs, Web site, TV and
radio broadcasts and public service efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just signage. These are integrated packages that a
sports team can put together,'' Aylward said. ``These companies are
getting really savvy to know that it's a smart way to reach their
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the new sponsors is Tesoro Refining, Marketing &AMP; Supply.
The San Antonio-based oil and gas supplier and producer has only a
handful of services stations here but plans to expand throughout
the Northwest. Advertising in Safeco Field is a way the company can
begin to make its product known.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in Alaska and Hawaii, and they recognize this as
a way to get their name recognized and out in front of people since
they are going to be rolling out big time here in this region,''
Aylward said. ``That region matches the Mariners' region perfectly.
It's a great setup for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesoro officials agree wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners were just a no-brainer for us,'' said Steve
Rucker, national market brand manager for Tesoro. ``The markets we
do business in include Oregon, Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest down to Reno. Because none of the markets have a major
baseball team, they all look to the Mariners and have adopted the
Mariners as their team.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its signs in Safeco, Tesoro also advertises on
the M's radio broadcasts and has purchased a suite to entertain
clients and company employees. It's all part of a long-range plan
worked out with team officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for partners that want to take advantage of that
Mariners brand, because it works,'' Aylward said. ``The first thing
you do is sit down and try to figure out what the company is all
about. Then we go away and create a package. We tell them, `Based
on what we heard you say, this is what we can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of new ads and sponsors, however, hasn't made
everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   Public Facilities District member Terrence Carroll is concerned
that the number of signs has created visual overload that takes
away from the game. He advocates a limit on how much of the stadium
can be turned over to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, it's already at the maximum of stimulation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Pastier, an architecture critic who has consulted on six
different stadiums, believes the sheer number of signs, both
permanent and on the video boards, detracts from the overall
ballpark experience. During the course of a game he counted about
60 ads or promotions that are visible from the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners see this stadium as an opportunity to make as
much money as possible, and that's part of the problem,'' Pastier
said. ``It's kind of offensive to have the most expensive stadium
in the country and then see all this stuff all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kingdome, the Mariners took in $4.8 million last year
from in-house advertising and suite rentals combined. Pastier
estimates the M's already have made that much money just in
advertising and sponsorships at Safeco Field. Rates vary depending
on the individual packages, and the figures have not been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The per-ad rate is going to be a lot higher because it's a
much more desirable place to be,'' Pastier said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Brenner, spokesman for Team Marketing Report, a
Chicago-based sports industry newsletter and analyst, notes that
new stadiums create all sorts of advertising and sponsorship
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are trying to be a little more savvy about how
sponsorships are packaged,'' Brenner said. ``From the team side,
especially as the new stadiums and arenas are opening, teams are
designing sponsorship opportunities into the design of the stadium.
It's so important that it's being incorporated into the
blueprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, however, added that his company does not yet have a
firm grip on how much additional revenue the new sponsorships are
producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a pretty significant jump in terms of stadium
revenue, and that's obviously what's driving teams to build or move
into new stadiums,'' he said. ``It's significant, but whether it's
double or 75 percent, it's not something that we've been able to
put a figure on.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much when it comes to advertising in a new
ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   Brenner noted that Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix limits its
number of major sponsors to between eight and 10. ``Those are the
companies that have a major, major presence, and you can't miss
them. That's by design,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward believes the M's have tried to be tasteful in the number
and placement of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked real hard,'' Aylward said. ``A lot of people want to
criticize advertising. But I maintain that if it's done right as
part of the ballpark, it adds to it. There are ballparks around the
major leagues where there is so much going on that it doesn't work
for the advertiser or the fan. We're trying to maintain a
balance.''

MICROSOFT PAINTS A PICTURE OF FIERCE COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft is known for conservatism in predicting
financial performance, but President Steve Ballmer seemed to carry
that tendency to new extremes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to an instant poll in which most attendees at a meeting
predicted Microsoft revenues would grow 25 percent or more in the
new fiscal year, Ballmer exclaimed, ``Come on! It's outlandish!
It's crazy!''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer pounded a fist into his hand with each word, his voice
high and straining, as he addressed 300 analysts and journalists at
the company's annual analyst meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have competition like never, ever, ever before!''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Between fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1999, the Redmond software
giant's annual revenues have grown by an average of 32 percent. But
for several reasons, such vigorous growth will be hard to maintain
in fiscal year 2000, which began July 1, said Ballmer and other
Microsoft executives.
</P>
<P>
   Noted doomsayer Greg Maffei, the Redmond company's chief
financial officer, ticked off the list: declining PC shipments,
cheap PCs, saturation of the market for the Office software suite,
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget continuing losses in the company's Consumer and
Commerce division, increased competition and the influx of portable
computing devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge will come from declining sales of PCs and
the PC-based software that makes up a large percentage of
Microsoft's revenue stream, company executives said. The increase
in PC shipments is expected to slow to between 6 and 8 percent,
compared with past years' increases in the teens.
</P>
<P>
   And the PCs under $1,000 that now make up 68 percent of all
units shipped in the United States _ not to mention the freebies _
tend to come without any extra Microsoft software installed. The
people who buy them tend to not buy such software, instead using
them for Internet access, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Linux, the much-discussed operating system that
seeks to challenge Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Again pounding his fist, Ballmer described the Linux phenomenon
as ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition will also come from Sun's Enterprise Java Beans,
which he said is drawing developers away from Microsoft's
Windows-oriented development tools.
</P>
<P>
   You might think conquering 93 percent of the market for office
application suites would make Microsoft happy, but no. Now
``there's no upside left'' in that market, Maffei lamented.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Office 2000 sold 30 percent better during its
first few days at retail than did its predecessor, declining Office
prices will mean it generates fewer revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer and Commerce division, led by Jon DeVaan and Brad
Chase, has lost more money each year, and bigger losses are
projected for fiscal year 2000, though ``we will continue to
invest'' in the division, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of good news the executives let slip through is that the
company is achieving greater penetration with its high-end
corporate database and messaging software.
</P>
<P>
   Though Microsoft is often thought of as consumer-oriented, 81
percent of its revenues in fiscal 1999 came from businesses, said
Jeff Raikes, group vice president of worldwide sales and support.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from the server version of the Windows NT high-end
operating system grew by 34 percent in the year, and the product
outshipped competitors NetWare, Unix and AS/400 combined, Raikes
said. It now holds 73 percent of the server operating-system
market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also is targeting non-PCs with its CE version of the
Windows operating system, as it acknowledges that its old slogan _
``A computer on every desk and in every home'' _ is no longer on
target.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company emphasizes letting people and businesses use
Microsoft's software any time, any place and with any device.
</P>
<P>
   The market will determine whether Microsoft's value continues to
soar beyond the $547 billion it hit this week. ``It looked scary a
long time ago,'' Maffei said. ``When does it look ludicrous?''

   But O'Keefe also sees national and international exposure coming
from the company's affiliation with the Mariners and Safeco Field.
He noted that he was in Taipei on business recently and saw his
company's name during the Mariners' broadcast via ESPN
International cable TV. For him, the advertising means that when
the games or highlights are shown around the world, Tully's will
likely have one of its ads on display as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that in the short homestand since the opening of
Safeco Field, we may have already paid for our annual sponsorship
via the national exposure we've received on TV to date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Aylward, the Mariners vice president of business and sales
who held a similar position for the Orioles in Baltimore and for
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before coming to Seattle, said moving into
the new stadium has given the team a variety of sponsorship and
advertising vehicles it never had in 22 years in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked long and hard and beefed up our corporate marketing
staff in an effort to take advantage of the opportunities that
Safeco Field gives a team,'' Aylward said. ``I'd like to think
that, looking around there, we did a pretty fair job.''
</P>
<P>
   Aylward noted that most companies don't just sign on to
advertise in the stadium. The team also has packages that allow
sponsors to be part of the team's game programs, Web site, TV and
radio broadcasts and public service efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just signage. These are integrated packages that a
sports team can put together,'' Aylward said. ``These companies are
getting really savvy to know that it's a smart way to reach their
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the new sponsors is Tesoro Refining, Marketing &AMP; Supply.
The San Antonio-based oil and gas supplier and producer has only a
handful of services stations here but plans to expand throughout
the Northwest. Advertising in Safeco Field is a way the company can
begin to make its product known.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in Alaska and Hawaii, and they recognize this as
a way to get their name recognized and out in front of people since
they are going to be rolling out big time here in this region,''
Aylward said. ``That region matches the Mariners' region perfectly.
It's a great setup for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesoro officials agree wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners were just a no-brainer for us,'' said Steve
Rucker, national market brand manager for Tesoro. ``The markets we
do business in include Oregon, Hawaii, Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest down to Reno. Because none of the markets have a major
baseball team, they all look to the Mariners and have adopted the
Mariners as their team.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its signs in Safeco, Tesoro also advertises on
the M's radio broadcasts and has purchased a suite to entertain
clients and company employees. It's all part of a long-range plan
worked out with team officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for partners that want to take advantage of that
Mariners brand, because it works,'' Aylward said. ``The first thing
you do is sit down and try to figure out what the company is all
about. Then we go away and create a package. We tell them, `Based
on what we heard you say, this is what we can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of new ads and sponsors, however, hasn't made
everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   Public Facilities District member Terrence Carroll is concerned
that the number of signs has created visual overload that takes
away from the game. He advocates a limit on how much of the stadium
can be turned over to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, it's already at the maximum of stimulation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Pastier, an architecture critic who has consulted on six
different stadiums, believes the sheer number of signs, both
permanent and on the video boards, detracts from the overall
ballpark experience. During the course of a game he counted about
60 ads or promotions that are visible from the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mariners see this stadium as an opportunity to make as
much money as possible, and that's part of the problem,'' Pastier
said. ``It's kind of offensive to have the most expensive stadium
in the country and then see all this stuff all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kingdome, the Mariners took in $4.8 million last year
from in-house advertising and suite rentals combined. Pastier
estimates the M's already have made that much money just in
advertising and sponsorships at Safeco Field. Rates vary depending
on the individual packages, and the figures have not been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The per-ad rate is going to be a lot higher because it's a
much more desirable place to be,'' Pastier said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Brenner, spokesman for Team Marketing Report, a
Chicago-based sports industry newsletter and analyst, notes that
new stadiums create all sorts of advertising and sponsorship
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are trying to be a little more savvy about how
sponsorships are packaged,'' Brenner said. ``From the team side,
especially as the new stadiums and arenas are opening, teams are
designing sponsorship opportunities into the design of the stadium.
It's so important that it's being incorporated into the
blueprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, however, added that his company does not yet have a
firm grip on how much additional revenue the new sponsorships are
producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a pretty significant jump in terms of stadium
revenue, and that's obviously what's driving teams to build or move
into new stadiums,'' he said. ``It's significant, but whether it's
double or 75 percent, it's not something that we've been able to
put a figure on.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is too much when it comes to advertising in a new
ballpark?
</P>
<P>
   Brenner noted that Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix limits its
number of major sponsors to between eight and 10. ``Those are the
companies that have a major, major presence, and you can't miss
them. That's by design,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Aylward believes the M's have tried to be tasteful in the number
and placement of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked real hard,'' Aylward said. ``A lot of people want to
criticize advertising. But I maintain that if it's done right as
part of the ballpark, it adds to it. There are ballparks around the
major leagues where there is so much going on that it doesn't work
for the advertiser or the fan. We're trying to maintain a
balance.''

COLISEUM FINANCING PLAN IN WORKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. Gray Davis' designated NFL deal-maker for the
Coliseum is close to recommending a financing plan that would
primarily utilize bonds to construct approximately 15,000 parking
spaces at state-owned Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, Davis' personal representative in negotiations to
bring an NFL expansion team to Los Angeles, said he will propose a
complex series of bonds and venue-generated revenues to pay them
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to some conclusions, but I'm not final, final,
final,'' Chadwick said. ``Give or take, building 15,000 new parking
spaces is going to cost $150 million. The state has directed me to
figure out a way to finance that without using existing general
funds and without having new taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means taxable and tax-exempt bonds to build it, which you
can do. It's not one bond, it's probably 10 bonds in a series. I'm
still working on the various sources of revenue that might be
available to pay principal and interest on the bonds _ for example,
property taxes, ticket surcharge, parking revenues, sales taxes,
transient occupancy taxes, etc., etc. _ to cobble together enough
sources of revenue to pay principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think I'm there, but I'm not positive that I'm there.
It's not easy to figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL insists on significant additional parking at the
Coliseum as a condition for expansion, but Davis and local
government officials have balked at using public funds. Chadwick
believes he is now close to a plan that will satisfy all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty comfortable with it, but every time I look at it, I
change something,'' Chadwick said. ``I think it's doable, but I'm
still fine-tuning it. I'll probably be fine-tuning it for a
month.'' &QL;
