<P>
BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Portugal captured the first
semifinals place at the Euro 2000 when they beat 10-men Turkey 2-0
in Saturday's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first one in any major event since 1984 for
Portugal, who dominated the match at the Amsterdam ArenA and had
all the two goals scored by Benfica striker Nuno Gomes.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese will meet the winner of the France-Spain quarter-
final, which to be played on Sunday, in the semifinals in Brussels
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nuno Gomes opened the scores for Portugal at the 44th minute
and added the second at 56. The two goals gave the Portuguese,
known as 'the Brazilians of Europe' in full domination after
Turkey defender Alpay Ozalan was sent off in the 29th minute of a
scrappy and ill-disciplined first half.
</P>
<P>
Alpay was dismissed for retaliation after he had jumped into a
challenge with Fernando Couto, the Turk lashing out with his arm
as Couto lay on the pitch, but some saw the decision as harsh.
</P>
<P>
The Turks also missed a penalty shortly before the interval,
when Arif Erdem fired his spot-kick straight at Vitor Baia, after
being adjudged to have been brought down by Couto. The goalkeeper
then blocked the follow-up shot from Hakan Sukur.
</P>
<P>
The opening period began with Portugal, producing bursts of
their delightful one-touch flowing football, on top, but soon
degenerated into a series of fouls which resulted in five yellow
cards and one red one in 12 minutes. The final tally was seven
yellows.
</P>
<P>
The second came after a sweeping and skilful move, started on
the left by Dimas, who found Figo.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona forward outwitted Hakan Unsul comprehensively and,
after a burst of speed, pulled the ball back across goal for Nuno
Gomes to glide it home from close range.

The number of rescue teams has increased to ten from five.
However, rescue efforts are becoming more difficult, local sources

three days in summer.

Luzhou City and downstream Chongqing City will strengthen
cooperation and rescue the victims by all means, the sources said.

CHONGQING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Imports and exports in this

<P>
Customs statistics showed that the city imported 342 million US

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants' Strike Continues in Nigeria's Lagos State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Government offices remained closed
and state- owned firms paralyzed Saturday as the civil servants'
strike in Lagos State in southwestern Nigeria entered its third
day.
</P>
<P>
The state government and strikers maintain their own tough
stance over the minimum monthly wage, with the government sticking
to its offer of 5, 500 naira ( 55 U.S. dollars), and the state
employees insisting on 7,500 naira (75 dollars) given to employees
of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of different minimum wages for federal and
state workers by the central government on May 1 triggered the
crisis, which threatens to erupt into another nationwide strike
as workers in the country' s 36 states demand between 6,500 naira
(65 dollars) and 7,500 (75 dollars) naira minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
A meeting in the capital Abuja Thursday between state governors
and representatives of the labor group, the Nigeria Labour
Congress (NLC), failed to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos State government Friday attempted to break the ranks
of the workers by enforcing an earlier directive that the workers
return to their desks or be fired.
</P>
<P>
In compliance, many workers reported at their various offices
to register their names, but they were later chased out of the
premises by officials of the Council of Industrial Union (COIU),
the umbrella body for all labor unions in the state public
service.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, the government declared the union illegal and
expressed the hope that the strike would soon end.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that by Monday or Tuesday, everything would have been
100 percent normal," governor of the state Rauf Tinubu said.
</P>
<P>
But COIU chairman Ayodele Akele, who addressed the workers
Friday, asked them not to be intimidated by the government's
action, saying that it was impossible for the government to break
the strike.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Denies Coup Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Army Saturday described
as malicious and injurious a report alleging that some officers
were holding secret meetings with a view to toppling the country's
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
The statement was in response to a report carried by a
Lagos-based radio station saying that officers within the ranks of
colonels and majors were holding secret meetings in Makurdi in the
middle belt, Calabar and Port Harcourt, both in the southeast,
with the intention of overthrowing President Olusegun Obasanjo's
one-year-old government.
</P>
<P>
The army is taking the issue seriously because Nigeria is
widely regarded as coup prone, with more than half a dozen
successful military coups since 1966, in addition to a host of
unsuccessful bids.
</P>
<P>
The army has ruled Africa's most populous nation for 29 of its
39 years after independence, and the country only returned to
civilian rule on May, 29, 1999 after 15 years of unbroken military
rule.
</P>
<P>
Successive military dictators have plundered the economy and
damaged the national psyche with unbridled corruption and human
rights violations, making Nigerians to be very alert to actions
that could bring back the soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Parliament Special Committee Supports Bashar's Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A special committee of Syrian
parliament on Sunday gave its blessings to the nomination of Bashar
al-Assad for the post of president to succeed his late father,
President Hafez al-Assad, who died on June 10.
</P>
<P>
According to the official SANA news agency, the 70-member
committee of the 250-seat People's Assembly discussed the
nomination of Bashar by the ruling Baath party and expressed its "
total support" for his candidacy for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
A full session of the parliament is expected to be held Monday
to approve Bashar's nomination and set a date for a referendum for
the country's nearly 7 million voters to decide whether Bashar will
be the new ruler.
</P>
<P>
If approved, Bashar will serve as Syria's 16th president for a
seven-year term. He has already been appointed supreme commander of
the armed forces and was elected secretary of the Baath party's top
policy-making body at the end of the party's ninth conference last
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Britain Charges Three Dutchmen Over Drug Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British officials said on Sunday
that three Dutchmen have been charged with drug smuggling after
the seizure of eight tons of cannabis from a yacht off the
Scottish coast.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Britain's Customs and Excise Department said
the three Dutchmen would appear at a Court in Aberdeen, the North-
east port city of Britain, on Monday, charged in connection with
the illegal importation of a controlled substance.
</P>
<P>
British customs officers boarded the yacht "Red Scorpion" on
Saturday while it was in international waters off the northeast
coast of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
They took charge of the yacht after discovering the cannabis
resin, estimated to be worth over 20 million pounds (about 30
million United States dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Smugglers being smugglers, they will make diversions to get
into any point of the United Kingdom mainland," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Jail Protest Spreads in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A jail protest by inmates protesting
conditions and calling for amnesties spread from the north to the
south of Italy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Naples, prisoners in the Poggioreale and Secondigliano jails
rattled the bars of their cells and shouted slogans during the
night and into the morning, taking their cue from counterparts in
the northeastern city of Trieste Saturday, who waved burning
sheets and threw flaming paper out of their cell windows.
</P>
<P>
The Trieste inmates demanded to meet the prison warden and,
like the others, called for an amnesty for many crimes. Like most
Italian jails, Trieste is over-crowded, with 210 inmates for its
150 places.
</P>
<P>
But the extent of the over-capacity in Italy's teeming jails is
estimated to be around 30,000. The situation is made worse by grim
living conditions and the fact that a large percentage of the
prison population has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
There were similar protests, all without violent incidents, in
the Genoese prison Pontedecimo and in Bergamo east of Milan.
</P>
<P>
A half-hour protest took place Sunday afternoon in another
northern city, Trento, while in Bologna a group of inmates started
a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
The protests have taken the political world by surprise,
especially after the recent approval of a reform that would
improve living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Italian Justice Minister Piero Fassino said Sunday the
government's "structural strategy" would allow parliament to
calmly assess the various calls for "an act of clemency" that
would ease the pressure inside Italy's jails.
</P>
<P>
He said the over-crowded and inadequate state of the prisons
had been known for some time, adding that "the government is
working to tackle this situation both by building more jails and
by new prison regulations which will permit less pitiful and
constrained living conditions."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ready to Hold Referendum on Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Ding Qilin and Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Ugandans will go to
the 17,000 polling stations across the country on June 29 in the
national referendum to determine the political system of the east
African nation.
</P>
<P>
"There are two sections of forces in Uganda, one force wants
the system of the National Resistance Movement to be continued,
and another section of people thinks the multiparty system should
be followed," Aziz Kasujja, chairman of the Ugandan National
Electoral Commission, said in an interview with Xinhua at his
office.
</P>
<P>
When the Movement took power in 1986, it promised to enable the
people of Uganda to make a constitution. In 1988 the government
set up the Uganda constitutional commission comprising of 22
eminent people.
</P>
<P>
The commission collected people's views on the new constitution
which was passed in 1995. However, on the form of governance, a
majority of Ugandans preferred the Movement (or one party) system
to continue while some people wanted a multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding a referendum to decide future political
system is contained in the constitution which recognizes people's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"The referendum on a political system is necessary, because the
 constitution provides for it on the basis that all power belongs
to the people," Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
"People are given right to vote for or against either of the
systems, the Movement or the multiparty, but no one can be forced
to vote," Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
Since the National Electoral Commission was established in
1996, it has done plenty of work to prepare for the referendum.
"Everything is ready at the final stage, and everything is going
smoothly despite of some difficulties," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"The major difficulty the commission has been facing is
inadequate resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum expenditure totals 22 billion Uganda shillings
(about 15 million U.S. dollars). But the commission has only
received around 13 billion shillings. Some money from donor
community has gone to the civic education in the country.
</P>
<P>
From January 17 to February, a total of 300 million shillings
was paid to the civic educators who were recruited for every
parish in the country during a civic education campaign initiated
by the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The education campaign countrywide has not been so successful
due to low voters' turnout, said Dick Kizito, public relations
officer of the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, majority of Ugandans are expected to vote. "From scene
they demand voters' cards, we can see they are enthusiastic,"
Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
According to a public opinion poll conducted by K2-Research
Ltd, an affiliate of K2-Consult of Denmark, 75.5 percent of the
respondents said they would vote while 23.2 percent said they
would not.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be supervised by independent organizations.
"The commission has also invited some international observers to
supervise the exercise," said Kasujja.
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, the referendum will be held, with security and order
being guaranteed by the government," he added.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Zimbabwe's Parliamentary Voting Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Voting ended at 7 pm on Sunday, the
final day in Zimbabwe's two-day parliamentary election, with the
Election Directorate ruling out extension of voting and declaring
that counting begins on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
About four million of the 5.1 million registered voters were
estimated to have cast their vote by close of polling at some
4,000 polling stations in the country's 120 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Peace prevailed throughout the country during the elections in
contrast to predictions that the poll would be marred by violence.
</P>
<P>
Many people, mostly whites, fled the country with some
companies closing for fear of violence that left about 30 people
dead, 300 injured in the run up to the election since February.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Saturday when there were high turnouts everywhere,
Sunday was a mixture of long queues in some areas but none at all
in others, indicating that most people voted on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the European Union observer team Pierre Schori said his
team had not received any reports of irregularities worth talking
of.
</P>
<P>
However, there were cases of people trying to vote twice.
Police arrested some of these people, while others were simply
turned away by polling officials.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has said the huge voter turnout and
peace showed that democracy is getting stronger in the country.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change
Morgan Tsvangirai said in a statement his party was happy with
the way people voted, adding that intimidation of his supporters
had receded.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 candidates from about 15 political parties and
independents are contesting 120 seats on offer in the 150-member
House of Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Oil Production Not Affected By Blast: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's oil production will
not be affected by the explosion Sunday dawn in the Mina al-Ahmadi
refinery, said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Naser Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the statement at a press conference after he
rushed to the explosion scene for an inspection of the refinery,
which processed 440,000 barrels of crude each day.
</P>
<P>
An oil source was quoted by the official Kuwaiti News Agency as
saying that the huge blast took place Sunday morning during
attempts to control a gas leakage of a pipeline, which killed three
people and injured 43 others, and caused unspecified material
damage.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Al-Sabah told reporters that the fire caused by the
explosion has been put off, and actions and measures have been
taken to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
The refinery has been completely closed, he said, adding it may
take several months before the factory can resume full operation.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "baseless and untrue" the claim that the
accident occurred because of outworn equipment, saying all the oil
installations are completely checked and repaired every two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti National Oil Company issued a statement,
denying the explosion might result from a sabotage operation.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the country's power plants were not affected
as fuel supply to them did not stop. Neither were the local supply
of fuel oil, liquefied gas and plane fuel, it added, thanks to the
availability of sufficient reserves.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait produces 2.37 million barrels of oil per day. Its two
other refineries of Al-Shabia and Abdullah Port, are now operating
at full capacity.

<HEADLINE> Iran Burns 23 Tons of Drugs to Mark Anti-Drug Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday afternoon burned 23
tons of various seized narcotics with a market value of over 3
billion U.S. dollars to mark the international anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held on a hill in northern Tehran in the presence
of senior Iranian officials, foreign diplomats and representatives
of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Under tight security, a pile of drug was set on fire, belching
heavy, black smoke into the air.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi
Shahroudi called on the international community, particularly the
European countries, to help Iran in its campaign against drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"I call on all European countries and countries neighboring Iran
to expand their technological, research, training and financial
cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the global
campaign against narcotics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shahroudi said that 2,958 Iranians sacrificed their lives in the
campaign since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran has spent more than 900 million dollars for the
construction of fortifications and deployment of forces in border
areas and is spending 200 million dollars more annually for the
campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that over 263 tons of various narcotics were captured in
1,445 operations.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world countries to coordinate their anti-drug
efforts, harshen punishments, and facilitate the extradition of
narcotic criminals.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to set up a regional research and study center
on narcotics, because countries in the region are hardest hit by
the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
Iran stepped up its massive anti-drug campaigns after its Majlis
(parliament) passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989 against drug
trafficking and drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Israeli Presidents Praise Bashar as "Kind Man" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his Israeli counterpart said on Sunday that Bashar al-Assad, son of
late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, is "a kind man" and would be
a good president of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, a young eye doctor who did not come from the military
but looked after patients, "must be a kind man," Weizman said after
meeting with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Bashar al-Assad will be an excellent president," Mubarak said
at a press conference held jointly with Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Hafez al-Assad died on June 10. The Syrian leadership has since
been taking steps to promote Bashar, the heir apparent, to Syria's
top position.
</P>
<P>
"Everything reported on the frailness of the Syrian leadership
are mere false rumors," Mubarak stressed, saying that the Syrian
leadership will continue and Bashar will be "persistent and firm."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Weizman left Cairo for home, ending a short "
farewell" visit to Egypt. He is due to retire from politics early
July, three years before his term ends, partly for allegations of
corruption and tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Weizman, both former pilots who fought in the wars
between the two countries, have known each other since Egypt and
Israel made peace in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was one of the key figures who played a benevolent role
in making peace between Egypt and Israel, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the efforts Weizman has exerted and continues
to exert as president for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Seizes Another Iraqi Ship for Violating U.N. Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti coast guard patrols
stopped another Iraqi ship in Kuwaiti territorial waters Saturday
night, said the Interior Ministry in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second Iraqi ship seized in 24 hours. According to
the statement carried by the official Kuwaiti News Agency, the ship
was one its way from Iraq's southern port of Umm Qasr to the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
It said the ship, with an eight-member crew on board, was
carrying 449 heads of sheep. The previous ship intercepted Saturday
morning was an oil tanker, carrying 650 tons of diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
There have been four Iraqi ships stopped by the Kuwaiti coast
guard patrols in Kuwaiti territorial waters between May and June,
for violating the U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The ships were found to be carrying leatherware, wool, lentil,
dates and grain, the Kuwaiti statement said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under 10-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions, which
had banned Iraq from conducting practically all trade until limited
oil sales were permitted in 1996 under the U.N. oil-for-food
program for Iraq to buy humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program was expanded last December to allow
virtually free oil sales, but still under U.N. supervision.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Defense Minister Clarifies Armament Policy as Self-Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz said his
country's armament policy aims at achieving self-sufficiency and
protecting the public security and sanctities.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with visiting French Defense
Minister Alain Richard in Saudi Red Sea port city of Jeddah late
Saturday night, Prince Sultan said Saudi Kingdom was not confined
its arms imports to any specific country.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has worked out five-year and ten-year plans and the
strategies for maintaining its security and serving the Arab Nation
especially the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) and the Damascus Declaration, Prince Sultan added.
</P>
<P>
On the Saudi-French accord for the supply of French Le Claire
tanks and ground defense systems, he said the Kingdom has been
studying the supply of such tanks and systems since three years
ago. Seven Saudi army officers have been cooperating with their
French counterparts in the development of the tanks since then.
</P>
<P>
France is one of the earliest countries that cooperate with
Saudi Arabia sincerely and positively, the Saudi official noted,
adding that the cooperation is growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
In the light of balanced economic cooperation between Saudi
Arabia and France, the Kingdom seeks to develop joint ventures to
serve the interests of both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are joint Saudi-French committees that work hard to
determine whether the supply of Le Claire tanks would be in the
form of purchase or manufacturing and the possibility of private
sector involvement in the deal, the Saudi minister added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Richard said he discussed with Prince Sultan the
Middle East peace process, noting that France was trying to find an
solution acceptable to all concerned parties in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the Syrian-Israeli peace track, he said France holds that the
basis for peace should be the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
As for the joint military manufacturing, Richard said France
wants to establish a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia and
enhance the military cooperation to serve the world peace, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz received the French defense
minister upon the latter's arrival in Jeddah Saturday evening.

Sunday closed the daily Bayan, one of the few reformist newspapers
left after the mass closure of 17 reformist papers and journals by
conservative courts in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The clerical court ordered to suspend the publication of the
daily, citing offenses of the Constitution, the Islamic penal code
as well as the press law as reasons, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The managing editor of Bayan is Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur, an
adviser to reform-minded President Mohammad Khatami and a former
interior minister.
</P>
<P>
As a medium-ranking cleric, Mohtashamipur was reportedly
summoned by the special court recently. The clerical court is
responsible for handling offenses committed by religious figures.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative courts ordered the closure of the 17
reformist
publications in the past few months as a way to crack down on the
country's growing reformist campaign which pushed reformers to the
landslide victory of parliamentary elections in February.
</P>
<P>
Tehran's Justice Department announced Sunday that the court
hearings for the banned publications will begin next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Jews Charged With Spying May Face Death Penalty: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Public prosecutor Ayatollah
Morteza Moqtadae said Sunday that the 13 Iranian Jews charged with
spying for Israel could be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Moqtadae's remarks were contradictory to those made by another
judiciary official who assured earlier that the accused would not
face death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Moqtadae said the Jews have been found guilty of spying for "the
Zionist regime" (Israel), and according to law they could be
sentenced to either death or prison terms, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the official further noted that
the legal proceedings against the suspects did not indicate that
they would not be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the head of justice in Iran's southern Fars
Province, Hossein Ali Amiri, dismissed speculations that the Jews
would be sentenced to death, saying they are not charged with "
mohareb" (waging war against God and the country), the only crime
carrying the death penalty in the case.
</P>
<P>
Court hearings for the accused Jews began on April 13 in Shiraz,
capital of Fars Province, and formally concluded on Saturday. So
far at least eight of the suspects have reportedly confessed to
passing on classified information to Israel and having connections
with Israel's security service.
</P>
<P>
Amiri said the court ruling on the suspects would be issued
within a week following the conclusion of the hearings. The verdict
will
also concern four Muslims charged with the same offenses.
</P>
<P>
Under the Western powers' pressure to release the Jews, Iran
insists that the arrests of them, in March 1999, had nothing to do
with their religious backgrounds and no foreign country should
interfere in Iran's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for International Relief to Drought-hit Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday called on the international community to
rush help to counter the famine and drought crisis in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The need for a firm decision in this regard is now felt more
than ever before and all world countries are required to prevent a
human tragedy in the region, Asefi said here.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the severe famine and drought disaster in most
parts of Afghanistan, he underlined the need to dispatch relief aid
for the deprived and oppressed people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under present circumstances, the dispatch of international
relief aid seems to be vital, Asefi said, adding that the aid will
help prevent Afghan refugees from entering Iran, Afghanistan's
western neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Iran has taken in more than 1.5 million Afghan refugees over the
past two decades, and an influx of more refugees will worsen the
situation, the spokesman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all Afghan factions to respond positively to calls
of neighboring countries, the Organization of Islamic Conference
and the international community to restore peace and stability in
their country.
</P>
<P>
Afghan political groups should set up a broad-based government
and avoid any military operation which will surely aggravate the
present situation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Legislators Sentenced to Jail Terms for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Higher State Security Court
on Sunday sentenced three members of the People's Assembly
(Parliament) from the ruling National Democratic Party to 10 years
in jail for their role in misuse of public money.
</P>
<P>
Another parliament member, Ibrahim Aglane, was given a one-year
suspended sentence for his part in the country's biggest corruption
scandal in 20 years, involving 32 defendants in fraudulently
obtaining around 470 million U.S. dollars in loans, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aglane received a lighter punishment than the other MPs because
he had repaid the money he fraudulently received, the news agency
said, without mentioning the sum.
</P>
<P>
The four MPs, Tawfiq Abdu Ismail, Khaled Mahmud, Mahmud Azzam
and Aglane, were present at the court amid tight security measures
at the session ending a three-year trial.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced 28 bankers and businessmen to prison terms
ranging between one year and 15 years in jail with hard labor. The
verdicts can not be appealed.
</P>
<P>
The scandal was revealed in early 1995 when President of the
Nile Bank Issa al-Ayouti accused his daughter Aleya of
misappropriation of funds.
</P>
<P>
Aleya was sentenced to 15 years in absentia after failing to
return from France, where she was allowed to go last year by a
special court authorization giving her a two-week leave from Egypt.
Issa al-Ayouti himself was also found guilty in the case and was
sentenced to 10 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
Five banks -- the commercial Dakahlia Bank, the Bank of Suez
Canal, the Nile Bank, Al-Mohandess Bank and Faisal Islamic Bank --
have been damaged in the case since the defendants
failed to return millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to investigations, a broad section of the business
community, from import-export firms to real estate, got involved in
the case.

<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Zimbabwe and Namibia
said Sunday they will only withdraw their troops from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) when peace and stability is
restored in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma made the remarks after they held a three-hour meeting here
with DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process would dictate when the withdrawal should
start. We will remain until we are guaranteed of peace and
security in the Congo," Mugabe told reporters after the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal from the DRC will only be when peace and
stability is restored and when a democratic process of election in
a peaceful environment is guaranteed," Nujoma said.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the elections would be held in the DRC, Kabila said
the elections would be held when the invading countries Rwanda and
Uganda withdraw from his country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he had already asked the Organization of African
Unity to choose another facilitator to replace former Botswana
President Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
In March Masire stormed out of the Congo saying Kabila's
government had prevented him from carrying out his duties.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed the withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan
troops from the northern Congolese city of Kisangani where the two
former allies repeatedly clashed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila briefed the two heads of state on the situation in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola have been
in the DRC since the conflict started in August 1998 to help
Kabila's forces fight rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda trying to
topple his government.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos could not attend the
summit because of political problems in his country.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The greatest challenge facing
Mozambicans is the struggle against absolute poverty, President
Joaquim Chissano declared here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the capital's Independence Square to celebrate the
25th anniversary of Mozambican independence in 1975, Chissano said
the battle to overcome poverty "requires renewed effort,
commitment and determination, and a collective belief in success".
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamental that all of society should participate in
developing a programme that seeks to concentrate efforts on
improving the living conditions of Mozambican families,
particularly rural house holds," he added.
</P>
<P>
He called for a faster rate of growth in the countryside, while
 simultaneously improving basic social services such as health
care, education and the supply of clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
"Some courageous measures of structural adjustment taken by the
 government, such as the privatization, did not only bring the
positive results expected, but also some social problems,
particularly in the area of employment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Absolute poverty persists, particularly in the countryside,
and regional imbalances are sharpening," Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano also called for a vigorous fight against corruption,
which he described as "an insidious and destructive evil which,
by diverting resources for individual profit, causes development
programmes to atrophy".
</P>
<P>
Chissano urged that special attention be paid to AIDS "which is
 spreading alarmingly, with a negative impact on economic
development programmes.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday
Israel is still open to peace talks with Syria, but its policy on
the sovereignty of the northeast bank of Lake Kinneret is not
changed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Barak
reiterated the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East
War, depends on security arrangement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he added, the northeast shore of Lake Kinneret will
remain under Israeli control, according to a statement issued by
Barak's office after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak was responding to his Justice Minister Yossi Beilin's
early remarks on the Israeli-Syrian talks.

Arafat, who made a speech at the Kamal Gunblat School
playground in Nablus, said, "Decisive and the most serious weeks
are ahead of us, because the independent Palestinian state will be
declared by the end of them."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams set September 13 for
reaching a final agreement on the future of Palestinian

So far, the open and secret rounds of talks between Israel and

<HEADLINE> China Launches Meteorological Satellite EDS-3rdAdd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China successfully launched a
meteorological satellite here at 7:50 p.m. (Beijing time) today.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, called the Fengyun 2, was launched by a Long
March 3 carrier rocket at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
This is China's second geostationary meteorological satellite.
It is an improved version of the first Fengyun 2 meteorological
satellite launched by China in 1997, Chinese experts said. The
satellite has a designed life span of three years.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, measuring 44.9 meters in length, has a boosting
capacity of 300 tons. It was designed by Chinese scientists. This
is the thirteenth launch of a Long March 3 carrier rocket and the
sixty-first launch of Long March carrier rocket series.
</P>
<P>
The satellite successfully entered its final orbit at a perigee
of 204 km, apogee of 36,035 km. It will ultimately be positioned
in a geostationary orbit over 105 degrees east longitude.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is expected to play an important role in helping
improve medium- and long-term weather forecasts and those for
natural disasters in the country and in monitoring the ecological
environment in western China, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun 2 satellite was jointly developed by the Shanghai
Aerospace Technology Research Institute under the China Aerospace
Corporation, the Chinese Research Institute of Space Technology
and several other research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is equipped with a scanning radiometer, a cloud
coverage information system, a data collection translator, and
other high-tech equipment. It is capable of monitoring the Earth's
meteorological conditions round-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun 2 can provide meteorological information such as
cloud maps and wind movements.
</P>
<P>
It can also coordinate the geostationary applications system,
including the collection of visible light, infrared rays and water
vapor images, as well as the transmission of photos of cloud
formations, data collection and environmental monitoring.
</P>
<P>
China launched two Fengyun 1 weather satellites in 1988 and
1990 respectively. Those two satellites, all sun-synchronous orbit
satellites, have stopped functioning.
</P>
<P>
Now China has become the third country, following the United
States and Russia, to develop and launch the weather satellites
with the two kinds of orbits.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires in Northeast China Brought Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires that raged in parts
of the Daxing'anling Mountains in northeast China have been
brought under control, according to sources with the State
Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Artificial cloud-seeding that is currently being conducted in
the region has helped to extinguish some of the fires, said
officials with both the bureau and the fire department in
northeastern Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More artificial rain will be produced in the next few days, to
help prevent possible relapses, they said.
</P>
<P>
The forest fire was caused by lightning which struck the area
June 6. Some 10,000 fire-fighters and a number of helicopters were
sent to battle the blazes.
</P>
<P>
The region, a major forest reserve in the country, has been
besieged by hot, dry weather in recent weeks. Since May, 150 fires
have been reported in the mountain area, which is five times the
number for the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Improving Awareness of Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Until recently, most traditional
Chinese farmers didn't make the connection between savvy marketing
strategies and rice and vegetables with catchy names.
</P>
<P>
Farmer-entrepreneuer Gong Xuebin, president of the Longda Group
and maker of Longda-brand vegetables, was one of the first to
realize that customers will return to a name they trust.
</P>
<P>
"We are engaged in China's agricultural industrialization, and
we are trying to set up a worldwide agricultural brand," said the
50-year-old Gong.
</P>
<P>
His heat-cured meat has gained a good reputation over the past
five years, and the Longda vegetables sell well in supermarkets in
Japan, the United States, and Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
NHK, Japan's premier TV station, wants to interview Gong at
Longda headquarters in east China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Longda is currently among the top 500 village and township
enterprises in China, with 10 joint ventures and total assets of
810 million yuan, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
More and more modern Chinese farmers like Gong have deepened
their marketing know-how, introducing useful business strategies
into the sales of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Xinlong county in north China's Hebei province, for instance,
is famed for growing Chinese chestnuts. Over the past few years,
the county has promoted several high-quality brands of chestnut,
which have been welcomed in Japan and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"Baotashan" apples, produced in northwest China's Shaanxi
province, are also well-sold in European markets.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in east China's Zhejiang Province have registered
nearly 40 brands of rice, which have provided more options for
local consumers.
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts here say that more famous agricultural brands
will emerge as Chinese farmers gain a greater understanding of
marketing.

<HEADLINE> Freed Malaysian hostage Hopes Early Release of Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian hostage released by
the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf expressed here Sunday his
gratitude for his release and hoped for an early release of other
hostages still held captive by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to thank Allah...and...to release me ad I hope as
soon as possible my friends, the other hostages, will be released
as soon as possible." Zulkurnain Bin Hashim, 29, said at a press
brief held in the Presidential Palace here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado disclosed at the
briefing that Hashim's release was actually secured last Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Hashim was quietly brought to the southern city of Zamboanga
Friday and turned over to him Saturday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado reiterated that no ransom was paid and no political
promise was made in the release of Hashim, which he said was a "
goodwill gesture" of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
when Hashim was asked how the hostages were treated, Aventajado
said Hashim assured him that the hostages were treated well. "He
is very much in good shape as you can see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hashim's release is the biggest break so far in the two-month-
long hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group is still holding captive three Germans,
two French, two Finns, two South Africans, one Lebanese, eight
other Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf rebels on April 23
from the diving resort of Sipadan in neighboring Malaysia and
taken to Jolo island in the southern Philippines.

WUHAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The cockpit voice recorder recovered
from the Yun-7 plane which crashed in Wuhan last Thursday has been
sent to the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China to

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Accuses Washington Times of Creating Rumors (1) EDS-Recast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman with the Xinhua News
Agency today refuted reports by the Washington Times which tried
to discredit the news agency by making fuss about a normal real
estate transaction.
</P>
<P>
He accused the reports of "deliberately distorting the fact and
creating rumors with an intention to make trouble."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Washington Times has published
several reports since June 21 slandering the correspondents of
Xinhua's overseas bureaus of "being engaged in spying," and
claiming that the purchase of a new building by Xinhua's
Washington Bureau is aimed to "gather intelligence of the Pentagon.
"
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing but a rumor and smear. We are filled with great
indignation, and we strongly refute the reports," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the current office of Xinhua's Washington
Bureau is in an apartment building on the North 14 Street,
Arlington, Virginia. Because the building is old and dilapidated
and the staff's working and living conditions are deteriorating,
the bureau decided to purchase a new office building at the
approval of the agency's headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Advised by American real estate agents, the bureau chose an
apartment building located at Arlington Ridge Road, Arlington, VA,
in early May 2000, formally informed the U.S. State Department of
the matter on May 22, and completed the needed procedures for the
legal purchase of the property with the aid of local lawyers on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
Like what had been done in the past, the purchase by the Xinhua
bureau was just a normal real estate deal done in conformity with
American laws, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency was established on November 7, 1931. With 8,
500 news subscribers, it now has 34 domestic bureaus and 104
overseas bureaus, and is regarded by the United Nations and the
international community as one of the biggest news agencies in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Coming Weeks "Decisive" for Palestinian Statehood: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Sunday noted that the coming weeks would be decisive and serious as
the Palestinian statehood would be declared by the end of them,
said a report reaching here from the West Bank City of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who made a speech at the Kamal Gunblat School playground
in Nablus, said,"Decisive and the most serious weeks are ahead of
us, because the independent Palestinian state will be declared by
the end of them."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams set September 13 for
reaching a final agreement on the future of Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
So far, the open and secret rounds of talks between Israel and
the Palestinians failed to iron out such a deal as there was a wide
gap in standings of both sides over such thorny issues as
Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, prisoners, water and borders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Israeli army officers threatened to take
military actions against the Palestinian territories, which infused
tension into the Palestinian-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arafat said,"No one should threaten us. We are for
peace, the just and comprehensive peace. We are proud of our sons,
friends and allies in South Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan and Syria." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of Palestinian independence has been a controversial
and sensitive topic since the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians was launched. 
</P>
<P>
Such a "Palestinian entity", according to Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, should be established on the West Bank territories
evacuated by the Israel Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side has been insisting that according
to the Oslo accords, an independent Palestinian state should be
established on all of the West Bank with east Jerusalem as its
capital. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Palestinians have full or partial control of about
40 percent of the West Bank territories. Arafat reiterated several
times that an independent Palestinian state will be established no
later than September 13, 2000, the day set for the two sides to
sign a final accord for permanent status issues.

<HEADLINE> Cut My Hand If I Steal, Says Nigeria Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Zamfara State Governor,
Alhaji Sani, has challenged those accusing him of fraud and
insincerity in the implementation of the Islamic law Sharia to
produce evidence, reported Nigerian press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly said that he was ready to face an Sharia court
and if found guilty, let his right hand be cut-off.
</P>
<P>
Sani is the first governor in the Africa's most populous
country, to introduce the controversy Islamic law Sharia in
January of this year into a state, which followed nationwide
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
The riot over the proposed implementation of Sharia in the
country's northern Kaduna State in February of this year killed
about 1,000 people. Sani made the statement on Saturday in
Kaduna, capital of Nigeria's Kaduna State, amidst allegations by
officials of the country's ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)
that he is not transparent and sincere in the execution of most
projects, the costs of which they alleged were highly inflated.
</P>
<P>
"What I want my detractors to say is that me as a governor who
 introduced Sharia has been alleged to have either taken money
from contractors or siphoned money from government account," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Let them dare say it. You will hear the first case of Alkali
court with the governor and if I am found guilty my hand should
be amputated," said the governor.

<HEADLINE> Blair Puts Labor Lawmakers on Election Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has placed Labor lawmakers on alert for a possible snap general
election this autumn, according to a Sunday Express report on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted party insiders as saying last week that Blair
put Labor's Members of Parliament (MPs) on a war footing when he
addressed them at a private meeting.
</P>
<P>
They said the possibility of an autumn poll is why he withdrew
his spokesman Alastair Campbell from the front line and gave him a
strategic planning role.
</P>
<P>
However, Sunday Express said, May 2001 remains the likeliest
date for the next election and is favored by Blair's top pollster,
Philip Gould.
</P>
<P>
An election this autumn would be only three-and-a-half years
since the May 1, 1997 general election and would be a huge gamble
by Labor, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem would be explaining why a Govenment with a
majority of 180 needs to hold an election so soon," admitted one
party official.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition Saturday accused Blair of planning to "cut and
run," but insisted they were ready for a snap autumn poll if it
happened. "It all adds up," said shadow cabinet member Andrew
Lansley.

</P>
<P>
The poll follows four months of state-supported holdings of
white-owned farms by veterans of the country's liberation war that
won it independence from Rhodesia in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been monitoring the preparation and
process of the Zimbabwean parliamentary elections and has
stationed 150 observers in the southern African country.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

elections in which the ruling party's fate may hinge on turnout
and a large complement of undecided voters.
</P>
<P>

proposal he sent Congress as part of his budget request in
February.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> No New U.S. Proposals on Mideast Peace: Senior Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Envoy to the Middle East Denis
Ross has not conveyed any new U.S. proposals during his Mideast
trip, said Chief palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to Voice of Palestine radio on Sunday, Erekat said, "
Ross has not any proposals in his current trip neither on the
transitional nor on the final talks" between the Palestinians and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Ross told us that he would listen to the view points of both
sides then forward the attitudes to the U.S. administration after
he meets with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday", he
added.
</P>
<P>
The palestinian official stressed that U.S. administration" has
to find mechanisms to carry out the agreed third phase Israeli
troops redeployment by August 7."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinians said they had accepted a U.S. proposal
that postponing the third phase troop deployment, overdue on June
23, for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Erekat pointed out that he handed Ross a list of should-be-
released Palestinian prisoners in Israel jails under Sharm al-
Sheikh interim deal signed last September.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli demand of collecting illegal arms from the
Palestinians which Israel raised during the meeting, Erekat said "
the Palestinian side is ready to carry out the agreements on
condition that Israel should meet its commitments."
</P>
<P>
Referring to a statement by Israeli Security Minister Shlumo Bin
Ami on formation of an international commission to compensate the
Palestinian refugees, Erekat said, "it is unacceptable by the
Palestinians and goes against international laws including U.N.
Security Council Resolution 194 which confirms the right of return
and compensation for Palestinian refuges."

<HEADLINE> Meretz to Have Role From Outside Government: Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's left-wing Meretz Party
leader Yossi Sarid said on Sunday that his party's role in matters
of government policy would become apparent within the next few
days, Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, a staunch supporter of the peace process with the
Palestinians, said he had not been invited to any meetings with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak after the coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meretz ministers resigned from the coalition last week in a move
that helped Barak end the crisis with Shas party, while pledging
continued support to the government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
Sarid expressed his hope that the resignation be only temporary,
and said if he returns to the government, he will return only to
the Education Ministry, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's long-running dispute with the ultra-Orthodox's Shas
party over funding for the latter's school system led to a grave
coalition crisis in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Meretz finally made the concession to quit the coalition so as
to enable Prime Minister Ehud Barak to keep Shas within the
coalition. Shas is the third largest party with 17 seats in the
Knesset (parliament) and the largest ruling partner of Barak's One
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The real intention, said Meretz, was to support Barak's efforts
on the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks which have entered a
critical stage with the September deadline for a permanent final-
status accord looming.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a fresh crisis has emerged to threaten Barak's
coalition as Interior Minister Natan Sharansky warned of his
possible resignation over reported concessions being made to the
Palestinians in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Washington for a summit on Sunday, Sharansky
called for the formation of a national unity government which is to
draft a common platform by all on the peace negotiations with the
Palestinians.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Sunday Israel is still open to peace talks with Syria, but its
policy on the sovereignty of the northeast bank of Lake Kinneret is
not changed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Barak
reiterated the extent of Israeli withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, which Israel occupied during the 1967 Middle East
War, depends on security arrangement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he added, the northeast shore of Lake Kinneret will
remain under Israeli control, according to a statement issued by
Barak's office after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak was responding to his Justice Minister Yossi Beilin's
early remarks on the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, one of the prime minister's closest aides, indicated on
Saturday night that the government might agree to give Damascus
some access to the Kinneret in order to renew talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The extent of Israeli troops withdrawal from the Golan Heights
and the correlative problem about the control over a strip of shore
northeast of the Kinneret are the major contention points between
the two sides, which broke off their talks in January.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Syria's new ruler Basher al-Assad will
firstly consolidate his power base in the country before reopening
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Beilin sent a signal to Bashar Saturday night that
Israel will consider proposals on Lake Kinneret sovereignty made by
British journalist Patrick Seale, who is the official biographer of
Hafez al-Assad and the most closest western friend of the late
Syrian president.
</P>
<P>
Under Seale's plan, which was published several months ago, the
waters of the Kinneret will remain under Israeli mandate, the
United Nations will control the northeast bank of the lake, and
Syria will be given free access to swimming and fishing in the
Kinneret.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an interesting suggestion. This is a basis,"
said the justice minister.
</P>
<P>
But Barak said in Sunday's statement that he and his Foreign
Minister David Levy believe that ministers who issue opinions
contrast to the government's stands are irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet was convened for the first time in two weeks, during
which Barak avoided a government crisis and managed to persuade
ministers from the rebellious Shas party back into the cabinet at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ultra-orthodox religious party's demands, including
government funding for its educational network, legalizing its
pirate radio stations, and having a say in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, have been met in the process.
</P>
<P>
Eli Yishai, Labor and Social Affairs Minister and leader of the
Shas party, attended Sunday morning's cabinet meeting.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Investment in Bangladesh Surpasses 1 Bln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua ) -- The number of registered industrial
projects in Bangladesh stood at 6,115 during the past four years
with estimated investment of 11.52 billion U.S. dollars, an
official statement published in the New Nation said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total registered investments, foreign investment amounts
to 7.32 billion dollars in 554 projects, according to the
statement of the Board of Investment.
</P>
<P>
Average registered investments during the four-year rule of the
present government are 145 per cent higher than previous
government's five-year (1991-96) tenure. The local investment has
increased 95 per cent while foreign investment 180 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The number of projects registered with the board in 10 years
from 1980 to 1990 was 31,872 with estimated investments of 4.38
billion dollars. It rose to 17.31 billion dollars in nine years
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the implementation of the registered
projects is 80 per cent while the implementation of the foreign
projects is 50 per cent, which is satisfactory compared to other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Investment scenario in the country has been brightening
gradually and it would accelerate with the improvement of
infrastructures like traffic links, port facilities and power and
telecommunications systems," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Power Failure Occurs Frequently in Ethiopian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Residents, particularly
businessmen, in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa have been
complaining power rationing which was reportedly hurting varieties
of business in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Electric and Power Corporation (EEPC) is turning
the lights off without a weekly schedule, Alemayehu Seyoum,
administrator of a medical center, told local mass media.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we use the timetable properly, the irony is, we do not
know when and where the power blackout is going to strike next,"
he said, noting the power outrages might have done damages to
vital sectors of the center at any time.
</P>
<P>
Some bar owners said that in the past few weeks they had been
forced to carry their draft beer canisters to neighborhoods where
there is power to chill the beer. Otherwise, they say, the beer
would be undrinkable and they would lose money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some private newspaper publishers have been forced
to move office equipment frequently to areas with power supply to
ensure that readers get their copies in time.
</P>
<P>
For two successive weekends, many sports lovers did not have
pleasure of watching the on-going Euro 2000 Football Competition
because of power failure.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing has been a popular way in Ethiopia to overcome
the shortage of power in the country where hydroelectricity has
been the sole public power resource. The practice of power
rationing is very much common in the capital in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the frequency of power failure in Addis
Ababa has been speeded up from once every four days to once every
other day. The power failure normally lasts 15 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
According to EEPC officials, the frequent power failure in the
capital is due to the shortage of water in the dams to run the
turbines.

<HEADLINE> Sharansky Threatens To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A fresh crisis is threatening
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition government after
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky warned he may resign over
reported concessions being made to the Palestinians in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharansky voiced his opposition to the holding of a
three-way summit between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in the near future, urging Barak to
form a national unity government before the summit and before
reaching a framework agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The government, in its current configuration, has reached the
end of its road," Sharansky told the Army Radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"A national unity government should draft a common platform
agreed upon by all," Sharansky said, adding that "if this did not
happen, Israel would soon have to back down from its principles."
</P>
<P>
He also complained that coalition members have no information
regarding current negotiations and what he was hearing from
unofficial sources has worried him.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky sent a letter to Barak on Friday, accusing Barak of
preparing a complex strategy aimed at ratifying the framework
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians at the expense of his
coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Sharansky outlined Barak's concessions that he is
ready to give to the Palestinians, which he said he will not
support them.
</P>
<P>
The concessions include giving up Israel's control in certain
parts of Jerusalem, the right of return for the Palestinian
refugees to the June 4, 1967 lines, and having the Jordan River,
its bridges, and the Jordan Valley transferred to Palestinian
sovereignty, according to Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Prime Minister's Office said Barak has sent a
letter to Sharansky responding that "not agreement has been
reached with the Palestinian at this stage."
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Sharansky's information is inaccurate and "do
not correctly describe the Israeli position at the present time"
and that he supports the formation of a broader coalition based on
the guidelines that he promised to his voters before last year's
election.

<P>
TEHRNA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and
another missing on Saturday night when a sewerage tunnel collapsed,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of two victims, both young engineers, were found and
efforts are under way to recover the third one buried under the mud
in the vicinity of Tehran's main square of Vali-e Asr.
</P>
<P>
A technician for the emergency affairs told the agency that the
two victims had been suffocated.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when two engineers and another Afghan
worker of the contractual company stationed there for drilling.
</P>
<P>
An expert from the company, speaking on condition of anonymity,
blamed the district municipality for the incident.
</P>
<P>
However, the district mayor declined to comment on the causes
behind this tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
An officer in charge of the local fire department said that it
was a very hard task to recover the bodies since they were hidden
under a huge volume of soil.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of this incident, the district road was closed which
has caused a heavy traffic, IRNA added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Shahak's Transportation Portfolio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Cabinet approved
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's nomination of Center Party leader Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak as Transportation Minister on Sunday, leaving his
post of Minister of Tourism vacant.
</P>
<P>
The former chief of staff also automatically becomes a permanent
member of the prime minister's security cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Lipkin-Shahak is replacing Yitzhak Mordechai who resigned
following an indictment on sexual assault charges against him.
Lipkin-Shahak took over Mordechai's position as head of the Center
Party a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Barak intended to name Center Party's No. 2 man Dan Meridor,
chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the
Knesset (parliament), to succeed Lipkin-Shahak as Tourism Minister.
But Meridor has refrained from accepting the offer.
</P>
<P>
Meridor was reported to have set his sights on other posts such
as the Justice Ministry portfolio now held by Yossi Beilin (One
Israel) in light of Barak's intention to reshuffle the government
by using the opportunity of Mordechai's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Meridor was also said to be interested in receiving the Defense
portfolio, now held by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a retired general at age 55, resigned as
transportation minister at the end of May in the face of charges
that he sexually assaulted three women over the past eight years.
If convicted, he can face up to seven years in prison.

ANKARA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Istanbul Industry Chamber (ISO) Chairman Husamettin Kavi has
evaluated the first six months of the three-year economic
stabilization program which Turkey runs with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"We spent the first six months trying to understand what the
program was about, but now we should work to lighten the burden of
next year," he said, stressing that 2001 will be the most critical
stage of the economic program, which envisages a single digit of
the inflation rate at the year-end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Party Urges Amendment to Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A major reformist party in Iran on
Sunday urged the new Majlis (parliament) to amend the election law
so that the nation's election process can be protected.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis election in February showed that as long as
relevant authorities do not conform with their responsibility and
the power is accumulated in an irresponsible hand, there is no hope
of protecting the nation's election, the Islamic Iran Participation
Front (IIPF) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The influential party, led by President Mohammad Khatami's
younger brother Mohammad Reza Khatami who is currently vice speaker
of the Majlis, was actually criticizing the conservative Guardians
Council (GC).
</P>
<P>
As the powerful supervisor of the February election, the GC has
so far annulled first-round and runoff election results in some 10
constituencies, voiding as many as two million votes. It has also
rejected the victory of a number of reformist candidates, awarding
their seats to their conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
The measures, however, failed to stop the reformists from
seizing absolute control of the new Majlis from the conservative
establishment.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament started work on May 27, with 276 of the total
290 seats filled. The IIPF and other reformist parties have
occupied 80 percent of the filled seats.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency, also
urged the people to remain calm and patient in the face of the
conservative pressure so that one day they can show their "strong
will and determination" again.
</P>
<P>
All the people, especially those in constituencies where the
polls were nullified, should go their way for materialization of
the reform movement, it added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's reformist campaign has been growing since moderate
President Khatami won a landslide victory in the presidential
election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Reformers in the new Majlis have vowed to reverse legislation
passed by the conservative fifth Majlis to hinder President
Khatami's social and cultural reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the new Majlis passed an urgent motion to
review the press law, which was amended by its predecessor in the
last days of its term to impose more restrictions on the reformist
press.

seats up for grabs was cut by 20 from 500 as a result of electoral
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The total number of eligible voters is 107 million, a record
high.
</P>
<P>
One focal point of the election is whether the ruling coalition,
comprising of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), New Komeito and
New Conservative Party, can win 254 seats to secure a stable
majority in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Attention is also focused on how many seats the LDP alone can
gain. LDP Secretary General Hiromu Nonaka has set the goal at 229
seats.
</P>
<P>
The targets are well below the number of seats the tripartite
coalition controlled prior to the dissolution of the lower chamber
on June 2. At that time, the coalition held 336 seats, 271 of
which were held by the LDP.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls conducted by Japan's leading newspapers,
however, showed that the coalition was on its way to securing a
stable majority, although a high percentage of undecided voters,
between 30 percent and 50 percent, made the results difficult to
predict.
</P>
<P>
In the election campaign, the ruling coalition said it will
continue economic efforts aimed at putting Japan's economy, which
posted plus growth in fiscal 1999 after two years of contraction,
firmly on a path toward sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, meanwhile, criticized the ruling bloc for
trying to spend its way out of the recession, and called for
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc also blamed a series of controversial
remarks made by Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, including one in
which he said Japan is "a divine nation with the emperor at its
center." Critics said the remark echoed the ideology that drove
Japan's wartime militarism.
</P>
<P>
The LDP registered 337 candidates for the race, while the New
Komeito fielded 74, and the New Conservative Party 19.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) fielded 262,
while the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) entered 332, among others.
The results for most of the seats are expected to be known early
Monday.

<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Minister of Construction and Housing
Yitzhak Levy and his American counterpart Andrew Cuomo have signed
a memorandum of understanding establishing a Binational Commission
on Housing and Community Development.
</P>
<P>
The new commission will promote cooperative efforts in
integrating advanced building technologies and encourage joint
ventures between Israeli and American construction firms.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Two weeks after a general strike was averted by
freezing preparations to implement the Ben-Bassat income tax reform
plan, the Israeli Finance Ministry and Histadrut labor federation
are no closer to reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
One June 11, one day prior to the scheduled strike, Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat announced a three-week freeze on plans to
implement disputed sections of the tax reform package and said the
three-week period would be used to arrive at consensus with labor
leaders.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Economic officials in Jerusalem expect Bank of
Israel Governor David Klein to announce on Monday the nominal
interest rate will remain unchanged for another month at 9.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
If this assessment is correct, it will mark the second month in
a row that interest rates remain unchanged, following six straight
months of interest rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
Klein believes the rate of interests is now in line with the
government's inflation target of 3 to 4 percent from the years 2000
and 2001.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman is to raise the ceiling on foreign equity
participation in the services sector from 49 percent to 70 percent
early next year, according to Sunday's Dubai based daily "Gulf
News".
</P>
<P>
In addition, a company with foreign equity of up to 70 percent
will be treated the same as a wholly-owned Omani company in terms
of taxation, the paper quoted the economic expert at the
Sultanate's Ministry of Commerce and Industries as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is going to be a major step forward, for which new
legislations will be enacted," Dr. Said Al-Riyami said in an
interview to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Call for Israeli Troop Withdrawal from West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday stressed the need for
Israel to carry out the third phase of troop withdrawal from the
West Bank, the Egyptian information minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat termed as "important" for Israel to go ahead
with the pullout, which was to have taken place on Friday, Safwat
el-Sherif told reporters after a meeting between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Israel has put off the troop withdrawal till July 7 as agreed by
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There are still obstacles and tough issues of contention
between the negotiating delegations," said el-Sherif, who attended
the talks in a presidential palace in northern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
But efforts are being made by all the concerned parties in a bid
to overcome the differences, he added.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations for a final peace agreement, planned for September 13,
on the thorniest issues, including the border of a future
Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements,
and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been trying to bring together Arafat,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton
to seek a breakthrough in the peace talks. But Palestinian
officials have ruled out imminent convocation, saying that Arafat
will go to such a summit only for the signing of a peace accord
other than negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Saturday evening and ended the visit after
the talks with Mubarak. He frequently travels to Cairo for
consultations on the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
arrived here on Sunday for what has been termed as a "farewell"
meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak before his July
retirement for corruption allegations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak led senior officials to greet Weizman upon his arrival
at Cairo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will hold talks on the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process, especially on the Palestinian-
Israeli track, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is to step down on July 10, three years ahead of
schedule, after narrowly escaping prosecution on allegations of
corruption and tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is reportedly to use the meeting with Mubarak to plead
for the release of Azzam Azzam, an Israeli Druze sentenced to 15-
year imprisonment by an Egyptian court in 1997 for spying for
Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Army Commander General
Srilal Weerasooriya will soon be appointed as the next High
Commissioner (ambassador) to Pakistan, a senior military official
said Sunday, as Weerasooriya's term as the commander is due to end
shortly.
</P>
<P>
"A new army commander is expected to be appointed within the
next few weeks," said the official, adding the new commander would
be either Major General Lionel Balagalle or General Janaka Perera.
</P>
<P>
Weerasooriya's friendship with Pakistani Chief Executive
Officer General Pervez Musharraf may be considered as very
favorable to his new post. He was a colleague of Musharraf at
Pakistan's National Defense College, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week a local newspaper said Weerasooriya was visiting
Pakistan to brief Musharraf on the island's battle against Tamil
Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, military spokesman Palitha Fernando described reports
to this effect as "mere kite-flying", saying "there is no truth in
such reports."
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka had a former Army Commander General Gerry Silva as
High Commissioner to Pakistan from 1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The present High Commissioner to Pakistan Alfred David is due
to return to Colombo in a few months, according to officials of
the foreign ministry.

<HEADLINE> 210 Million Dollars WB Aid to Bangladesh Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the 210 million U.S.
dollars assistance from the World Bank (WB) has become uncertain,
due to the failure of the government to submit a fresh program to
it for rehabilitation of the country's ailing jute industry, the
Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources as saying that after discontinuation
of its Jute Sector Adjustment Credit (JSAC), the WB asked the
government of Bangladesh in August, 1997 to come up with a fresh
program about the modalities for privatizing the mills in the
government sector and the ways for making them commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
A special committee of the government prepared an outline of a
Revised Jute Sector Rehabilitation Program and submitted it to the
Jute Ministry on November, 1997. But the ministry had failed to
submit it to the WB.
</P>
<P>
The WB under its JSAC program disbursed a total of 40 million
dollars as financial assistance to the jute industry here out of
total allocation of 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The WB has discontinued the assistance since 1996 as the
program seemed to be ineffective. The bank claimed that it would
not disburse the remaining fund until the government is determined
to transfer the public sector to private hands.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Jute's slowness over the recommendation only
retards the privatization process of the public sector mills, the
sources said, adding that if the government can submit a fresh
proposal, there is a possibility for the country's jute sector to
get the remaining 210 million dollars from the bank.

JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin indicated on Saturday
that the government might be willing to discuss giving Syria some
access to the Kinneret (or Sea of Galilee) and a strip of shore
northeast of the lake as part of a future peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Beilin said a plan recently put forth by British journalist and
Syria expert Patrick Seal - which suggests that Syria be given
authority over a strip of land and be given access to swimming and
fishing in the Kinneret - is "an interesting suggestion" and can
serve as "a basis" for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Israel Edward Djerdjian said
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from South Lebanon last month has
provided an opportunity for the resumption of Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Saturday
that "the Israeli and Palestinian positions have never been so
close, and we are coming close to forming a basis for summit."
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who heads the Israeli negotiating team to talks on the
framework agreement which will form the basis of a permanent status
agreement, added:"We are doing all the clarification work and
clearing up misunderstandings now to enable the Americans to
convene such a meeting."
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed July 5 as a possible date for the summit.
The source, who is involved in the talks with the Palestinians,
said "they too understand the importance of the summit. The
agreement is as vital to them as it is to us, and they prefer, as
we do, to utilize the trust that has evolved with Clinton, and not
to start from zero with the new president."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- A fresh crisis threatens Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
coalition after Interior Minister Natan Sharansky warned he may
resign over reported concessions being made to the Palestinians in
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Barak on Friday, Sharansky wrote that if he
continues on the current path in the negotiations with the
Palestinians, the "significance from my perspective will be an end
to the partnership between us."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The secretary-general of the Jordanian engineers union was
lightly wounded Saturday by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) gunfire in
an accident at the Fatma gate, on the Lebanese border. Three other
Jordanian civilians also sustained injuries form the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The IDF claims the Jordanians tried to cross the border fence,
but the Jordanians reject this explanation. In their version, the
union secretary-general sustained wounds in his back, while
kneeling to pray.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon denounced the IDF shooting as a "criminal act." Lebanon
President Emile Lahoud declared that there is no justification for
the IDF gunfire.

Technical Cooperation concluded its meetings on Saturday with the
signing of protocols and agreements that will evaluate the economic
and investment relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The four-day committee meetings were chaired by Egyptian

Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng.
</P>

Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>

Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- A recent report released by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Egypt leads the non-petroleum countries in achieving a
tangible growth rate of 6 percent in 1999. The report added the
economic policies applied by the Egyptian government managed to
tame the soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's rate of growth even surmounts that of the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia whose growth depends on the increasing
revenue of their oil export, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt will promote its demand for freeing the Middle East
from nuclear weapons during a meeting of a UN disarmament board
starting Sunday, said an Egyptian diplomat.

The proposal is based on an initiative launched by President
Hosni Mubarak in April 1990 to remove all weapons of mass
destruction from the region, added Egypt's chief delegate to the UN
Ahmed Abul Gheit.

to lack of containers.
</P>
<P>
At least two vessels were scheduled to ship the sea foods from
Mongla, but none of them reached the port till Saturday. The ships
have remained stranded at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port,
200 kilometers southeast of Dhaka since June 17 due to berthing
problems.
</P>
<P>
Unless arrangements are made immediately for the arrival of the
ships at Mongla port by June 26-27, most of the Letter of Credits
will be expired, the sources said, and exporters and entrepreneurs
will have to face a tough monetary situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 50 frozen foods exporters of the Khulna region
in a joint statement Saturday sought intervention from the prime
minister for immediate arrangement of vessel to ship the
exportable shrimp.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the shortage of vessels at Mongla Port, exporters
said huge quantity of shrimp remains piled at the plants when the
season of export gets momentum.

<HEADLINE> 15 Million People Suffer from Diabetes in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetic patients
in Pakistan is rising at an alarming rate and has now reached the
15 million mark.
</P>
<P>
At present 8 to 10 percent of the diabetics patients are in
Karachi and 12 percent each in Lahore and in the twin cities of
Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the Associated Press of Pakistan
reported by quoting the Pakistan Diabetic Association.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the number of male diabetic patients is one
percent higher than the female patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
There are two main types of diabetes. In Type I diabetes the
pancreas fails to produce insulin which is essential for survival.
In this cas, insulin must be administered by injection.
</P>
<P>
Type I is more common in children and adolescents and accounts
for 10 to 15 percent of all diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Type II diabetes occurs when the body is unable to produce
enough insulin to meet body requirements or when it cannot
properly use the produced insulin.
</P>
<P>
This condition can be controlled through diet, oral medication
and routine exercise. Type II occurs primarily in adults and is by
far the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 85 and 90
percent of all diabetes.

<HEADLINE> Two Main Indian Banks to Open Branches in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Two prominent Indian banks
are set to open up joint banking facilities in Tanzania in the
near future to promote economic relations between the two Indian
countries, local newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian High Commissioner to Tanzania Virendra Gupta told
local press here on Saturday that Bank of India and Bank of Baroda
have decided to get engaged in the joint venture and arrangements
were underway.
</P>
<P>
Gupta said there was growing interest among Indian businessmen
to invest in the banking sector in Tanzania and that his
government have always been encouraging them to do so.
</P>
<P>
"India is very impressed by Tanzania's macro-economic policies
and that it attaches a lot of importance to enhancing existing
economic relations between the two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since a free market economy was introduced in Tanzania in early
1990s, several foreign banks have settled their branches,
including Trust Bank of Kenya, Commercial Bank of Kenya, STANBIC
of South Africa, CITI Bank of the United States, Standard
Chartered Bank of UK among others.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was restructuring its state-owned banks in a bid to
make them profitable and to build a sound banking system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Tanzania sold its biggest commercial bank,
the National Bank of Commerce (1997) Limited, to the Amalgamated
Banks of South Africa Group (ABSA), with ABSA acquiring 70 percent
of the shares and Tanzanian government 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania admitted its failure to operate the bank profitably,
hoping it a success after the privatization which started in
November 1998 after the government split the National Bank of
Commerce into three entities in 1996, the National Micro-finance
Bank, the NBC (1997) and the NBC Holdings Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's central bank, Bank of Tanzania, has said that during
2000/ 2001 financial year, it would continue to strengthen its
supervisor capacity and improve on the reporting standards of the
commercial banks to minimize systemic failures.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Official Explains Reason for Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Congolese Katanga Province director
Nyange Kangaza has said the Democratic Republic of the Congo civil
war might be forced to drag on because of its ethnic complexity,
Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the visiting Congolese official as saying the war was
basically between the nilotics and the Bantu people with the
former harboring hegemonic ambitions to spread their influence in
the Great Lakes region as well as southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
Kangaza, who during the week paid a series of visits to the
border areas, said this at a cocktail party hosted for him by
Zambian Copperbelt Permanent Secretary Arthur Yoyo in Ndola,
capital of Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
The civil war is being between President Laurent Kabila's
forces backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola on one side and the
two factions of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) supported
by Rwanda and Uganda on the other.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is backing the main RCD rebel group based in Goma led by
Emile Ilunga while Uganda is supporting the Kisangani-based
faction of Wamba dia Wamba and Jean-Pierre Bemba's Congolese
Liberation movement (MLC).
</P>
<P>
But Rwanda and Uganda troops have since engaged in fierce
fighting over the control of the diamond trading city of Kisangani
in which more than 300 civilians are believed to have been killed
in the cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
"But I want you to understand that the war in the DRC is
between the nilotics and the Bantu. It is an expansionist war,"
Kangaza said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Zambian President Frederick Chiluba for the peace
initiative in the DRC saying peace was cardinal in the war-torn
country.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Accuses Washington Times of Creating Rumors (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman with the Xinhua News
Agency today refuted reports by the Washington Times which tried
to discredit the news agency by making fuss about a normal real
estate transaction.
</P>
<P>
He accused the reports of "deliberately distorting the fact and
creating rumors with an intention to make trouble."
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Washington Times has published
several reports since June 20 slandering the correspondents of
Xinhua's overseas bureaus of "being engaged in spying," and
claiming that the purchase of a new building by Xinhua's
Washington Bureau is aimed to "gather intelligence of the Pentagon.
"
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing but a rumor and smear. We are filled with great
indignation, and we strongly refute the reports," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the current office of Xinhua's Washington
Bureau is in an apartment building on the North 14 Street,
Arlington, Virginia. Because the building is old and dilapidated
and the staff's working and living conditions are deteriorating,
the bureau decided to purchase a new office building at the
approval of the agency's headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Advised by American real estate agents, the bureau chose an
apartment building located at Arlington Ridge Road, Arlington, VA,
in early May 2000, formally informed the U.S. State Department of
the matter on May 22, and completed the needed procedures for the
legal purchase of the property with the aid of local lawyers on
June 15.
</P>
<P>
Like what had been done in the past, the purchase by the Xinhua
bureau was just a normal real estate deal done in conformity with
American laws, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency was established on November 7, 1931. With 8,
500 news subscribers, it now has 34 domestic bureaus and 104
overseas bureaus, and is regarded by the United Nations and the
international community as one of the biggest news agencies in the
world.

Xinhua's mission is to report the major events in China and
around the world in an accurate, timely, objective and just manner,
to promote mutual understanding between the Chinese people and the
people of other countries, expand friendly cooperation and
safeguard world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua's reports have aroused great interest and received warm
welcome worldwide, particularly, in developing countries, the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Xinhua's overseas correspondents have
always been strictly following laws of the countries they are
stationed in, and gathering news stories in accordance with local
regulations. "They have never been engaged in anything that is not
in conformity with their capacity of correspondents."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the spokesman, Xinhua correspondents
have established a profound friendship with people from various
circles in the countries they work in.
</P>
<P>
However, disregarding all the well-known facts, the Washington
Times has tried to discredit Xinhua by making fuss about a normal
real estate transaction, the spokesman said. Its reports are
against the basic professional ethics for newspaper men.
</P>
<P>
He said that we have noticed that the newspaper still sticks to
the Cold War mentality and often publishes reports that are
politically biased against China and the Chinese people. All this
is harmful to the development of the Sino-U.S. relationship as
well as the friendship between the people and journalists of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"To safeguard the common interests of China and the United
States, we demand that the newspaper admit its mistake publicly
and hope it will never engage in such activities that go against
the professional ethics for newspaper men," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dhaka, Washington Widely Split on TU Issue in EPZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The outstanding issue of allowing
trade unions in the Export Processing Zones (EPZs) seems to be
dragging on, as Bangladesh and the United States recently
reiterated their contradictory stands.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bangladeshi government finally decided not to
allow trade unions or union activities in the two EPZs, one at
Savar near the capital city Dhaka, and the other in the port city
Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
In an instant reaction to this decision, the U.S. authorities
have threatened to withdraw the Generalized System of Preference (
GSP) to Bangladesh, and issued an ultimatum to Bangladesh to
reverse the decision by August 15 or face an arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Bangladeshi government has been in a very awkward
situation on the issue. On the hand, Japan and South Korea, major
investors in the EPZs, strongly oppose the existence of trade
unions, while on the other, the United States firmly asked for it.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean and Japanese industrialists have told
Bangladesh that they would start winding up their industrial units
once trade union is allowed.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at reaching a compromise between the investors, the
Bangladeshi government proposed to establish welfare associations
in the EPZs, trying to convince the U.S. that the associations
will protect the interest of the employees and workers.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the Bangladeshi government is
continuing talks with the United States in an effort to retain GSP
facility to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"If the talks do not yield any positive result, then the
government will face the arbitration," an official said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, American Free Labor Union demanded that trade unions
be set up in the EPZs to protect workers' rights and implement
international labor laws.
</P>
<P>
Under the labor organization's pressure, the U.S. authorities
asked Bangladesh to allow trade unions in the EPZs as it did in
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government replied that trade unions remained
prohibited since the establishment of EPZs and foreign investors
came in on condition of not allowing trade unions activities in
the zones to keep production unhindered.
</P>
<P>
Now the latest U.S. reaction poses a serious threat to the
country's export sector, particularly the ready-made garments
industry that earned as much as 1.8 billion U.S. dollars last year
alone.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Countries Urged to Focus on Similarities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Islamic countries should
focus on their similarities and not on their differences to build
on their respective achievements in various fields including in
economic and political areas, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"If politics haunts us in our efforts to achieve success, we
have to ease political tension and promote cooperation among us,"
he said in a program over Radio Television Malaysia (RTM), two
days before the opening of the four-day 27th meeting of the
Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers here.
</P>
<P>
It is Malaysia's hope the meeting would have frank discussions
on these issues, Syed Hamid said, adding the conference would also
discuss, among others, ways of changing the western perception
that Islamic countries were backward and in constant conflict.
</P>
<P>
The conference would also look into ways to ensure that the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) member countries become
part of the respected international community and not seen as
countries involved in frequent bickering, he said.
</P>
<P>
Islamic countries need not be wholly dependent on other nations
because such total dependence would only cause a nation to be
easily controlled, Syed Hamid said, adding, "Hence, we have to
determine our own future."
</P>
<P>
On how the OIC could be more effective, the minister said
member countries must conduct self-appraisal to gauge their
strength and weaknesses and tap their available resources for
their common benefit.
</P>
<P>
"I think to suggest that the OIC has not achieved anything is
not true. Unlike before, we know each other more now with
increased cooperation among us, bilateral relations have been
established and these must be enhanced," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there should not be any doubt on the OIC'S capability
to function effectively for the benefit of Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 delegates from OIC-member countries will attend the
foreign ministers' meeting which begins here on June 27.

system, he said in a program over Radio Television Malaysia (RTM)
prior to the opening of the four-day 27th meeting of the Islamic
Foreign Ministers here on June 27.
</P>
<P>
He said "The IMF anecdote for the financial ills is the same
for all. Some will have to die as their complaints differed. Hence,
we have to diagnose the other problems as well."
</P>
<P>
As such, the minister said, in the formulation of the new
financial architecture, the sensitivities and the prevailing
situations should be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
"We also need to consider capital flow, currency manipulations
and regulatory requirements which work against the weak nations
that could not by themselves face the world financial giants,"
Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said that apart from proposals to enhance multilateral
trading and a new financial architecture, Malaysia would also make
suggestions on the advancement of technology and communication
within the OIC.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 delegates from OIC-member countries are expected to
attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Praises Voting Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday said the huge voter turnout and peace that marked the
start of the two-day parliamentary election showed that democracy
is getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after touring his house in Harare, Mugabe
said, " This is a very important election. I hope it goes well.
I can see and feel it is very quiet, people are voting massively.
 Whites are also voting massively, I do not know how they are
voting but I hope it's positive."
</P>
<P>
"It's a message that the democratic process is strengthening in
 Zimbabwe and I hope it keeps strengthening," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a helicopter tour of most constituencies in Harare and
other provinces, Chairman of the Election Directorate Mariyawanda
Nzuwah said voting started on high note as tens of thousands of
people turned out to cast their votes at all polling stations
throughout the country on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If Saturday's huge turn-out was maintained throughout the
country, most people would have exercised their right to vote
when polling ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said the election was
held in a peaceful environment Saturday as no incidents of
violence had been reported.
</P>
<P>
Head of the European Union election observer mission Pierre
Schori is impressed by the way the country's parliamentary
elections are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
"He told President Mugabe that he had the opportunity to go to
some polling stations in Harare in the morning and was impressed
by the professionalism at the voting centers," government sources
said.
</P>
<P>
He added the EU has been working well with Zimbabwe since
independent in 1980 and wanted to continue on the path.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Meet Rwandan Counterpart Kagame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
will meet his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame over the recent
clashes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the New
Vision daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni who was speaking on CBS radio to the live Luganda
Program, local language program, did not say when and where they
would meet, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no war between Uganda and Rwanda but clashes, he
said, adding that he did not consider Rwanda as an enemy and that
they have achieved what they had wanted to have withdrawn their
troops from the Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
He said the 28 soldiers of the Uganda People's Defence Forces
(UPDF) who Rwanda refers to as POWs are mostly those who were in
the U.N. company, and not were captured from Tchopo bridge in
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Observer team in Congo had borrowed 216 officers and men
from the UPDF for security reason in Kisangani after a ceasefire
was agreed and withdrawal from the city started following clashes
between the Ugandan and Rwandan troops in Kisangani where they
shelled each other two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said Uganda did not go to DRC to interfere, but to
defend itself and this has resulted in the development of Western
Uganda following the demolishing of rebel bases of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) in eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
The president said among the benefits for having gone to DRC
was that UPDF had managed to break the back of the ADF rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper report, Museveni said Uganda would
talk about the Kisangani reparations when it goes to the Hague to
put up its defence against the case filed by the DRC President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
He said Kabila would be put to task to explain why his country
has remained unstable and a haven for wrong elements that even
destabilize neighboring countries.

TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic silver medalists
China clinched their spot at the Sydney Games Sunday when they

volleyball final qualifying round.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women, who earlier lost to Italy and the
Netherlands, stormed past the Argentines 25-17, 25-11, 25-17.
</P>
<P>
With five wins against two defeats, China joined Italy and
South Korea to enter the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"It was really a difficult tournament," said Chinese coach Hu
Jin.
</P>
<P>
It will be China's fifth straight ticket to the Olympics since
the 1984 Los Angeles Games, where they won the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The remaining available qualification spot would be decided by
the outcome of Croatia's match against Italy later in the day. A
defeat for the Croatians would leave Japan with a mathematical
possibility of qualifying if they win their game against South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The qualifiers from the tournament here will join the World Cup

Germany, United States, Peru and Kenya as well as hosts Australia

<HEADLINE> U.S. Diplomats in Row With New Sri Lankan Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. diplomats including the
Deputy Head of Mission have walked out of a meeting in a dispute
with the new Sri Lankan political party, Sinhala Urumaya (Heritage)
, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The row took place when the Colombo-based U.S. diplomats
questioned the party leader S.L. Gunasekara regarding the "
genocide" by the Sri Lankan forces in the north and the minority
rights and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Gunasekara in return questioned the U.S. diplomats on the issue
of bombing of Hiroshima and genocide by U.S. forces and the
minority rights and human rights in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Heated words were exchanged at the time and the three diplomats
walked out abruptly, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held at the residence of Gunasekara.
</P>
<P>
Sinhala Urumaya, established on April 26 this year, is a
nationalist party which aims to safeguard the rights of the
majority Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists forming 74 percent of
the 19 million population.
</P>
<P>
The party opposes giving special status to the Tamils who are
generally Hindus making up 18 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
It claims that Sri Lanka doesn't have an ethnic problem, but a
terrorist problem, which should be solved militarily.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, alleging
the Sinhalese government discriminates against the Tamils, are
fighting for a homeland for the Tamils in the country's north and
east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 MILF Rebels Killed Since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front(
MILF) has lost 5,000 men, or one third of its force, as a result
of fierce fighting with government troops since late April, The
Manila Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which used to have 15,000 fighters, now has at most
10,000 men left, and most of them have taken refuge in Camp
Abubakar, the MILF's headquarters, the paper said, quoting
military sources.
</P>
<P>
Government troops, which began launching offensives against
MILF encampments in the southern province of Maguindanao late
April, claimed they have captured more than 30 rebel camps and
expected to complete military operations soon in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rebels continue to hold to half a dozen satellite
bases around Camp Abubakar, but they are experiencing a shortage
of ammunition, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, police seized some 2,000 bullets, believed to be
destined for Camp Abubakar, at the North Harbor in Tondo, Manila.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has warned that unless the peace talks
reach a positive conclusion by June, the entire might of the armed
forces would be unleashed on the MILF, which has been fighting for
two decades for an independent Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The president also set three conditions on the extension of the
deadline to July 29 as requested by the MILF. The MILF was asked
to drop its bid for an independent state in exchange for expanded
autonomy, stop terroristic activities and lay down its arms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Makes Remarkable Achievements in Drug Fight  By Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The "Golden Triangle" area
bordering Myanmar, Thailand and Laos is the main base where opium
and heroin are produced.
</P>
<P>
For many years, narcotic drugs have not only run rampant there
but also been illegally smuggled to every part of the world.
</P>
<P>
In face of the grave danger brought to Myanmar and the
international community, Myanmar has launched anti-drug battles
year by year and has scored remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by Myanmar's Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), during the 12 years
between 1988 and 1999 and with the cooperation of its army units,
police force and customs departments, Myanmar exposed over 50,000
drug-related cases, arrested over 70,000 drug offenders, seized 29,
833 kilos of opium, 4,448 kilos of heroin, 6,880 kilos of
marijuana, 503,528 liters of precursor chemicals and 55.89 million
tablets of stimulants, and destroyed 110 heroin refineries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, during the period, Myanmar also destroyed 37,379
hectares of poppy cultivation, resulting in reduction of 400 tons
of opium output annually.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32,794 kilos of drugs destroyed, heroin accounted for 3,
679 kilos, while opium represented 23,646 kilos. The destruction
also included 24.26 million tablets of stimulant drugs.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, there established a "drug-free" zone in Mongla
region, eastern part of Shan state.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there is now a total of 86,
537 drug addicts in Myanmar. To help them give up drug addictions
and regain health, the Myanmar government has set up six treatment
centers in Yangon, Mandalay, Myitkyina,Taunggyi, Lashio and Kyaing
Tong, catering to 2,000 addicts annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country also established eight rehabilitation
centers under the Social Welfare Department for ex-addicts.
</P>
<P>
Due to efforts of years, Myanmar's poppy cultivated area and
drug production dropped markedly. The Myanmar CCDAC said, in 1999,
the country's poppy cultivated area reduced by 31 percent as
compared with 1998, while its drug production dropped by 38
percent from the same year.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its achievement made in drug control and to
educate people on the danger of drugs and to stay away from them,
Myanmar is building two drug control museums.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Myanmar has reached memorandums of understanding on
regional drug control action plan with China, Cambodia, Laos,
Thailand and Vietnam. It also signed agreements on bilateral
cooperation in drug control with India, Bangladesh, Vietnam,
Russia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Another measure is increasing of investment in drug-cultivating
and producing border areas and minorities-inhabited areas to raise
their living standard and change their traditional way of
livelihood which depends on drug cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Although Myanmar has made big achievements in drug eradication,
due to domestic security and problems in international assistance,
the success is not as anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has started in 1999 implementing a 15-year plan worth
255 million U.S. dollars, aimed at total elimination of drugs
covering 51 cultivating and producing townships.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the aim as early as possible, Myanmar has
urged the international community to enhance cooperation, and
moreover, to further extend aid.

<HEADLINE> Communal Clash Continues in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Communal violence between
Christians and Muslims continued to torment the riot-stricken
Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, according to
reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes in Talake and Galala subdistricts on
Saturday left at least 10 people dead and 36 injured, bringing the
death toll in the four days of continuous fierce fighting to 41.
</P>
<P>
Around 6,000 people, mostly women and children from the
subdistricts of Halong, Galala, Poka and Rumah Tiga, have poured
into the Halong Naval Base, 12 kilometers east of Ambon, in panic
since the new round of rioting began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambon, about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, was totally
paralyzed as the two warring parties attacked each other with
grenades and mortars. Heavy rain during the night was not enough
to stop their actions, which continued late into Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have sent children and women to safer areas, while
men stay to protect their properties," a resident of Bata Merah
subdistrict was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maluku police chief Brigadier General Dewa Astika Saturday said
it would be difficult to block the rioters as some members of the
security forces, both police and military, had taken sides with
one of the warring camps.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, at least 152 persons died in religious violence in
Halmahera island, North Maluku province. It was one of the worst
incidents in nearly two years of religious and ethnic violence
that has plagued Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to calm down the situation, Indonesian Military (TNI)
Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. Saturday voiced support for the
government to declare a state of emergency in Maluku and North
Maluku provinces.
</P>
<P>
Widodo said TNI would soon take tough measures to stop the
widespread violence and would conduct door-to-door sweeping
operations to confiscate unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
"TNI will take stern measures in anticipating further
developments. There will be also a concentration of troops in
several riot-prone places to prevent clashes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Widodo's support for a state of emergency in ravaged provinces
came just one day after President Abdurrahman Wahid announced the
closure of the two provinces to outsiders due to escalating
destruction there.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed nearly two
years of religious and ethnic violence. The number of people
killed and wounded in both provinces now runs into thousands.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tensions in the two provinces have been
fueled by the arrival of 2,000 hard-line Muslim fighters from Java
island, who have vowed a holy war. Their leaders have said they
would not wage a war against Christians, but help fellow Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Granddaughter-in-law Nabbed For Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A granddaughter-in-law of
Indonesian former president Soeharto was arrested by West Jakarta
Police detectives on Saturday with around 2.5 grams of shabu-shabu
(crystal methamphetamine) at the Olympia Hotel in West Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
West Jakarta Police chief Col. Adjie Rustam Ramdja identified
the 25-year-old woman as Gusti Maya Firanti Noor, the wife of
Soeharto's grandson Ari Sigit.
</P>
<P>
The arrest occurred following a report by a security guard who
said that Maya had asked him to buy a prepaid cellular phone
voucher for her using a counterfeit 50,000 rupiah (about 6 U.S.
dollars) bank note.
</P>
<P>
Based on the report, the local police then examined the woman
and "found 1.5 grams of shabu-shabu in her hand bag and another
gram under her car seat," Adjie was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
During questioning, Adjie said, Maya admitted to have used the
shabu-shabu earlier in room number 303 at the hotel with three
other men.
</P>
<P>
The officer vowed that his office would go on with their
investigation and carry out the legal processes regardless Maya's
status as a member of former president Soeharto's family.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the first time for us to handle this kind of case,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, West Jakarta police detectives arrested Second Lt.
Agus Isrok, the oldest son of former Army chief Gen. Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo, in a hotel room on August 8 for drug possession.
</P>
<P>
Agus was sentenced to four years in jail by the West Jakarta
District Court on Thursday and has been discharged from the army.
</P>
<P>
The police actually have a complete list of drug related
suspects, who are all family members of important figures in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Only after the resignation of Soeharto in May 1998 have police
officers started to have the guts to arrest and name these
suspects.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition May Resign en Masse From House of Representatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai major opposition party the
New Aspiration Party (NAP) resolved to resign en masse from
parliament to pressure the government into dissolving the House of
Representatives and holding a snap election, according to the
latest television broadcast Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, it was unclear how many of NAP's 116 members of
parliament (MPs) would actually follow the call of their executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour meeting of the committee Saturday, NAP leader
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh read out a statement saying his party wanted
to return power to the people.
</P>
<P>
The government could not effectively perform its duty in
parliament and resigning was the only way to stop the government
from furthering damaging the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The response to the executive committee's resolution remained
uncertain. The decision is to be formally put to the party's MPs
on Tuesday and they are supposed to tender their resignation to
parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Chavalit's faction has only 55 MPs. Another 50 are in the
Wang Nam Yen faction of Sanoh Thienthong and 11 others are
defecting to Chart Pattana.
</P>
<P>
It is not known if Sanoh, who was unceremoniously booted out of
the secretary-general's job by Chavalit and is moving to Thai Rak
Thai Party, will abide by the decision.
</P>
<P>
The 11 MPs moving to the coalition Chart Pattana Party have
already made it known they will not resign.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said the government would
keep doing its job despite the NAP's decision.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in the government's mind was the budget bill for
fiscal 2001, due for deliberation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the NAP opted not to resign, the prime minister is bound by
law to propose its leader as the new opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Sathit Wongnongtoey, the ruling Democrat spokesman, admitted
the NAP's departure would have an effect on the government, but
how much of a problem it causes would depend on how many MPs
actually resign on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six-party ruling coalition, taking power in late 1997, has
237 seats in the 385-member parliament. It must call a general
election before November when its term expires.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Powerlifter Breaks World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite a wrist injury, Sutrisno
of Indonesia's Lampung province, managed to break the world record
in the bench event at the 15th National Games (PON) powerlifting
event in Surabaya, East Java, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sutrisno, 27, competing in the men's 60 kilograms division,
earned a gold medal after lifting a total of 675 kgs in the squat,
bench press and dead lift.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Sunday, Sutrisno lifted 186.5 kgs
in the bench press, beating the previous Asian record of 185.5 kgs
and the former world record of 186 kgs both set by Isagawa
Hiroyoki of Japan.
</P>
<P>
He also bettered the PON record of 160 kgs and national record
of 170 kgs, both held by himself.
</P>
<P>
Sutrisno expressed pride at his success as he considers PON a
very important sporting event for him. However, he was
dissatisfied with his total lift as he usually lifts 725 kgs
during training sessions.
</P>
<P>
He had malaria two weeks prior to PON and was still dealing
with a wrist injury which made him unable to lift anything heavier.

<HEADLINE> Most Eye Diseases Caused By Bad Habits: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- As many as 80 percent of the eye
diseases Chinese youngsters suffer from are caused by bad habits,
according to the latest survey by a group of experts from the
Tianjin Eye Diseases Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the eye diseases of Chinese youngsters are
caused by such bad habits as long-time reading, writing, watching
TV, working on computers or playing video games," said the survey
report.
</P>
<P>
"Another reason for many youngsters' bad eyesight is the lack
of scientific and health knowledge," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that one should take a break of ten to 15
minutes after straining one's eyes for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
The experts also suggested that children over five years old
take a medical examination every year to ensure their eyesight is
all right.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Land-use Principles for Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Land and
Resources has formulated the guiding principles for land-use
evaluation and approval in the 10 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities in western China.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's Outline on Land Resources
Development and Use for West Development Program, major
infrastructure projects will be given top priority in land-use
evaluation and approval.
</P>
<P>
They include trunk lines of national expressways or trunk
highways linking towns and cities, selected town development
projects, airports, interprovincial railway projects, natural gas
pipeline projects and power plants.
</P>
<P>
Priority will also be given to application for land use for
urban infrastructure projects, new water conservancy projects
approved by the central government, selected mineral resources
development projects, and projects encouraged by the State
industrial polices.
</P>
<P>
Land use approval will not be given to projects which are
discouraged by the State industrial policies, such as those which
are technologically-backward, consume excess resources, and are
heavy polluters, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
It calls for policies to be formulated on land use for projects
geared to woo domestic and overseas investors to set up factories,
develop natural resources and provide technological upgrading for
existing enterprises in the western region.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Coup Leader Frees Four Female Hostages EDS-Adds Details, Coup Group's New Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's coup leader George Speight
has released the four women hostages and said the remaining
hostages will not be freed until a new president is sworn in, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Speight and his group released the women without any warning
Saturday night, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication when he will release the remaining 27
men.
</P>
<P>
All four are said to be in good health, but will undergo
medical check-ups at the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The women, three of whom were MPs, were briefing other families
about the health of the remaining 27 hostages and may be available
to speak publicly later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Speight group has given an ultimatum to the
military that it will not release the remaining hostages until
after a president is installed, the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
The Muanikau Accord, an agreement to end Fiji's five-week-old
hostage crisis which had been scheduled to be signed on Saturday,
stipulated that all hostages should walk free within three hours
of its signing.
</P>
<P>
But the Speight group now said a president must be sworn in
first.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Fiji's hostage talks ended in deadlock and a
military official said a new attempt to reach agreement would
start on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini said Saturday that talks
on the release of the 31 hostages held in parliament by Speight's
group had stalled over the issue of the future presidency of the
country.

<HEADLINE> ``Majority of Dunhuang Sutra Cave Relics Kept in Foreign Countries" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corrupt government of late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) did not
have the ability to protect the relics, and a large number of hand-
copied and printed sutras, exquisite embroidery objects, colored
sculptures and documents were stolen.
</P>
<P>
According to scholars, China currently preserves 18,500 items
of Dunhuang relics; Russia, 19,000 pieces; Britain, 13,300; France,
6,000; Japan, 1,000; the United States, 25; Denmark, 16; and
Germany, three.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang relics are also being kept in India, Finland, the
Republic of Korea, Australia and Sweden, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In China, Dunhuang relics are mainly stored in 30 museums and
libraries in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Gansu, and
Taiwan, including the Beijing Library, the Beijing University
Library, the Palace Museum and the National Central Library in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Library alone houses 16,000 items of Dunhuang
relics, and 144 are kept in the National Central Library in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China has been collecting Dunhuang relics ever since the
founding the People's Republic of China in 1949, but many are
still missing, said Fan Jinshi, director of the Institute of the
Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
The institute is actively seeking ways to gather the lost
Dunhuang relics through donations or purchase, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a Japanese donated eight Dunhuang relics kept by his
family, becoming the first foreigner to voluntarily return
Dunhuang relics to China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts hope that his action will inspire more
foreigners and foreign governments to return Dunhuang treasures to
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUNHUANG (Gansu Province), June 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 57,
794 items of relics have been discovered so far in the Sutra Cave
at the world-famous Mogao Grottoes in northwest China's Gansu
Province, much more than the widely reported 50,000, Chinese
scholars said. However, the majority of the relics are now being
kept in a dozen foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have called for the return of the Dunhuang
relics kept by foreign countries to China during the ongoing
series of activities to mark the 100th anniversary of the
discovery of the Sutras Cave.
</P>
<P>
The dispersal of Dunhuang relics, including Buddhist sculptures,
documents, paintings and embroidery dating from the 4th to the
11th centuries is not only regrettable for Chinese historical
studies, but also regrettable as far as human civilization is
concerned, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to scholars at the Institute of Dunhuang Studies in
Gansu, many relics found in the cave are scattered in 13 countries-
- China, Britain, France, Russia, Japan, the United States,
Germany, Denmark, India, Finland, the Republic of Korea, Australia
and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Sutra Cave was reportedly accidentally found by a Taoist
priest when he was clearing sand from the No. 16 grotto on June 22,
1900.
</P>
<P>
The cave, containing the relics from a dozen dynasties, offers
valuable materials for the study of the history, geography,
religion, economy, politics, culture, nationalities, literature,
arts and science and technology of ancient China and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the cave, considered one of China's four major
archaeological discoveries in the 20th century, created its own
branch of learning -- Dunhuang Studies.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, eye-catching worldwide since that time,
attracted many adventurers and explorers from Russia, Britain, the
United States, Japan and other countries to the Mogao Grottoes. (

<HEADLINE> One Malaysian Hostage Freed by Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim extremist group Abu
Sayyaf Saturday released one Malaysian of the 21 hostages it held
on Jolo island in the southern Philippines, the biggest break so
far in the hostage crisis which entered its third month.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said that no
ransom was paid and no political promises were made in the release
of Zulkurmain Bin Hashim, 29, who is now under the custody of
Aventajado, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado called the release "a gesture of goodwill" by the
Abu Sayyaf group, which is still holding captive three Germans,
two French, two Finns, two South Africans, one Lebanese, eight
other Malaysians and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf rebels on April 23
from the diving resort of Sipadan in neighboring Malaysia. The
Malaysians and Filipinos are staff members on the resort.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf had demanded for the setting up of an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, a total ban on commercial
fishing in the Sulu Sea and the formation of a commission between
the Philippines and Malaysia to address the alleged maltreatment
of some 500,000 Filipino Muslims living in Malaysia's Sabah state.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group had also demanded a ransom of one million U.S.
dollars for each of its captives.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has repeatedly ruled out any breakup
of the country and stuck to its no-ransom policy.

<HEADLINE> Unexploded Bombs Found in General Santos City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Police authorities said they have
recovered several other unexploded bombs in General Santos City
after seven bombs exploded in the southern Philippine city
Saturday evening, which killed one woman and wounded 36 others.
</P>
<P>
Police said they have been on alert since June 14 when they
received intelligence reports that the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front will explode eight bombs in the city, according to a report
of the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The series of bombings began around 18:30 local time (10:30 GMT)
with minutes apart between each blast. Some of the bombs were
placed under vehicles.
</P>
<P>
One woman, identified Elena Kabasag, died on arrival upon being
brought to the general hospital in the city, and one of the
injured, a five-year-old boy, is in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Police said those responsible for the bombings used pipe bombs
and magnetic bombs which were powerful enough to destroy
structures and kill people as they were made of mortar shells
attached to an explosive.
</P>
<P>
So far, no individual or group has claimed responsibility for
the bombings. Police have blocked entries and exits of the city.
</P>
<P>
The report said two blasts were at the vicinity of the public
market, one blast at the parking lot of Gaisano Mall, one along
Magsaysay Avenue, another one in front of Safii Hardware Store.
</P>
<P>
The blast also rocked several city bank branches - Metrobank,
Land Bank and PCI Bank.

<HEADLINE> Voting For Japan's Lower House Election Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balloting started at 7 a.m. (local time) at most polling
stations across Japan and will continue until 8 p.m., two hours
longer than in the last lower house election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,404 candidates are vying for 480 seats, 300 in
single-seat constituencies and the remaining 180 in the
proportional-representation section. The number of lower house
seats up for grabs were cut by 20 from 500 as a result of
electoral reforms.
</P>
<P>
Eligible voters will be 107 million, a record high.
</P>
<P>
One focal point of the election is whether the ruling coalition,
comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), New Komeito and New
Conservative Party, can win 254 seats to secure a stable majority
in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
Attention is also focused on how many seats the LDP alone can
gain. LDP Secretary General Hiromu Nonaka has set the goal at 229
seats.
</P>
<P>
The targets are well below the number of seats the tripartite
coalition controlled prior to the dissolution of the lower chamber
on June 2. At that time, the coalition held 336 seats, 271 of
which were held by the LDP.
</P>
<P>
If votes fall short of the two targets, Mori could be forced to
step down, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls conducted by Japan's leading newspapers,
however, showed that the coalition was on its way to securing a
stable majority, although a high percentage of undecided voters,
between 30 percent and 50 percent, made the results difficult to
predict.
</P>
<P>
In the election campaign, the ruling coalition said it will
continue to make economic efforts aimed at putting Japan's economy,
which posted plus growth in fiscal 1999 after two years of
contraction, firmly on a path toward sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, however, criticized the ruling bloc for trying
to spend its way out of the recession, and called for structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc also blamed a series of controversial
remarks made by Mori, including one in which he said Japan is "a
divine nation with the emperor at its center." Critics said the
remark echoed the ideology that drove Japan's wartime militarism.
</P>
<P>
The LDP registered 337 candidates for the race, while the New
Komeito fielded 74, and the New Conservative Party 19.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) fielded 262,
while the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) entered 332, among others.
The results for most of the seats are expected to be known early
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Experts Predict Decreased Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have predicted
that China's exports will slow down in the second half of this
year while imports are expected to increase quickly, according to
today's Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Long Guoqiang with the Development Research
Center of the State Council as saying that the high rate of
increase in exports in the first half was based on a comparatively
low base last year, and the growth is expected to slow in July.
</P>
<P>
He said a declining trend can already be detected -- the May
increase, 27.1 percent compared to last May, was lower than rates
for the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Imports, however, may continue to grow because of the
strengthening economy and expanding investment, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Experts also believe that there is "room for improvement" in
policies affecting imports and exports, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months, China's trade volume surged 36.1
percent from comparable months of last year to 174.1 billion U.S.
dollars with a surplus of 10.5 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson needed only 38 seconds to stop fellow American
Lou Savarese in a non-title fight in Glasgow on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But the stoppage of the fight was marred by confusion, as
referee John Coyle was floored himself while attempting to haul
the former heavyweight champion away from Savarese.
</P>
<P>
The initial damage had been done by a left hook, which put
Savarese on the seat of his pants in the first 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Savarese looked shaken upon rising, but was given the chance to
carry on.
</P>
<P>
But a procession of hooks and uppercuts had him in trouble
again and it was no surprise that Coyle decided enough was enough,
even after such a short time.
</P>
<P>
The speed of the win disappointed the large Scottish crowd, who
had loudly cheered Tyson when he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
Despite destroying his opponent in such quick time, the win
will do nothing to convince the sceptics that Tyson is back to his
best.
</P>
<P>
Savarese's quality as an opponent was questioned before the
fight and his inability to take any kind of punch suggests that he
was handpicked to ensure that the Tyson express was not derailed.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's record improves to 48 wins, three defeats and one no
contest. His fallen opponent suffered his fourth defeat, with 39
wins.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Urine Samples to be Frozen for Future EPO Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Urine samples from riders in this
year's Tour de France are to be frozen and tested for the banned
substance EPO (erythropoietine) when a reliable method for
detecting the drug has been perfected, the International Cycling
Union (UCI) confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UCI president Hein Verbruggen approved the measure following
Thursday's decision not to validate a new method for detecting the
drug, developed by the French National Anti-Doping Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Two of the experts examining the new procedure demanded that
further aspects be examined before the total validation of the
method.
</P>
<P>
Verbruggen said Saturday that he was optimistic about the
future of the test and that although it would not be ready for the
July 1-23 Tour urine samples would be frozen and "conserved under
the required conditions".
</P>
<P>
A UCI statement said that the decision had been taken in order
to ensure that this year's Tour ran smoothly and peacefully. "We
believe the method could be finally validated in the coming months.
If an analysis later shows up positive for EPO, rules and
sanctions can still be applied," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
EPO causes the body to create more blood cells, bringing more
oxygen to muscles and enabling them to work longer and harder. It
thus can boost performance by 10 percent or more. But the drug is
extremely difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
Since it started being used by athletes in the 1980's 26
cyclists and several elite athletes have died in suspicious
circumstances.

<P>
-- A report on NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks Operate Well in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight overseas banks approved to
do business in Chinese currency in Shenzhen lent out two billion
yuan in loans and raked in 29 million yuan in interest earnings in
the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Information from the local taxation administration said the
overseas banks turned in 2.8 million yuan in taxes for business
operations in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Granting foreign banks with the right to do business in Chinese
currency yuan is an important step in opening up the financial
sector in China.
</P>
<P>
This has helped improve the confidence of foreign banks in
investing in Shenzhen and attracting more overseas banks to the
special economic zone. Some 20 overseas banks have built branch
organizations in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The capital needed by overseas banks in Shenzhen mainly comes
from inter-bank loans, as the eight overseas banks have all signed
medium- and long-term yuan loan agreements with local Chinese
banks.
</P>
<P>
The overseas banks then lend the Chinese currency loans to
overseas-financed ventures in Shenzhen, a regional financial
center in south China.

<HEADLINE> Portugal, Italy Enter Semis at Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BURSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Portugal beat Turkey and Italy
Downed Romania and both winners advanced to the semifinals after
their identical 2-0 victories in Saturday's quarter finals the
2000 European championships.
</P>
<P>
For Turkey and Romania, hitting at an opponent and blatant
theatrics to fool the referee turned into red cards and into
inglorious exits from Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Italy will face the winner of Sunday's quarter-final between
France and Spain while Italy will take on the winner of another
quarter-final between the Netherlands and Yugoslavia, also on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two goals from Nuno Gomes capped a display of Latin flair with
more than a touch of samba soccer to it, as mastermind Luis Figo
steered his team 2-0 past Turkey, which already was in unchartered
territory by just making it into the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
A steely defense gave Italy the solid base and opportunistic
goals from Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi brought the team
over Turkey earlier in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Gheorghe Hagi ended his long international career on
a shameful note, first committing a vile foul before the worst
kind of theatrics to fool the referee into giving a penalty. It
cost him a red card and he walked out of international soccer in
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
But if one color stood out, it was the claret-and-green of Luis
Figo and his men.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's golden boys were able to ride the class of their
Barcelona midfielder again and Nuno Gomes is riding the crest of a
scoring wave, slotting three goals in the three games he started
so far. He hadn't found the net in 12 earlier appearances.
</P>
<P>
Missing two more easy chances, he was still trying to score a
hat-trick when coach Humberto Coelho pulled him off in the 74th
minute.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed not to have the chance to go for a hat-trick,
" Gomes said. "But I'm happy that we won."
</P>
<P>
So for the first time since 1984 Portugal is in the semifinal
of a major tournament again. That year it lost in an epic European
Championship match against France.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese creativity finally broke down Turkey's defensive
wall in the dying moments of the first half when Figo, quickly
turning into the star of the tournament, whipped the umpteenth
cross in front of goal and striker Nuno Gomes tecber.
</P>
<P>
In the 56 minute, when Turkey was already groggy from wave
after wave of Portuguese attacks, Figo faked his way past Hakan
Unsal, put a precision pass on the foot of the unmarked Nuno Gomes,
who only had to tap into the empty net to scored his third goal of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the match, Portugal confirmed its reputation as a
limitless well of creative talent,
</P>
<P>
"We never lost our heads. Everybody has their feet firmly on
the ground," said midfielder Costinha.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been down a man since the 29th minute when Alpay
Ozalan was sent off for hitting Fernando Couto when both were down
after a duel for the ball in the air.
</P>
<P>
"When you play against a team like Portugal with 10 men it's
always going to be difficult," said Turkey's England-based Muzzy
Izzet.
</P>
<P>
"The sending off was a turning point," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dino Zoff's Italian team, hardly rated as title contenders
before the tournament, has now won four championship games in a
row. The coach though, was only "moderately satisfied" with his
team's performance, and disappointed with their play after Hagi
was expelled. "Some thought reaching the quarterfinals was
impossible, and we're happy with what we've accomplished," Zoff
said. "But we have to play much better. "

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon May Change Seeding System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- All England Tennis Club may change
the seeding system in next year's Wimbledon championships after
complaints from some players that the system was not objective,
club chairman Tim Phillips said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Wimbledon and ATP Tour officials would work closely
together to reconcile the differences in their approach to the
seedings in time for next year's tournament, according to a
Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
The ATP Tour Entry System used to work out players world
rankings is adjusted by the All England Club's Order of Play
Committee, which determines the seedings at Wimbledon, to "better
reflect player skills on grass".
</P>
<P>
The club says its separate set of criteria recognize the
special nature of grass court play.
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the need to reassess the criteria had come about
because this was the first year the players had to count the
points they won at Wimbledon in their ATP Tour rankings.
</P>
<P>
"This important change has highlighted the differences in
primary objectives of the two different approaches to seeding,"
said Phillips.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Spanish players Alex Corretja, Juan Carlos Ferrero
and Albert Costa threatened to boycott Wimbledon because they had
not been seeded.
</P>
<P>
The three clay court specialists wrote to the ATP Tour
complaining that the All England Club had ignored their world
rankings and excluded them from the seedings.
</P>
<P>
Corretja is ranked 11th, Ferrero 13th and Costa 15th according
to the ATP Tour Entry System used by all other tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero withdrew from the championships on Saturday with a
lower back injury.
</P>
<P>
The ATP sent an observer to this year's seedings meeting in
order better to understand Wimbledon's approach.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that they conscientiously endeavoured to
select seeds based on their grass court credentials," said Mark
Miles, the ATP Tour's Chief Executive Officer.
</P>
<P>
Miles said he recognized the special circumstances involved
with playing on grass and the difficulties this produces in the
seeding process. But he added that, "... any subjective system
must be open to criticism."
</P>
<P>
"For the betterment of the game, and in fairness to all players,
I am pleased that both organizations (Wimbledon and the ATP) are
committed to working out an equitable arrangement to resolve these
issues for next year."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Resolve Sharia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government said Sunday
that it would soon effectively resolve the crisis over the
controversial Islamic law of Sharia which has been introduced in
four northern states.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is being very carefully studied and we will
resolve it in the interest of all Nigerians," said Information
Minister Jerry Gana in a Lagos radio interview.
</P>
<P>
"We have the solution, but we want to do it in such a way that
when applied, it will be effective," Gana said. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Sharia has resurfaced following the
introduction of the Koran-based law last Wednesday in Kano state
after Zamfara, Niger and Sokoto.
</P>
<P>
More states in the predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria are
under pressure to follow suit. Christians, living mostly in the
southern part of the country, described the introduction of Sharia
as unconstitutional in secular Nigeria. They have urged the
federal government to seek constitutional clarification at the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused to do so but allowed individuals and
 organizations whose interests were affected by Sharia to go to
court.
</P>
<P>
The controversy broke into a bloody clash in February between
Moslems and Christians in the northern city of Kaduna, leaving
more than 1,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The deaths sparked off reprisal killings in the country's
southeastern part, and forced governors in the areas to call for
confederacy in the country.
</P>
<P>
To ease the tension, the federal government and governors of
the 19 northern states later reached an agreement to suspend the
implementation of Sharia and return to the existing penal code.
</P>
<P>
Niger, Sokoto and Kano states have since introduced the Sharia
in violation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Gana assured all Nigerians Saturday that the government had
the courage, vision and determination to resolve the issue and
ensure peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was cautious in its intervention
because " issues of religion are very emotive and if not well
handled can lead to a situation that last for years".

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Court Orders Shell to Pay Compensation for Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A court in Nigeria' s southeastern
city of Port Harcourt has ordered the oil giant Royal Dutch and
Shell Cooperation to pay about 40 million U.S. dollars in
compensation for a 1970 oil spill in the area, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported on Sunday. The agency quoted a Shell spokesman
in Lagos as saying on Sunday that the court passed the verdict on
Friday and that the company's Nigerian unit, Shell Petroleum
Development Company (SPDC), was appealing.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that a Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt
 delivered judgment in a case arising from the 1970 oil spill at
Ebubu, Rivers State, and awarded four billion naira (about 40
million dollars) against SPDC," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The case has been dragging since the Ejamaa Ebubu community
near Port Harcourt went to court nine years ago seeking
compensation for the spill, which devastated an area in the Ogoni
region whose people have been battling Shell for alleged
exploitation and ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
Villagers and witnesses say the mangrove swamp area where the
spill occurred has been covered by a thick crust of oil that is
now as hard as asphalt.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Schroeder Support Majority Decision in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, June 25 (Xinhua)--German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and visiting French President Jacques Chirac Sunday said they
wanted more decision by majority in the European Union (EU) to
raise its ability of operation.
</P>
<P>
At a joint interview in Hanover with German ZDF television,
the two leaders also supported the EU's eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"I am in full agreement with the French President, that we
must create more possibility for majority decision," said
Schroeder, adding, "Germany and France will not split over this
issue."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said the issue "will not be a problem."
</P>
<P>
In present EU decision-making mechanism, each of the 15 member
countries owns veto power. Germany has been calling for decision
by majority in the bloc, but smaller countries are afraid of
losing their impacts on the EU policy under majority voting system.
</P>
<P>
The necessity of a majority decision has become undeniable,"
said Schroeder, "When Europe is larger, we must have it to keep
Europe's ability to operate."
</P>
<P>
About the EU's eastward enlargement, Chirac said France would
achieve progress during its term of EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I am ambitious to go on with this adventure with progress,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Paris is due to take over the half-year EU rotating presidency
from Portugal on July 1st.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder agreed with Chirac's viewpoint and said the EU's
eastward enlargement was also accordance with national interests.
"We will not only give, but also get," he said.
</P>
<P>
But neither of the two spelled out a concrete date when the EU
would accept new members, such as Poland, Hungary, and Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a political decision," stressed Chirac, adding that
the candidates must continue "necessary economic reform."
</P>
<P>
"One must be in the position at first to become a member of
the Union. One must be in the position to apply the rules of the
game," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Over the EU's troubled relation with Austria, both Chirac and
Schroeder rejected to loosen the EU's boycott against Austria. "At
the present there is no ground to think about that," said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The two also support a common immigrants law of the EU.
Schroeder said the problem should be solved in middle term, Chirac
agreed and added, in one or two years there should be a common
European law.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Schroeder said that France, Germany and Finland
were closely co-operating to solve the hostage crisis in
Philippine. Both vowed to "take every thoughtful step to free the
hostage."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying our best. We are heartily concerned at the
crisis," said Chirac, but adding there was nothing harder to solve
than the kidnapping crisis. Schroeder also said, "we need patience.
"
</P>
<P>
The Philippine anti-government forces kidnapped 21 foreigners,
including Germans, Frenchmen, and Finns as hostage this April. The
EU has intervened in the negotiations aiming to free the hostage,
but no progress has been made till now.
</P>
<P>
Before this joint interview, the first families of Germany and
France had dinner together in a Hanover restaurant. Chirac is due
to arrive in Berlin to formally begin his German trip Monday noon,
after he visits the Expo 2000 world fair in Hanover.
