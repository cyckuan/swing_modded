<HEADLINE> CDU Official Opposes Giving Moscow Too Much for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A leading foreign affairs expert
in German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party today cautioned against
giving Russia too much in the way of compensation for NATO's
planned eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Russian attempts to make advance in fields not closely related
to security are not very helpful," Karl Lamers, the parliamentary
foreign policy spokesman of Kohl's Christian Democratic alliance
(CDU/CSU), said as quoted by the German press agency.
</P>
<P>
Lamers said Moscow's bid to link acceptance of the NATO
enlargement to conversion of the Group of Seven club of rich
industrial nations into a G-8 with Russia was a mistaken attempt.
</P>
<P>
He added that NATO should respect the legitimate security
interests of Russia, but the question remained whether such
concerns were caused by the West or arose more from developments
in the East and the South as was often stated by military
officials in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Deports Alleged Iraqi Secret Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's military court
decided today to deport an Iraqi citizen who was taken into
custody one week ago for alleged links with Iraq's intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
In a verdict issued in the name of assistant military
prosecutor Judge Khalid Hammoud, the military court announced
the "deportation of Bassam Yaaqoub Yousef, 28, from Lebanon
after a complete of investigation."
</P>
<P>
The court asked the Directorate of Public Security to
implement the deportation, after interrogating the defendant,
hearing witnesses and study of the file, the verdict said.
</P>
<P>
The verdict accused Bassam of "illegally" entering Lebanon, but
noted that Bassam "is not a Lebanese and does not reside
in Lebanon and therefore can not be tried on the Lebanese
land."
</P>
<P>
Bassam was arrested in Lebanon on February 16 on charges that he
participated in operations of killing opponents of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein in Britain, Kuwait, Lebanon and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Judicial sources said Bassam, a rich Christian from
Mosul in northern Iraq, was working for the Iraqi intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous sources said that he had entered Lebanon
several times with a fake Egyptian passport under the name of
Saleh Salem.
</P>
<P>
They said that a Lebanese woman, whose name was withheld,
was detained with Bassam.
</P>
<P>
The detained Iraqi reportedly made confessions that he had
been ordered by the Iraqi intelligence service to assassinate
Iraqi dissidents in Lebanon and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But he denied these confessions later, arguing that he
wrote the letters and documents which linked him to the Iraqi
intelligence service so as to win the sympathy of a Lebanese
woman he loved.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Lebanese government released and deported
three Iraqi diplomats suspected of killing a leading Iraqi
dissident in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The release of the Iraqis ended a nearly three-year-old case,
which prompted Lebanon and Iraq to sever their diplomatic
ties.

<HEADLINE> "Larry Flynt" Takes Top Award at Berlin Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Milos Forman's controversial
"The People vs. Larry Flynt" (U.S.) won the Golden Bear award at
closing ceremonies today of the two-week 47th Berlin Film
Festival, with top acting awards going to Leonardo DiCaprio and
Juliette Binoche.
</P>
<P>
DiCaprio took the Silver Bear for best actor for his title role
in "William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet" (U.S.), with his
female counterpart being Binoche, who portrayed a love-struck
nurse in "The English Patient" (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
Best Director honors went to Eric Heumann for "Port Djema"
(France). The jury, headed by former French Cultural Minister Jack
Lang, gave its annual special jury award to the film "He Liu" (The
River) from Taiwan, China, which also took the Silver Bear prize.
</P>
<P>
Other awards included a special Silver Bear for Franco-Chilean
director Raoul Ruiz' "Genealogies d'un Crime" (France) and a prize
for outstanding individual achievement to Zbigniew Preisner for
his screenplay for "The Island on Birdstreet"
(Denmark/Britain/Germany).
</P>
<P>
Forman has been nominated for an Oscar in the best director
category at the U.S. Academy Awards ceremonies in March, and Woody
Harrelson for a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of "Hustler"
magazine publisher Flynt.
</P>
<P>
A great success at the Berlin festival, the film has been
controversial elsewhere. In the United States, the movie was
condemned by feminists and a number of leading columnists, while
Columbia Pictures and Phoenix Pictures published full-page
advertisements in The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times to
defend it.
</P>
<P>
The European version of its promotional poster, with Harrelson
swaddled in an American flag and "crucified" over the loins of a
naked woman, was banned last week by authorities in Marseille,
France.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Party Tops Swedish Political Parties in Popularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The electoral support for
the Swedish Moderate Party has amounted to 30.9 percent, making it
the most popular party in Sweden, Swedish Institute of Public
Opinion Research poll for February showed.
</P>
<P>
The party's major political rival, the ruling Social Democratic
Party (SDP), obtained 29.1 percent support.
</P>
<P>
The figures illustrate an obvious change of political trend in
the nation, an even wider gap between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Moderate Party Secretary Gunnar Hokmark is convinced that the
recent energy agreement, reached between the ruling SDP and some
central and left parties, including the Moderate Party, was of
decisive importance to the changes.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the nuclear power station in Barseback, on
the western coast of the country, is scheduled to be closed by
July, 1998 before an autumn election.
</P>
<P>
However, Social Democratic Party Secretary Ingela Thalen seemed
to be satisfied with the party's steady supporting rate below 30
percent, saying it was caused by the firm but inevitable economic
policy of the last two years.

<HEADLINE> Iranians to Stage Demonstrations During Hajj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today that
Iranian pilgrims will stage political demonstrations during the
forthcoming hajj rituals in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Mohammad Reyshahri, head of Iranian
hajj pilgrims and representative of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei and carried in all evening Persian dailies.
</P>
<P>
Reyshahri, also one of the four nominees for the 7th
presidential race scheduled for June, claimed that Mecca and hajj
must be the starting point for public uprising in the world of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
He said that hajj must be used as an instrument of
strengthening the power of Islamic leadership.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported earlier that about
100,000 Iranian pilgrims will leave for Mecca and Medina for hajj in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government bans all political activities during the
pilgrimage. After the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979, Iranian
pilgrims insisted on staging political demonstrations and rallies,
saying that the pilgrimage should be used for political aims.
</P>
<P>
Iranian pilgrims clashed with Saudi police in a political
demonstration near the grand mosque in the holy city of Mecca on
July 31, 1987. Some 320 Iranians were killed in the bloody Mecca
incident.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Ordered to Cut Domestic Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The German airline Lufthansa was
formally ordered today by anti-monopoly watchdogs to reduce its
high fare on route between capital Berlin and the financial center
of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Cartel Office issued the order following a written
warning. It told the airline that its one-way fare on this route
could not exceed by more than Deutsche 10 marks (5.928 U.S.
dollars) the price of the Berlin-Munich flight, a longer distance.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa is now the sole airline flying the lucrative
Berlin-Frankfurt route. The Cartel Office noted that Lufthansa
charged on the route much more than on others where there was
competition, mainly from Deutsche BA, a unit of British Airways.
</P>
<P>
It described such a price disparity as a breach of German
competition law.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa indicated that it would challenge the office's ban on
its higher Berlin-Frankfurt charges. It was entitled under German
law to set a high price because of the loss of money on domestic
routes for several years, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the authorities, companies in a monopoly position
have no fundamental right to charge whatever it takes to cover
their costs, and Lufthansa is profitable overall.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa said that, however, would it cut Berlin-Frankfurt
fares, it would lose money.

JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu met Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, and promised
that a decision will be made in two days on the construction of
Har Homa neighborhood in Jerusalem, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Olmert told Israel Radio that he and the premier also
agreed on the building of some 3,500 housing units in ten
Arab neighborhoods in the eastern side of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Olmert said that Netanyahu told him that he would submit
these proposals to the cabinet Wednesday for approval, adding
he believed that the construction would start in "a matter
of weeks."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu, during his visit to Jordan, informed
Jordan's King Hussein that Israel plans to "simultaneously
announce this week" the construction of an estimated 2,600
Jewish housing units on Har Homa and an "approximately equal"
number of Arab units in the Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians officials continued to express their
opposition to the building of the Har Homa neighborhood, even
if it was linked to the building of Arab neighborhoods in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They warned that there would be Palestinian resistance to the
construction of the Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem, which, they
said, would lead a situation that would threaten the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> UK Urged to Tighten Fiscal Policy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government should
tighten its fiscal policy soon to avoid the risk of suffering a
"boom and bust" cycle, a report published today by the accountant
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand warned.
</P>
<P>
The report came after Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth
Clarke's warning Sunday in a BBC interview that it would be
damaging to cut interest rates to try to stem the strength of the
sterling. That would cause high inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the immediate outlook for
Britain's economy is favorable, strong consumer demand and the
improving housing market mean interest rates might need to
increase sharply unless the government raises taxes or cuts public
spending soon.
</P>
<P>
However, it warned that higher rates could push the economy
into recession by the turn of the century, so it called for a net
tax increase or a spending cut of 5-10 billion pounds (8-16
billion US dollars) over the next two years "to put the public
finances on a sounder footing."

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Ordered to Cut Berlin-Frankfurt Fare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- German airline Lufthansa was
formally ordered today by anti-monopoly watchdogs to reduce its
high fare on route between capital Berlin and the financial center
of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Cartel Office issued the order following a written
warning, and told the airline that its one-way fare on this route
could not exceed by more than 10 marks the price of the
Berlin-Munich flight, a longer distance.
</P>
<P>
The Cartel Office noted that Lufthansa charged on the route
much more than on others where there was competition, mainly from
Deutsche BA, a unit of British Airways.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa is now the sole airline flying the lucrative
Berlin-Frankfurt route. It has indicated that it would challenge
the office's ban, stressing that it is entitled under German law
to set a high price because of the loss of money on domestic
routes for several years.

ALGIERS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces have
killed 83 in a vast offensive against Islamic extremists over the
past few days, local media quoted security sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that 60 were killed in Chrea and Medea,
respectively 60 and 90 kilometers south Algiers, and at least five
"back-up bases" of the extremist group, Armed Islamic Group (GIA),
were destroyed.
</P>

GIA, the most radical of the groups, has intensified terrorist
activities, including bombing attacks in cities and villages,
since the beginning of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on
January 10, during which more than 400 people were killed,
</P>
<P>
After the bloody month of Ramadan, Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual vowed to "exterminate" the groups.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Preparatory Committee Members Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A panel for working out
methods for the selection of the first Legislative Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) held its first
meeting here on February 23 and 24.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, more than 40 Hong Kong and mainland
members of the panel under the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR
stood in silent tribute to mourn for the death of Deng Xiaoping
who put forward the concept of "one country, two systems" for the
solution to the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting briefed the participants on suggestions raised by
the special group for political affairs under the Preliminary
Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
SAR concerning the specific methods for the first legislature of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Based on these suggestions, the participants discussed the
guiding principles for formulating the legislative council, the
requirements for candidates and specific methods for drawing up
geographical constituencies, functional constituencies and the
election committee.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on how to make sure that the
proportion of the legislature members who are of non-Chinese
nationality or have the right of abode in foreign countries does
not surpass 20 percent in the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Most of them agreed with the view of the political affairs
group on geographical constituencies -- that the so-called "one
seat, one vote" will not reflect the principle of fair and
balanced involvement, but will make the legislature lack
representativeness.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they held that if the constituencies are too small
the legislature members to be elected will find it difficult to
reflect general social interests.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to further study the method of multiple seats with
one vote and of selecting representatives according to proportion.
</P>
<P>
The panel members held that functional groups and election
methods prevalent during the election of the Hong Kong Legislative
Council in 1991 will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision by the National People's Congress, the
Preparatory Committee will be responsible for formulating specific
methods for the establishment of the first Legislative Council,
and the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR will
draw up corresponding ordinance on elections based on these
methods.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the panel will solicit opinions from
the Hong Kong people of all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, vice-chairman and secretary-general of the Preparatory
Committee, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kohl Faces Showdown Over Tax Reform With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Facing record high unemployment
and widespread pessimism over Germany's economic outlook, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl today opened talks with leaders of the
opposition Social Democrats in a bid to forge a compromise on the
controversial tax reform.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who described the planned tax reform as "vital for the
German economy," said he expected from the talks "an important
signal of the determination and ability to reform in Germany."
</P>
<P>
The Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner in Kohl's
ruling coalition, also pressed for a swift decision on the tax
reform. "When the decision is made quickly and clearly motivated,
I'll expect a better situation on the job market from this
summer," FDP leader Wolfgang Gerhardt said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at reducing tax rates and bolstering business
competitiveness and job creation, tax reform has become the German
government's top domestic policy priority and its main recipe to
curb unemployment, which stands at 4.66 billion, the highest since
1933.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform plan, however, met with sharp criticism from the
Social Democrat Party (SPD). SPD parliamentary leader Rudolf
Scharping called it "scandalous" and "obscene" as the government
was again trying to dip further into the pockets of normal
employees while offering more tax breaks for the rich.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Sunday that the SPD will not relent in its
opposition to crucial elements of the government's tax reform
plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed tax reform, the government plans to cut
income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage earners and 39 percent for
people with high incomes instead of the current marginal rates
ranging from 25.9 percent to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, the income tax cuts, along
with other cuts in corporate tax rates, would leave a shortfall in
state revenue of 44 billion Deutsche marks (26.3 billion U.S.
dollars) which the government wants to reduce to 30 billion marks
(17.9 billion dollars) by raising the 15 percent value-added tax
(VAT) to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the SPD rejects any VAT increase and has also said that
while it backs cutting income tax for low-wage earners, it wants
to leave the 53 percent rate intact for the rich.
</P>
<P>
The opposition is also strongly against a government proposal
for tax hikes on work done on Sundays, public holidays or at
night.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the SPD wants the entire tax reform package to be
implemented in 1998, instead of 1999 as favored by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to strike a compromise with the SPD if the
reform plan is to survive the upper house of the German
parliament, Bundesrat, where the SPD controls a majority.
</P>
<P>
The government's position in the talks has also been weakened
by infighting within Kohl's own party, the Christian Democratic
Union (CDU). It had to delay last week a parliament vote to
abolish the so-called local business tax due to continued
opposition by eastern German members of the CDU.
</P>
<P>
Today's high-level meeting between the government and the
opposition is expected to yield nothing concrete but rhetoric,
German media commented. The real work is expected to be handed off
to a cluster of expert committees. Sharping said he hoped that
talks would not extend beyond April or May.

<HEADLINE> Think-Tank Attacks UK Government Claim on Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) - Britain's falling unemployment
is a result of structural changes in the economy and has little to
do with government policies, according to a report published today
by an independent think-tank.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Employment Policy Institute (EPI), argued
that the British labor market has become more flexible because of
structural shifts such as the move to part-time work which began
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It undermined the government's claim that
Conservative-instigated deregulation of the labor market is
responsible for the unexpected falling joblessness which is now
below 2 million, dropping by a third since the recent recession.
</P>
<P>
The EPI pointed out that the government should be responsible
for the "deep-rooted and institutional failure" to tackle core
unemployment which has created an underclass of people with slim
prospects of finding work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report challenged the government's claim that
Britain's job record has made it the envy of other European
countries like Germany, where unemployment has reached levels not
seen since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
It argued that Germany's jobs crisis has more to do with the
strict anti-inflation policy that accompanied unification and the
economic stringency needed to meet the Maastricht criteria for
European economic and monetary union than with inflexible
employment practices.

<HEADLINE> Good Sino-US Relations Help World Peace: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting with US Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright tonight, Premier Li Peng said that
increasing cooperation and the establishment of good relations
between China and the US, as two major countries, will be
significant for safeguarding world peace and promoting common
development.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted that maintaining and enhancing high-level
exchanges of visits between the two countries will also be helpful
for increasing mutual trust and understanding.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to do anything that will benefit world peace,
security and development," Li said, adding that China observes
principles, shoulders its responsibilities and keeps its promises
in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Vice-President Al Gore's forthcoming visit to China
in March," Li said, adding, "I am looking forward to discussing
with him the environmental and energy cooperation and sustained
development, in order to explore new ways of expanding
mutually-beneficial cooperation in these areas, and to open up
even broader prospects for bilateral economic and trade
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Because the two countries have different histories, traditions
and social systems, and their economies are developing on
different levels, the Chinese premier noted, it is easy to
understand that there exist disputes on some questions between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
But this should not hinder the development of Sino-US
relations, Li said, adding that the two sides should engage in
constructive dialogue in the spirit of seeking common ground while
reserving differences, since the world is diversified.
</P>
<P>
"Dialogue, instead of confrontation, is beneficial to both
sides," Li emphasized.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 100
representatives from the local educational sector gathered here
today to commemorate Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who passed away
last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
Yeung Yiu-chung, chairman of the Federation of Education
Workers, praised Deng as one of the greatest figures in today's
world.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the Chinese people embarked on the road
of reform and opening-up and modern construction, and have made
great achievements featured by a growing comprehensive national
strength, an enhanced international status and improved living
standards of the people, said Yeung, who is also headmaster of
Heung To Middle School.
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Mu Kuang English School voiced his regret that
Deng, whose initiative of "one country, two systems" led to a
successful settlement of the Hong Kong issue, could not witness
the moment when Hong Kong will return to her motherland in the
middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many speakers agreed that the best way to commemorate Deng is
to make every effort toward Hong Kong's smooth transition and its
long-term prosperity and stability, so as to live up to Deng's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"We should teach the younger generation to love their country
and the Chinese nation, and to study and work hard with a
perspective of a better Hong Kong," Professor Chan from the
Chinese University of Hong Kong told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Various mourning activities have been held in Hong Kong's
schools in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students and teachers went to the mourning hall at
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch here to pay their homage
to Deng Xiaoping.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Minister to Chair Swedish Nazi Gold Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Wirten, Sweden's Labor
Minister in early 1980s and a former county governor, has been
appointed chairman of an investigation commission, which will deal
with Swedish purchases of gold from Nazi during the Second World
War.
</P>
<P>
These gold could have been stolen from the Jewish people by
Germany's Nazi government.
</P>
<P>
Ragnar Sohlman, a possible nominee, missed the appointment
because of concerns of his qualification as the son of Rolf
Sohlman, the Swedish Foreign Minister during the war.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also review bank accounts opened by
persecuted European Jews before the war started.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that these dormant accounts now contain
deposits of as many as 59 million Swedish kroner (about 7.67
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Concerns Ease Over Anthrax Outbreak In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Victoria State
authorities said today that the crisis over an anthrax outbreak in
the state's north area during the past month appeared to have
eased.
</P>
<P>
"It seems as though there is not much activities in terms of
getting increasing numbers of properties," State Natural Resources
and Environment Department chief veterinary officer Andrew Turner
told reporters in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Only one new property with anthrax was reported yesterday and
one newly infected animal found, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
Turner attributed the slowdown in the spread of the disease to
the fact that 40 to 50 out of about 79 infected properties had
passed the 10-day threshold for the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The anthrax outbreak is centered at Tatura-Stanhope area 182 km
north of Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Turner admitted that scientists were still mystified as to the
cause of the outbreak and that epidemiological investigations were
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Since the first case was discovered on January 26, a total of
160 cows and three sheep have died of the disease.

<HEADLINE> NATO Officials Question Russians on Talks Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO officials questioned
Russian senior officials today about the texts of Russia's four
proposals on future relations presented to the alliance during
negotiations between NATO and Russia
</P>
<P>
The meeting between NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov Sunday evening was the
second round of talks between NATO and Russia to outline a
document governing all the aspects of future NATO-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
The papers, according to NATO sources who asked to remain
anonymous, contained "idea and draft elements" covering the
principles of the new relationship, the mechanism for NATO-Russia
consultations, NATO enlargement and changes in the NATO structure.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Gebhardt von Moltke, NATO assistant
secretary-general for political affairs, met with Russian
Assistant Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasievsky and a Russian arms
control specialist today to clarify the proposals and ask a number
of questions.
</P>
<P>
Von Moltke was expected to travel to Moscow with NATO's
responds early next month prior to a third Solana-Primakov
negotiating session.
</P>
<P>
The Russians appear to share NATO's thinking in three areas,
the sources said, including the basic principles of a special
relationship, the idea of creating a new NATO-Russia council for
close consultations, and on areas where Russia and NATO can
cooperate, such as in peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree, sources said, that the new council would be a
distinct body apart from NATO, with its own secretariat, and in
which both sides would have equal status. NATO insists, however,
that Russia will be given a voice but "no veto."
</P>
<P>
During Sunday's talks, Moscow insisted that no significant
defense equipment should be moved onto the territory of NATO's new
members and the alliance disagreed, saying that NATO should
respect the right and obligation of the new members.
</P>
<P>
Russia also wants a legally binding agreement governing future
relations with NATO, but the alliance is only offering a flexible
politically binding charter.
</P>
<P>
However, both NATO and Russia wish to reach a deal before
NATO's Madrid summit in July, when membership invitations are
expected to be issued to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Reap A Record Winter Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A record 1996-97 winter
harvest of 34.5 million tons in Australia was predicted by the
Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE).
</P>
<P>
The chief commodities forecaster of the federal government has
boosted its predictions for this harvest by 2.3 million tons from
32.2 million tons, and that is also four million tons up on the
previous high in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production for 1996-97 was forecast at 23.5 million tons,
up marginally from earlier expectations, following an increase in
both plantings and yields.
</P>
<P>
The Grains Council of Australian (GCA) said the record
production would inject around seven billion Australian dollars
(5.40 billion US dollars) into the Australian economy over the
next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"For an industry that has been devastated by years of drought,
mouse plagues, frosts, low commodity prices and high interest
rates, growers have finally received the confidence boost they
need to reinvest in their industry," GCA said.
</P>
<P>
According to ABARE, major summer irrigated crops, cotton and
rice, were expected to be particularly bountiful in 1996-97, with
production expected to exceed previous records by 10 and 28
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Plans Package of Incentives for Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Senator Sartaj
Aziz said today that a new incentive package for offshore
exploration was being planned to attract oil exploration companies
to country's vast coastal prospective areas.
</P>
<P>
"The basic strategy of the Nawaz Sharif government will remain
to attract foreign private capital and exploit this potential
fully as quickly as possible by facilitating the process and
improving the market conditions," Aziz, secretary general of
Pakistan Muslim League (N), said while addressing the "Pakistan
Oil and Gas Summit 1997."
</P>
<P>
He said the present government would construct massive
infrastructure at Gawadar for a free port and hoped it would help
increase trade with Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to revive industrial sector in a very short time," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government plans to provide a framework to assist
the industry so as to solve problems concerning duties and taxes,
access to the prospective areas, weaknesses in infrastructure,
procedural delays and difficulties in accessing technical data.
</P>
<P>
The former finance minister said oil and gas industry of
Pakistan has remained a cornerstone of his party's economic
strategies.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the summit, the third major event on the subject of
promoting private participation in the petroleum sector of
Pakistan, would result in further improvement in the government's
policies and more importantly in promoting the opportunities for
investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector has taken the lead in the current
conference while the earlier two conferences were convened by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite indicative of the changing scenario in which the
private sector is to play the major role in the industrial
development in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He voiced the confidence that the three-day conference will
provide a much needed platform for promoting understanding between
the private investors and the key figures of the government, which
would ultimately culminate in practical business in the days to
come.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Reiterates Stand on Relations with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today reiterated
that easing of relations with Iraq was out of the question
as Baghdad still refused to set free the 620 Kuwaiti
Prisoners of War (POWs) it said still jailed in Iraqi
prisons.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuwait indicated that ties with other countries that
supported Iraq during the Gulf War would be back on track.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Sulaiman Majed
Al-Shahin, on the eve of the six anniversary of Kuwaiti liberation
from the seven-month Iraqi occupation on February 26, said that the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait should not be treated lightly and
its consequences could not fall under the saying "let bygones
be bygones."
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that "things must be put right
and matters should settle down under just principles."
</P>
<P>
Shahin said that Iraq should treat the question of the
Kuwaiti detainees from a humanitarian angle without exploiting
for in political ends.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should be committed to releasing all information about
the POWs, he said, the Iraqi claims that it holds no prisoners shows
it has no intention to cooperate on this humanitarian issue.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been insisting that all the POWs detained by
Baghdad be released. But Iraq claimed it has no information
about the persons still missing.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said the Kuwaitis arrested during the occupation were
taken to jails in the southern city of Basra. But these jails
were overrun during the Shiite Muslim uprising that raged in the
months after the Gulf War and all trace of them vanished.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi and Kuwaiti officials sit down together three or four
times a year in Geneva and every month on the Kuwaiti-Iraq
border to try to uncover the fate of those still missing,
but progress has been very slow.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has offered to normalize ties with other Gulf Arab states,
which have been strained since Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. Oman and Qatar have improved ties with Baghdad but others
such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reject direct dealings with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shahin said that "Iraq remains an aggressive and
hostile element which undermines stability. Kuwait is a victim
and, like other countries, must preserve and protect its
security and stability with every available means."
</P>
<P>
Regarding relations with other countries that stood on the
side of Iraq during the Gulf War, Al-Shahin said that
"Kuwait has not severed relations with any of the countries
which backed Iraq during the invasion and our job is to
neutralize their policies and win their support."
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have not been interrupted with Jordan and
there is an honest desire to put the relations back on track, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On ties with Sudan, he said Kuwait has maintained relations with
Khartoum at the level of Charge D'affaires.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that ties with Yemen might also be improved
although he expressed regret that the country was the only one in
the then U.N. Security Council to take a different stand from
other council members during the occupation.

NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Indian Union Minister for
Civil Aviation C.M. Ibrahim said today the government would soon
come out with a new policy to invite private sector participation
in providing infrastructure at airports in the country.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at the upper house of parliament,
Ibrahim said the government intended to upgrade the infrastructure
at airports to boost trade and commerce and tourism.
</P>
<P>
With economic reforms deepening in the country, more and more
facilities are needed at airports. Previously all airport projects
were reserved for the public sector, which is not able to cope
with the new situation.
</P>
<P>
Congestions at airports have become more serious day by day.
Economic experts and industrialists have time and again asked the
government to allow the private sector's participation in
providing infrastructure at airports in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that practical steps
are needed to carry out the decisions of the Manila meeting
between Chinese and Japanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark during a meeting with Japan's former
Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi, who is on a good-will
visit at the invitation of the China-Japan Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese and Japanese peoples should carry on
their friendship from generation to generation, which is a
conclusion drawn from history.
</P>
<P>
He added that the key to this goal is to face history properly,
draw lessons from it and educate the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has made
speeches on many occasions making it clear that Japan attaches
importance to developing its relations with China. The Chinese
government welcomed his stance, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that he regarded it as a must that the two countries
carry out the decisions agreed upon by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and the Japanese prime minister through concrete measures.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries are important to each other, Qian
held, but their ties bear more than bilateral significance. He
expressed the hope that the two countries would view and develop
their ties from a long-term and strategic perspective.
</P>
<P>
"As 1997 is the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese relations," he said, "we hope the two governments
and peoples will make concerted efforts to nurture a healthy,
stable friendship."
</P>
<P>
Qian also thanked Ouchi for his condolences over the death of
Deng Xiaoping. Qian said the Chinese people will turn grief into
strength and continue to take the path of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics that was initiated by Deng.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK People Continue To Mourn for Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- At 10:00 am today, dozens of
ships cruising in Victoria Harbor of Hong Kong simultaneously
sounded their sirens for one minute in tribute to the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away last Wednesday at the age
of 93.
</P>
<P>
When the memorial meeting attended by 10,000 people in Beijing
began at 10:00 a.m., Hong Kong residents mourned in various forms
for Deng Xiaoping, whose concept of "one country, two systems" has
made it possible that Hong Kong will continue to prosper after its
return to the motherland in the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
In memory of Deng, all public transport means made their own
arrangements today: on the streets of Hong Kong all the 800 buses
run by the China Motor Bus were decorated with white flowers and
black ribbons; funeral music resounded for 10 minutes in all 38
underground railway stations; trains running between Kowloon and
Canton blew their horns; and the Peak Tram suspended its services
for one minute.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many schools on the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon,
including Pui Kiu Middle School, Hon Wah Middle School, Heung To
Middle School, Fukien Middle School and Mong Kok Workers' Children
School, held memorial meetings this morning to mourn the death of
Deng.
</P>
<P>
In Heung To Middle School, more than 1,000 students and
teachers gathered this morning in a memorial meeting held at the
school's meeting hall, which was solemnly decorated with a large
portrait of Deng on the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m. when the memorial meeting began, all the people
present stood in silent tribute for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Headmaster of the school Yeung Yiu-chung said in his speech
that Deng devised the great concept of "one country, two systems,"
which is in accordance with the Hong Kong people's interests and
has won the Hong Kong people's support. The Hong Kong people will
always cherish the memory of him.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regret that Deng Xiaoping could not fulfill his wish
to set foot on the land of Hong Kong at the returning day. We
believe that the best way to commemorate the great man is to
realize Hong Kong's smooth transition, ensure its stability and
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of all students in the school, a student
representative said: "Beloved Deng Xiaoping devoted his whole life
to the motherland and the nation. Whenever we see our motherland
is progressing ever stronger and people's living standards
constantly improving, we will recall his great deeds."
</P>
<P>
He called on his school mates to study diligently so as to make
greater contributions to the motherland, pledging to do their best
to live up to Deng's expectations.
</P>
<P>
While watching live TV broadcast of the memorial meeting in
Beijing at 10:00 a.m., many students and teachers here shed tears.
</P>
<P>
At the Workers' Club of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade
Unions, more than 350 workers' representatives stood for a whole
hour to watch live TV broadcast of the memorial meeting in
Beijing, while tens of thousands of members of the Federation also
watched the broadcast at its branch offices.
</P>
<P>
"He has done so much for the Chinese people, so much for Hong
Kong, we should pay our most sincere respects to him," a worker
said.
</P>
<P>
Many other social groups and organizations also held memorial
meetings this morning. These include Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of
Commerce, New Territory Federation of Societies, Bank of China
Group, Hong Kong China Importers' and Exporters' Association and
Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Joint Publishing (HK) Co. Ltd issued portraits and badges of
Deng today, attracting thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days more than 45,000 people went to the
mourning hall at the office building of the Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch to offer their condolences, with more than 1,200
wreaths sent there in memory of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Zhang
Junsheng said that the mourning activities in Hong Kong fully
showed the Hong Kong people's understanding of Deng's great deeds
and contributions and their respects for him.

MADRID, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Bilardo, who led

struggling Sevilla less than a month after he took over at the
Spanish first division club.

<HEADLINE> Number of Poor People Drops in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Only 4.5 percent or nine
million of Indonesia's 200 million population is poor, down by
about 7.5 percent from 22 million registered at the end of the 5th
five-year Development Plan period (1989-1994), Antara news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of implementing the underdeveloped village
assistance program, the drive to build prosperous families, and
the loan to help the poor start small businesses, Secretary to the
Coordinating minister for people's welfare Suyono Yahya told a
meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yahya said that according to a census by the Central Bureau of
Statistics in 1996, the drop in the number of poor people is also
due to an equal distribution of health services, education,
infrastructure and facilities.
</P>
<P>
A person is said to live below the poverty line if he consumes
food containing less than 2,100 calories a day, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a family is also considered poor if it has four
children and the head of the family only earns a monthly gross
income of 300,000 rupiah (about 130 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the government has set a target that by the end of the
7th five-year Development Plan (1999-2004), the number of poor
Indonesians shall have dropped to zero.

<HEADLINE> China, Portugal Encourage More Exchanges Between Congresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met here
today with visiting Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio arrived in Beijing on February 23 for a state visit to
China. During his meetings with Chinese leaders he several times
expressed his condolences over the death of Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation, Qiao said, "A solemn memorial
meeting for Comrade Deng Xiaoping was held at the Great Hall of
the People this morning. The Chinese people are determined to turn
grief into strength and continue to unswervingly follow the road
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which was
initiated by Comrade Deng."
</P>
<P>
Qiao welcomed Sampaio's state visit to China. He said that
since the establishment of Sino-Portuguese diplomatic relations in
1979, the two countries have developed friendly cooperative
relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
There has been good cooperation between the NPC and the
Parliament of Portugal, Qiao said, adding that the visit by the
president of the Portuguese Parliament to China in 1988 and the
visit by NPC leaders to Portugal have played an active role in
enhancing the development of bilateral relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC is willing to keep and strengthen its
friendly cooperation with the Parliament of Portugal in an effort
to further develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio noted that he was visiting China at an important
moment. He said he hoped that the current visit would help make
Portuguese-Chinese ties more secure.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Parliament of Portugal maintains a good
relationship with the NPC." According to Sampaio, his entourage
includes senior Portuguese parliamentarians, who appreciate the
NPC's efforts to improve China's legal system, are very interested
in obtaining more knowledge about the NPC and expect more
exchanges between the two congresses.
</P>
<P>
As for the issue of Macao, Qiao said that, based on the idea of
"one country, two systems," the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration
on the Macao issue was signed in 1987, which sets a good example
for the whole world for the settlement of problems left over from
history through peaceful negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The NPC passed the basic law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) in 1993, defining China's basic
policy of carrying out the policy of "one country, two systems" in
Macao in the form of legal provisions.
</P>
<P>
After China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty
over Macao, the NPC will support the implementation of the policy
of "one country, two systems" in the MSAR, Qiao noted. It will
also honor its commitment in the joint declaration of implementing
the MSAR basic law and realizing a "high degree of autonomy" and
"Macao people governing Macao," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said he was glad to see that the Portuguese-Chinese
joint declaration and the MSAR basic law have high legal status in
China. He added that he has great confidence in Macao's stable
transition and a "high degree of autonomy" in Macao after its
return to its motherland.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Jihad Refuses to Participate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Jihad Movement
has refused to give a positive response to a call made by
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for a national dialogue
scheduled to take place on February 27 in Nablus, JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem, reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a communique addressing the Palestinian people, the
movement complained that "it is impossible for Palestinian
political forces to take part in the national dialogue while many
of their innocent cadres are still locked in the authorities'
prisons due to unjust rules and without trial."
</P>
<P>
The movement also accused the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) of "complying to enemy and responding to its demands for
declaring war against the Islamic and national forces which
insist on struggle against the (enemy) occupation."
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued from Jerusalem and dated on February
24, added that the Islamic Jihad welcomes a dialogue based on
"resisting occupation and not complying or cooperating with it."
</P>
<P>
The movement suggested that the national dialogue be aimed at
uniting Palestinians to confront Israeli schemes of Judaizing
Jerusalem and establishing Jewish settlements. It said that the
national dialogue should not coincide with further negotiations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There is no meaning and use to initiate a dialogue if it
rests on wreckage of the Palestinian legitimate right to
struggle against occupation," the movement declared.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the Israeli authorities following a wave
of suicide bombing attacks in February and March last year, the
PNA carried out a crackdown on the Islamic Jihad group and the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of their activists were arrested and many of them are
still in jails.

their rights and set up an independent state.

"Let the soul of the deceased sleep quietly, and let the great
people of China boast the achievements of their unique leader who
heightened the standing of his country and built up castles of
friendship with peace-loving nations of the world," Kadoumy
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unhappy Over French Minister's Decision to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel has lodged an
official complaint with France over Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette's shortened itinerary in Israel, the Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that de Charette originally promised to make
an extended visit to Israel next week, but rescheduled only a
one-day stop.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials were quoted as saying that during a private
visit to France last month, Foreign Minister David Levy believed
that he had secured a commitment from de Charette to visit for two
or three days,in an attempt to erase misunderstandings left over
from last fall's visit by President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chirac pushed an Israeli bodyguard, and
spoke in the Palestinian Legislative Council in favor of
Palestinian control of East Jerusalem. Moreover, in the original
program, Chirac was to spend virtually no time at the Western
Wall, while spending time at other religious shrines in the
Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, when Levy became aware last week that de Charette
would only visit Israel and Palestinian territory for a day
during a March 4-6 regional swing also involving Syria and
Lebanon, "he flew into a rage," a Foreign Ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
Levy insisted that the Foreign Ministry summon French
Ambassador Jean Noel de Lacoste to complain.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ambassador to France Avi Pazner filed a similar
complaint with the French Foreign Ministry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said De Lacoste was
summoned last week to the ministry, where "we expressed our
discontent over changes in the program for the visit."
</P>
<P>
Palmor said Paris had originally promised "a full state visit
of two or three days." "We don't mind what he does in
the region once he is here, but instead of dedicating two or
three days to Israel on a full-scale visit, he will be here
for a 24-hour visit which will include a visit to the
Palestinian Authority," Palmor added.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should beg de Charette to visit," one
official said bitterly. "He can stay home. However as Levy
became personally offended, the Foreign Ministry has decided to
file a complaint."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Israel and France have grown sour since the
right-wing Likud Party came to power in elections last
May. France has wanted a bigger say in the peace process, but
Israel has replied no way arguing that France has leaned to the
Arabs too much in its position regarding the peace process.

<HEADLINE> German Business Suffers From Office Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- German business losts 3 to 20
billion U.S. dollars a year because of office theft, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The losses are still expected to rise by 25 percent by the end
of the century, Manfred Lotze of the German Detective Federation
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that in 1995, shoplifting caused about
6-billion-dollar inventory losses, 25 percent of which were due to
theft by employees.
</P>
<P>
Traders are constantly up against shoplifting, but many bosses
have been found wary of taking any legal action against the
culprits for fear of frightening business partners, customers and
banks.
</P>
<P>
Employees often take home company property, such as pencils or
a stapler, spontaneously or without much thought, but often too,
the thieving is methodical and well-organized and many employees
appear to enjoy the risk of taking things from work.
</P>
<P>
Lotze, head of one of Germany's largest trade detective
agencies, said that in one case his agency found the chief of the
repairs department at an engineering firm taking home components
which he then put together at home and gave the final machine
products to his father-in-law, a market trader, to sell.
</P>
<P>
In another case, warehouse goods were found shipped abroad.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that office theft often starts with making
private telephone calls at work, and a survey showed that three
out of every four employees make private calls in company time.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Mourns Deng's Passing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, will publish an editorial tomorrow lamenting the
passing of Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the editorial, entitled "Recalling
Contributions, Inheriting the Legacy, and Jointly Accomplishing
the Great Cause", is as follows:
</P>
<P>
Our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping passed away on February 19,
1997, leaving the entire Chinese nation in a state of profound
grief. The Party, the Army, and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout China, struck by a sense of deep sorrow, have expressed
their heartfelt mourning.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng was an outstanding leader whose great prestige was
acknowledged by the whole Party, Army, and people of all ethnic
groups throughout China. He was a great Marxist, a great
proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist and
a diplomat, and a long tested communist fighter, the chief
architect of China's socialist reforms, opening-up, and
modernization drive, and the founder of the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In his revolutionary career of over seven decades, Deng made an
indelible historic contribution to the liberation and happiness of
the Chinese people, to the independence and prosperity of the
Chinese nation, and to the peace and progress of the world,
leaving us with an exceedingly rich and valuable spiritual legacy.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping was a great man of the century with
outstanding exploits. His passing represents an immeasurable loss
to the Communist Party of China and to the Chinese people, and his
great name will go down in Chinese history and in world history as
well.

<P>
The great life of Comrade Deng Xiaoping spanned the entire 20th
century as a magnificent epic, a painted scroll of splendid sweep,
and a movement of resounding music. His great achievements, his
scientific theories, his revolutionary style, and his grand
trans-century blueprint, will never be forgotten by the Communist
Party of China or the Chinese people and, will forever inspire and
encourage us to advance bravely in fulfiling the great
expectations of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
We will never forget Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great
achievements. In the long years of revolutionary wars, Comrade
Deng was repeatedly entrusted with important missions, and with no
fear for hardship or danger, he fought bravely and performed
immortal feats for the founding of New China. In the early years
of New China, he worked effectively for the establishment of the
socialist system and for the development of socialist
construction. During the "Cultural Revolution", he firmly upheld
truths and fought against the "Gang of Four" unswervingly.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee in
particular, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who was more than 70 then,
added the most glorious chapter to his life. With a dauntless
revolutionary spirit, he launched the drive to rectify the chaos
of the time and bravely re-established the ideological line of
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, leading the
Party and the whole nation to a historic change and opening a new
historical period of reforms, opening-up, and focusing on the
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 years, China's economic development has seen
achievements that have attracted worldwide attention, and its
national strength has gained marked growth, with the people's
standard of living improving significantly, the country's outlook
undergoing profound changes. In this, socialist China has shown
great vitality and vigor and, internationally its status has risen
to unprecedented heights. With the guidance of an outstanding
leader with political vision like Comrade Deng Xiaoping, our Party
and our country have left behind the disasters of the "Cultural
Revolution", avoided falling into a new period of chaos and
confusion, and successfully embarked onto a road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. This has been the good
fortune and pride of the Chinese Communist Party and of the
Chinese people.

<P>
We shall forever remember Comrade Deng's great theories. He
combined the basic principles of Marxism and Leninism with the
reality of the contemporary China, beginning the process of
reforms and opening up, and the socialist modernization drive,
under new historical conditions.
</P>
<P>
By summing up the experience, the successes, and the setbacks
in our country's socialist construction and learning from other
socialist countries' experience, he developed Mao Zedong Thought,
grasping the essence of socialism scientifically, and for the
first time, answering a series of questions in a systematic way
about how to consolidate and develop socialism in a country like
China with a relatively backward economy and culture, after the
proletariat seized state power.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng was a great theorist, and the theory he developed
was significant in the annals of the development of Marxism. All
the successes of our country in reforms and opening-up were
achieved under the guidance of his theory.
</P>
<P>
Practical experience has proved that the theory conforms to
the reality of the initial stage of socialism in our country, and
possesses great vitality. We must hold high the banner of this great
theory to achieve our goals for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Deng's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the guiding principle for the Communist Party
of China, and the spiritual support for the Chinese nation and
Marxism in contemporary China.

We shall cherish the memory of Comrade Deng's great strength of
character. He was unceasingly loyal to the Party, the nation and
the people. He said: "My life belongs to the Party, to the
country," and "I am the son of the Chinese people. I love my
motherland and my people deeply."
</P>
<P>
Precisely because of this, he showed great respect for the
people, serving them with all his heart, and always paying close
attention to their interests and aspirations. He always considered
whether something would boost the productive forces of the
socialist society, enhance the country's comprehensive national
strength, and improve people's standard of living as both the
starting point and the goal in formulating principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
Precisely because of this, he valued practice, sought truth
from facts, was good at feeling the pulse of the times and using
opportunities for development. He always tried to sum up fresh
experience, create new methods and look for new ways based on
China's reality and developments of the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he was far-sighted, broad-minded, selfless,
and dauntless, unyielding, heedless of personal safety, and of
personal ups and downs. He always took the entire situation into
account, observing and tackling major issues by keeping in mind
the fundamental interests of the nation and the people.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he had firm beliefs and a strong will, was
pragmatic, and made scientific decisions at crucial moments, which
demonstrated his extraordinary courage and insight.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with his lofty and distinct
revolutionary style, will forever be the model for Chinese
Communists.

BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of South Korea's

condolences over the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In the message to his Chinese counterpart, Qiao Shi, Kim said

We shall forever cherish the memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's
great ideals. Comrade Deng was a devoted Communist. He showed
great foresight, and possessed a scientific and creative mind.
</P>
<P>
Combining his lofty ideals with the reality of the initial
stage of socialism in our country, he proposed the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, drew up a
blueprint for revitalizing the Chinese nation, and a three-step
development strategy of turning our poor country into a strong and
prosperous nation.
</P>
<P>
According to that strategy, the Chinese people will be
comfortably well-off by the end of the century, and will reach the
standard of living of certain developed nations in the middle of
the next century and be built into a prosperous, democratic,
civilized, and modernized socialist country. This has become a
common ideal for the people of the country's various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng was adept at combining the strictness of
principles with the flexibility of tactics. He developed the idea
of "one country, two systems" as the way to complete the great
cause of national reunification. Propelled by this concept, our
country will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 of this
year, putting an end to more than a century of national
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Comrade Deng expressed his hope to visit
Hong Kong after its return to the motherland. But now, with less
than 130 days to Hong Kong's return, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, to our
great sorrow, has passed away. Although his long-cherished wish is
not to be realized, his legacy certainly will be.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping has parted from us, but his great
theories, ideals, and strength of character will forever
illuminate Chinese people's path of advancement. Under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core, the Chinese people will unswervingly march forward
along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
chartered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, we feel all the more deeply the
broad-mindedness and great foresight of Comrade Deng Xiaoping as a
proletarian revolutionary. He created sufficient conditions for and
played a decisive role in the smooth transition from the second
generation of the central leading collective to the third, with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, which helped maintain the
stability of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has lived up to the people's great
trust and expectations, and is a loyal, reliable, enterprising,
and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the
core has established Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics as the guideline for the entire
Party, and armed the whole Party and educated the cadres and the
people with this theory, thus providing a fundamental guarantee
for adhering to the Party's basic line for 100 years to
come.

In accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories and Party's
basic line, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core analyzed new situations, summed up fresh experience,
and put forth the basic principle of "seizing opportunities,
deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside world, promoting
development, and maintaining stability," which clearly pointed the
way for properly dealing with the relationship among reform,
development and stability, and for ensuring the country's
long-lasting stability and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the
core, by firmly relying on the people and adhering to the Party's
basic line comprehensively, placed equal emphasis on promoting
both ethical and cultural progress and material progress, with
"both hands being strong," while taking economic construction as
the center. It has continuously overcome new difficulties, solved
new problems, and achieved new and important successes in economic
construction and social development. The country now enjoys
political stability, economic development, solidarity of all
ethnic groups, and social progress, and the people are happy.
</P>
<P>
When China scored brilliant successes during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), and reached, ahead of schedule,
the second-phase strategic goal set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the
Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core took
the opportunity to map out the Ninth Five-Year Plan and set the
long-term objectives to the year 2010, and is now making great
strides in leading the people of all ethnic groups across the
country toward the set objectives.

<HEADLINE> HK Students Mourn for Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 students and
teachers of Heung To Middle School on the Hong Kong Island
gathered together this morning in a memorial meeting to mourn over
the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The memorial meeting was held at the school's meeting hall,
which was solemnly decorated with a large portrait of Deng on the
rostrum.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 a.m. when the memorial meeting began, all the people
present stood in silent tribute for three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Headmaster of the school Yeung Yiu-chung said in his speech
that Deng was the architect of China's reform and opening-up
policy and modernization drive. Under his leadership, China's
comprehensive national strength was reinforced and people's living
standards improved, he added.
</P>
<P>
"He is also the inventor of the great concept of 'one country
two systems,' which is in accordance with the Hong Kong people's
interests and has won the Hong Kong people's support, we Hong Kong
people will never forget him," Yeung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are only 126 days left before Hong Kong
returns to the motherland. The Preparatory Committee, the Chief
Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council are carrying out
various tasks for forming the Special Administrative Region
government in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
"We regret very much that Deng Xiaoping could not fulfill his
wish to step on the land of Hong Kong at the returning day. We
believe that the best way to commemorate the great man is to
realize Hong Kong's smooth transition, ensure its stability and
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of all the students in the school, a student
representative said: "Beloved Deng Xiaoping devoted his whole life
to the motherland and the nation, whenever we see our motherland
is progressing ever stronger and people's living standards
constantly improving, we will recall his great deeds."
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping has passed away, but his spirit of 'seeking
truth from reality' and his noble personality will stay in our
heart forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on his school mates to study diligently and
contribute to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We'll never let Deng's expectations down," he said.
</P>
<P>
At 10:00 a.m. the students and teachers watched live TV
broadcast of the 10,000-people memorial meeting in Beijing. Many
of them shed tears.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many other schools in Hong Kong, such as Pui Kiu
Middle School and Hon Wah Middle School, also held memorial
meetings this morning for teachers and students to mourn for
Deng.

<HEADLINE> Blazes Threat to HK's Old Office Buildings: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Every one in three
commercial buildings in Hong Kong is at huge fire risk, according
to a government study released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Buildings Department study revealed that fire is likely to
erupt in one third of the local commercial buildings, in a quarter
of the industrial and a fifth of the residential blocks and other
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed the number of buildings deteriorating into
potential fire traps was swelling by 1,000 every year.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department urged that urgent action was needed
to alert owners to the dangers, particularly in the pre-1975
commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
The most common dangers included fire doors being left open,
substitute materials being used for fire doors, locked emergency
exits and alterations to fire escape routes.
</P>
<P>
A blaze in a commercial building in Yau Ma Tei in November last
year, which was believed to be the worst over the past century in
Hong Kong, killed 39 people and injured 81. And 17 people died in
a karaoke bar blaze in Tsim Sha Tsui last month.

<HEADLINE> Improving Supply of Commercial Energy Key to Pak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's President Farooq
Leghari said here today that improving the supply of commercial
energy at an affordable rate is the key to the country's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The government should make great efforts to narrow the gap
between reserves and estimated potential by exploiting the proven
reserves fully, said Leghari when inaugurating a three-day oil and
gas summit here.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan Oil and Gas Summit 97" was organized by the Ministry
of Petroleum and Natural Resources in cooperation with a number of
oil and gas companies including Shell Pakistan Ltd. and United
Meridian International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Leghari said, is gifted with enormous resources which
need to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt in my mind about the bright future that awaits
Pakistan when its vast resources of men and material are fully
mobilized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan spends a very large portion of its foreign exchange
earnings on the import of oil and it imported 2 billion U.S.
dollars' worth of oil in fiscal 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The sum accounted for 23 percent of the country's export
earnings in the fiscal year and it will further go up in view of
the increasing energy needs, Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The country, he noted, was recently able to revive the
confidence of the oil and gas industry by restoring the duty and
tax concessions which were earlier allowed under the Concession
Agreements executed prior to June 13, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the decision would convey a clear message to the
international community that the country is not only serious but
also sufficiently flexible in adjusting to market needs and
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The president said that although exploration of oil and gas
started in this part of the world about 140 years ago, Pakistan
has so far drilled fewer than 500 exploratory wells with a success
rate of one discovery in every four exploratory wells.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that by harnessing the breakthroughs in technology,
such as three-dimensional seismic exploration techniques, Pakistan
would be able to discover larger deposits of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that since 1947 governments had not paid
sufficient attention to developing the country's human and
material resources.
</P>
<P>
This is the reason that Pakistan had not been able to realize
its potential and lagged behind even those countries which
achieved independence after it, he said. Now Pakistan has to make
up for the deficiencies in the past.
</P>
<P>
Leghari urged countries in the region to cooperate in putting
up joint importation proposals and thus help them obtain benefits
of large-scale economy and optional routing of pipelines.
</P>
<P>
A large gas market in Pakistan and in its neighboring countries
would create attractive opportunities for regional projects
leading to a "win-win situation for gas producers, pipeline
sponsors and end users," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 delegates from 28 countries are participating in
the international meeting, the third since 1988.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Pakistan currently consumes 120 million
barrels of oil per annum and demand will rise by 50 percent in the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan targets to double its oil production to 120,000
barrels a day by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Seek for 400,000 Vietnamese MIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will make efforts to
seek for 400,000 Vietnamese soldiers missing in action during the
Vietnam War, the local press today quoted Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The remains of all Vietnamese soldiers who died either in
Vietnam or abroad should be recovered and buried in Vietnam's war
cemeteries," said the prime minister when meeting with senior
officials of the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social
Affairs in Hanoi last week.
</P>
<P>
He told the officials that they were responsible for recovering
all the remains of the martyrs for reburial in the war cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
An interim report by the ministry showed that Vietnam lost more
than 1 million soldiers and 2 million civilians in the war of
resistance against the Americans between 1954 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued by the ministry late last year after two
years of surveys put the number of missing Vietnamese soldiers at
400,000.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said a lack of information and changes of
battlefield landscapes had made it almost impossible to trace even
the graves of fallen combatants who had been buried by their
comrades-in-arms.

<HEADLINE> Wife of Top Ugandan Rebel Commander Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- One of the wives of a top
rebel commander in northern Uganda surrendered to the government
troops, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The name of the woman was withheld for security reason, "The
New Vision" said in its report. Her husband, the self-styled
Colonel Alex Otti Lagoni, is commanding one of the three
remaining groups of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
The woman surrendered with other 15 LRA rebels with their arms
to the government troops in northern Kitgum District.
</P>
<P>
Alex Otti Lagoni was wounded in a battle recently and
reportedly refused to return to LRA's bases in southern Sudan as
LRA leader Joseph Kony asked. The commander is nursing his wounds
in northern bushes.
</P>
<P>
The rebel LRA had 13 groups and more than 2,000 rebels earlier
last year. But now, it has only three groups operating in northern
Uganda and only hundreds of rebels. Most of its members were
killed or surrendered. enditem

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister to Visit Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh is scheduled to arrive here Thursday for a
two-day official visit to Malaysia, it was officially announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit which is part of his tour of countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Chavalit, who
assumed the post in December last year, will hold discussions with
his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, on bilateral and
regional matters, a Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister will be granted an audience by Supreme
Head of State Tuanku Ja'afar.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, to be accompanied by a 42-member delegation, is also
scheduled to meet representatives of the Malaysian private sector
to discuss investment opportunities in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Both Malaysia and Thailand are ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's newly-appointed ambassador to Malaysia,
Suchitra Hiranprueck, said in an interview with Malaysia's
official news agency Bernama that Chavalit's visit would also be
an opportunity for leaders of both sides to look into ways to
resolve a few existing problems including those involving the
common border.
</P>
<P>
The discussions are also expected to center on better trade and
investment promotion between the two countries, Suchitra, who
assumed her post here on February 20, said. "Although we are
neighbors," she added, "I think our trade and economic relations
have not been so extensive. There's still room for improvement."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is Thailand's second largest trading partner in the
ASEAN whose members also include Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, the
Philippines and Vietnam. But the total value of their trade is
still small, accounting for only 4 percent of Thailand's total
global trade in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade stood at 13.075 billion ringgit (about 5.23
billion U.S. dollars) from January to November last year, of which
Thailand's exports to Malaysia were 4.631 billion ringgit (about
1.85 billion dollars) against its imports of 8.444 billion ringgit
(about 3.38 billion dollars) from Malaysia, according to
preliminary figures available.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Bobsleigh Teams Stripped of Medals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- World bobsleigh governing body
on Tuesday confirmed the disqualification of three Swiss teams
that won world championship medals using illegal axles on their
machines.
</P>
<P>
The International Bobsleigh Federation (FIBT) carried out
technical checks at the end of the four-men race at the world
championships on February 2 at St Moritz, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
They disqualified the Switzerland 1, 2 and 3 teams piloted by
Marcel Rohner, Reto Goetschi and Christian Reich -- as they found
breaches of international rules on the front axles of all three
sleds and the rear axle of Rohner's sled.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss federation appealed against the first such
disqualification at the world championships in the 73 years of
competition. This meant medals were not immediately awarded to
eventual winners and runners-up, Germany 1 and 2, piloted by
veteran Wolfgang Poppe and Dirk Wiese, and bronze medallists the
United States, driven by Brian Shimer.
</P>
<P>
The FIBT asked its material commission to review the
information and confirm or reconsider its report.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Broadcasters Confederation Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian National
Broadcasters Association (MNBA) today proposed the formation of an
ASEAN Broadcasters Confederation (ABC).
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by MNBA President Ismail Mustapa in his
paper presented at the five-day ASEAN Broadcasters Conference
which opened in Langkawi, a tourist resort island in the north of
Malaysia, according to the Malaysian news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said the spirit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has permeated to all strata of society but is
somewhat subdued among broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
"The police have got their cooperative effort going very
strongly now, the same thing with the customs, the travel and tour
operators, the doctors, the engineers, journalists... What about
us, the broadcasters? We are supposed to be the master of the
airwaves. Are we devoid of the ASEAN spirit of cooperation?" he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The conference, being attended by about 100 broadcasters from
the seven ASEAN countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam -- and Myanmar,
was likely to discuss important points such as leadership and
articles of instruments for the formation of the ABC, Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
The conference would also discuss subjects related to
collaboration in training, exchange of programs and personnel,
research and development and censorship.

<HEADLINE> Senior S. Korean Presidential Secretaries Intend to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- All senior South Korean
presidential secretaries, including Chief Presidential Secretary
Kim Kwang-il, expressed their intention today to quit their posts
"for their failure to serve their chief executive well."
</P>
<P>
The 12 officials told President Kim Young-sam of their intent
at a luncheon meeting following Kim's nationally-televised speech
earlier in the day apologizing to the public for Hanbo Business
Group's bribe-for-loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kim Kwang-il said that he and his colleagues are stepping down
"as we are totally responsible for not properly assisting the
president," according to Presidential Spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ruling New Korea Party (NKP) Chairman Lee Hong-koo
and other key NKP officials also expressed their intention today
to resign from their posts to President Kim.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung and the
entire cabinet are expected to tender their resignations later
this week, according to an official at the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
In his speech today, President Kim, marking the fourth
anniversary of his presidency, revealed his plan to conduct a
reshuffle of his presidential staff, the ruling party leadership
and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kim publicly apologized to the nation for the Hanbo loan
scandal, saying that he assumes responsibility for the scandal in
which his close aides are also involved.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo loan scandal surfaced following the bankrupcy of
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, the flagship firm of South Korea's
14th largest group Hanbo Business Group, on January 23 after
failing to honor billions of U.S. dollars in notes.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Hanbo Business Group General Chairman
Chung Tae-soo used huge amounts of money to bribe important
figures in the process of financing his pet project to build
Tangin Steel Mill in South Korea's South Chungchong Province.
</P>
<P>
So Far, 10 people, including three legislators of the ruling
party, one legislator of the main opposition National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP), and one minister, have been indicted by the
prosecution for graft or influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who was also indicted on fraud and embezzlement charges,
had secured six billion U.S. dollars in bank loans between 1992
and 1996 without sufficient collateral for his Hanbo Iron and
Steel Company.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deploys F-18 Fighters in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
started deploying F-18 fighter jets in Kuwait to replace eight
radar-evading F-117a Stealth bombers, Kuwaiti military sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the bombers dispatched to Kuwait last
year as a safeguard against what it figured as a possible Iraqi
attack were being pulled out and the first of a batch of advanced
F-18 fighters had already arrived, but no figure of how many F-18
fighters would be deployed here is available.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk also will be leaving the
Gulf soon. It would be replaced by about 30 F-15 and F-16
fighters that began arriving in Qatar from the United States as
part of an air expeditionary force, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The rotation coincides with the deployment of an armored
battalion in Kuwait for three months of training. About 1,200
U.S. troops have arrived in Kuwait to take part in routine
exercises with the Kuwaiti military. The soldiers are now
training at the Udairi desert range, some 50 kilometers from the
Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. usually rotates a troop battalion through Kuwait
since 1994 when tension was intensified here following Iraqi
troop's movement in the south near Kuwaiti border. The troops
use equipment stockpiled at Camp Doha, 25 kilometers to the west
of Kuwait City, to conduct regular training exercises with the
Kuwaiti forces.
</P>
<P>
This time, the troops will take part in a series of
exercises, codenamed Intrinsic Action 97, which will last four
months and include live fire training and joint maneuvers with
the Kuwaiti army, U.S. army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
Nickerson said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed defense pacts with the United States, Britain
and France after the Gulf War and Kuwaiti military forces
regularly holds exercises with forces from the three western
countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait Ryan Crocker renewed U.S. commitment
Sunday to Kuwait's security and stability against any outside
threat.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement on Kuwait's Independence and
Liberation days, observed today and Wednesday, that "we will
continue to maintain a strong U.S. presence in the region in
order to deter Saddam (Hussain)."
</P>
<P>
"As long as Kuwait feels the need for support, we will
provide it," Crocker said.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Spy for Kremlin Exposed to Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A spy, who worked for
Kremlin and is serving a 15-year sentence in Israel, was exposed
Tuesday night to the public after the Israeli Supreme Court lifted
a ban on publication of the affair.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that the ban was lifted at the
state's request so the case could serve as a precedent in
determining heavy sentences for espionage.
</P>
<P>
Roman Weisfeld, 55, who sent Israel's secrets by Morse code to
the National Security Committee of the former Soviet Union, or the
KGB, was recruited by the KGB in 1976 with the purpose of making
aliya (immigration) in order to collect military and political
information about Israel.
</P>
<P>
He underwent a period of training in various espionage
techniques and in 1980 was sent on his mission to collect
information about Israel's relations with Arab states, the United
States, and the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In return, Weisfeld received large sums of money and was
promised an apartment in the Commonwealth of the Independent
States (CIS) if he wished to return.
</P>
<P>
Weisfeld, an electrical engineer, found himself a job with
the Elco company in Haifa in northern Israel, a job which
eventually gained him access to one of Israel's main air bases.
</P>
<P>
He succeeded in having maintained contact with his operators
in the KGB for five years with the use of Morse code.
</P>
<P>
In November 1985, Weisfeld went to Vienna, Austria, where he
met one of his operators, from whom he received 3,000
U.S. dollars as well as more sophisticated equipment.
</P>
<P>
It was after this visit that Weisfeld began his work as a
company representative on the air base, where he was able to
collect data on the types and movements of aircraft, and
information of the organization of the squadrons, and the storage
of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
This continued for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
In April 1988, Weisfeld was instructed to meet his operator
again in Europe, this time in Berlin, but there was a hitch and
the meeting did not take place.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, he was arrested, tried, and found guilty
by Israel's Tel Aviv District Court of aggravated espionage, and
was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment, after an appeal to the
Supreme Court was rejected.
</P>
<P>
There have been unconfirmed reports of the arrest of other
new immigrants on suspicion of spying, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Becomes Oil Products Exporter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, traditionally an oil
products importer, has now become an exporter, with a surplus
refining capacity forcing local refiners to export excess output
of oil products.
</P>
<P>
The volume of oil products exported by local refiners reached
an average of 107,619 barrels per day (b/d) or 17.1 million liters
in January, according to a report from the Department of
Commercial Registration of the Thai government available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The top export was high-speed diesel oil, with exports of 40
million liters a day. Gasoline followed at 8.8 million liters per
day, aviation fuel 3.4 million liters per day and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) 400 metric tons per day.
</P>
<P>
The output of the products in January soared 57 percent over
the same period of last year to reach an average of 811,057 b/d.
</P>
<P>
The jump was due largely to the start of operation last year of
two new oil refineries in the country. The two oil refineries are
run by Rayong Refining Co. (RRC) and Star Petroleum Refining Co.
(SPRC).
</P>
<P>
RRC and SPRC, with a crude processing capacity of 145,000 b/d
and 130,000 b/d respectively, have significantly boosted imports
of crude and sharply slashed those of refined products.
</P>
<P>
As a result, imports of finished oil products in January
dropped 71 percent to 43,401 b/d, with those of gasoline plunging
73 percent and diesel 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for oil products in the month increased 8
percent to an average of 720,787 b/d or 114.6 million liters per
day, with consumption of gasoline up 6 percent, diesel oil 17
percent and LPG 12 percent and fuel oil down 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Apologizes for Corruption Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Apologizing for a major loan
scandal, South Korean President Kim Young-sam said today that he
will bar one of his sons from social activities for his alleged
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a televised address on the fourth anniversary of
his inauguration, Kim said that "I, as the president, offer a
sincere apology to the people" over the scandal swirling around
the failed Hanbo Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Steel, the flagship of the Hanbo Group, went bankrupt on
January 23 after racking up 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in debt. The
debt was incurred mostly in government-controlled bank loans,
which Hanbo secured after giving bribes.
</P>
<P>
"What troubles me more is that the name of one of my sons is
talked about in connection with this case," Kim said in his
address.
</P>
<P>
His second son, Hyun-chul, has been accused by opposition
parties of taking huge kickbacks for helping Hanbo buy foreign
equipment and technology with government loans. He was questioned
over the weekend but was later cleared of the suspicion.
</P>
<P>
But the president said that he still felt morally responsible
and will order his son to quit all social activities.
</P>
<P>
The son, aged 38, heads a socially active fraternity group. He
holds no government position but has been criticized by the
opposition for alleged influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors last week also indicted 10 people, including
a Cabinet minister, politicians from the ruling and opposition
parties, top banker and the founder of the Hanbo Group, the
nation's 14th largest conglomerate.

LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
slashed fund to the office of former President Kenneth Kaunda by
219.1 million Kwacha (about 168,500 US Dollars), according to
today's Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The government fund has been reduced to 128.4 million Kwacha
this year from annual 347.5 million Kwacha in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's aide dismissed the reduction as malicious.
</P>
<P>
"Capital expenditure for the office includes three official
cars, an official house and an office. The former president has
received nothing amid claims that he is looked after well,"
Kaunda's Special Assistant Muhabi Lungu was quoted as saying by
the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
An official source said the cut was due to poor economic
performance over the years and current donor squeeze.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
One was inscribed with the words "Eternal Glory to Comrade Deng

various people's organizations, and people from various walks of
life in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
At 9:45, the curtain in the auditorium of the Great Hall of the
People was raised and all present at the service plunged into solemn
silence. Comrade Deng's family members were led to the front of the
hall. Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li

wearing the traditional white paper flowers and black armbands of
mourning, stood in the front row.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Then, whistles on trains, ships, warships, and in factories
across China sounded for three minutes, in tribute to the
venerable leader.
</P>
<P>
After the playing of the national anthem, President Jiang
Zemin, who is general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
spoke to the assembled gathering.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
hailed Comrade Deng Xiaoping as "an outstanding leader whose
immense prestige was recognized by the Party, the army, and the
people of all ethnic groups throughout China."
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng was a great Marxist, a great proletarian
revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat, and a
long-tested Communist fighter, the chief architect of China's
socialist reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive, and the
founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said under the staunch leadership of the Party Central
Committee, the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of
various ethnic groups across China will certainly push forward the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and turn the country into a
socialist and modernized country which is powerful, prosperous,
democratic, and with a high degree of socialist ethics and
cultural development.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee called on the whole Party, the whole
army, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to
turn grief into strength, carry on the behest of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, and express the mourning by working harder and doing
well in all aspects of practical work, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
After Jiang's speech, all present bowed three times to Comrade
Deng to express their feelings of reverence and to honor the
memory of his more than 70-year-long revolutionary career, his
leadership and victory in China's new democratic revolution, the
founding of New China, and the establishment, consolidation and
development of the Chinese cause of socialism.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the memorial meeting was accompanied by the
Internationale. Jiang and the other Chinese leaders shook hands
with Zhuo Lin, Deng's widow, and with his sons and daughters and
expressed their condolences.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's LPG Output Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's production of
processed liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) rose by 23 percent last
year to a daily average of 5,155 metric tons, according to the
Department of Commercial Registration today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to additional LPG production capacity in
three plants, one in the south and two in the east.
</P>
<P>
The higher production exceeded local consumption which stood at
4,634 tons a day last year, allowing 538 tons a day to be exported
to neighboring countries, including Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
This year, domestic LPG demand is expected to rise by 18
percent to a daily average of 5,488 tons, of which 5,128 tons will
be used as fuel, up 20 percent from 1996.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Banking Institute Set up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya School of Monetary
Studies (KSMS) was set up in Nairobi with its focus on the
training of specialist economists for the eastern and southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
The institute established by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
admitted its first group of 600 students last month who are
scheduled to learn, among other things, high level economics,
professional banking, data processing and management courses.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to present the school's prospectus, CBK
Governor Micah Cheserem said that the school is aimed at training
specialist economists to formulate, implement and sustain
policies for economic growth for Kenya and the region as well.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem, who is the school master, noted that resources in
Africa are underutilized because of a shortage of economists who
could formulate electric economic policies.
</P>
<P>
The school will focus sharply on practically-oriented
training, analytical skills and quantitative methods required by
the emerging economies to sustain the current and future economic
reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the first public lecture at the school last week, the
Deputy Director of the CBK, Nzioki Kibua, said that the school
will strive to respond to the lack of specialist economists.
</P>
<P>
The banking school targets financial houses in the region,
government ministries, the public and private sectors, regional
and multinational organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor pointed out that the school will be a
unique one where teaching staff will be hired from resource
persons with practical experience and not full-time staff.
</P>
<P>
The school is expected to be self-sustaining in three years
and no donor funds will be used on the institution.

SEOUL -- Apologizing for a major loan scandal, South Korean
President Kim Young-sam said today that he will bar one of his
sons from social activities for his alleged involvement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a televised address on the fourth anniversary of
his inauguration, Kim said that "I, as the president, offer a
sincere apology to the people" over the scandal swirling around
the failed Hanbo Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Steel, the flagship of the Hanbo Group, went bankrupt on
January 23 after racking up 5.8 billion U.S. dollars in debt. The
debt was incurred mostly in government-controlled bank loans,
which Hanbo secured after giving bribes.
</P>
<P>
"What troubles me more is that the name of one of my sons is
talked about in connection with this case," Kim said in his
address.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Suspends Hearings on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has decided to suspend any scheduled public
hearings on the move to amend the country's 1987 constitution.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Romualdo, chairman of the House Committee on
Constitutional Amendments, said today that it is useless to go on
with any move to amend the charter due to strong opposition from
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
He said the Senate has already signified its firm opposition to
any charter change in a resolution signed by 20 senators.
</P>
<P>
Once the Senate changes its stand, he added, the committee will
reconvene to continue with its pending tasks.
</P>
<P>
The committee was supposed to act on a House resolution for
convening both chambers of the congress into a constituent
assembly as a prelude to a "people's initiative" to amend the
constitution to extend the term limits and the election of
senators by region.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, 67 congressmen who are second termers
 expressed their opposition to any charter change.
</P>
<P>
The second termers said that if the 89 third termer congressmen
are to run again, they will have no chance to sit as committee
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
At the House, seniority is the basis of getting a committee's
chairmanship.

<HEADLINE> Political Solution Key to Zaire War: S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
Chief of Defense Forces General George Meirring has said a
political and not military solution is the key to end Africa's
latest war in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said this here on Monday in a joint interview with
reporters after he arrived for a four-day official visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meirring added that the war in Zaire, pitting the country's
ill-disciplined army against Rwandan-backed rebels of
the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire, is more a political than military upheaval.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "I think the problems will not be solved militarily.
They must be solved politically and diplomatically inside Zaire".
</P>
<P>
Meirring, South Africa's first post-apartheid Chief of Defense
Forces, is visiting Tanzania to discuss bilateral defense
co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Dollar's Slide Eases Pressure on Thai Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pressure on the baht, the Thai
currency, has eased as the U.S. dollar lost some ground against
the Japanese yen and the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The ease has led to a slight strengthening of the baht, which
has been depreciating against the rising dollar for months.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand set the mid-rate of the baht at 25.94 to
the dollar on Monday, down 4 satangs from the last trading day,
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Trade was light in the spot market, with the baht moving in a
wide range from 25.87 to 25.96 baht against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the dollar would move downward to about
121 yen, compared with the 124.49 level it reached last week.
</P>
<P>
Siri Garnjarerndee, assistant governor of the central bank,
said that the foreign exchange and money markets were moving
closer to a normal position and that the baht and the dollar were
traded in a wider range, providing investors with more strategies
and thereby easing pressure.
</P>
<P>
Less volatile trading brought the forward swap premium down to
11-12 satangs for one-month settlement, 62-63.5 satangs for six
months and 106-110 for one year.

<HEADLINE> Fungal Disease Threatens Maize Yield in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe might fail to produce
its estimated maize yield of about three million tons this
season, following the recent outbreak of the fungal grey leaf
spot disease in its commercial and some communal farming areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily "The Herald" today, the disease, also
known as corcospora zeae-maydis, wreaks havoc on the maize crop
only and can destroy enormous hectares within a season.
</P>
<P>
Being a fungal disease, it also has the capacity to move with
the wind over great distances.
</P>
<P>
Maize production was this season expected to increase from 2.6
million tons to about three million tons, but unless measures
are taken to curb the spread of the disease, the yields would,
without doubt, be reduced, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Its outbreak was first reported in the United States in 1925
and spread to the African continent in 1988, where it settled in
South Africa and some central African countries.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the grey spot disease is said to have moved
up to 400 km, destroying vast maize fields in one season.

<HEADLINE> Two Provincial Firms to Sell Shares to Fund Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two inland firms are poised to
use the securities market to raise funds to fuel future growth by
issuing more than 61.29 million yuan (7.38 million US dollars) A
shares starting today.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said that the two companies, Xianyang
Pianzhuan Ltd. in Shaanxi Province and Hunan's Zhenghong Fodder
Ltd., will also apply to list their shares on Shenzhen Securities
Exchange "as soon as possible," according to their prospectuses.
</P>
<P>
Pianzhuan is planning to collect 63.2 million yuan through
issuing 11.29 million shares priced at 5.96 yuan (0.7 US
dollars)each.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be poured into three production expansion
projects which will involve a total investment of 67.88 million
yuan (8.1 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
When completed, the company will have an annual production
capacity of 4.1 million yokes to used in 20-. 21-, 25- and 29-inch
color television kinescopes.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is still no factory in China producing yokes used
for 29-inch color televisions. Domestic television manufacturers
have to rely on imports.
</P>
<P>
Zhenghong Fodder is expected to float 50 million shares to
raise 341 million yuan (41 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company will use part of the collected funds to expand the
production capacity of 10 subsidiaries co-funded with domestic
partners.
</P>
<P>
The company's products are sold in 13 provinces and autonomous
regions, and account for over 30 percent of the Hunan market.

<HEADLINE> China's New Foreign Exchange Payment Rules to Take Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- New regulations to verify
foreign exchange payments for imports will be put into effect on
March 1 by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The new rules place direct responsibility on the administration
for conducting verifications of the import payments.
</P>
<P>
The administration will take over the task from banks which
lack the management tools to make the verifications efficiently.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted the verification system to ensure the
authenticity of import procedures and to prevent illegal
remittances of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a foreign exchange official as saying that
"it is even more necessary to set up a simple and effective
verification-monitoring system now that the yuan is convertible
under current accounts."
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will standardize import payment activities
and prevent confusion between current and capital accounts
activities.
</P>
<P>
Designed banks are to report foreign exchange payment
statistics to the administration; importers are to report
certification and information concerning the arrival of imported
goods.
</P>
<P>
The administration then will check the importers' reports
against information received from banks and customs
bureaux. Further, some importers will be subject to random
inspections, according to the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
Firms found in violation of the regulations will be fined and
placed on a special list.
</P>
<P>
Firms on the inspection list will be permitted to do import
payment activities only after the administration confirm the
authenticity of their exports.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange administration will also discuss a list of
trade organizations and foreign-funded ventures which can directly
conduct import payment activities with designated banks.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of the two lists is to convince importers to
operate legally and so keep their reputations intact.
</P>
<P>
"Gaining the right to conduct foreign exchange payments
directly with banks will reflect a firm's credibility," said the
official, adding that the administration will adjust the two lists
periodically.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will also make it convenient for importers
to report information to do import payment.
</P>
<P>
Periodic reports will be required, rather than reporting and
verifying each import transaction, as required at present.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- India is negotiating with
Israel to acquire U.S. missile technology even as Washington
increases pressure to prevent the country from building an arsenal
of missiles.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Secretary T. Banerjee was in Israel a fortnight
ago at the head of an Army and Air Force team to negotiate the
purchase of components and technology of the Israeli "Arrow"
missile program, a joint venture with the United States, Defense
Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
India needs advanced launching and guidance systems to perfect
its surface-to-surface missile "Prithvi," which has a range of 250
kilometers, and the fledgling submarine-launched missile
"Sagvarika."
</P>
<P>
Last year India's Defense Research and Development Organization
chief A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Israel to study that country's
expertise in missile and related technologies.
</P>
<P>
Israel is negotiating the sale of a number of defense systems
worth 500 million U.S. dollars with India, including a large
contract for the supply of electronic systems for the upgrading of
Mig-21 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Indo-Israeli defense ties are expected to grow following the
visit of Israeli President Ezer Weizman to India a couple of
months ago when the two countries signed an agreement on
cooperation in the defense industry. No details have been given
about the agreement, but reports said it would translate into
India sourcing Western components from Israel at a low cost.

<HEADLINE> India Develops AIDS Test Kit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 25 (Xinhua) --India has developed a new kit
for detecting AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
A team of micro-biologists at the All India Institute of
Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, capital of India, developed
the kit to detect the deadly human immune-deficiency virus (HIV),
causative agent of AIDS, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pradeep Seth, head of the Department of Micro-Biology and
his research associate Dr. Mohammed Najeeb Siddiqi developed the
kit after two years' hard work.
</P>
<P>
A key feature of this enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
kit is its high sensitivity to the AIDS virus. "It has 100 percent
sensitive and specificity. We did tests on more than 1,000 blood
samples which were available in our bank, and we did not miss a
single one. More than 500 random samples were alone done. There
were no errors in detecting HIV positive cases here as well," Dr.
Seth said.
</P>
<P>
A major drawback with several kits available in India has been
the high degree of error. Recently several such kits had to be
withdrawn from the market due to the high error percentage.
</P>
<P>
"The sensitivity of a HIV testing kit is crucial. If a HIV
positive case is declared as negative, the person can die
prematurely due to lack of treatment. Similarly, if a negative
case is declared as positive, it can be traumatic for the person,"
Dr. Seth further said.
</P>
<P>
The kit is specifically sensitive to HIV types prevalent in
India.

<HEADLINE> Two Corporate Bonds Floated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Two batches of corporate bonds
became available for investors Monday, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
They included 1.34 billion yuan (161 million US dollars) in
bond certificates issued by China Petrochemical Corp and one
billion yuan (120 million US dollars) in paperless bonds by Jilin
Chemical Industry Group (Jihua Group).
</P>
<P>
Officials with Guotai Securities Co, which underwrites the
petrochemical bonds and another one billion yuan (120 million US
dollars) in such bonds issued by the Ministry of Power Industry,
said that the bonds sold well and expected competition among the
bonds did not happen.
</P>
<P>
Floating of the power binds began on Friday. Before that, the
Ministry of Railway issued 3.5 billion yuan (421 million US
dollars) in such bonds in January.
</P>
<P>
An official with Citic Securities, one of the managers of the
Jihua bonds, said that he was satisfied with the first day's
issuance.
</P>
<P>
"Individual investors were attracted by the corporate bonds'
higher yield over the upcoming treasury bonds to be issued this
weekend," he said.
</P>
<P>
These corporate bonds are three-year bonds with an annual
interest rate of 11 percent compared to 8.46 percent for the new
issue of T-bonds for the same term.
</P>
<P>
The T-bonds, with a total amount of 123 billion yuan (14.8
billion US dollars), will go to market on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Claim Seizure of Strategic Shibar Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have claimed the seizure of the strategic pass which is the
gateway to a rival faction's stronghold north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces Monday night broke through two defense lines
of the anti-Taliban alliance and captured the Shibar Pass, local
newspapers reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Shibar Pass opens out to Bamyan Province, the stronghold of
the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction led by Karim Khalili and provides
access to Baghlan and Samangan provinces in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
If the report is true, the loss of the Shibar Pass represents a
major setback for the anti-Taliban alliance which comprises forces
of Khalili, northern warlord Rashid Dostum and ex-defense minister
Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
Together with the Salang Pass which was blocked when Dostum's
retreating troops blew up the road near the Salang Tunnel in the
Hindu Kush Mountains, the Shibar Pass is the doorway to the 10
provinces in northern Afghanistan controlled by the anti-Taliban
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which control two-thirds of Afghanistan, have
vowed to bring the whole country under their control and enforce a
true Islamic system there.

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jim Bolger paid a visit to the Chinese Embassy here today to
express his condolences on the death of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He signed the condolence book and watched briefly the live

Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Bolger sent a message of condolence to Chinese

He said in the message that "with the passing of Deng Xiaoping,
 China has lost a distinguished citizen and leader renowned

reform and opening policies that, since 1978, have placed China
firmly on the road to national prosperity and full participation
in the international community."
</P>
<P>

rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Deng Xiaoping directed his
efforts above all to improving the living standards of the Chinese
people. Through his policies, he has left behind a legacy of the
fastest and deepest improvement in living standards, affecting the
greatest number of people, in the history of the world. This is
Deng Xiaoping's legacy not only to the Chinese people, but to the
people of the world as a whole."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling MPs Demand Smaller Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A dozen of Nepal's ruling
MPs demanded that Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba should trim
his cabinet, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
12 MPs of Deuba's main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party Monday
urged him to reduce his 47-member cabinet before the winter
session of parliament scheduled from March 3, the Kathmandu Post
quoted sources close to the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The NC lawmakers, who earlier registered their letters saying
they would not be present at the parliament session, promised
their support to the coalition government during the session if
Deuba reshuffles the cabinet before it begins, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba is expected to seek a vote of confidence
for his three-party government during the parliament session under
pressure from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Any ruling MPs' absence from the session is considered
disastrous for the fate of Deuba's government, which had been
reduce into minority status by a no-confidence challenge of the
main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) in last December.
</P>
<P>
The main ruling NC party, which leads the coalition government,
earlier this month directed Deuba to trim his cabinet after the
prime minister expanded the cabinet to induct some MPs of the
ruling partners in an attempt to stabilize the shaky ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five ministers from the NC party have reportedly
offered to resign to make it easy for the prime minister to
reshuffle the cabinet.

HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The explosion on Tuesday
afternoon of a container truck could be caused by the fuel in the
second-hand motorcycles being transported by the vehicle,
according to local press reports here on Wednesday.

"We believe (the explosion) might have been caused by
inflammable liquid in the motorcycles inside the container," said
Yeung Kwong-hung, Divisional Fire Services Commander Kowloon East.
</P>
<P>
"Somehow it burned and led to the explosion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Three people were injured in the explosion of the packed truck
at a busy Wong Tai Sin highway but the 36-year-old truck driver
escaped unhurt just before the main of a series of blasts.

The injured were two drivers and a two-year-old girl in a
nearby flat and they were all treated and discharged.
</P>
<P>
The blast at about 5:40 PM on Lung Cheung Road sent burning
motorcycle debris as far as 120 meters away. They scattered a
large area in a sea of smoke and flames.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 firemen rushed to the site and the fire was put out in
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Hong Kong's Transport Department said Monday
night that the current legislation did not cover fuel in goods
carried by lorries and other commercial vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Transport Advisory Committee chairman Raymond Ho Chung-tai said
safety aspects of long vehicles transporting other vehicles must

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan President Visiting India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan President S.A.
Niyazov is arriving here today on a two-day state visit to India
for enhancing bilateral ties with India, especially in the fields
of economy and trade, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
India and Turkmenistan are expected to sign a cooperation
agreement on oil and natural gas during the visit.
</P>
<P>
"Turkmenistan represents a major market for our goods and a
major source of energy for us," said Ministry of External Affairs
Secretary K. Raghunath.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan president's visit comes on the heels of a
trilateral agreement signed last weekend in Teheran by Indian
External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral and his Iranian and
Turkmenistan counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The trade and transit agreement laid down the framework for
regulating and monitoring the movement of goods between India and
Turkmenistan, a major gateway to central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral agreement, which had been in the making for the
past two years, will allow normalization and facilitation of
various procedures for the transport and transit of goods.
Furthermore, with a reliable rail link recently established from
Iran's Bandar Abbas port, and the excellent Soviet-era roads
leading from Ashkabad to central Asia, and onward to China in one
direction and Europe in the other, India expects its trade with
the region to receive a big boost in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
India is deeply interested in cooperating with Turkmenistan in
the area of hydrocarbons, since the Caspian sea basin is rich in
oil and natural gas, Raghunath said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Calls on U.S. to Suspend Mass Deportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A decision by the United
States to deport 20,000 Nicaraguans within the next few days could
create serious problems for Nicaragua as the deportees arrive home
to face unemployment and homelessness, the Nicaraguan Foreign
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The mass deportation could bring about grave consequences to
Nicaragua's impoverished economy as the government struggles to
create new jobs, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Latin America with
52 percent of its workforce unemployed or underemployed.
</P>
<P>
In 1970s and 1980s, about 25 percent of Nicaragua's population
sought political asylum abroad, while 200,000 took up residence in
Miami, U.S.A..
</P>
<P>
However, the exiles can no longer claim they face political
persecution back home to avoid deportation now because of the
democratic elections in Nicaragua in 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Tough immigration laws signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
last year required all American-based Nicaraguans who had received
deportation letters to leave.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 20,000 Nicaraguans in Florida are facing
deportation in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Playing down the danger of the mass deportation, Nicaraguan
President Arnoldo Aleman said on Sunday that his government will
ask the U.S. government to give Nicaraguans in the
U.S. provisional status until Nicaragua is able to meet their
social needs after they come back.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that the situation is as alarming as the
media has reported," Aleman said.
</P>
<P>
Aleman, who took power on January 10, has said he would join
with presidents of other Central American countries, asking
Clinton to temporarily suspend the deportation of Central American
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The issue of deportation will be one of the major topics up for
discussion between Clinton and Central American leaders during the
U.S. president's visit to the region in May.

<HEADLINE> China to Carry Forward Deng's Behest: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, said here
today that under the strong leadership of the Party Central
Committee, the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of
various ethnic groups across China will certainly push forward the
great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and build the country into a
socialist and modernized country which is strong, prosperous,
democratic, and civilized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also Chinese President and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, made these remarks at a memorial meeting for
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who passed away in Beijing last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the memorial meeting, which was held at the Great Hall of
the People, Jiang said that the Party Central Committee called on
the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of all ethnic
groups of the whole country to turn grief into strength, carry on
the will of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and express the mourning by
working harder and doing well in all aspects of practical work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: Deng Xiaoping was among founders of the people's
republic, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China
(PRC), he became an important member of the Communist Party of
China's first generation of the central collective leadership with
Comrade Mao Zedong at the core. After the third plenum of the 11th
CPC Central Committee, he became the core of the Communist Party
of China's second generation of central collective leadership and
led us to pioneer a new road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that without Comrade
Mao Zedong, we Chinese people would have to grope in the dark for
at least a longer period of time. And likewise, we should say
today that without Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese people would
not live a new life like today's and there would not be today's
new situation of reforms and opening-up and the bright prospects
of the socialist modernization.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader
whose high prestige was recognized by the Party, the military, and
the people of all ethnic groups throughout China. He was a great
Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military
strategist and diplomat, and a long tested communist fighter, the
chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening-up, and
modernization drive, and the founder of the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's most precious legacy
to us is his theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the Party's basic line for the initial stage
of socialism which was formulated under the guidance of that
theory. The theory has scientifically grasped the essence of
socialism, and for the first time, provided a systematic and
initial answer to a series of basic questions such as how to build
socialism in an economically and culturally underdeveloped country
like China, and how to consolidate and develop socialism. It is
the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the whole Party
and people of the whole country, and constitutes the guiding
ideology of the Chinese Communist Party and the spiritual prop of
the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only guided us with the
glorious revolutionary theory he established, but also inspired us
with his revolutionary style which was hammered in his long-time
revolutionary practice.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: In the new march into the next century, to hold
higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and better carry out the
Party's basic line represents the unswerving determination and
faith of the leading collective of the Party Central Committee, as
well as the common understanding and aspiration of the whole
Party, the whole Army and people of all ethnic groups of the whole
country. We will more conscientiously arm ourselves with this
theory for a unity of understanding, be of one mind and one heart,
work with a creative spirit to open up new spheres, overcome all
difficulties in our road of advance, remove the interferences of
various erroneous tendencies, and adhere to the Party's basic line
in whatever circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: Economic construction is the center of various
kinds of work of our Party and the whole country. We must act in
accordance with the teaching of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and grasp
this center firmly. All our work must be subordinate to and serve
this center. We must concentrate all our strength and wisdom, work
hard, build our country thriftily, shift economic development to
relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the
quality of laborers, and promote all-round social progress on the
basis of sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the pillar of the
state. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's military career held an important
position in his brilliant life. As the chairman of the Central
Military Commission, he charted the orientation and road for the
building of the army and national defense during the new
period. We must act in accordance with the teaching of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, stepping up our efforts to build our army into a
revolutionary, regular and modernized one under the overall
situation of concentrating on economic construction, taking the
road of better-armed troops with Chinese characteristics, so that
our army will constantly make new contributions to safeguarding
the national sovereignty and security, and defending and
participating in socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
Making a success of both material progress and ethical and
cultural progress is imperative for the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping repeatedly
emphasized that equal attention must be paid to the two kinds of
great progress, with neither aspect neglected, and that under the
condition of concentrating on economic construction, pursuing a
socialist market economy and opening up to the outside world, the
promotion of ethical and cultural progress should, in particular,
never be neglected. We must act in accordance with the teaching of
Comrade Deng Xiaoping, taking the "training of people with lofty
ideals, moral integrity, good education and the strong sense of
discipline" as our objective, striving to improve the ideological
and moral quality and the scientific and cultural quality of the
whole nation, constantly developing socialist ethical and cultural
progress which takes Marxism as its guidance, is based on our own
country and faces the whole world, and carries forward fine
traditions and reflects the requirements of the times as
well.

<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
a speech delivered by General Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China, Chinese President and Chairman of
the Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin at Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's Memorial Meeting:

Comrades and Friends:
</P>
<P>
Today, we are at the Great Hall of the People in the capital to
hold a memorial meeting and mourn for our beloved Comrade Deng
Xiaoping with profound grief. At this moment, the broad masses of
the people at factories, the countryside, shops, schools, army
units, government institutions and urban neighborhoods throughout
our country's vast territory, are together with us to cherish the
memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's tremendous achievements and
outstanding qualities and to give expression of our grief.
</P>
<P>
For the past few days, people of all ethnic groups, including
compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese,
felt boundless grief for China's loss of a great man in the
passing of Deng Xiaoping. People all over the world, leaders of
other countries and international friends in various fields have
also expressed their heartfelt condolences over the world's loss
of a great man in the passing of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people love Comrade Deng Xiaoping, thank Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, mourn for Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and cherish the
memory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping because he devoted his life-long
energies to the Chinese people, performed immortal feats for the
independence and liberation of the Chinese nation as well as for
China's cause of socialist modernization. His revolutionary
career with magnificent sweeps in more than seven decades is
closely associated with the founding and development of the
Communist Party of China, with the founding and development of the
Chinese people's army, and with the founding and development of
the People's Republic of China. He was among founders of the
people's republic and after the founding of the PRC he became an
important member of the Communist Party of China's first
generation of the central collective leadership with Comrade Mao
Zedong at the core. After the third plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, he became the core of the Communist Party of China's
second generation of central collective leadership and led us to
pioneer a new road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Following this path, China's national economy has
developed rapidly, its comprehensive national strength has grown
stronger day by day, the living standards of its people has
gradually improved, and socialism has shown unprecedented vigor
and vitality. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that without Comrade Mao
Zedong, we Chinese people would have to grope in the dark for at
least a longer period of time. And likewise, we should say today
that without Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese people would not
live a new life like today's and there would not be today's new
situation of reforms and opening-up and the bright prospects of
the socialist modernization.

<TEXT>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping was an outstanding leader whose high
prestige was recognized by the Party, the military, and the
people of all ethnic groups throughout China. He was a great
Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military
strategist and diplomat, and a long tested communist fighter,
the chief architect of China's socialist reforms, opening-up,
and modernization drive, and the founder of the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In the history of the Communist Party of China, the Party led
the Chinese people to carry out a great revolution to turn the
semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China into the socialist new
China, and has, since the third plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, led the people to start a new revolution, that is to
turn China from a undeveloped socialist country into a prosperous,
democratic and civilized socialist modern country. In the course
of the two great revolutions, two historic leaps were achieved in the
combination of Marxism with China's realities and
two major theoretical findings were made, namely, the Mao Zedong
thought and Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The two great revolutions and the two
historic leaps made two great men, namely, Comrade Mao Zedong
and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who was a comrade-in-arms of Comrade
Mao Zedong's and a successor to Comrade Mao Zedong's cause.
</P>
<P>
In a large semi-colonial and semi-feudal oriental country like
the old China, there were no ready answers for the communists to
lead revolutions to victory and they must open up their own
road. And this was a road of armed struggle, as well as a road of
establishing revolutionary bases in rural areas, encircling cities
from the countryside and eventually winning the nationwide
political power. This road was pioneered by our Party led by
Comrade Mao Zedong. Following the road unswervingly, comrade Deng
Xiaoping launched Uprisings in Guangxi, founded Red Army units,
and established revolutionary bases. After he arrived in the
Central Revolutionary Base, he was removed from his post by the
"Left" leaders within the Party for supporting Comrade Mao
Zedong's correct line. This was the first setback he had suffered
in his political career. During the Long March, he attended the
Zunyi Meeting, which marked a significant turn in the Party's
history.

fighter, the chief architect of China's socialist reforms,

Bocheng jointly led the troops, always working in key positions of
the overall strategic situation, and waging tit-for-tat struggles
against the enemies on the foremost front, and always firmly
carrying out major strategic decisions by Comrade Mao Zedong,

<P>
Following the founding of the People's Republic of China, our
Party faced the task of how to transit from new democracy to
socialism, and of probing its own road of building socialism
under the comparatively backward economic and cultural
conditions. The Party led the people in achieving great
successes, but also made some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping was transferred to Beijing from the
southwest to join in the central leadership, served
successively as vice-premier of the Government Administration
Council, secretary-general of the CPC Central Committee, and
vice-premier of the State Council, and was elected to the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the fifth plenum
of the seventh CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In his report on revising the Party's Constitution at the
eighth CPC National Congress, he put forward and profoundly
expounded the Party's task of strengthening the building of itself
as a ruling party. At the first plenum of the Eighth CPC Central
Committee, he was elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau, and general-secretary, of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the ten years when he served as the general-secretary,
he shouldered heavy tasks, put forth many correct proposals, and
carried out fruitful work in establishing the socialist system,
conducting socialist construction, probing a socialist road that
suits China's situation, and in overcoming the economic
difficulties in the three years, which were mainly caused by
"Leftist" errors, through summing up experience, correcting
mistakes, and readjusting policies.

<P>
The "Cultural Revolution" is a grave mistake in our Party's
history during the socialist period. In this movement, Comrade
Deng Xiaoping was wrongly criticized and denounced, and was
stripped of all his posts, suffering another major setback in his
political career.
</P>
<P>
After Lin Biao's plot of counter-revolutionary coup d'etat was
smashed, Comrade Deng Xiaoping came out to work again, and served
in 1975 as vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee, vice
premier of the State Council, vice chairman of the Central
Military Commission, and chief of the PLA General Staff, taking
charge of the day-to-day affairs of the Party, the state, and the
army.
</P>
<P>
He made vigorous efforts to turn the tide, urging boldness and
decisiveness in action, and determination to carry out drastic
rectification of the seriously chaotic situation caused by the
"Cultural Revolution."
</P>
<P>
For the benefits of the Party and the people, he gave no
thought to his own interests or safety, and, despite the risk of
being overthrown again, waged a resolute struggle against the
Gang of Four,
</P>
<P>
This rectification drive was, in essence, an experiment
for the reforms afterwards. It reflected the aspirations of
the cadres and the people, and represented the Party's
correct leadership, leading to conspicuous successes within a
short period of time.
</P>
<P>
Since the deepening of the rectification drive would surely
lead to the systematic correction of the errors of the "Cultural
Revolution", Comrade Deng Xiaoping was accused of whipping up "the
right deviationist wind to reverse the previous verdicts", and
he was again wrongly deprived of all his posts. This was the third
serious setback in his political career.
</P>
<P>
However, the achievements in the rectification drive and his
strength of character displayed in the rectification drive had
helped him win the support of the Party, the army, and the people
of the whole country. And this served as full popular preparations
for smashing the Gang of Four.

<P>
Following the downfall of the Gang of Four and the end of the
"Cultural Revolution", China was facing a critical historical
moment, that is, whether China could change the grave situation
caused by the ten-year "Cultural Revolution", and arise from amid
difficulties to open a new road of developing socialism.
</P>
<P>
Under the urgent demand of the Party members and the people,
Comrade Deng Xiaoping was restored to his former posts. At the Party
Central Committee plenum that decided to restore him to his posts,
he said: When I come out to work, there may be two kinds of
attitudes. One is to act as a bureaucrat, the other is to work. I
said to myself: Who asked you to be a Communist? Since you are a
Communist, you can neither act as a bureaucrat nor have selfish
considerations. You can not have other options.
</P>
<P>
With his great foresight, rich political experience, and superb
art of leadership, Comrade Deng Xiaoping seized the decisive link
from numerous events, and started the rectification drive from bringing
the ideological line back onto the right track.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that seeking truth from facts is the essence of Mao
Zedong Thought, he opposed the erroneous idea of "two Whatevers" ("We
should firmly uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made,
and unswervingly adhere to whatever instructions Chairman Mao
gave.").
</P>
<P>
He also supported the discussions on the criterion for judging
truth, paving the way for the convening of the third plenum of the
eleventh CPC Central Committee ideologically.

Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee re-affirmed the
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from
facts, affirmed shifting the focus of the work of the Party and
the State to economic construction, made the policy decision to

construction. After the plenary session, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
became the core of the Party's second generation of central
collective leadership.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping guided our Party in summing up the
historical experience since the founding of the People's
Republic. With immense political and theoretical courage, he
insisted on a scientific appraisal of the historical role of
Comrade Mao Zedong and the scientific system of Mao Zedong
Thought, completely repudiating the erroneous practices and
theories of the "great cultural revolution" and at the same time
resolutely resisting the erroneous ideological trend of negating
Comrade Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. Developments in the
domestic situation and changes in the international situation have
again and again proved the boldness and foresightedness of this

Although he retired from the leading post, Comrade Deng

continued to pay close attention to China's reform, opening up to
the outside world and the modernization drive. The important
remarks he made during his tour of southern China in early 1992
represent a scientific summing-up of the Party's basic practices
and experiences since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh
Party Central Committee in 1978, as well as an in-depth
theoretical answer to many major cognitive issues which had long
perplexed and trammeled people's thinking. Deng's talks not only
played an important guiding role in ensuring the successful
convening of the Party's 14th national congress, but is of a
far-reaching significance for the entire cause of socialist
modernization as well.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's talks of the southern tour and the

MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday urged Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to reshuffle the
cabinet to improve its efficiency.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Chernomyrdin in the Kremlin, Yeltsin said
he was worried that many people are dissatisfied with the government
and the president because of the country's difficult economic
situation and the government's inability to cope with the problem
of delayed wages and pensions.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government's social achievements and called
on Chernomyrdin to propose changes in the cabinet to make it "more
flexible, more efficient and more able to solve problems".
</P>
<P>
The government owes workers billions of rubles in backpay,
pensions and social benefits, even though Yeltsin had promised to
radically improve the situation before he suffered from double
pneumonia earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin promised that all delayed payments would be fully
repaid by July.
</P>
<P>
However, he argued that his cabinet was "sorting things out",
and said regional authorities were partly to blame for the social
problems in the country.

socialist modernization drive, and on the basis of summing up the
historical experiences of the triumphs and setbacks of China's
socialist cause and the ups and downs of other socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
Put in the perspective of the whole world, how to build
socialism after people led by the proletariate took power
represents an important topic of historical significance that
requires serious study and probing with the summing-up of past
experiences.
</P>
<P>
The new situation and new achievements socialism has
accomplished in China has enabled us to arrive at the conviction,
which is based on historical comparison and international
observation, that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics is correct.
</P>
<P>
The theory has scientifically grasped the essence of socialism,
and for the first time, provided a systematic and initial answer
to a series of basic questions such as how to build socialism in
an economically and culturally underdeveloped country like China,
and how to consolidate and develop socialism.
</P>
<P>
The theory is the product of combining the fundamental
principles of Marxism and Leninism with the realities and
characteristics of contemporary China, as well as the continuation
and development of Mao Zedong Thought. As Marxism of contemporary
China, it is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the
whole Party and people of the whole country, and constitutes the
guiding ideology of the Chinese Communist Party and the spiritual
prop of the Chinese nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Comrade Deng Xiaoping not only guided us with the glorious
revolutionary theory he established, but also inspired us with his
revolutionary style which was hammered in his long-time
revolutionary practice. His lofty style and integrity were
embodied in his life-long activities of revolutionary practice, in
his experience of "three rises and three falls", and in his
efforts to boldly open up a new path for China's socialist
development.
</P>
<P>
When he was wrongfully treated and in an adverse situation, he
never lost hope. Instead, he was always fearless, selfless,
indomitable, dauntless and well-composed, showing absolute loyalty
to the Party and people, and cherishing optimism about the future
of our cause.
</P>
<P>
Invariably, the adverse situation allowed him to have deeper
pondering over the experiences, lessons and fundamental laws of
the Chinese revolution, which resulted in a strong determination
to accomplish more.
</P>
<P>
Because of that, he was able to meet the demand of history and
the times, and take on heavy responsibilities after going through
the adverse circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, his rise and fall during the "Cultural
Revolution" prompted his deep thinking on the question of "what is
socialism and how to build socialism," which enabled him to
resolutely lead the whole Party and people in opening up a new
path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, after the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the process of opening up the new path, he showed respect to
practice and with a keen sense, felt the pulse and opportunities
of the development of the times. While carrying on the
achievements of the predecessors, he broke with conventions, and
in studying the experience of the outside world, he never copied
the models of foreign countries. He always summed up new
experiences and created new methods by proceeding from the
realities of china and from the characteristics of the development
of the contemporary world. He respected the masses and was
constantly concerned with the interests and wishes of the broad
masses of the people, always taking the question of whether it
would be beneficial to developing socialist productive forces, to
enhancing the overall strength of the country, and to raising
people's living standard, as the starting-point and the end of
formulating policies, principles and lines of work. Far-sighted
and broad-minded, he always studied and handled the various major
issues in view of the overall interests. He advocated actions and
was resolute in taking actions, and in particular, demonstrated
extraordinary courage and wisdom in making important decisions at
critical moments. His style along with his cause and thought, will
always live in our hearts.
</P>
<P>
The passing of Comrade Deng Xiaoping is a loss beyond measure
to our Party, our army and the people of all ethic groups of our
country. The Party Central Committee called on the whole Party,
the whole army, the people of all ethic groups of the whole
country to turn grief into strength, carry on the will of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping, and express our mourning by working harder and
doing well in all aspects of practical work.

Economic construction is the center of various kinds of work of
our Party and the whole country. The decision to take economic
construction as the center represents the most fundamental
achievement made under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's leadership in the
effort to bring order out of chaos. We must act in accordance with
the teaching of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and grasp this center
firmly. All our work must be subordinate to and serve this
center. Development is the most essential criterion. The key to
seizing the opportunity and developing ourselves lies in expanding
the economy. We must concentrate all our strength and wisdom, work
hard, build our country thriftily, shift economic development to
relying on scientific and technological progress and improving the
quality of laborers, and promote all-round social progress on the
basis of sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Reform is the inevitable road through which China will be able
to achieve socialist modernization. Comrade Deng Xiaoping drew up
a master plan for our all-round reforms. We must act in
accordance with the teaching of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, taking
the deepening of the reform as the key to eliminating barriers to
the development of productive forces and further advancing our
entire cause. The establishment of a socialist market economic
structure on the basis of taking the socialist public ownership as
the mainstay and the common development of multi-economic sectors
is a great pioneering work that our predecessors have never
undertaken. On the basis of the achievements which we have already
scored, we must carry on the reform of the economic structure in
depth. To meet the needs in this regard, we must persist in the
restructuring in political and other fields.

The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics

whole Army and people of all ethnic groups of the whole country,
to hold higher the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of

the interferences of various erroneous tendencies, and adhere to

Opening up to the outside world is an essential condition for
China to achieve its socialist modernization. Comrade Deng
Xiaoping emphasized repeatedly that the current world is an open
one, that China's development is inseparable from the world and
that it is imperative to pursue the policy of opening up to the
outside world on the basis of persisting in self-reliance. We must
act in accordance with the teaching of Comrade Deng Xiaoping,
soberly assess the development of the world, courageously meet the
severe challenge, adhere to the fundamental national policy of
opening up, develop an all-directional and multi-layer pattern of
opening up, strive to enhance the level of our opening up,
extensively absorb and draw on all results of advanced
civilization created by all countries in the world including
developed capitalist countries, and actively participate in
international economic and technological cooperation and
competition.
</P>
<P>
The state power of the people's democratic dictatorship
constitutes the political guarantee for the healthy development of
our cause. Comrade Deng Xiaoping always paid close attention to
the consolidation and development of the people's political
power. We must act in accordance with the teaching of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping, upholding the leadership by the working class,
consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, developing the broadest
possible united patriotic front with various non-Communist parties
participating, strengthening the great unity among the people of
various ethnic groups throughout the country, carrying forward
socialist democracy, perfecting the socialist legal system,
managing state affairs according to law, constantly improving the
political situation marked by stability, unity and liveliness.

<HEADLINE> USDA Forecasts Slower Growth in Food Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Agriculture Department
has forecasted that food prices would moderate this year after
rising at the fastest rate in six years in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, released today at USDA's annual Agricultural
Outlook Forum, shows the cost of food consumed at home would rise
by 1.8 percent this year, much slower than the 3.7 percent gain in
1996.
</P>
<P>
It said that food prices in the country are expected to rise
just by 2.1 percent this year, down sharply from 3.3 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast said that meat costs would increase only by 1.1
percent this year, down from the 3.5 percent advance in 1996. Pork
is expected to post a 1.2 percent advance comparing with the 9.9
percent gain in 1996. The price of poultry is projected to fall by
0.9 percent after jumping 6.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise of food prices in the U.S. last year was the steepest
since prices increased by 5.8 percent in 1990 when the economy was
entering the recession.
</P>
<P>
USDA economist Annette Clauson said much of the overall food
price increase in 1996 was due to higher grain prices that
affected the retail cost of meat, poultry and eggs, diary products
and cereal products.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index in the U.S. for all goods and services
rose by 3 percent in 1996.

ZHENGZHOU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has reported all-round development in its rural economy
since the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province is expected to add
94.8 billion yuan in profits from developments in agriculture,
forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries in 1996, a rise of 11.2
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Henan is one of China's leading agricultural provinces. In
recent years, provincial officials have placed strengthening the
agricultural foundation at the top of their economic development
list and have managed to put more investment into the sector to
increase farmers' initiative in production.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have had some effect. Last year, the province had
marked increases in the area devoted to grain, in meat output, and
in rural industry.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have also benefited greatly. Per capita net
income of farmers in the province was 1,530 yuan in 1996, a rise
of 11 percent over the previous year when adjusted for inflation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal government
recorded a budget surplus in January for the second consecutive
month, but the deficit for first four months of fiscal 1997 was
larger than the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Treasury Department said today that budget surplus in
January totaled 13.4 billion dollars, pulling down the deficit in
the first four months of fiscal 1997 to 46 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Still, the deficit was 27 percent higher than the red ink
recorded during the first four months of fiscal year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The full-year deficit of 107 billion dollars in fiscal 1996 was
the lowest in 17 years. The Clinton administration is projecting
the deficit will increase to 125.6 billion by the end of fiscal
1997 ending on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that the 1996 deficit in today's report
was slightly lower than the 107.3 billion previously recorded,
primarily because of a shift in the reported timing of spending by
the Federal Housing Administration.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit hit a record high of 290.4 billion
dollars in fiscal 1992 and then dropped in each of the following
years since President Bill Clinton took office.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz and
Foreign Minister Prince Saud arrived in Washington on Monday for
talks with U.S. officials on bilateral relations and regional
developments.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters that
talks will be on a wide range, including "economic subjects,
military subjects, the kinds of topics" especially concerning the
regional development.
</P>
<P>
"In our discussion with the Saudis, clearly one of the big
issue areas is a discussion of the region, where Saudi Arabia
plays a leading role and they have concerns about Iraq," Davies
said.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said U.S.-Saudi bilateral and security
relations, including the probe into the June 25, 1996, truck
bombing at Khobar Tower, Dhahran, which killed 19 American
servicemen, will be at the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process, Gulf security and oil supplies
would also be discussed, the U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of whether the Saudis plan to buy 100 F-16
aircraft from the United States, a deal reported to be worth
billions of dollars, would not come up, they said.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the United States was likely to maintain its
military presence in the Gulf for some time to come for its direct
interest.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a direct interest in the security of the
Gulf region, so we're going to be there in a fairly serious way
for the foreseeable future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cancer Increase Links Nuclear Power Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Radiation released in an
accident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant
may have increased cancer rates in the area, showed a study
published today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of North Carolina applied new
analytical techniques to old data and found stronger evidence that
the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island increased cancer risks
for residents living within 10 miles of the plant outside
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
A 1990 study, performed at Columbia University, said the 1979
accident was not responsible for slightly increased cancer rates
near the area because the radiation released was low. But the new
study said radiation doses may have been higher than originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
It said lung cancer and leukaemia rates downwind of the reactor
were 2 to 10 times higher than upwind rates.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a U.S. District Court in Harrisburg dismissed 2,000
damage claims against the power plant, saying area residents
failed to provide enough evidence the accident may have made them
ill. The ruling is being appealed.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Services for Deng Xiaoping Held in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- People from various circles
in the eastern areas of the United States staged various kinds of
memorial service to express their deep sorrow and painful sadness
on the passing away of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Chinese living in New York city held today a memorial meeting
in China Town, which was joined by Chinese diplomatic officials
here.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qicheng, president of the United Chinese Associations of
New York, said at the meeting that Deng's idea of reunification of
the country has deeply rooted among the overseas Chinese. He will
be remembered forever.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, more than 2,000 Chinese, originated from
both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, foreign diplomats and
Chinese students attended the mourning ceremonies held in the
Chinese Consulate General and China's Permanent Mission to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, was one of
the first few U.N. officials going to the Chinese mission to
express their condolences. He described Deng's death as "a great
loss, not only for the people of China but for the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Razali Ismail, the president of the 51th United Nations who
also appeared at the Chinese mission's mourning hall, said Deng
contributed "immensely to the elevation of China and to the
aspirations of people of the world."
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. new ambassador to the United Nations,
also went to the Chinese mission to express his condolence. He
wrote that "My most sincere condolence for a leader who greatly
improved U.S.-China relations and greatly modernize China's
economic system. He was a great leader who will be missed on the
world stage."
</P>
<P>
At the weekend, some Chinese drove hours from upper part of the
New York state, Philadelphia and New Jersey to express their sorrow
at the mourning hall of the Chinese Consulate General. The
wreathes in the hall also included those presented by the
governments of nearby cities, such as Jersey City and Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
I. M. Pei, the famous American Chinese architect, told the
reporter he personally held that Deng's greatest contribution to
the nation was his introduction of market economy which had
immensely improved people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Chinese from some organizations of Taiwan also joined the
mourning of their compatriots. Some of them, working as
interpreters for the U.N., recalled their witness of Deng's first
explanation of China's theory of three worlds during a U.N.
session in 1974. They described Deng Xiaoping as a great man who
made great contribution to the people.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Chinese Consulate General, who were also in
deep mourning, said they were really moved by some of the
mourners, one of whom brought a wreath made by 93 fresh roses.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese student named Tu said that without Deng's initiation
of the opening up policy, it would be hardly possible for large
numbers of students to study abroad. They have not only gained
advanced knowledge, but also contributed to the motherland in
various forms.

<HEADLINE> East China Economic Zone Reporting Faster Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The city of Xiamen, one of
China's first special economic zones, in east China's Fujian
Province, had a GDP of 30.82 billion yuan last year, a rise of
19.25 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The latter figure is 10 percentage points more than the
nation's average, but the city held down price hikes and the
retail price index compared with the national average, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial enterprises at or above the township level
generated 39.59 billion yuan in output value and contributed 4.23
billion yuan in revenues.
</P>
<P>
Local officials consider overseas-backed businesses as a major
force behind the fast economic growth of the special economic
zone. In 1996, those at or above the township level generated 30.1
billion yuan in output value, accounting for 76.1 percent of the
city's total industrial output value from industrial enterprises
at and above township level.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Has No Plans to Mediate in Greek- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Richard Holbrooke said here tonight that he currently did
not have any plans to mediate in Greek-Turkish differences and
stressed that tensions in the area were out of all proportions.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was here accompanying his wife, Kati Marton, in her
capacity as President of the International Committee for the
protection of journalists, to receive the Costas Kyriazis
International Centre award. Marton is honored for her work as the
president.
</P>
<P>
"I dont't have any plans right now. I have a book to finish and
I have work to do," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would have liked very much to help, but "right now I
can't undertake any other commitments." He was referring to the
book he was writing about his experiences as mediator in Bosnia
that led to the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
He said however "I'm very interested in the area."
</P>
<P>
Asked to venture a prediction on possible escalations of
tensions, Holbrooke said "I think that tensions in the area are
out of all proportion on the issues, which are real... but do not
justify such a high level of tension."
</P>
<P>
"This is excessive and the leaders of both sides (Greece and
Turkey) have to talk directly to each other to get this cooled
down."
</P>
<P>
On the possible war in the area, Holbrooke said "I don't think
that war makes any sense at all. I know people like to talk about
wars out here, but last year this time with Imia we had a little
problem that could have led to a military confrontation. Still, it
doesn't make any sense and I just met with the Turkish leaders in
Washington last week and I told them there is no reason at all for
people to have a high level of tension."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he was "confident that Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis and his government and the Turks will find ways to
cool things off, and they really should, because there is no need
for this."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt, Paris Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
traded flat and ended mixed Monday, with Frankfurt and Paris
slightly higher while London marginally down, as Wall Street's
rally did little to help the markets.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London regained some early losses later in
the day to end the session off the day's lows, helped by a revival
of the Dow, but still in the negative ground, with the FTSE 100
index 5.7 points lower at 4,331.1.
</P>
<P>
Traders said a weaker dollar and rising bond yields, together
with concern that the US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
semi-annual commentary on the US economy to Senate and House
committees on Wednesday and Thursday might unsettle markets,
undermined share prices.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares recovered their earlier losses and
ended marginally higher, with the DAX-30 index 0.12 points up at
3,184.21.
</P>
<P>
There was little positive sentiment in the market which was
depressed by a weak dollar which is negative for German exports,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, share prices bucked the weaker
international trend on strength in selected stocks and fresh
buying at the start of the March trading account, with the CAC-40
index ending 5.01 points higher at 2,567.85.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 5.7
points lower at 4,331.1. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 0.12

<HEADLINE> Britain Set to Table New Proposals on Lifting Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
poised to present a package of proposals aimed at a partial
lifting of the European Union's (EU) global ban on British beef
exports to the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for British Agriculture Ministry was quoted by BBC
television as saying this evening that it was "more than likely"
that the plans would be put forward to an EU veterinary committee
on Tuesday and then the agriculture ministers of the 15-nation
bloc.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the new certified herd scheme was
designed to ensure that exports come only from cattle which have
never been in contact with BSE or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Northern Ireland are likely among the first wave
to benefit from the partial lifting of the beef ban as there are
better records of cows' history in the region.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a world-wide ban on exports of British beef
products last March when the British government acknowledged
possible links between mad cow disease to its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) increased its borrowings in the world
capital market last year, strengthening its ability in aiding
development projects in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
A IDB report released today said that the bank completed 20
individual borrowings in the international capital market in 1996,
totaling 4.25 billion U.S. dollars. It was an increase of 1.5
billion dollars comparing with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IDB expects to borrow between 4 billion and 5 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997 with 100 percent of the swap requirements in U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the next few years, the bank's annual borrowing
requirements are expected to remain close to or slightly above the
1996 level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the bank's outstanding borrowings
reached 26.6 billion U.S. dollars with an average life of six
years.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Spend More on Prisons Than Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
spending more money on building prisons than building
universities, a report of The Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
"From 1987 to 1995, state government expenditures on prisons
increased by 30 percent while spending on higher education fell by
18 percent," said the Post, quoting a study which was conducted by
the Justice Policy Institute, a research and advocacy organization
based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It said that many states are rapidly expanding prison
facilities while the size of their college-age population has
remained static for several years.
</P>
<P>
The study found that in 1995, spending by states on prison
construction increased by 926 million U.S. dollars, but building
funds for higher education decreased by an almost equal amount.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said, from 1980 to 1994, the number of
adults in prison nationwide tripled from 320,000 to 992,000 as
lawmakers across the country enacted longer sentences for many
crimes, including nonviolent drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
However, over the same period, enrollment in institutions of
higher education increased from 12 million to 14.7 million people.

people of China but also to the people of Tanzania and the world.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this is the time when solidarity between the
peoples of the two countries - China and Tanzania, has to be
enhanced," said the message.

UNITED NATIONS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on
Monday called upon the Islamic Taleban to release two French aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
Two Frenchman from the Paris-based group Action Against Hunger

Taleban's information minister put it, "tramping under foot
Islamic and international moral principles.
</P>
<P>
"We are making four points to the Taleban," U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said. Among them was that private or non-governmental
humanitarian groups, which supply considerable aid, would be
"inclined to leave Afghanistan if the two are not released."
</P>
<P>
The Taleban was also told that its actions were a violation of
diplomatic norms and that the Frenchmen should be released on
humanitarian grounds because they committed no offense to justify
their arrest, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was also told that "unless these two people are released the
Taleban's international image would be further undermined," he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to reform its tens
of thousands of rural credit agencies and to turn them into
genuine cooperative banking institutions over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by Dai Xianglong, governor of the
People's Bank of China at the opening of a national work
conference on reforming the administrative system of the rural
banking sector.

</P>
<P>
In his speech Dai said that to build rural credit agencies into
cooperative banking institutions is in line with the demands of
rural economic development and banking reform.
</P>
<P>
When rural credit agencies become cooperative banking
institutions they will be able to raise funds for the agricultural
sector effectively, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dai announced that all the over 50,000 credit agencies
scattered across the country have been separated from control by
the Agricultural Bank of China and will operate independently

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Stresses Equitable Use of Nile Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is "prepared to
sit and engage in fruitful discussion with other Nile riparians
in the determination of their equitable shares of water," a
senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
But this should be "based on progressively developed and
universally acceptable principles of international law
particularly within the sub-basin countries of the Blue Nile,"
Ethiopian Minister of Water Resources Shiferaw Tarso said here.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Tarso when he was opening the 5th
Nile 2002 Conference at the United Nations Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "as a source and major contribution of the
Nile waters, Ethiopia has the right to have an equitable share of
the Nile waters and reserves its right to make use of its water."
</P>
<P>
However, Tarso said: "In the exercise of its sovereign right
to the utilization of its waters, Ethiopia has no intention to
cause appreciable or significant harm to other riparian states."
</P>
<P>
He called on participants to "create a viable framework for
effective cooperation in all areas of endeavor, ranging from
integrated basin development, effective utilization of their
resources as well as the sustainable development and protection
of its environment."
</P>
<P>
On behalf of 17 financial supporters to the conference,
Canadian Ambassador to Ethiopia Gabriel Lessord said: "Canada has
been assisting the Nile Basin countries toward achieving the goal
of comprehensive management of the water resources of the Nile
Basin."
</P>
<P>
"We also very much desire that once success has been achieved
on working together on the uses of water resources, and that
confidence is created between the member states, that other
pressing strategic issues can also be addressed," he added.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the five-day conference is "Comprehensive Water
Resources Development of the Nile Basin: Basis for Cooperation".
</P>
<P>
Over 300 participants will discuss issues and topics that will
foster regional cooperation in the basin under the focal theme,
basis for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is held annually in each of the 10 countries on
rotational basis. Four conferences were held in Aswan, Egypt in
February 1993, Khartoum, Sudan in January 1994, Arusha, Tanzania
in February 1995 and Kampala, Uganda in February 1996
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 6,600-km River Nile is one of the longest and most
remarkable rivers in the world. The Nile Basin area is estimated
to be about 3 million square km, the equivalent of about
one-tenth of the African continent, extending into 10 riparian
countries, namely Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Tanzania, Kenya,
Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and Egypt.

two days ago after a dog bit him. The dog died itself during the
struggle with the young boy.
</P>
<P>
In Afgoie district, 30 km south of Mogadishu, seven women were
bitten by dogs in separate cases. Two of them are at present in
critical condition suffering from hysteria and serious
lacerations on their heads caused by the bites of the dogs.
</P>
<P>
Hyenas, a dangerous animal which eats human fresh, also began
to be seen in the streets in Mogadishu, local residents said. But
so far there are no reports of people being attacked. Somalia is
hard hit by drought which has brought famine to parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
More animals are believed to be hiding in the old wrecked
buildings in the center of Mogadishu, but nobody seems to know
how these animals, especially the hyenas and leopards, could
reach right there.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- More people in Hong Kong
went to the mourning hall at the Xinhua New Agency Hong Kong
Branch here today for the fifth day to offer their condolences
over the death of Deng Xiaoping who passed away last Wednesday at
the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
A winding queue of waiting mourners was seen throughout today,
the last day of mourning at the hall.
</P>
<P>
Among them were business people, students, teachers, workers,
Buddhists, entertainers, tourists from the Chinese mainland and
diplomatic envoys in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Postcards on Hong Kong's landscapes, a guidebook of Hong Kong
and a calendar of 1997 were laid before Deng's portrait, to let
him "have a look at Hong Kong" after it returns to its motherland,
mourners said.
</P>
<P>
"I miss Grandpa Deng. Thanks to the concept of 'one country,
two systems" put forward by him, Hong Kong is now very stable and
I can go to school at ease as in the past," a tearful primary
school pupil told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A new football was placed before Deng's portrait by a local
football team, as the late Chinese leader "enjoyed the sport very
much."
</P>
<P>
Since the hall opened last Thursday, a total of 43,000 people
have gone there to offer their condolences.
</P>
<P>
Six other mourning halls, set up by Chinese-funded groups, such
as the Bank of China Group, to share the huge number of mourners,
received some 15,000 people during these days.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accused of Trying to Find Foothold in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi Foreign Ministry
spokesman today accused Iran of trying to find a foothold in
northern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to INA, the spokesman said the Iranian
government tries to get advantage of chances whenever available
to find a foothold in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came after Iranian newspapers reported on February
17 that the Iranian government received "alleged representatives
of Iraqi kurdish factions" to take part in ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
By receiving the "alleged representatives" as guests attending
ceremonies, the Iranian government aims to maintain the
abnormal situation in the north, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the allegations by Iran that it is making efforts
to help stop in-fighting between the Iraqi Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Iraq previously denounced and condemned such practices, which,
the spokesman said, showed Iran's "insistence on interfering with
Iraq's internal affairs and spreading a state of instability in
the region."
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon Iran to stop and keep away from the
"crooked" ways which deeply harm relations between the two
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Greece Promotes Olive Oil Sale in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Promotions
Organization has begun a campaign aimed at increasing Greek olive
oil's share of the U.S. and Canadian markets to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greek olive oil currently holds about 3.0-5.0 percent of the
market share and the 1 billion drachma (4 million U.S. dollar)
program hopes to establish new Greek brands as well as increase
sales of brands already on the market.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for olive oil is a major focus for exports as
it is both the biggest non-olive oil producing market and holds
extensive potential for development.
</P>
<P>
The olive oil sector in Greece provides income for some 500,000
Greek farming families and contributes significantly to the gross
value of Greece's agricultural production, with production
exceeding 300,000 tons annually, the third-largest internationally
after Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, two-thirds is consumed domestically while the
remainder is exported, primarily to Italy, with exports to the
U.S. totaling only 4,500 tons.

<HEADLINE> European Frigate Project in Danger of Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Arguments among the British,
French and Italian partners over ship designs and capability are
threatening to sink the European joint frigate project.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which all need high-technology frigates,
have been negotiating over the past nine years to produce a new
generation of frigates, the Financial Times newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
But they are sharply divided on what capabilities to give the
new frigate and at the heart of the dispute is the weapon system
of the ship.
</P>
<P>
Britain wants a highly sophisicated frigate capable of
defending a widely-dispersed convoy alone. France and Italy, under
severe budget pressure, are prepared to settle for a less advanced
ship which would only defend the waters immediately around the
ship.
</P>
<P>
Military experts say that the dispute could eventually break up
the program as Britain was not prepared to settle for the lower
capacity, while France and Italy would also refuse to pay the
price Britain has demanded.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- One day before the opening of
the fourth International Conference on Mines to be held in
Maputo, 100,000 Mozambicans have signed a written appeal for a
ban on the production and sales of mines in the world.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, initiated in the Mozambican capital in early
February, has so far gained huge support among local residents
who have long been the victims of mines ever since the civil war
started in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Banners and placards urging the ban of mines could be seen
everywhere in the streets of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said an estimated two million mines have been
planted in the soil of Mozambique. However, despite the end of
the civil war in 1992, people are still suffering from the mine
explosions daily.
</P>
<P>
So far fewer than 50,000 mines have been removed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Mozambique, South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe,
Cambodia, etc., are expected at the conference which would be
opened by Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Offers Half Price of Grain to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- India's United Front
government today announced in parliament its decision to offer
half a price of rice and wheat to the poor people in the country.
</P>
<P>
A targeted public distribution system (TPDS) will cover 320
million people below the poverty line in the country. At the
beginning, it was to issue 10 kg of food grains per family per
month at half the normal prices for all families below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda told the house in a statement that a
total of 18 million tons of rice and wheat was likely to be issued
under the TPDS.
</P>
<P>
Massive food subsidy of 82.82 billion rupees (2.33 billion US
dollars) is expected under the new system, an official said.
</P>
<P>
The government's new move is expected to be widely welcomed by
the poor people in the country. As soon as the government came to
power last year, Gowda made it clear that his administration would
work for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said, however, that the new policy of the
government has made the fiscal deficit management a herculean task
for the beleaguered finance minister, who is scheduled to table
the new budget to parliament on February 28.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have
recommended a gradual phasing out of subsidies to reign in the
fiscal deficit and ensure better management of resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
claimed today it has recovered territory it lost to a rival Shiite
Muslim faction in a strategic valley northwest of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction led by Karim Khalili last
night captured some of the Taliban's positions in the Ghorband
valley but they were retaken by the Islamic militia in a dawn
counter-attack, said reports reaching here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Khalili's forces had been pushed to the foot of the Shebar
pass, which is the gateway to the Bamyan province, a Taliban
spokesman in Kabul was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The claim could not be independently confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban last week sent reinforcements to the Ghorband
valley, 150 km from Kabul, which links Kabul to northern provinces
controlled by the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Ghorband valley also controls access to Khalili's
stronghold of central Bamyan province.
</P>
<P>
Khalili is allied with northern warlord Rashid Dostum and
ex-defense minister Ahmad Masood in an anti-Taliban alliance.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Meet US Secretary of State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng met here tonight with visiting US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright conveyed US President Bill Clinton's condolences over
the passing away of Deng Xiaoping. She also handed letters of
condolences from Clinton to Jiang and Zhuo Lin, Deng's widow.
</P>
<P>
Albright referred Deng as a respectable, great and historic
figure whose leadership has produced dramatic economic
transformation for China and who has contributed much to the
development of the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
She offered her personal condolences over Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Li said Deng was an outstanding leader whose prestige
was recognized by the whole Party, the whole Army and the people
of all ethnic groups throughout China.
</P>
<P>
They said Deng made indelible contributions to the victory of
the New Democratic Revolution and the founding of New China, and
to the establishment, consolidation and growth of socialism in
China.
</P>
<P>
Deng also made contributions of historical importance to
creating a new scene for the country's independent diplomacy of
peace, to develop friendly ties of cooperation with other
countries, and to normalize and push forward the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders told Albright that the Chinese people will
cherish the memory of the late Deng's great historical
contributions, and will continue to take Deng's road.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, when recalling his meeting with President Clinton in
Manila last November, said the two heads of state have set the
principles for the continuous improvement and development of
bilateral ties, and that the two sides should make efforts to this
end.
</P>
<P>
China and the US are two countries of major importance in the
world, the Chinese president said, and they share broad common
interests.
</P>
<P>
He said great potentials are yet to be tapped between China and
the US, especially in developing mutually-benefitting trade and
economic cooperation, jointly maintaining global and regional
peace, promoting the growth and prosperity of the world
economy. And such potentialities are solid foundations for the
growth of bilateral ties, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Despite differences, Jiang said, the two countries should view
the bilateral ties from a more farsighted perspective. They should
increase understanding, seek common ground while reserving
differences and expand their cooperation to meet the fundamental
interests of the two peoples, and serve peace, stability and
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and of the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is a major task of the Chinese and American
leaders at the turning of the century to bring a healthy and
stable bilateral relationship of sustained development into the
21st century, based on the three Sino-US joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
This historical task, he stressed, requires the courage and
farsightedness as demonstrated by the leaders of the two countries
when they opened the relations between China and the US in the
1970's.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that to this end, he is willing to make concerted
efforts with his US counterpart.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Detention of Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's judicial authority
today accused Japan's press of filing "baseless" reports,
categorically denying that Lebanon detained any Japanese, not to
mention any alleged members of the "Red Amy."
</P>
<P>
Adnan Addoum, the state prosecutor, stressed that no Japanese
had been arrested by the Lebanese security forces.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with a Japanese security
delegation, Addoum announced that he received a report from the
country's security authorities that they had not taken into
custody any Japanese citizen in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"During investigations with a number of Palestinians over
certain cases, the Palestinians confessed that there were
foreigners cooperating with them," Addoum told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These foreigners were captured, but among them was not a
Japanese," the state prosecutor clarified.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, an official in the Japanese
embassy in Beirut denied today that his government has received
"anything official" from the Lebanese side on the detention of
members of the "Red Army."
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's newspapers reported last week that Lebanon arrested
five members of the "Red Army," and they even published the
names and pictures of those persons. Japanese Prime Ministry
reportedly confirmed the reports.
</P>
<P>
A silence observed by the Lebanese government deepened
speculations in both Beirut and Tokyo.

<P>
The Japanese papers also said that those detained in Lebanon
included Kozo Okamoto, 49, who had been sentenced to life
imprisonment in Israel for his role in the May 1972 shootout in
Tel Aviv's Lodd airport in which 24 people were killed, and was
released in May 1985 as part of a prisoner swap between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The radical "Red Army," founded in 1971, was accused of
involvement in a series of terrorist activities in the Middle
East in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Japanese journalists arrived in the Lebanese
capital in the past week in order to cover what they
regarded an event attractive for their audience back home.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo sent a two-men security delegation to help Lebanon
conduct the investigation, but the Japanese embassy complained
that the Lebanese government shrugged off the help.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers hoped that a "diplomatic
embarrassment" resulted from the event would not damp efforts of
the cash-hungry government led by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to
draw financial aid from Japan.

<HEADLINE> Turkey for Direct Talks Between Rival Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey always supports the
direct talks between two communities of divided Cyprus, said
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
here today.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told the visiting British Special Envoy on Cyprus issue
David Hanney, "We have been expecting the dialog to be held
between the two communities of Cyprus as soon as possible for a
long time."
</P>
<P>
It is very necessary for Hanney to mediate for the dialog
and peace process between Turkish and Greek Cypriots as soon
as possible, added the Turkish foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
On the Cypriot government's purchase of the Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, Ciller said that it is "not helpful
to peace" in this region.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that northern Cyprus and Turkey would not
accept the deployment of the 150-kilometer-range missiles on the
east Mediterranean island of divided Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Hanney said that the dialog should be
secured between the two communities of the island in a bid to
solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkey occupied the
northern third of the strategic island in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed on the
island to protect the Turkish Cypriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told visiting US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here today that China is willing to have more
dialogues and cooperation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the US side will strictly observe the
principles set in the three Sino-US joint communiques, and settle
the Taiwan question in a careful and proper way, in order to
maintain the momentum of improvement and development in bilateral
relations and a favorable environment for their cooperation in the
international affairs, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the statement during his talks with Albright at the
Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have seen progress recently, Qian noted, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton will exchange
state visits in 1997 and 1998, and US Vice-President Al Gore is
expected to visit China next month at the invitation of Chinese
Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, there are opportunities for further
improving and advancing China-US relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two foreign ministers also discussed
other issues of common interests including China's accession to
the World Trade Organization, non-proliferation of weapons, and
the Hong Kong issue.

<HEADLINE> Albright on US Policy Toward China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here today that the US is willing to see a
prosperous, stable and safe China and to make concerted efforts
with the Chinese side to broaden bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks here this afternoon when she was
received by Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and held talks
with Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese diplomats present at the meetings and
talks, Albright reaffirmed that the US government will continue to
commit itself to the "One China" policy and principles enshrined
in the three US-Chinese joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed the Shanghai Joint
Communique in 1972, the joint communique on the establishment of
diplomatic relations in 1978 and another communique in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that the US and China are two major countries in
the world and they face a shared task in maintaining world peace
and stability, and therefore, the US has always viewed its ties
with China as that among the most important ones.
</P>
<P>
She said that President Clinton has repeatedly said that he
will further advance the US-Chinese relations during his second
term so as to build a partnership of cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that 25 years ago the two countries published the
Shanghai Communique out of their shared strategic interests and
that although the world situation has greatly changed since then,
the US and China have enjoyed sound cooperation for they have much
in common.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, differences between the US and China
remain. It is very important for the two countries to narrow their
difference through more high-level dialogues and exchanges, she
added.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Algeria's Decision to Resume Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the decision
by Algeria to resume the direct flight of Air Algeria between
Algiers and Paris after a two-year suspension of the flight by
Algiers.
</P>
<P>
"We have been informed of the decision of the Algerian side to
resume its service to Paris by Air Algeria on the basis of
discussions between Algerian and French experts," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
Air Algeria, which served the only direct airline between
Algiers and Paris, suspended its flight to the French capital in
June 1995 after France asked it to remove its terminal from the
Orly-Sud Airport south of Paris to the Roissy Airport north of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
France cited security reasons and described Air Algeria as a
"high risk" target by Islamic extremists, while Algeria
considered the decision as "discriminatory."
</P>
<P>
"The French government always shows the hope that Air Algeria
could resume its activities from Paris as rapidly as possible,"
said the spokesman. "We cannot but rejoice over the decision
announced yesterday (by Algeria)."
</P>
<P>
He said that French experts are contacting Air Algeria on
practical arrangements to install the air company at a terminal in
the Roissy Airport.
</P>
<P>
"The preoccupation for an all-out security (for the air
company) is a constant preoccupation of the French authorities,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> France Makes New Appeal for Ending of Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- France today described the need
to end hostilities in Zaire as "urgent" and reaffirmed its
"active" support for a five-point peace plan for Zaire, which was
unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council last
week.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
France considers as "extremely preoccupying the resurgence of
fightings in Zaire in the course of the past few days."
</P>
<P>
Zaire's Tutsi-led rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila took last
weekend the town of Kalima in South Kivu, which is some 100
kilometers east of the strategic city of Kindu, after Zairean
government forces looted and abandoned the city.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that officials of
the European Union countries will discuss the situation in Zaire
during their session of the EU council of general affairs to be
held in Brussels later this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. five-point peace plan for Zaire calls for an immediate
ceasing of hostilities, the withdrawal of all foreign forces,
including mercenaries, and reaffirmation of respect for the
national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other
states of the region.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the guarantee of security of refugees and
displaced people and access of humanitarian aid to them, and a
rapid and peaceful solution to the crisis through dialogue,
elections and holding of an international conference on the peace,
security and development of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The author of the peace plan, Algerian diplomat Mohamed
Sahnoun, who is representative of the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity to the Great Lakes region, will
attend the EU session.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Use Euro Alongside Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain should adopt a
two-stage approach to the European Monetary Union (EMU) by making
the euro, the single European currency, legal tender alongside the
pound, according to the Adam Smith Institute.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here today, the institute proposed a dual
currency system for transactions of more than 10 pounds (about 16
U.S. dollars), arguing it would solve the British government's
dilemma over the single currency.
</P>
<P>
This would allow the euro to circulate freely in Britain,
giving British business and citizens access to the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
Madsen Pirie, president of the institute, said, "If the euro is
indeed built upon the sand of fudged criteria, it might well float
down against the pound after its launch."
</P>
<P>
"The greatest advantage of all is that it would allow us to
test the quality of the euro," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Pirie admitted that the proposal was likely to be
rejected by the country's retailers and industry, which would face
the high costs handling two currencies simultaneously.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Varsity Ordered to close Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nairobi University was today
ordered to close indefinitely following two-day protests over the
suspected murder of a student leader by grieving students.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Muruli, a third-year student of the Nairobi
University, was burnt to death in a mysterious explosion on
Sunday morning at his Kikuyu campus, about 30 kilometers from the
Nairobi city center.
</P>
<P>
following his death, university students went on the rampage
last night and today, and have taken to streets lighting fires,
hijacking buses and stoning cars and shop windows.
</P>
<P>
Muruli, the Vice-Chairman of the university's Education
Students Association, died barely a week after he received a note
reportedly threatening him with death.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Muruli was abducted by unknown people who
allegedly tortured him for five days before abandoning him in a
church compound in Kiambu district.
</P>
<P>
On December 31 of last year, he was reportedly arrested in the
port city of Mombasa by plain-clothes policemen who accused him
of being a member of the unregistered Safina political party.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the grieving university students last night, Vice
Chancellor Francis Gichaga appealed for calm and promised to set
up a committee to investigate the matter with all seriousness.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government sent out large numbers of anti-riot
police to control the situation when hundreds of irate students
moved into the city center and others barricaded the University
Way/Uhuru Highway round-about and then set about stoning
motorists along State House Road and Uhuru Highway.

<HEADLINE> Deng's Contributions to Taiwan Affairs Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and scholars
connected with Taiwan affairs said that Deng Xiaoping's theory of
"one country, two systems" has made a great and indelible
contribution to the country's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
and other organizations and institutions connected with Taiwan
affairs participated in a discussion here today to cherish the
memory of Deng, who died in Beijing last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was presided over by Chen Yunlin, director of
the Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
As one of the top members of New China's first generation of
leaders and the core of the second generation of leadership, the
officials noted, Deng was many times engaged in making policies on
Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the reunification of China was one of the
three major tasks for the whole Party and the whole people, and
Deng initiated the theory of "one country, two systems" as a
practical solution to the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Deng made great efforts to promote peaceful negotiations
between the CPC and Taiwan's Kuomintang, as well as to push
forward economic ties and non-official exchanges between both
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng's theory, relations across the Taiwan Straits
have experienced historic changes in the past few years, the
discussion participants agreed.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their intention to turn grief into strength
and to do an even better job of dealing with Taiwan affairs, by
sticking to the principle of "peaceful reunification within the
framework of one country, two systems".

The Chinese people have received unprecedented benefits from
Deng Xiaoping's three-step strategy for economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Every household in our company has refrigerators and color TV
sets now. However, there were only four refrigerators and six
color TV sets among some 3,000 employees in 1980," said Wu Zukai,
a chief engineer with the Rainbow Group.
</P>
<P>
"My two sons have returned to work after studying in Britain
and the United States, because they are confident in the country's

development," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Deng had urged Shanghai, China's largest city and economic
center, to take good advantage of favorable conditions to speed up
economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with his proposal, Shanghai's industrial sector
plans to achieve an annual increasing rate of 14 percent in the

Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Deng's three-step strategy, local economy of Yan'an

<P>
Yan'an, known as a sacred place of China's revolution, has seen
local residents' annual income rise to some 1,100 yuan, more than
ten times that of 1978.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government
today pledged to allocate a total of 10 Billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 16.6 million U.S. Dollars) for various
development projects mostly in the health sector in Tanzania.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Recalls Deng's Merits in Economic Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- For the past several days,
people across the country have vowed to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics under
the Communist Party's leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away last Wednesday at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the outstanding deeds of Deng Xiaoping, the people
said they had heartfelt feelings that there would not have been
earth-shaking changes in China without the basic principle of
taking economic development as the central task and persisting in
the Party's leadership and socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proven that the principle has brought about
benefits to the people and the country, and it is the only way to
build the country's prosperity and increase the people's
wellbeing," said Yang Chungui, vice-president of the Party School
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
This principle should remain unchanged for a long time to come,
just as what Deng Xiaoping had stressed time and again, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers who have become beneficiaries of Deng Xiaoping's
economic reform program remember Deng as a great reformer who
helped them get rich. They are able to build new brick houses and
buy household electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The mountainous village of Dazhai in Shanxi Province used to be
a national model designated by late Chairman Mao Zedong to exhibit
the spirit of socialism. However, the villagers lived poor lives
in those days.
</P>
<P>
Now annual per capita income of local farmers has reached 2,100
yuan (253 US dollars), 11 times that of 1980 when Deng Xiaoping
just began his economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
"Reform and opening-up bring about earth-shaking changes in
Dazhai," Guo Fenglian, secretary of the village's Communist Party
Committee, said with emotion.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, many factories were in great chaos under the
"Leftist" policy of class struggle during the "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-1977). With great care of Deng Xiaoping, the
enterprises restored normal production, according to Liu Benren,
general manager of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.

Deng Xiaoping set three criteria to assess the work in all
fields, namely whether it helps develop productive forces, enhance
China's comprehensive strength, and improve people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials and ordinary people agreed that the three
criteria greatly liberated people's mind and further pushed
forward China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, said that Deng was a pioneer in reforming
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jinlong, deputy-director of the Wenzhou City Commission for
Restructing the Economy, attributed the city's rapid economic

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Against Air-space Violation by Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has protested against
Turkish military planes' reconnaissance flight over its air-space.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said today at his
daily press briefing that Cyprus' Permanent Representative to
the U.N. has been instructed to make representations against
repeated violations of Cypriot air-space by Turkish reconnaissance
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on reports that two Turkish
military planes made reconnaissance flights over the sea area,
off the southern and western coastal towns of Limassol and
Paphos and island of Rhodes between Cyprus and Greece last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) report,
the two Turkish RF-4 planes, especially used for photographing,
were located by Cyprus National Guard radars.
</P>
<P>
CyBC said the two Turkish military aircraft were trying to
locate and photograph strategic places of importance to the
joint defense pact, agreed between the governments of Cyprus and
Greece in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also made special reference to the most recent
arrest of a young Greek Cypriot by the Turkish Cypriot side,
accusing it of creating tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
Sotiris Louca Siderenos, who was said to lost his way and
crossed into the Turkish-controlled northern areas, was apprehended
by Turkish Cypriot regime last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed the hope that the Turkish side
would show the necessary political will for a successful outcome
of the U.N.-sponsored indirect military dialog between the
National Guard and the Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
The dialog was conducted following a tension on this
eastern Mediterranean island since last Summer.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek Cypriots have been killed and a Turkish solider
was murdered since last June along the U.N.-controlled buffer
zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Recall Deng's Merits in Economic Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Communist Party
Committee, said that Deng Xiaoping had been back to his hometown
province twice since the country's economic reform, and every time
he would stress the importance of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Guided by his economic policy, the local GDP of Sichuan in 1996
was about four times that of 1980, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping also told people in his hometown to emancipate
their minds in bolstering agricultural and industrial production
so as to make the people have better lives.
</P>
<P>
In some old revolutionary bases, many local people have shaken
off poverty, thanks to Deng Xiaoping's thinking of "poverty is not
equal to socialism."
</P>
<P>
Outlining the country's modernization drive, Deng Xiaoping
depicted a three-step development strategy: China's per capita GNP
in 1990 doubles that in 1980 to make the people have adequate food
and clothing; per capita GNP by the end of the century doubles
again on the basis of 1990 figure to make the people lead a
comfortable life; by the middle of next century, per capita GNP
reaches the level in advanced countries to basicly achieve
modernization.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Deng's economic outline, China has been
carrying out economic reforms to establish a socialist market
economy and to open wider to the outside world, so as to achieve
sustained, fast and sound growth of the national economy, said
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The goal of quadrupling the per capita GNP, which was planned
for the first two development steps, has been achieved ahead of
schedule. China's comprehensive national power is strengthened and
people's living standards are greatly improved, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Just at this time, Deng Xiaoping passed away. Many officials
and the masses said that although Deng could not see his grand
goals fulfilled, the Chinese people can surely accomplish them by
next century under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core.

HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister
Stan Mudenge said today 18 African leaders will hold a two-day
Commonwealth roundtable meeting on Wednesday at Kasane game lodge
in northern Botswana to discuss democracy in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge, who chairs the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
on the Harare Declaration (CMAG), said the group, which met in
London early this month, resolved that Nigeria, Sierra Leone and
Gambia should speed up moves to embrace democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
He said following its visits to the three countries, the group
discovered that the countries had partially implemented the
recommendations of the Harare Declaration, with violations of
human rights still being evident in most of the countries.
</P>
<P>
He said while Nigeria, which was suspended from the
Commonwealth in 1995, had made great strides in improving its
human rights record, it still continued to detain opponents
without trial.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial group, he said, also noted that the continued
exclusion of a significant part of the Gambian civilians from the
political life of the country continued to be detrimental to the
cause of democracy in that country.
</P>
<P>
''In the meantime, the group welcomed the conclusion of the
electoral phase of the transition in Gambia marked by the
parliamentary elections of January 2 1997,'' said Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
CMAG was formed in 1995 as a Commonwealth mechanism for
dealing with serious or persistent violations of the Harare
Declaration principles arrived at in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad have agreed that their
countries' peace negotiations with Israel should be resumed from
where they were suspended.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency said this evening
that the Lebanese-Syrian summit, which was held in Damascus
Sunday, reiterated peace positions of the two countries and their
 continuous coordinations.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official comment made by Lebanon on
the details of the Summit meeting, the first since October.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese-Syrian summit reiterated the Lebanese-Syrian
positions toward the Middle East peace process and their
coordination of positions over any new developments," the LNNA
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese and Syrian presidents stressed a necessity to
resume the negotiations from where they were stopped and not
to return to the zero point," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Syria and Israel, which had been held
at the Wye Plantation, Maryland in the United States, were
indefinitely suspended last February amid a wave of bombings
in Israel, only three months before the Israeli Labor government
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state agreed that a re-start of the
peace negotiations from the beginning "is totally unacceptable,
and it contradicts the international practice," the LNNA added.
</P>
<P>
Damascus and Beirut feared that the right-wing Israeli
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would use the
Hebron agreement, signed not long ago between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority, as a tool for exerting pressures
upon the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The LNNA reported as well that the Syrian-Lebanese summit
dealt "with the bilateral relations and the domestic situation
in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The Summit came only one day after a meeting in Damascus
between Assad and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarad, who is
expected to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Syria said that former Israeli Labor government had promised a
withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights, but Netanyahu argued that
he would not be obliged by any unwritten commitment.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon upholds an adherence to an interlock of the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks and refuses to talk any peace
settlement with Israel before a tangible progress is achieved
between Syria and the Jewish state.

<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League General
Secretariat warned today that the continuation of building Israeli
settlements in the occupied Arab lands will have their grave
impact on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretariat, in a statement, said the erection of
settlements in Jerusalem and the Golan Heights constitute
"flagrant violation" of international legitimacy and run against
all United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Saying that these settlements will reflect negatively on the
peace process, the statement urged the UN Security Council and the
co-sponsors of the peace process, notably the United States, to
move quickly to force Israel to stop this settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretariat is holding contacts with the Arab
League delegation to the UN in coordination with the Organization
of Islamic Conference and the Non-aligned Movement to follow up
this issue and refer it to the Security Council, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat followed up with concern over the past few days
the building of a new settlement in southeast Jerusalem in Abu
Guneim Mount(known as Har Homa to Israelis), it said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said last Friday that
in spite of fierce Palestinian opposition he will submit to his
Cabinet a plan for the construction of a Jewish neighborhood in
disputed east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa project of 6,500 housing units is expected to win
overwhelming approval of Cabinet ministers, according to the
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are seek to make east Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, the capital of their future
state.

BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling coalition
and the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) failed to narrow
their difference over the controversial tax reform plan in
negotiations today, but agreed to continue their talks later this
week.
</P>
<P>
SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said after the three-hour talks
this afternoon, "There was no movement towards reconciliation."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his party's rejection of an increase in the
value-added tax (VAT) as proposed by the government to offset the
revenue shortfall induced by the tax reform.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at bolstering business competitiveness and job creation,
tax reform has become the German government's top domestic policy
priority and its main recipe to curb unemployment, which stands at
4.66 billion, the highest since 1933.
</P>
<P>
Under its proposed reform plan, the government wants to cut
income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage earners and 39 percent for
people with high incomes instead of the current marginal rates
ranging from 25.9 percent to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, the income tax cuts, along
with other cuts in corporate tax rates, would leave a shortfall in
state revenue of 44 billion Deutsche marks (26.3 billion U.S.
dollars) which the government wants to reduce to 30 billion marks
(17.9 billion dollars) by raising the 15 percent VAT to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its opposition to VAT increase, the SPD has also
said that while it backs cutting income tax for low-wage earners,
it wants to leave the 53 percent rate intact for the rich.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to strike a compromise with the SPD if the
reform plan is to survive the upper house of the German parliament,
Bundesrat, where the SPD controls a majority.
</P>
<P>
Given the wide difference between the government and the SPD,
German media expect a marathon bargaining between the two sides,
possibly until April or May.

<HEADLINE> Britain Agrees with Proposal of Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- British Special Representative
for Cyprus Sir David Hannay has agreed with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides' proposal on the island's complete
demilitarization, a Cypriot government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides, the spokesman, told reporters that "the
British believe that Cyprus should be demilitarized as part of a
solution."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides' demilitarization proposal has been welcomed
abroad, the spokesman said, adding that it has not been
dealt with so far due to Turkey's "utter rejection."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides made clear that President Clerides' proposal does
not concern British bases troops but those of the Cyprus
Republic's National Guard and the Turkish occupation army.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial power, has retained two
sovereign military bases on the island under the 1960 Treaty on
Establishment of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides' demilitarization proposal, which was
submitted to former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
in December 1993, provides for the disbanding of the Cyprus
National Guard, the handing over of its weapons and equipment to
U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In return, the proposal also calls for the withdrawal of
the Turkish forces and the disbanding of the Turkish Cypriot
armed forces, the handing over of their weapons and military
equipment to the custody of UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened and occupied the northern third of the island
following an Athens-backed coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today called on the Palestine Authority (PA) to insist on
legal rights of the Palestinian people and not to compromise in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, UAE's news agency WAM
reported.
</P>
<P>
UAE Defense Minister and Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Muhammad bin
Rashid al-Maktoum called on the PA and Palestinian negotiators
for the Israeli-Palestine peace talks not to compromise and give
up legal rights of the Palestinian people, no matter what the
pressure is, WAM said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made the remarks in Dubai during his
meeting with Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, who is currently
visiting the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed UAE's support to the Palestinian
people, saying that the UAE government and people will continue their
support for the Palestinian people until they can enjoy freedom
and independence.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen began his visit to the UAE from Friday to seek the
UAE's political and financial support for the PA, and to discuss
with UAE officials the current Arab developments.
</P>

It was not known for the time being whether the UAE government
has promised to provide financial support to the Palestinians, but
some diplomats here said the UAE has financed settlement projects
for the Palestinians in Jerusalem and Gaza Strip before.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen's visit to the UAE comes after Israel's right-wing
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu last week announced the

<HEADLINE> EU President Calls for New Vision of EU-US Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Union (EU) Jacques Santer recently called for a new shared vision
for the future of the relationship between the EU and the United
States, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The transatlantic relations do not mean anything if they are
not "sustained by a strong determination to build a real EU-U.S.
partnership," Santer said in a speech made in Brussels on February
21.
</P>
<P>
He said that any long-term vision of Euro-American relations
must recognize that the present concentration of power and
influence was being gradually diluted.
</P>
<P>
The EU chief called for a new shared vision for the future,
saying that the U.S. should be ready to "share influence and power
more equally with its European partners" and to understand the
"specificity of this unique animal which we call the European
Union."
</P>
<P>
He explained that there was no point in criticizing the EU for
not behaving as if it were a single nation state, adding that the
EU needed the cooperation of various emerging international forces
to address global and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that the EU and the U.S. must help solve the
difficulties that the United Nations face. "UN bashing might be
fashionable until we discover that we are shooting ourselves in
the foot," he said.
