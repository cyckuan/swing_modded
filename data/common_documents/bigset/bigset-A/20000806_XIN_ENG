<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Calls for World Free From Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Saturday called for global efforts to free the world from
the threats of all categories of arms.
</P>
<P>
"Let peace and development be our agenda for the new century,"
Hasina said in a message on the occasion of the Hiroshima Day.
</P>
<P>
She also called for taking a renewed pledge on this day to
engage all efforts of mankind toward preserving the human race
with its rich diversity.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated Bangladesh's unequivocal
commitment to free the world from all weapons of mass destruction,
especially the nuclear weapons for the cause of world peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Referring to meaningful pledges made by the international
community toward durable peace since the Hiroshima incident,
Hasina said the international community achieved much in its
efforts to rid the world of chemical, biological and inhumane
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But, she added, the huge stockpile of nuclear arsenals at the
advent of the 21st century remained as a stark reminder of horrors
of Hiroshima and the single most threat to the existence of
mankind.

<HEADLINE> Joint Syrian-Iraqi Committee Meets in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Syrian-Iraqi Committee
met for the first time in 20 years here Saturday, chaired by Syrian
Economy Minister Mohammed al Imadi and his Iraqi counterpart
Mohammad Mehdi Salah.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the committee discussed means of developing
economic and trade relations between both countries in the context
of the U.N. resolutions, according to the Syrian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue discussions through their technical
sub-committee made up for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to study several issues, including
boosting trade exchange, developing economic relations, re-
activating technical and cultural relations and completing talks on
cooperation in the field of transport.
</P>
<P>
They will consider particularly the exploitation of railway
links between the two countries and the use of Syria's
Mediterranean ports of Lattaquieh and Tartus for Iraq's imports and
exports. An agreement has already been signed on Iraq's importing
million tons of goods via Tartus this year.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two neighbors has not risen to the
expected level, as Syrian exports to Iraq hit 400 million U.S.
dollar only after the U.N. oil-for-food program was launched,
compared to over 1 billion dollars of goods exported to Iraq by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria backed Iran in its eight-year bloody war with Iraq in the
1980s. But Baghdad-Damascus relations began to improve in 1997.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said al-Sahaf paid two visits to
Syria in late June and early July and was received by the new
president, Bashar al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Tourism Raises Gold Demand in UAE, Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Brisk tourism in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia has boosted gold demand in the two
countries, showed a latest report issued by Dubai Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The report said that UAE has witnessed a flourishing tourism in
recent years, particularly in Dubai, which is considered to be the
biggest gold importer in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Gold Council (WGC), over 90 percent of
the 1.5-2 million tourists coming to Dubai each year end up with
buying gold.
</P>
<P>
The more than 5 million pilgrims to Saudi Arabia every year for
the Haj and Umrah, most of them coming from the subcontinent,
southeast Asia and Africa, also make Saudi gold market fizz.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities expect 10 million tourists and pilgrims this
year, which will further stimulate gold and jewellery consumption
there.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis tend to use this large number of pilgrims to the
very best possible way by introducing new products with religious
designs," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE ranks 13th regarding annual demand for gold at 79.7 tons
while Saudi Arabia comes fourth at 199 tons, behind India, the U.S.
and China.
</P>
<P>
The report also said gold bars and coins are exempted from an
import tax while finished and semi-finished gold and jewellery are
levied a 12 percent tax Saudi Arabia and a 1.5-4 percent in the
UAE. But neither have sales tax on the metal.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Cargo Ship for International Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rocket with the supply ship blasted off from the Baikonur
cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 10:27 p.m. Moscow time (1827 GMT), and
was smoothly put into its pre-determined orbit at 10:36 p.m.
Moscow time (1836 GMT), Interfax cited the Russian Aerospace
Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cargo ship was lifted into space by the Soyuz-U in
accordance with launch calculations done by the agency. It was
launched in preparation for a long-term expedition to ISS
scheduled to begin October 30.
</P>
<P>
This is the first unmanned cargo flight to the ISS. Mission
Control in the town of Korolyov outside Moscow has been instructed
to control the flight and Progress' docking maneuvers with the
first ISS elements already in orbit.
</P>
<P>
The basic cargo is fuel reserves to be used for correcting the
orbit of the previously linked ISS modules Zarya-Unity-Zvezda,
which are in an orbit with a 380-kilometer apogee and a 352-
kilometer perigee, said the Mission Control.
</P>
<P>
The similar parameters for the pre-determined working orbit of
the ISS are 460 and 410 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Progress M1-3 will deliver to the ISS 2,434.2 kilograms of
cargo, including 1,559.4 kilograms of fuel and oxidizer for
raising the station's orbit, plus 260 kilograms of fuel for
ensuring the station's orientation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cargo ship is to bring to the station
scientific equipment and instruments to back up the station's on-
board systems, including flight guidance and navigation systems,
the electricity and heat supply network, gas and water tanks for
the ISS as well as linen, personal hygiene effects and individual
protection, and on-board technical manuals.
</P>
<P>
This is also the third launch of the newly modified version of
a cargo ship in the Progress M1 series, the so-called "space truck.
" The first ship was launched for the Russian orbital complex Mir
on February 1, the second on April 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
The docking of Progress M1 with the first elements of the
International Space Station has been scheduled for 00:14 a.m.
Moscow time on August 9 (2014 GMT on August 8).
</P>
<P>
The Russian space agency's press service has said that yet
another two short-term missions to ISS by U.S. space shuttles and
a Russian Progress M1-4 cargo ship are planned as part of
preparations for the first long-term expedition to the
International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
Five American astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts will set
out on expedition STS-106 aboard the space shuttle Atlantis to the
ISS on September 8.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis will deliver to the station a double cargo module, and
the crew will shift the cargo from the shuttle and Progress M1-3
over to the ISS. This expedition is scheduled to last until
September 19.
</P>
<P>
Yet, another Russian Progress M1-4 cargo ship is due to lift
off for the station on September 14, and on September 28 an U.S.-
Japanese crew are to set out on expedition STS-92 aboard the
Discovery space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
Now American astronaut William Sheered and Russian cosmonauts,
ship Commander Yuri Gidzenko and flight engineer Sergei Krikalev
are training for a four-month expedition aboard a Russian ship
Soyuz TM, scheduled for October 30.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Calls for Total Cancellation of Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) heads of state Sunday gathered in
Windhoek, Namibia with calls for the total scrapping of debt in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of this year's summit meeting,
outgoing SADC chairman and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
said five SADC member countries, namely Mozambique, Angola, Zambia,
Tanzania and Malawi, are experiencing acute debt problems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Mozambique the external debt per head is
almost seven times the gross national product per capita, while
Zambia in the 1990s has spent more than 30 percent of its national
budget on debt repayment and only 10 percent on social services.
</P>
<P>
This dire situation deserves immediate attention from creditor
nations and international financial institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "improved economic prospects can only come
into reality in the SADC countries, in Africa and in the
developing world at large if the current economically debilitating
debt is forgiven in its totality."
</P>
<P>
The SADC heads of state will meet in a closed session Monday
morning to discuss the conflict in the democratic Republic of the
Congo, give green light to the revised SADC free trade pact and
several other minor protocols and approve a regional position on
acceptance of western drug companies' lower price offers on AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Another key issue at the meeting will be the restructuring of
SADC, including SADC's controversial security organ now headed by
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Calls for Renewed Peace Efforts in Congo and Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) heads of state Sunday gathered in
Windhoek, Namibia calling for renewed peace efforts in the war-
torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of this year's summit meeting,
outgoing SADC chairman and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
said moves to revive the faltering DRC peace talks are dealt a
blow by DRC President Laurent Kabila's boycott of the summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
General-Secretary of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim and presidents of Seychelles and Mauritius were
also absent from the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
SADC is gravely concerned about the situation in the DRC and
Angola and is working closely with the OAU and the United Nations
to end the conflicts, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
He said the humanitarian situation in the two countries is also
a matter of grave concern, where thousands of people have been
displaced.
</P>
<P>
"These people are condemned to die of hunger and deprivation
unless assistance is provided as a matter of urgency. Once again
we would like to appeal to the magnanimity of the international
community to provide the much-needed humanitarian assistance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to throw SADC's weight behind beleaguered
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe when he said the former heroes
of freedom struggle in that country are now being wrongly labeled
as anti-democratic and "even dictators".
</P>
<P>
"We can not in SADC condone these views. We are the democrats
and we want democracy to work according to the will of our people
in each one of our countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC heads of state will meet in a closed session Monday
morning to discuss the DRC conflict, give green light to the
revised SADC free trade pact and several other minor protocols and
approve a regional position on acceptance of western drug
companies' lower price offers on AIDS drugs.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Insists Burundi Peace Deal be Signed in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Burundian peace facilitator,
former South African president Nelson Mandela still maintains that
the peace agreement aimed at ending the seven-year ethnic civil
war in Burundi will be signed on its scheduled date of August 28
despite the recent announcement by key warring parties that they
will not sign the accord.
</P>
<P>
Mark Bomani, Mandela's top aid and leader of the mediation team,
said here on Sunday that when meeting with Burundian President
Pierre Buyoya this weekend in Johannesburg, South Africa, Mandela
reaffirmed that the signing of the peace deal will take place at
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"The facilitator will like the negotiating parties to come with
a consensus on all the four issues (they are negotiating about),
or some of them, and it is hoped that the revised document will be
embodied in the
final agreement for signing on August 28," Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
Heads of the 19 Burundian negotiating parties and groups will
meet in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha beginning on Monday to
resolve the four outstanding issues they still disagree.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the scheduled signing of the peace deal on
August 28 will come true is set to be known at the end of the
Arusha meeting, which is expected to clear the ground for the
power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, the core issues on which the parties are
expected to focus include the electoral system, the leadership of
the proposed transitional government, questions concerning the
guarantees where things are not clear, and the integration of
armed rebel groups into the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Mandela circulated a draft peace plan three weeks ago in Arusha,
but the main Hutu rebel group in Burundi, the CNDD-FDD (the
National Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for the
Defense of Democracy) announced that it will not sign the peace
agreement because they had not been involved in the peace talks
since it began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
A day later, Buyoya's military government declared in Bujumbura
that it too will not sign the accord unless a cease-fire agreement
is signed first and Buyoya is allowed to preside over the
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft accord, the Tutsi minority, which has dominated
Burundi's political and economic life since independence, would
have to hand over power to a democratically elected government in
three years' time.
</P>
<P>
At least 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
since fighting in the tiny central African country began in
October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's
first democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> Second Israeli-Palestinian Summit Premature: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that he thought conditions for a second Israeli-
Palestinian summit talks for reaching a peace agreement are
premature.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the cabinet meeting on Sunday, Barak said that it is
still too early to determine whether the Palestinians are ready to
achieve progress in the peace process, officials in Barak's office
said.
</P>
<P>
Assessing the current situation after having talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday, Barak said that in his
opinion, Arab states will not pressure Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to make further concessions.
</P>
<P>
However, these countries may act as safety net for Arafat if
Israel and the Palestinians finally come to an agreement, said
Barak.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday, there were Israeli media speculations that Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators were holding secret talks and preparing
for another summit following the botched Camp David summit talks
last month.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David talks, hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton,
failed to resolve core issues, especially the status of Jerusalem
and the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland,
to lay grounds for a permanent peace deal between Israel and the
Palesnitians by September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has since launched a campaign to gain support for
Palestinian cause by visiting France, Saudi Arabia, Morocco,
Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To counteract Arafat's move, Barak announced Sunday that he will
dispatch two of his confidants to a number of countries to
expatiate Israel's views regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who also holds the
Transport portfolio, will visit Russia, Germany and Turkey in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, a possible
candidate to replace David Levy as foreign Minister, will visit
Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Levy resigned from his post last Wednesday and took leave of his
senior ministry staff on Sunday by vehemently criticizing Barak's
approach in handling the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Asks for More Active Turkish Role in Mideast Peacemaking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has asked Turkish government to play a more active role in the
Mideast peace process, especially in talks with Israel over the
fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Saturday to brief Turkish leader on the
latest development in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, has met
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency
reported on Sunday. .
</P>
<P>
Arafat is launching a campain to rally support after the failure
of Camp David talks with Israel near Washington last month. He had
visited France, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During 15 days of tough talks, the two sides failed to reach
consensus over core issues, especially the status of Jerusalem, to
pave way for clinch a permanent peace deal by September. Both sides
want the holy city as their capital.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Turkish leaders, Arafat complained about
policies adopted by Israeli administration over Jerusalem while
asking for Turkish support.
</P>
<P>
The Ottoman Turks had ruled Jerusalem, as well as the rest of
the Middle East, for 400 years until early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders have expressed their support for Arafat and
assured that they would discuss the issue during meetings with
Israeli officials.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli ministers were reported to visit Turkey next week.
They will explain Israel's position and update Turkish authorities
about the current situation in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders said that they will stress Ankara's sensitivity
over Jerusalem and urge the Israeli government to review its
policies over the holy places in the city. But it made no clear
support for Arafat's decision to unilaterally declare a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's talks, Turkish leaders told Arafat his decision to
unilaterally declare Palestinian statehood on September 13 "would
not affect Turkish-Palestinian relations because we have already
recognized you."
</P>
<P>
It was indicated that Turkey has already recognized Palestinian
independence by allowing the Palestinians to maintain an embassy in
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
When the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid,
Spain, in 1991, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Office
in Ankara was turned into an embassy.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that this was different from support of
Palestinian statehood to be announced unilaterally on September 13.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders have advised Arafat to be moderate towards his
decision, saying that the a unilateral declaration of Palestinian
state will bring about confusion and chaos in the region and should
be thought over.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Turkey is trying to pursue a balanced
position between its Muslim brother Palestine and its Mideast ally
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has formed close military, political and economic ties
with Israel in order to contain their common rivals Syria and Iran
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was among the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948 when is was founded, but lowered its diplomatic
representation to Israel to charge d'affaires level in 1981 when
Israel declared Jerusalem as its "eternal" capital. It also closed
its consulate-general in Arab East Jerusalem as well.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey raised its diplomatic relations with Israel to
ambassadorial level in 1991 when it turned the PLO Office in Ankara
into an embassy.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Awarded SADC Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela was on Sunday awarded the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) Sir Seretse Khama SADC Medal.
</P>
<P>
The medal, for people who have made outstanding contributions
towards achieving the regional organization's goals, was presented
to Mandela at the two-day SADC heads of state summit meeting which
opened in Windhoek, Namibia on Sunday afternoon, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandela received the medal for his role in promoting peace in
SADC and Africa as a whole and for his leadership of South Africa
after the 1994 democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is also recognized for leading the South African people
in "their heroic struggle against apartheid and colonial
domination", SADC said.
</P>
<P>
The previous recipients of the award, established in 1985, were
four former presidents, namely Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,
Ketumile Masire of Botswana, Agostino Neto of Angola and Samora
Machel of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Asked on his arrival at Windhoek's Eros airport earlier on
Sunday what he thought SADC should do about the ongoing conflict
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mandela said SADC has
highly capable leaders who are able to address and resolve the
problems facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on whether he has spoken to SADC leaders on a
request by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that he mediate in the
Middle East peace process, Mandela said "it's not very good when
you are dealing with heads of state to announce what you are doing
or propose to do with the press."
</P>
<P>
"Respect for heads of state means that we should give them the
privilege of knowing what we are doing and then in due course we
can involve the press," he said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela Sunday urged southern African leaders to
redouble their efforts to bring peace and stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the prestigious Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Sir Seretse Khama Medal at the opening of this
year's SADC heads of state summit meeting in Windhoek, Namibia,
Mandela said it was with sadness that he noted parts of the region
were still struggling under destructive conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Once more, those who suffer most cruelly under these conflicts
are the ordinary citizens, and especially the most vulnerable,
namely the women and children," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "it is incumbent upon us to redouble our
efforts to bring peace and stability to our entire region so that
our people can develop to the full their human potential and live
lives of dignity."
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the collective wisdom of
leadership in the region will bring a speedy and lasting end to
those conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Deal Firmly With Unruly Students: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Higher Education and
Technology Minister Herbert Murerwa Sunday said his ministry will
deal firmly with unruly students disrupting learning at
institutions.
</P>
<P>
College students should appreciate the contributions that both
parents and taxpayers are making in funding their education, the
minister said while officiating at the graduation ceremony of
about 500 students of the United College of Education in Bulawayo,
the country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfair for students to engage in demonstrations
without appreciating that the government is providing them with
quality education at highly subsidized rates.
</P>
<P>
"These students fail to appreciate their privileged status
compared with the majority of students in the country who are in
private colleges where no such government support is available,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged disciplined students to brush aside
intimidation by the unruly elements, saying "my ministry will deal
firmly with these unruly elements."
</P>
<P>
The ministry has recently closed Harare Polytechnic, Harare
Institute of Technology and Gweru Polytechnic following violent
demonstrations there against the proposed privatization of
catering services.

<HEADLINE> Syria Wants Just, Comprehensive Peace: Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- President Bashar al-Assad said on
Sunday that Syria wants to achieve just and comprehensive peace
according to U.N. resolutions, and it is willing to resume Middle
East peace talks when Israel is ready.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with Edward Walker, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, at the
People's Palace here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Walker is the first U.S. official to visit Syria since Assad was
sworn in as president on July 10 following the death of his father,
Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Walker arrived Sunday morning in Damascus, the fifth leg of his
Middle East tour, which has taken him to Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
Jordan and Tunisia since the failed Camp David summit between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh, who had held talks with Walker earlier on the current
situation in the Middle East and the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Shareh on the "results" of the summit, Walker was
trying, as he did all the way, to convince Arab leaders of the
necessity of flexibility in dealing with Israel, especially in the
Jerusalem issue and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that Shareh insisted "Any peaceful
solution should be fair and comprehensive, ensure the full Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories to the borders of
June 4, 1967, and guarantee the rights of the Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for Israel to withdraw from Arab East
Jerusalem and for the guarantee of legitimate national rights of
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Syria and Israel have stalled since
January. Damascus demanded a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from
the Golan Heights they captured in 1967, which was rejected by the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel feared such a withdrawal would give the Syrians access to
the Sea of Galilee, thus endangering its main source of fresh
water.

<HEADLINE> Falcons From UAE Released in Northern Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- As many as 111 falcons sent by
President Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) were released in Gilgit and Hunza valleys recently,
the Associated Press of Pakistan reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The falcons were airlifted from Abu Dhabi in a special aircraft
to Gilgit.
</P>
<P>
The release of falcons was jointly organized by the UAE
Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency and the
Falcon Foundation of Pakistan under a Falcon Release Project.
</P>
<P>
The project's aim is to resuscitate the depleting falcon
population for which the northern areas of Pakistan are considered
an ideal habitat by international wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
Gilgit had been the site of earlier releases in 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
These falcons were released 130 kilometers north of Gilgit
where sufficient water and food are available.
</P>
<P>
Generally an area with a radius of five kilometers, having food
and water, can easily sustain one falcon.
</P>
<P>
These falcons will be an added attraction for tourists from all
over the world in the most fascinating northern areas of Pakistan,
known for their majestic peaks, wildlife and natural environment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Non-Communist Party Personages Inspect Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Chinese non-
Communist Parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce and noted persons without party affiliation have called
for promoting greater development of western China according to
laws of nature and of the market.
</P>
<P>
After completing inspection tours of 12 provinces, autonomous
regions and Chongqing Municipality in the past two months, the
delegations urged the local and central governments to draw
lessons from economic development worldwide as well as in east
China, and to formulate a long-term plan for the development of
western China.
</P>
<P>
They called for the development of western China to abide by
the principle of achieving unity between ecological and economic
efficiency, resource allocation and protection, regional
development and overall development, and short-term interests and
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Arranged by the United Front Work Department of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, the delegations
consisted of more than 200 leaders of non-Communist parties and
experts.
</P>
<P>
The delegations were led by Vice-Chairmen of the Standing
Committee of the National People Congress Ding Shisun, Cheng Siwei,
Xu Jialu and Jiang Zenghua, and Vice-Chairmen of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference Wang Zhaoguo, Sun Fuling, Jing Shuping, Luo Haocai,

<HEADLINE> Intel to Set Up Internet Exchange Center in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp will set up its first
Internet exchange architectural development center in Beijing
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The move is to accelerate the development of networking and
communications solutions in China, said Tom Franz, vice-president
and general manager of the network processing group with Intel
Group.
</P>
<P>
"This is another clear demonstration of the company's support
for Chinese customers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Intel Internet exchange architecture is a framework for
designing powerful and flexible networking and telecommunications
equipment using re-programmable silicon, which allows systems
designers to add network functionality cost-effectively.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Internet exchange architecture, Intel has
introduced a developer's tool kit to help facilitate product
design and enable equipment suppliers to provide post-sale product
enhancements to their customers.
</P>
<P>
"Through the use of standard software interfaces, programmable
silicon and readily available development tools, Intel and out
customers can look forward to ushering in a new era of networking,
" Franz said.
</P>
<P>
New capabilities, such as wire-speed voice, video and data
services, can be added to existing equipment simply by
reprogramming the network processor, which allows suppliers to
extend the life and value of their designs.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic telecom companies have shown interest in the
project. "The technology level of application specific integrated
circuit in China has lagged, said a representative of Huawei, one
of the four non-state telecom companies in China.
</P>
<P>
"Intel Internet exchange architecture provides us with an
opportunity to catch up with the world-class development trend,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Population May Reach 210.8 Million in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- When the world's population hits 9
billion by the middle of the new century at the current growth
rate, Bangladesh is likely to be crammed with 210.8 million people
after 50 years,according to a data sheet of the U.S.-based
Population Reference Bureau(PRB) received here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ranking eighth at present, Bangladesh will remain pegged to the
same status while some of the countries would have shifted from
their present positions.
</P>
<P>
The just-released World Population Data Sheet 2000 containing
the demographic data worldwide showed that the world is expected
to add 3 billion more people to reach a total of 9 billion by 2050.
</P>
<P>
And the PRB, in its press release, made the grim predictions
that the current period of rapid population growth would continue
for at least another 50 years to 2050.
</P>
<P>
The PRB annual report on world demographic trends also showed
that the populace of Bangladesh is doubled within 38 years and the
rate of natural increase is 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The world population in 2000 totals 6,067,267,000, of which the
less developed countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America account
for 80 percent, but represent 99 percent of the global population
growth.
</P>
<P>
"The highest growth rates are found in the poorest countries,
despite stated policies to reduce population growth and despite
high levels of HIV/AIDS, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa," the
release said.
</P>
<P>
At stake are the successes of efforts to protect the
environment,combat growing poverty and solve water and food supply
problems under the threat of world population explosion, said the
release.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Readjust Agricultural Mixture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China will make further efforts to
readjust the mixture of its agriculture in the coming years so as
to adapt to economic globalization and the effects of China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, a high-ranking official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chengguo, vice-minister of agriculture, said that the
readjustment also aims to enhance the competitiveness of China's
farm produce on the international market, increase farmers'
incomes and strengthen agriculture's pillar status in China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium on agricultural cooperation across the Taiwan
Straits, Liu said modern agriculture is expected to be promoted in
the coastal areas and the suburbs of large cities in east China so
as to turn out more export-oriented farm produce with high added
value.
</P>
<P>
In central China, he said, large-scale and high-yielding
commodity grain and fodder production and processing bases are to
be set up, while in western China, high-effeiciency agriculture
based on environmental protection and water saving is to be
established.
</P>
<P>
He said that the state will rationally reduce the growing area
for cotton, sugar and tobacco on the basis of stabilizing high-
yielding and high-quality cotton and sugar fields.
</P>
<P>
At the symposium, Liu also expounded the state's policies on
reducing the areas of low-yielding grain and cotton, developing
cattle-raising projects, popularizing agricultural technologies
and diversifying farm produce varieties.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- This east China city has built a
library named after a U.S. clergyman who risked his life filming
Japanese soldiers' atrocities here in 1937.
</P>
<P>
John Magge filmed massacre scenes with a film camera when the
city fell to the Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
The 105 minutes of film footage is strong evidence of the
Nanjing Massacre, in which more than 300,000 Chinese were brutally
killed by Japanese soldiers, historians say.
</P>
<P>
The massacre shocked the world, but there are some Japanese who
attempt to deny it.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that Magge's film footage is the only film
record of the Nanjing Massacre that has been discovered so far.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, the church in Xiaguan District where Magge preached
was turned into a secondary school library. The local government
has now named it the John Magge Library.

<HEADLINE> Top Palestinian Legislator Rules out Three-Way Summit Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)
Speaker Ahmed Qurei Sunday ruled out the possibility of holding a
three-way summit in the near future unless the Israeli government
shows real flexibility in its negotiations with the Palestinians.
Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, said in a broadcast interview that
there are no negotiations on the final status issues at present.
</P>
<P>
"The now and then bilateral meetings between Palestinian and
Israeli officials only touched upon the interim period issues," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, who also leads the Palestinian team to the final
status talks with Israel, stressed the Israeli side showed "no sign
of flexibility" in the key issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian
refugees during last month's Camp David summit which failed to
produce an agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian refugees issue, Qurei said that "during the
summit at Camp David, the Israeli side attempted to detour around
by promising to permit hundreds of refugee families to return home
without recognizing the U.N. Security Council Resolution 164 in
this regard."
</P>
<P>
He called upon the U.S. administration to adopt a fair and
neutral stand as a Middle East peace mediator and not to take
Israeli interests as its own.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli leaders failed to hammer out a framework
agreement on permanent peace during the 15-day three-way summit
sponsored by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David near
Washington last month.

<HEADLINE> Israeli New President Receives Congratulations From Jordanian King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Having been elected as
Israel's new president for nearly a week, Moshe Katsav Sunday
received a massage of congratulations from Jordanian King
Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Abdullah expressed the hope that during Katsav's

term of office, the Israeli-Arab peace process will be advanced,
according to officials in the president's office.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Katsav also received a letter of congratulations from
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who expressed his hope that the
ongoing Oslo process will continue and wished Katsav well in the
new position.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, a right-wing legislator from the opposition Likud party,
stunningly defeated Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres, a
candidate nominated by the ruling One Israel coalition, in last
Monday's secret ballot in the Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Leaders around the world sent congratulations to the newly-
elected president since then.
</P>
<P>
Notably, several Arab leaders kept their silence for some time
because they have more close relations with Peres, former Israeli
prime minister and a Nobel Peace Laureate for his peace efforts to
masterplan the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords in early 1990s.
They also worry a right-wing president will tamper with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Pour More Money Into Education Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
build nearly 8,200 new classrooms in public schools next year at a
total cost of 3.2 billion pesos (about 73 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new funding will address 30 percent of the current shortage
of some 25,800 classrooms nationwide, according to a report of the
Philippines News Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted House Majority Leader Eduardo Gullas as
saying the 3.2 billion pesos funding for the School Building
Program in the proposed 2001 national budget is 1.2 billion pesos
(about 27 million dollars) or 60 percent higher than the
allocation of 2 billion pesos (about 45 million dollars) for this
year.
</P>
<P>
The funding accounts for about 5 percent of the government's
proposed 73-billion-peso (about 1.66 billion dollars) public
infrastructure spending program for next year, Gullas said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Department of Education, Culture and Sports to
come up with "creative" schemes to address the massive lack of
classrooms,saying the government alone cannot solve the problem on
its own.
</P>
<P>
The department must find ways to involve other sectors, such as
drawing up an adopt-a-school program that would involve the
country's top 1,000 private corporations and leading civic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker also suggested a cost-sharing scheme with selected
local government units in the construction and maintenance of new
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
"We need a deliberate multi-year plan to wipe out the classroom
shortage and give more meaning to the mandate of the constitution
for government to provide free basic education," he said.

Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The country's total exports are 8.4 billion dollars yearly and

</P>
<P>
Pakistan's coastal line is 1,120 kilometers long, 30 percent of
which is in Sindh and 70 percent in Balochistan.
</P>
<P>
The value-added exports have become essential to fully
utilizing the sea resources, keeping in view the international
standard and costs, the APP report said. It added that substantial
foreign exchange can be earned through processing of seafood
besides a manifold increase in exports.

will further reform its agriculture in the years to come, as it
will soon become a member of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said agricultural reforms will provide new historical
opportunities for people across the Taiwan straits to carry out
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, the delegates will discuss methods of co-
operation and fields for investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government approved experimental areas in the
provinces of Heilongjiang, Fujian, Hainan and Guangdong for
businessmen across the straits to work together in developing
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The experimental areas have got funds, better strains of seeds
and technology from Taiwan for producing high-yield crops.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland has become a hot spot for Taiwan investors.
During the first half of the year, both the number of Taiwanese-
invested projects and the capital from Taiwanese businessmen
exceeded those of the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By June, the Chinese mainland had approved more than 45,000
Taiwan-funded projects, with a contractual value of over 46.6
billion U.S. dollars, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation and the Heilongjiang provincial
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arrived in Ankara on
Saturday to ask for support for the Palestinian state he is
intending to declare on September 13.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
and President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Arafat said that "Turkey is a
respectable country all over the world."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak sent a letter
to Ecevit, saying that "declaration of an independent Palestinian
state would cause chaos."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government will send two ministers to Turkey next
week as a counter-measure for Arafat's efforts to seek support.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Energy and Natural Resources Ministry has issued a
circular, asking public enterprises, municipalities and public
institutions to minimize the electricity they use to illuminate
their buildings during daytime.
</P>
<P>
Illumination of billboards, windows and streets will also be
limited and it might even be stopped completely when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- After 2,000 hectares of forest were burnt out in southern
Turkish province Adana on Friday, another 2,700 hectares of
forested land were burnt in the region of southwestern Manavgat
river on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, a total of 20,000 hectares of forest land have
been destroyed by fire in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rabbi's Comment on Holocaust Triggers Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's
sermon on Saturday, in which he described the six million Jews that
were murdered during the Holocaust as reincarnations of sinners of
the past generations, evoked angry responses on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said at a government meeting that the
words of the eminent rabbi, who is the spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, the third largest political party with
17 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Parliament), are offensive to
many Holocaust survivors and not fitting for a man in his position.
</P>
<P>
Barak added that it is surprising for a party that leads the
social struggle in Israel to say something that hurts the unity of
the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Israel Radio, Yosef Lapid, leader of the
secular Shinui party, said that these were "in his words he is
confirming Hitler's idea that Jews are sinners." He added that
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef should be kept out of sight from the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg said that there is nothing new in
Yosef's sermon. He argued that the rabbi's statement is based on a
known theological idea and is a way of trying to cope with the
Holocaust on a religious level.
</P>
<P>
President Moshe Katsav expressed the assurance that Rabbi Yosef
felt deeply over the atrocities of the Holocaust. "I'm sure he has
real feelings and suffers daily like every Jew and every person who
has a heart," Katsav said.
</P>
<P>
"The subject of reincarnation is a theological one and I don't
wish to become involved in it, but I regret any remark which hurts
someone's feelings," said the new president who vowed to work for
the unity of the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
Shas Knesset member Shlomo Benizri said Rabbi Ovadia Yosef does
not mean to hurt anyone with the comment, but to explain the
concept of reincarnation, which according to the former minister of
health, is one of the concepts of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Benizri also insisted that there are no coalition contacts
between Shas and Barak's ruling One Israel bloc.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the former largest ruling partner in Barak's government,
quit the coalition on the eve of the prime minister's departure for
the July 11-25 Camp David peace summit, for fear that Barak might
make too many concessions to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the party caused a prolonged government crisis with the
left-wing Meretz party over funding for its education network,
which led to the resignation of three ministers from Meretz in late
June.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports saying that Barak is still interested in
bringing Shas back to the shaky government, which now has only 40
seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Shas leader Eli Yishai said on Sunday that his party is not
interested in money or in five ministers and therefore it is
unlikely to rejoin the coalition. "We have our red lines," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he would agree to meet with Barak, if asked,
but that this would be a matter of good manners and not a desire to
participate in a new government.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef criticized Barak for the way in which he
dealt with the Camp David talks. During his weekly sermon on
Saturday, he said, "Barak has no brain and races to reach an
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The rabbi added that he does not trust the Palestinians and
said, "all they want are parts of East Jerusalem and to hurt the
Jews living there."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Barak's return from the Camp David summit,
however, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef expressed the willingness to rejoin the
coalition, saying that a peace deal that can protect human life is
more important than something that is only of symbolic value.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that sources from Shas predicted Sunday
that Shas will not return to Barak's coalition.

<HEADLINE> Barak Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak reshuffled his cabinet Sunday morning, naming four of his
ministers to hold concurrent posts.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday morning's weekly cabinet meeting, Communications
Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer took up the Construction and Housing
Minister post, while Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon
also got an additional portfolio of Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
Both of them had been ministers in their respective new posts in
the previous government, according to a cabinet statement issued by
Barak's Office.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was announced that Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
would also head the Religious Affairs Ministry, and Finance
Minister Avraham Shochat would act as National Infrastructure
Minister concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The Barak cabinet had been reduced from 23 ministers to 12
ministers following a series of cabinet crisis regarding the peace
talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Three ministers from the secular Meretz party, Education
Minister Yossi Sarid, Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen, and
Agriculture Minister Haim Oron resigned from the cabinet, but
remained in the coalition, in June due to their differences with
Barak over funding allocations for the religious Shas party's dept-
ridden educational network.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, four ministers of the ultra-Orthodox party, along
with Yisrael Ba'aliya leader and former interior minister Natan
Sharansky, and National Religious Party leader and former housing
minister Yitzhak Levy, resigned all the same ahead of the Israeli-
Palestinian peace summit at Camp David last month to avoid
responsibility for any peace agreement reached by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, once Barak's close political ally,
also submitted his resignation letter last Wednesday, complaining
that Barak made too many concessions at the Camp David talks, which
nevertheless failed to reach a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
In an irrelevant development, Transport Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai was forced to resign early this year for his involvement
in a sexual harassment scandal.
</P>
<P>
So before Sunday's reshuffle, Barak had to assume 10 ministerial
responsibilities, excluding the Defense Minister portfolio he had
assumed since the establishment of the government. Mordechai's
ministerial post was hold concurrently by his Center party
colleague and Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak has no right to appoint new minister to his
cabinet without Knesset (Parliament) approval, which had begun its
summer recess last Wednesday and will not reconvene until the end
of October.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's Basic Law, the government clearly states that "
Ministers are appointed by the prime minister. Their appointment is
subject to Knesset approval."
</P>
<P>
Barak has to convene the Knesset and muster a majority to vote
any new minister in. That's the reason why he only reshuffled the
cabinet with the current ministers. He is only required to inform
the Knesset for these nominations to take effect.
</P>
<P>
There are still six ministerial posts vacant without holders,
including the important Foreign Minister portfolio. Barak is hoping
to fill the vacuum when he finishes coalition talks with Shas,
Meretz, or even the major opposition Likud.

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Force MIG-21 Crash Due to Bird Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Air Force Sunday
said Saturday's crash of its MIG-21, in which the pilot was killed,
was caused by a bird hit.
</P>
<P>
"Initial investigations into the cause of the accident of the
aircraft have shown that there has been a bird hit on the engine
air-intake," an official release said.
</P>
<P>
The bird ingestion could well have caused an engine flame
immediately after the aircraft got airborne, it said, adding that
the pilot had suffered fatal burn injuries.
</P>
<P>
The single-seater plane being piloted by S. C. Shukla, which
crashed at Palam airfield here, was on a ferry flight to
Chandigarh in North India's Punjab State.

<HEADLINE> Becker Asked to Pay 4.63 million Dollars in Tax - Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Three-times Wimbledon champion
Boris Becker has been asked by the German tax administration to
pay 10 million marks (about 4.63 million U.S. dollars), newspaper
Bild am Sonntag said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into Becker's tax situation launched over
three years ago should be dropped if he decided to pay up, wrote
the newspaper, quoting Becker's tax adviser Erich Samson.
</P>
<P>
Samson said: "The proceedings against Mr. Becker could be
dropped in two weeks time."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The tax administration informed us in June of the
conditions for the proceedings to be ended. Now Mr. Becker has to
decide wether he accepts to pay the requested sum."
</P>
<P>
Becker is alleged to have used a residence he had in Monaco to
avoid paying tax while still living in Germany from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
32-year-old Becker has become involved in sports marketing
since retiring from competitive tennis.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Wins World Women's Volleyball GP in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Brazil defended
their title here Sunday by edging out local favorites China 3-2 at
the the China's Macao leg of World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The scores were 25-22, 27-25, 22-25, 18-25 and 16-14.
</P>
<P>
"The two teams gave an excellent performance today, the
powerfull attacks and delicate passes are the keys to our victory
of the match," said Brazilian trainer Jose Santos.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Hu Jin said: "Though we lost the game, my
players performed better than I expected today."
</P>
<P>
China and Brazil were drawn into the same group in the coming
Olympics and are favourites for the medal competition.
</P>
<P>
United States toppled Japan 25-18, 25-17 and 25-21 in another
match on Sunday. The Americans ranked third in the tournament with
one win and two losses while Japan finished fourth with three
staight losses.
</P>
<P>
In the first two sets, world and Olympic runners-up China
opened a flying start by producing a flurry of fierce attacks and
sound defence that caught the Brazilians out of position in most
of the time.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese spikers could not get the big points at the
crucial time as they gave up 14-7 and 19-16 lead, lossing the
first set 25-22.
</P>
<P>
To make them even feel more painful, the Chinese lost the
second 27-25 when they led all the way to 24-21.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese again led all the way and was caught up by Brazil,
finished third in last year's world cup in Japan, at 22-all and 23-
all in the third set.
</P>
<P>
China did not let Brazil turn the tables again when they
finished the set 25-23 by spiking two points.
</P>
<P>
Asked why China performed so differently compared with their
brilliant show in the last stage of the first two sets, Chinese
head coach Hu Jin said: "There are some sychological problems
among my players. "
</P>
<P>
A few changes of the Brazilan line-up in the fourth set caused
their defeat when the Chinese won the set at 25-18.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, the two teams leveled from 11-all to 14-all and
Brazil finished the match 16-14 with a Chinese mistake and a spike.
</P>
<P>
Rising star Erika Coimbra of Brazil was crowned most valuable
player in the leg.
</P>
<P>
The world top eight women's teams will be re-grouped and
compete at Chinese Taipei and Malaysia legs at next weekend.

<HEADLINE> PLA Barracks Open to HK Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some Hong Kong residents arrived at the barracks of the PLA
ground forces at Stanley even before it opened at 10:00 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong residents show great interest every time when the
PLA barracks are open to them," said Zheng Lei, a press officer of
the PLA Hong Kong Garrison.
</P>
<P>
All the 13,000 tickets for admission to PLA barracks were
quickly delivered to local organizations and residents last week,
he said, adding that someone even telephoned the PLA Garrison's
headquarters for the ticket after that.
</P>
<P>
He said this year will open to Hong Kong residents three
barracks for the ground, naval and air forces at Stanley,
Stonecutter Island and Shek Kong.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, the fourth one since the PLA troops began to
station in Hong Kong after its return to the motherland in 1997,
serves as a channel to increase understanding between the PLA
troops and the local community. Visitors can get a glimpse of what
is the life of the PLA like, he said.
</P>
<P>
At 10:20 in the morning, as the performance of the PLA
formation drill started at Stanley barracks, warm applause burst
from the visitors from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The warships open for exhibition at Stonecutter Island also
attracted a large number of visitors, who enthusiastically took
pictures on board.
</P>
<P>
The basketball match between the PLA troops and the Hong Kong
police was held at Stonecutter Island, where many visitors also
waited in long queue to watch the singing and dancing performance.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the barracks, Mr. Wong, a visitor, said he has get a
better understanding about the PLA troops, and "their discipline
and gifts really impressed me."

<HEADLINE> Barak Expects Better Times for Northern Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak told the cabinet on Sunday that he expected a number of
Lebanese security units to arrive at the border with Israel in the
first stage, rather than the Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
The units would establish a Lebanese military presence in the
southern part of that country, following the major deployment of
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) throughout the region
and along the border with Israel on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL troops took up 12 more positions along the northern
border with Lebanon on Saturday, adding to the six outposts manned
last week. The Lebanese government announced that it would send 1,
000 Lebanese soldiers to the area once the United Nations has
completed its deployment.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he expected that a new period of economic development
and increased tourism would now begin in the area along Israel's
northern border.
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral debt to the settlements in the north," Barak
said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) conducted a unilateral pullback
from south Lebanon on May 24, ending its 22-year-long military
occupation of the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly-elected President Moshe Katsav will travel
to the north on Sunday afternoon to learn about the impact of the
withdrawal on the residents there and to show solidarity with them.
This will be the first in a series of tours around the country the
president is taking to preach unity and learn the needs of the
people in different sectors.
</P>
<P>
It has taken the United Nations months to verify Israel's
complete withdrawal and draw an international border line between
Israel and Lebanon.

MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government renewed
its appeal to the public over the weekend to give it enough time
to make long-term solutions for Mindanao bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"You will not feel the immediate effect of what the government
is doing," Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said.

<P>
He assured residents in the southern island that the
rehabilitation and overall development of Mindanao is now among

</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada remains committed to ending government
neglect for Mindanao and turning it into a food basket, he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada announced Saturday when he came back from a 10-day
visit to the United States that he would embark on an extended
series of trips to Mindanao to personally oversee the
implementation of government projects on the island.
</P>
<P>
The president created a Mindanao coordinating council, which he
himself heads, to fast-track the implementation of development
projects for the strife-torn south.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Gather in Jakarta to Promote Religious Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Sunday said the country could overcome its present crisis
and eventually become a great nation in the future.
</P>
<P>
"We must maintain the unity and fraternity of our nation and
overcome poverty and backwardness. We are still in a crisis, and
we face threats to our territorial integrity. But we can overcome
this in a short time. We hope we can be a great nation in the
future," the president told the "Indonesia Prays" rally here.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 persons attended the rally to promote religious
harmony, peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The rally, also attended by House Speaker Akbar Tanjung and
other high-ranking officials, heard representatives of seven
faiths appeal for religious tolerance and peace in the country.
The seven faiths include Islam, Traditional Javanese Belief,
Buddhism, Hinduism, Catholicism, Protestantism and Confucianism.
</P>
<P>
"Plurality is a phenomenon of Indonesia, in the present and in
the future," Akbar said in a brief speech to the gathering.
</P>
<P>
The gathering was held ahead of a critical first annual session
of the People's Consultative Assembly, the country's highest
decision-making body, which is slated to be held from August 7 to
18.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Warns Traders Not to Manipulate Sugar Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government warned
unscrupulous traders over the weekend not to manipulate the price
of sugar in the local market as it prepares to import some 150,000
metric tons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
Director General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and
Development Authority said in a radio interview that the
government expects imported sugar from Thailand and Australia to
come in a month's time.
</P>
<P>
"Speculators, you will lose money because the National Food
Authority will bring in 150,000 metric tons of sugar," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Trade and Industry Undersecretary Ernesto Ordonez, who
also heads the country's price control council, issued a warning
to unscrupulous sugar traders that they will be dealt with
accordingly if found hoarding sugar to artificially jack up their
prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of sugar has risen sharply in some places in the
country and the government blamed this on traders' hoarding
activities.

<HEADLINE> 3 Red Cross Employees Missing in North Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the Red Cross and
Red Crescent mission in Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, were missing
on Friday in the country's north mountains near the border with
Russia's rebel republic of Chechnya, Russian Media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three, a Georgian, an Italian and a French national,
traveling in a Toyota car to the village of Dausi in Georgia's
Akhmeta region for humanitarian work, were believed to have been
missing after losing contact with their base for 24 hours, the
Interfax news agency quoted Akhmeta district police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police have found the car with the their identification cards
and personal things at the roadside near the village of Omalo,
which is on the Chechen stretch of the Georgian-Russian border.
The car was not damaged, but the walkie-talkie did not work,
Interfax cited the Georgian Interior Ministry as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian was identified as the driver Yuri Darchiyev and
the other two were women, French national Sophie Prokofiev and
Italian Natalie Zelino. They were going to study the situation of
several thousand Chechen refugees settled in the valley for the
purpose of rendering humanitarian aid to them, according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Georgian law enforcement agencies did not rule out
the possibility that the Red Cross workers may have been taken
hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Tbilisi office of the Red Cross and Red Crescent has also
confirmed the disappearance of their employees, but has not made
any comments on the incident.
</P>
<P>
Search for the missing is still going on, said the Georgian
Interior Ministry.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, DPRK to Ask UN to Issue Statement on Inter-Korean Summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Pyongyang have agreed in
principle to launch joint diplomatic activities to ask leaders of
U.N.member countries to issue a statement on the June Inter-Korean
summit at the next month UN Millennium Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
On a KBS television program Sunday, South Korean Foreign
Affairs and Trade Minister Lee Joung-binn said that he had
received a letter from Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, proposing the joint diplomatic
activities.
</P>
<P>
It is unprecedented that a DPRK foreign minister has sent a
letter to his South Korean counterpart since diplomats from the
two states had previously refused to contact each other before the
summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader
Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang on June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers met on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional
Forum (ARF) in Bangkok late last month.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lee proposed that the two sides launch
joint preparations for the UN Millennium Summit as part of efforts
to step up cooperation in the international community.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the July 26 foreign ministers meeting, the
first of its kind, Foreign Minister Paek recently sent a letter
which would herald a remarkable progress in the two Koreas'
cooperative relations in the international arena,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said the DPRK has come out of international diplomatic
isolation by joining the ASEAN Regional Forum, but stressing that
if Pyongyang wants to secure financial assistance from the Asian
Development Bank, it will have to improve ties with the United
States and Japan, the two largest share holders of the Manila-
based organization.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea will resume diplomatic normalization talks with
Japan on August 21, while Minister Paek and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright may meet on the sidelines of the UN Millennium
Summit,'' the South Korean minister said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that President Kim Dae-jung will meet DPRK's
parliament speaker Kim Yong Nam at the UN summit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the United States would shift its policies
toward the Korean peninsula if the Republican Party won the
upcoming presidential election, Lee said that both the Republican
and Democratic Parties have no differences on the Korean principle
issue as the issue should be resolved directly between the South
and North.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Asks for More Funds to Cope With Possible Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Force (IDF)
called on the treasury at the weekend to reimburse it with 1
billion shekels (about 250 million U.S. dollars) that were cut from
last year's budget to cope with possible clashes, Ha'aretz daily
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli defense and intelligence analysts have predicted that
uncertainties will reign on both the Palestinian and Lebanese
fronts between September and December, when the Palestinians are
expected to declare an independent statehood.
</P>
<P>
The chances for a successful diplomatic deal that will prevent
any outburst of violence depend, to a great extent, on the
development in the domestic political sphere, observed the paper.
</P>
<P>
The IDF's general staff is holding two days of sessions this
week to discuss planning and operation assessments in the event of
renewed tensions on the Palestinian front following the declaration
of a Palestinian state. Also on the agenda is IDF's budget for
2001.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that top IDF analysts believe that without a
peace deal with the Palestinians and increased U.S. aid, the
military will face an "insufferable" gap between its tasks and its
readiness.
</P>
<P>
This gap would require a reduction in manpower, cutbacks in
training exercises and closing down some long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
However, IDF senior officers said the unexpected rise in the
country's revenues from tax collection has enabled the government
to refund the military establishment the money that was cut from
last year's defense budget.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, said the paper, Military Intelligence doubts
whether the Arab and Islamic world would back any flexibility in
the Palestinian position on Jerusalem, a sticking point that led to
the collapse of the July 11-25 Camp David peace summit.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted General Staff sources as saying that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will try to prolong the
negotiations with Israel either until the end of the year, or until
there is a significant change in Israel's domestic political scene,
such as new elections or the opposition Likud faction joining the
government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is facing an urgent and uphill
task of reshuffling his government, which has shrunk to a minority
of 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament) with the
resignations of ruling coalition partners due to differences over
the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In either case, said the intelligence officers, Arafat might
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state, ready to enter into a
conflict that would also include clashes on the northern border
with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On the assumption that even without an agreement, the Camp David
summit enabled a mapping of those areas that would be annexed to
Israel or are considered vital for its defense interests, the army
will be able to focus on defending these areas.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians settle for practical sovereignty over Areas
A and B, which they already control, the situation may become
similar to that existing on the northern border after the IDF's
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
But until all these issues are clarified by events, the IDF will
remain in a state of alert, ready to be called into action on both
fronts in case of a rapid deterioration in the situation, the paper
said.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Two big fires broke out in downtown
Tehran on Sunday, causing heavy damages.
</P>
<P>
The fire of a burning cooker set two shoemaking shops ablaze in
a shopping center, inflicting material losses of some 200 million
rials (about 24,400 U.S. dollars), the fire department announced.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a fire broke out in a big clothes shop,
also resulting in heavy damages, the fire department said, without
giving specific figures, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Firemen cordoned off the six-story building where the shop was
located. The first floor blaze died out 45 minutes after starting.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the current Iranian calender year on
March 20, several housing and factory units have been damaged by
fires due to failure to take necessary precautionary measures, IRNA
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A Lebanese security force is expected to be dispatched to
south Lebanon soon, perhaps by this evening, following United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)'s major deployment
Saturday throughout the region and along the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr said the 1,000-member
detachment of Lebanese Army troops, police, and state security
officials would be ready to deploy in south Lebanon as soon as the
UNIFIL deployment is complete, possibly Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL established six positions along the border last week and
Saturday sent troops to additional 12 positions in south Lebanon,
including three along the border.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has written to U.S President
Bill Clinton on Friday. Palestinian officials have promised that
secret negotiations now underway with Israeli officials would be
formalized in a lead up to a second summit.
</P>
<P>
In recent messages to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
President Clinton indicated his willingness to sponsor a second
summit with a clearly-defined time frame, provided that the parties
submit, ahead of time, a clear outline of principles that would
lead to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Secret talks between Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin,
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami, Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon and
other Israelis and Palestinian officials took place last week in an
effort to renew negotiations toward a permanent agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Under intense pressure from Israel and Australian Jewry to
step down, Ronald Bakalarz, president of the Maccabi World Union
(MWU) announced his resignation Saturday just over three years
after the Maccabiah bridge disaster killed four Australian team
members and wounded 70 others.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred at the July 1997 Maccabiah Games, when a
footbridge collapsed over the polluted Yarkon River as the
delegations were marching into the games' opening ceremony at Tel
Aviv's National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Bakalarz's move came following a harsh Knesset (Parliament)
committee inquiring report, which concluded last month that the
head of the MWU must resign.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Elazar Brosh, a 60-year-old agricultural expert from Ramat
Hasharon working for the Foreign Ministry's international
cooperation department, was killed Thursday in Kyrgyzstan in what
local police officials said was an apparent robbery attempt.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Brosh and an unidentified woman, who local
officials said was probably his landlady, were found in Brosh's
rental apartment in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. The local
officials said one suspect had been detained and another was still
at large.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Foreign Minister spokesman said there is no reason to
suspect that the murder was anything but criminally motivated.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Vehemently Condemns U.N. For Decade-Old Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council has been committing a crime of genocide against the Iraqi
people during the past 10 years, an editorial carried by the
official daily Baghdad Observer said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years, the U.N. Security Council is committing genocide
in Iraq under flimsy pretexts and changing conditions," said the
editorial, adding that the sanctions have been going on without any
respect to the U.N. Charter, international laws and norms.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. Charter were to be respected, U.N. officials and
the Security Council should be charged with the premeditated crime
of genocide and brought to court of justice," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise that Iraq is in a fury as it has been
subjected to the toughest sanctions in history, and the end of
sanctions is yet to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq:
On August 6, 1990, four days after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, the
U.N. Security Council passed the Resolution 661 and imposed
stringent sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says that as many as 1.3 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died of curable diseases as a direct result
of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old sanctions have proved that the U.N. Security
Council is "a mere tool to the United States strategy," said the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., as a leading member of the U.N. Security Council, has
been behind the continuation of sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, 70 members of the U.S. House of Representatives have
sent a letter to President Bill Clinton, arguing that the sanctions
have inflicted suffering on ordinary Iraqis, the editorial noted.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also accused Kuwait of being "a spearhead to the
U.S. conspiracy against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah said on July 25
that only stronger military and economic ties with Washington would
safeguard the emirate against a repeat of Iraqis invasion.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait rejects any direct dialog with Iraqi officials until
Baghdad frees all Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs) still held since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claims that Iraq still holds some 600 Kuwaiti POWs.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Majlis Members Clash Over Amendment of Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Intense controversy over amendment
of the press law on Sunday erupted between members of Iran's Majlis
(parliament), almost leading to physical encounters in an open
session of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out following an announcement by Majlis
speaker Mehdi Karrubi that a motion to debate the press law has
been withdrawn from the agenda of the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The press law was amended by the conservative-controlled fifth
Majlis in April to put more restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
Following the amendment, some 20 reformist newspapers and
journals have been closed down by the judiciary on charges of
violating Islamic values and defaming government officials.
</P>
<P>
A number of reform-minded journalists have also been tried and
put into prison on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
However, the new Majlis, which was inaugurated on May 27 and are
dominated by reformers, has vowed to made new amendments to the
press law to restore press freedom which has been encouraged by
President Mohammad Khatami since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
An urgent motion of the plan was approved in a Majlis open
session on June 18 and was scheduled to top the agenda for the open
session on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Majlis speaker Karrubi, however, announced at the start of the
session that a decision has been made not to debate new amendments
to the press law following an order by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
After the speaker made the announcement, a number of Majlis
members voiced strong protest, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The protests disturbed the order of the parliament to the extent
that the live broadcast of the proceeding was interrupted.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some physical confrontation has also
occurred between some Majlis members. The protesting legislators
were later directed to outside the Majlis hall by other members of
the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Political struggles between reformers and the conservatives have
stepped up since the February parliamentary election, in which
President Khatami's reformist allies dealt a severe blow to their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives obviously have the upper hand in the
struggle, because they are still controlling such powerful state
organs as the judiciary, not to mention the military.
</P>
<P>
Even though reformers have seized control of the Majlis, any
bill passed by them have to be approved by the conservative
Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The press law has become one of the centers of the factional
struggle. The conservatives tend to use the restrictive law to
suppress reformist press, while the reformers, with the Majlis as
their tool, try to amend the law so that reformist papers can no
longer be banned easily.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said the Majlis Presiding Board held an
extraordinary session Saturday to decide whether to debate the
sensitive press law on Sunday. But the final decision was
definitely disappointing to reformers.
</P>
<P>
The powerful intervention of Khamenei, the supreme authority in
the country who is believed to stand by the conservatives, was
believed to be the direct reason for the Majlis decision.

<HEADLINE> Non-oil Sector in UAE to Play Major Role in Propelling Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The non-oil sector in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) is expected to contribute to 72 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the next two years, the
Dubai-based Gulf News daily Sunday quoted economists as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Non-oil sectors can expect overall nominal growth of at least
five percent a year over the forecast period. This will raise their
share of GDP to 72 percent in 2002, from 70 percent in 2000," the
paper quoted a report of the third quarter forecast on UAE's
economy as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was issued by the Britain-based Business
Monitor International, also said Dubai is forced by its limited oil
reserves to step up its diversification plans, while tourism, e-
commerce and other sectors are targeted for faster development.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications sector is expected to jump by 10 percent
this year, fuelled by the establishment of the Dubai Internet City
(SIC) and the rising demand for telecommunications facilities
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The report added the construction, trade and transport and
communications sectors will expect a rebound due to recovery in
government spending and improvement in international trade
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Construction and real estate will grow by five percent this year
following a two-year shake-off as projects that were once shelved
now start to be developed in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The much-delayed project of corporate headquarters for the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority, for instance, has finally gone out to
tender, pushing the prestigious 200 million U.S. dollars project on
stream.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, power and water and financial services will
continue to prosper though some problems are expected at the stock
market.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Offering Ransom to Abu Sayyaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanon diplomat in Manila
denies local press reports Sunday that the Libyan government has
offered 25 million U.S. dollars in ransom to Abu Sayyaf for the
release of the hostages held in the southern Philippine province
of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's vice consul to Manila, Joseph Assad, said there is no
truth in the reports that Seif Al-Islam, son of Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, had sent an emissary to Manila to work out the
deal, the local ABS-CBN news channel reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports earlier surfaced that Libya is ready to pay a ransom of
25 million dollars to the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf to
gain the freedom of 29 hostages, and that Seif Al-Islam has sent
an emissary to the Philippine capital to try for a deal.
</P>
<P>
The reports, quoting a report of the Lebanese daily An-Nahar,
said the envoy Mohamed Ismail contacted the Lebanese embassy in
Tokyo and expressed "full readiness" to pay one million dollars
for the release of Marie Moarbes, a Lebanese-Frenh, as first
priority.
</P>
<P>
Ismail also reportedly told the Lebanese mission that Libya is
willing to pay 24 million dollars more for the rest captives.
</P>
<P>
The 29 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo island, Sulu,
include the remaining 14 of the 21 hostages kidnapped from
Malaysia's Sipadan island on April 23 -- three Malaysians, two
Germans, two French nationals, two Finns, two South Africans, Two
Filipinos and the Lebanese-French woman.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels are also holding three French TV
journalists who went to Jolo to cover the hostage crisis and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who went there to pray for the
hostages early July.
</P>
<P>
So far, the rebels have released six Malaysians and one German
woman of the Sipadan group, one German journalist, two Filipino
reporters and one Christian evangelist.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Troops Head For Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal authorities
Saturday ordered a third battalion of troops to reinforce fire
crews battling dozens of large blazes across the western United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The west is just so dry. This is from years and years of
really dry weather," said Mary Apple of the National Interagency
Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
"We have ordered a third battalion from Fort Hood (an Army base
in Texas), and they will probably be sent to western Montana,"
Apple said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a battalion of 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton in
California arrived in Idaho Falls, Idaho on Saturday to begin two
days of training.
</P>
<P>
So far this year 3.9 million acres has been burned in 62,944
blazes, nearly twice as bad as normal, according to Assistant
Interior Secretary Sylvia Baca, who called it the worst fire
season in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Throughout western United States, 747,101 acres was burning in
62 blazes in 11 states. But more trouble could be ahead. Forecasts
of thunderstorms for the weekend in Oregon and Washington meant
that more lightning strikes could spark new fires, Apple said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty new big fires were reported Friday in the West, bringing
to 70 the number of fires burning through 747,110 acres in Idaho,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
High temperatures, low moisture levels, drought conditions and
lightning are blamed for the blazes. Fire experts said the
wildfires will likely rage until the first snows in October.
</P>
<P>
"We're really at the mercy of Mother Nature," U.S. Forest
Service chief Mike Dombeck said. "Unless we have a miraculous
change in the weather, I think we can look forward to several
tough weeks ahead of us."

<TEXT>
<P>
Mori unveiled his decision at a news conference in Hiroshima,
southwestern Japan, after attending a ceremony marking the 55th
anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city more than five
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni shrine, a bastion of the wartime government-
sponsored Shintoism and symbol of militarism in Japan before and
during World War II, houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals, including wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, and some
2.4 million Japanese military personnel and officials who have
died since 1853 in Japan's various wars.
</P>
<P>
In the past, visits by Japanese cabinet ministers to the shrine
drew criticism from Japan's neighboring countries invaded by
Japanese troops during the war.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine are also controversial
because Japan's postwar Constitution stipulates separation of the
state and religion.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Police Seize Largest Illicit Drug Cache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's anti-narcotics police have
seized 35-million-dollar-worth of hallucinogenic drugs and arrested
six suspects in the largest haul of illegal drugs in the kingdom's
history, the semiofficial Jordan Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on tips, the narcotics squad confiscated 3,341,400
tablets of Captagon with a potential black market value of 24
million Jordanian dinars (35 million U.S. dollars) and three
Kalashnikov rifles from the six suspects, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
One of the suspects is a Jordanian citizen, but police refused
to disclose the nationalities of the other five under police
custody.
</P>
<P>
Police stashed the cache of pills in a secluded cave near the
Al Hassa district, more than 200 kilometers south of the capital
city Amman.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations revealed the drugs were destined for
a neighboring Arab country which police refused to name.
</P>
<P>
The seizure came four months after police busted a similar drug
trafficking operation, in which 107 kilograms of heroin worth 10.5
million dollars were intercepted by police on the Jordanian-Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
Most of illegal drugs passing through Jordan usually find their
way to Israel, Egypt and the Gulf states, notably Saudi Arabia,
Jordan
Times said.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been used as major transit point in recent years
by international drug traffickers, who ship narcotics made in
Eastern countries and former Soviet Union states to the Gulf, Egypt
and Israel via Turkey, Syria and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian police seized 201 kilograms of heroin between the
years of 1996 to 1999 alone.

has been in constant touch with the six other member countries to
reschedule the programs of the SAARC conference through mutual
consultations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Technical committees of the association at various levels have
also been working with a view to creating a conductive atmosphere
for holding the summit.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan's Chief
Executive, General Pervez Musharraf are expected to meet in New
York in September, in the sidelines of the United Nations
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic circles hoped that after a direct contact between
Vajpayee and Musharraf, a positive ground will be prepared for
holding the SAARC summit by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Cuts 156 Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 5 (Xinhua) -- United Airlines, the world's
largest carrier, canceled more than 150 flights at Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport on Saturday because of crew shortages
and bad weather, the company said.
</P>
<P>
United pilots have refused to work overtime since their
contract expired in April, said United Airlines spokesman Chris
Brathwaite. The company and the pilots' union are negotiating a
contract with a federal mediator and hope to have a new agreement
in place by early September.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we had about 156 United flights canceled today because of
a combination of weather and crew shortages," said Brathwaite. "We
are trying to get people diverted to other planes."
</P>
<P>
The sticking points are job security, flight assignments,
salary and benefits. Negotiations between the two sides became
more complicated when United Airlines announced earlier this year
that it planned to acquire U.S. Airways, the No. 6 U.S. carrier.
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms and showers moved into the Midwest this weekend.
Weather problems on the East Coast have contributed to the
cancellations, Brathwaite added.
</P>
<P>
United Airlines has about 960 flights per day out of O'Hare.
Industry sources noted that Saturday's cancellations totaled about
half of the airline's cancellations systemwide.

Frazier 6-2, 6-3 to reach the final of the 535,000 US dollars
Acura Classic tennis tournament in Carlsbad, California on
Saturday, claiming her 14th straight match victory.
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Williams thus will go after her third
tournament title in a row in Sunday's final against the winner of
either Anna Kournikova and Monica Seles.
</P>

Frazier, who upset top-ranked Martina Hingis in the
quarterfinals, lamented that "she hit the ball so hard, I was just
trying to stay in the points and she really wasn't letting me do
anything."
</P>
<P>
Frazier was barely competitive on a day when Williams had a sub-
par performance by committing 28 unforced errors. "I didn't play
too well, I felt I was off-balance quite a lot," said Williams.
</P>
<P>
Frazier picked up early service breaks in both sets. But in the
first, Williams reeled off the last five games to close the set,
and erased a 2-0 deficit in the second set to close out the match
in one hour six minutes.

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Exports to US Goes Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's textile exports to the
United States rose by 32.1 percent to 2.64 billion U.S. dollars in
the first six months of the year, today's "Business Weekly"
reported.
</P>
<P>
But officials do not expect the rapid increase to continue in
the latter half of the year due to quota limitations.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Gu Qiang with the State Textile Industry
Administration as saying that China would have difficulties
getting enough quotas from the United States for its competitive
textile products in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"How much China will be able to sell to the United States will
ultimately be determined by the purchasing power of US consumers,"
said Gu. This also explains why even after China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the country's textile exports to
the United States are not expected to increase drastically, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to WTO rules, the United States will have to call off
its quota limitation on textile imports from China in 2005. Gu
said a booming US economy has contributed to the rapid increase in
China's textile exports this year.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the applied rate of textile quotas given
by the US government increased three percentage points on a year-
on-year basis to 38.3 percent. "This will enable China to compete
fairly with other countries that supply the textiles to the United
States," Gu explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shujin, another official with the same administration,
noted that products made of imported materials make up about one-
half of China's textile exports. And from such textile exports,
China only earns processing fees.
</P>
<P>
He added that the increase of textile exports lags behind China
's exports to the United States as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Sino-ROK Bilateral Trade Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese trade expert predicted
that the trade volume between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK)
might get to 30 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Xu Changwen, Director of Asian and African Studies Department
of the China Academy of International Trade and Economic
Cooperation, explained that the judgment was made in the light of
trade performances between the two countries in the first six
months of the year, according to today's "business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and ROK rose by 45.3 percent from the same
period last year to 16.1 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of the two economies has contributed to the
booming trade, said experts. China reported an economic growth of
8.2 percent in the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
China imported 10.8 billion U.S. dollars worth of commodities
from ROK from January to June, up 38.7 percent from the same
period last year. Its exports to ROK surged 60.7 percent from the
same period last year to 5.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China's trade deficit with ROK continued to expand.
The deficit rose by 5.5 billion U.S. dollars from January to June
and is expected to hit ten billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
China has generally imported more from ROK than it has exported
to ROK since the two countries normalized relations in 1992. By
the end of June, China's trade deficit to ROK was 43.7 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu explained that a large amount of ROK investment in China
boosted China's imports of materials and parts from ROK. But the
widening gap and long-term deficit is likely to do harm to trade
and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Xu suggested that ROK relax its controls over imports of China'
s agricultural and mineral products. Chinese companies should
also diversify their products and improve their quality and design
to interest companies and consumers in ROK.
</P>
<P>
ROK is China's third largest trade partner and vice versa.

<HEADLINE> Greater Efforts Urged to Develop Marine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's thriving marine industry
has become a powerful force in the economy, said today's "Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the
Development Research Center under the State Council as saying that
the output value of the marine industry is expected to make up at
least five percent of the country gross domestic product (GDP)
this year.
</P>
<P>
China's marine industry has experienced explosive growth during
the last two decades. Its industrial output jumped from 6.4
billion yuan in 1979 to 335 billion yuan in 1998, said Wang
Shuguang, Director of the State Oceanographic Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the rapid growth to a clear strategy and
reasonable policies adopted by the Chinese government since the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Throughout its thousands of years of history, the Chinese
nation has always paid greater attention to its land resources
than its marine ones which have virtually been ignored. But it's
clearly a serious matter now for China to pay more attention to
its vast ocean treasure.
</P>
<P>
As a major developing country with a long coastline, China,
therefore, must exploit the ocean as a long-term development
strategy while protecting the marine resources, said Du Bilan, a
researcher with the Ocean Development Strategy Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
China has an 18,000 km mainland coastline. There are more than
5,000 islands in China's territorial waters, each with an area of
more than 500 sq. m, and the islands' coastlines total more than
14,000 km. China also exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over
vast continental shelves and exclusive economic zones.
</P>
<P>
In light of its marine resources, China has adopted a policy of
developing and utilizing resources in a comprehensive way.  In
recent years, China has made constant efforts to upgrade its
maritime fishing, transportation, salt-making and other
traditional sectors and to develop marine reproduction and
mariculture, offshore oil and gas, tourism, marine pharmaceuticals
and other burgeoning industries.
</P>
<P>
A significant breakthrough in China's marine undertakings is
the fast-growing offshore oil and gas industry. Crude oil
production from China's offshore areas has soared from less than
100,000 tons in 1982 to around 20 million tons of oil equivalent
in 1999. China plans to double its offshore oil and gas output to
40 million tons prior to 2005.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring of Thai Key Economic Ministries Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A meeting of economic ministers, held here this week, agreed
that the three key economic ministries, including industry,
commerce, and agriculture and cooperatives, needed to complete
their respective restructuring plans within six months, Minister
to the Prime Minister's Office Abhisit Vejajiva said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Once the restructuring plans are completed, the Ministry of
Commerce will change its name to the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI), like the Japanese MITI, to be in charge
of all trade transactions with foreign countries, as well as
negotiations under the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC), and of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, negotiations under the APEC framework are under the
supervision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; while those under
the AFTA are within the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
All jobs relating to farmers would then be transformed to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, and a new independent
agency would be established to be in charge of the insurance
industry; while the work of consumers' protection would then be
under the supervision of the Ministry to Prime Minister's Office,
instead of the Ministry of Commerce, said Abhisit.

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM on Trade with, Investment in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between Myanmar
and Thailand is progressing well in spite of the fact that both
countries' economies suffered from certain crisis in the last
couple of years, said Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the press at the end of the second session of the
Myanmar-Thai Joint Trade Commission (JTC) here Saturday evening,
Supachai noted that like last year, the positive trade expansion
for some years exceeded 20 percent, pointing out that highly
commendable improvement was brought about which is tremendous jump
in the export from Myanmar to Thailand of more than 76 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
It helps to narrow the gap of trade between the two countries,
he said, hoping to see that the bilateral trade be more balanced.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has large surplus in trade with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He believes that there will be more import demand of goods from
Myanmar to Thailand, emphasizing that the Thai government has
placed the highest priority to cross-border trade with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Thailand has set up a Cross-Border Trade
Promotion Committee, which he chairs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for both sides to improve the payment
system and banking relations to expedite the implementation of
banking agreements and memorandums of understanding signed in the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
He recommends more banks to be involved in the MOUs in addition
to the existing only one Thai bank in the banking process dealing
with the private sector of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand would help Myanmar solve its trade deficit
which is likely brought about by allowing more open trade.
</P>
<P>
On investment, Supachai went on to say that Thailand encourages
more Thai investment into Myanmar, saying that Thailand is now the
third largest investor in the country and agreeing that there
would be more rooms for investment between the two countries. At
the moment Thailand is on the verge of signing an agreement on
investment promotion and protection, especially in the areas of
propagation of seeds for various types of agricultural products
and agro-industry.
</P>
<P>
As to tourism, he said Thailand would help Myanmar promote
tourist in-flow by upgrading coastal Dawei area in Southern part
of the country to a tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
With regard to fishery, he said that Thailand has been
providing assistance to Myanmar in the marine shrimp propagation
project until its completion, adding that the implementation has
been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
The two-day second session of the Myanmar-Thai JTC, which began
on Friday, was attended by Myanmar delegation, led by Commerce
Minister Brigadier-General Pyi Sone, and its Thai counterpart,
headed by Supachai who arrived here on Thursday for the session.

<HEADLINE> Anti Neo-Nazi Protest Takes Place in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 Germans took to the
streets Saturday in Dusseldorf, the capital city of Nordrhein-
Westfalen, to protest neo-Nazi violence and demand the banning of
the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by some left-wing groups.
Demonstrators staged a sit-in at the railway station, the site of
an explosion on July 27 which injured 10 immigrants from the
former Soviet Union, six of them Jewish.
</P>
<P>
Although police have yet to establish the motive of the
explosion, the possibility that right-wing extremists were behind
it triggered a wave of national soul-searching and demands for
official and public actions to stop neo-Nazi offenses.
</P>
<P>
On the same day in Thuringen in eastern Germany, police
detained more than 100 suspected neo-Nazis to prevent them from
taking part in a banned march.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily told the Der Spiegel
magazine that the federal government is considering using frontier
guards to fight against neo-Nazis. Meanwhile, Economics Minister
Werner Mueller warned that the recent rise in neo-Nazi violence
might scare off foreign investors and harm the German economy.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's administration has decided to
establish working teams with state governments to discuss whether
to declare the NPD unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The far-right NPD has great influence in eastern Germany. Its
members grew rapidly from 3,000 in 1996 to the present 6,000, most
of whom young people.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The city of Hiroshima in
southwestern Japan commemorated the 55th anniversary of its 1945
atomic bombing Friday, pledging to make a new start as a model
city for world peace.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 people, including A-bomb victims, bereaved families,
and dignitaries gathered at the Peace Memorial Park, near the
hypocenter of the bombing, and prayed for those who died from the
world's first atomic bombing more than five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, Hiroshima Mayor Tadatoshi
Akiba, Hiroshima prefectural and municipal government officials,
and Russian Ambassador to Japan Alexander Panov were present at
the annual Peace Memorial Ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After holding a one-minute silent prayer at 8:15 a.m. (2315 GMT
Saturday), the exact time of the blast, Akiba delivered an annual
peace declaration.
</P>
<P>
"Having called on the world to abolish nuclear weapons,
Hiroshima wishes to make a new start as a model city demonstrating
the use of science and technology for human purposes ... We will
create a 21st century in which Hiroshima's very existence
formulates the substance of peace," Akiba said.
</P>
<P>
"On the international stage, Hiroshima aspires to serve as a
mediator, actively creating reconciliation by helping to resolve
conflict and animosity."
</P>
<P>
Mori also addressed the ceremony, welcoming the May agreement
by a U.N. meeting to review the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) to promote the policy of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, Japan has just issued a peace message from
Okinawa after urging the leaders of other Group of Eight powers to
reach an agreement to promote nuclear disarmament and
nonproliferation in the July 21-23 summit, based on the results of
the NPT meeting," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the 50-minute ceremony, Akiba dedicated a new
list of 5,021 names of atomic bomb victims who have died since
August 6 last year, bringing the total number dead to 217,137.
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, by the
U.S. B-29 bomber Enola Gay, killed an estimated 140,000 people by
the end of that year.

Worsening Water Pollution Causes Big Hazard
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating water pollution in China will do great harm to
people's health and life quality, according to some members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Since some areas and rivers around Chinese cities are being
polluted, ground water could become toxic and unsuitable for human
consumption, the Subcommittee of Human Resources and Environment
of CPPCC warned at a recent symposium on "drinking water and
health" in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Effective Control of Desertification in Anhui
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui Province has effectively turned more than
100,000 ha. of arid and desertified land into vegetated areas in
the past decades.
</P>
<P>
As a result, greenery has so far covered 32.4 percent of local
arid and desertified land, whose grain yield has grown by 10 to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
The province has some 700,000 ha. of arid and desertified land,
mostly in northern Anhui. Of them, 130,000 ha. are desertified
land, which pose a big threat to local ecological environment and
hamper local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Dangshan County, which suffers from serious drifting sand in
the province, has done a good work in controlling shifting sand,
growing trees and grass, and developing agricultural production in
desertified areas in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Ecologists Eye on Changbai Mountains

<HEADLINE> Tunisia, Libya Reaffirm Promotion of Dialog among Maghreb Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian and Libyan leaders have
stressed the importance of promoting dialog between Arab Maghreb
Union and other regional and international groups, including the
European Union, on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a joint communique issued at the end of
Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi's three-day working visit to
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, both Ghaddafi and Tunisian President Zine el
Abidine Ben Ali expressed the hope to achieve common interests of
both the Maghred Union, or UMA, and the EU through dialog.
</P>
<P>
The UMA, created in 1989, groups five African nations of
Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. It has been
paralyzed since five years ago, mainly due to disagreement between
Algeria and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Ghaddafi and Ben Ali also hoped that security, peace, stability
and fruitful cooperation can be achieved among the Mediterranean
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need to convene an urgent Arab summit,
and to hold such a summit regularly.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Libyan leader met three times with Ben Ali
to discuss bilateral ties and an agreement on upgrading bilateral
trade volume from the present 700 million U.S. dollars to 1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On his way back to Libya by road Saturday, Ghaddafi visited the
grave of former Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba, the founder of
modern Tunisia who died in April, in the town of Monastir, 140
kilometers (80 miles) southeast of Tunis.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says No Change towards Afghan Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared on Sunday that it
would not have a change of heart towards the Afghan Taliban militia
as long as they have not punished those responsible for the 1998
killing of Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The statement came on the eve of the second anniversary of the
Taliban attack on the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif in
northern Afghanistan on August 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter were killed by the
militiamen. Iran has been demanding that the Taliban find out and
punish those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Iran is following up its demand at the United Nations and the
government had renewed its petition with the world organization on
Sunday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi was quoted by
the state-run IRNA news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the Taliban militia, which controls
over 90 percent of the Afghan territory, have improved despite
Tehran's continued support for the ousted government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Asefi expressed hope that the rivaling Afghan factions would
respect their pledges at talks and work to put an end to their
decade-old civil war.

<HEADLINE> 400 Refugees in Tanzania to Resettle in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada will resettle a
total of 400 refugees residing in western Tanzanian camps to its
Quebec Province within this year.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugee (UNHCR) Branch Office here said Monday that the first
batch of 180 refugees will be airlifted from Mwanza airport
Tuesday directly to Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The rest is scheduled to leave the refugee camps by the end of
this year with the help of the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) contracted by UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of whom from Burundi and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), have lived for years in the camps
after fleeing wars in the central African countries.
</P>
<P>
IOM will run a cultural orientation course for the refugees who
are considered by the UNHCR most in need of protection and with
little hope of returning to their countries of origin. Among the
criteria used by the Canadian Immigration Services in selecting
the refugees to be resettled is the ability to integrate well into
Canadian society.
</P>
<P>
"The head of the family in nearly every case speaks French and
has either finished High School or University education," the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are families with one spouse being ethnic Tutsi
and the other being ethnic Hutu, or in mixed marriage, a target
for prosecution by both ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR officials said that there are some 400,000 refugees in
western Tanzania from neighboring Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda and
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Resume Amid Major Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Heads of 19 Burundian
parties began a new round of peace talks in northern Tanzanian
town of Arusha on Monday to try to resolve outstanding differences
on a draft peace agreement expected to be signed on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Burundi government and Hutu rebel groups
are also expected to hold talks with the peace facilitator and
former South African President Nelson Mandela in South Africa this
week.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Arusha said that the tough negotiations come as
both the Burundian government and the rebels have expressed strong
reservations about the peace plan that was presented to them by
Mandela last month.
</P>
<P>
Delegates would focus on cease-fire arrangement, the leadership
of a transitional government, integration of the rebels into the
Tutsi-led armed forces, the proposed electoral system, and the
treatment of political prisoners in the week-long closed-door
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Mandela has told them that the draft agreement will not be
changed unless all the parties reach a consensus," an official of
the facilitation team said.
</P>
<P>
The two main armed rebel groups, CNDD-FDD and PALIPEHUTU-FNL,
have indicated they will not sign the document until certain
conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
PALIPEHUTU-FNL refused to attend the last round of negotiations
in Arusha at which CNDD-FDD was present for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The current wrangling has prompted many observers to note that
the signing ceremony, scheduled for August 28, now hangs in the
balance, although Mandela insisted that the date will be adhered
to.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, sources close to the mediation team said that the
question of who will lead the transitional government in Burundi
is the most intractable issue facing the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft proposals, the Tutsi minority, which has
dominated Burundi since independence, would hand over power to a
democratically elected government in three years' time after the
appointment of a transitional government.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi conflict between Tutsi-dominated government troops
and Hutu rebels has cost 200,000 lives since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya recently warned of a
premature signing of a peace agreement, saying a cease-fire must
come into effect before any accord is signed.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Hold Special Meeting on Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) heads of state are to hold a special
meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, next week to discuss the war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Foreign Affairs Minister
of the DRC Abdoulaye Yerodia announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yerodia, who is now representing President of the DRC Laurent
Kabila at the SADC summit meeting in Windhoek, Namibia, told South
African Press Association the purpose of the Lusaka meeting,
scheduled for August 14, is "to find the means to stop the war".
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Kabila will be there, he replied: "If he's alive,
yes. If he doesn't attend I will attend."
</P>
<P>
However, Yerodia appeared skeptical that the meeting will
achieve much.
</P>
<P>
He said he had told the SADC leaders that there is one way to
stop the war, namely implementing the United Nations Security
Council resolution on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Yerodia also denied that the DRC has refused to accept the
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The DRC has emphasized several times that the U.N. troops
should be deployed in the war zones instead in Kinshasa or other
towns controlled by the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Kabila did not attend the summit, Yerodia said: "
Because he has all the jobs more urgent than to attend this
conference. The war, the aggressor is still in our country."

carried out smoothly as it was the case in 1995, when Tanzania
held its first multi-party general elections and some 8.9 million
voters were registered.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a continuous exercise, no weekends, no public
holidays," he stressed.

LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Senegal and Guinea-Bissau have
signed an agreement on the immediate re-opening of the two
countries' common border closed since mid-July,  the Angolan
official news agency Angop reported on Monday.
</P>

Accusing the armed bandits from Guinea-Bissau of robbing and
plundering in the Senegalese cities, Senegalese residents living
along the frontier blocked the border areas with Guinea-Bissau.

<P>
The two countries later created a joint commission for
investigating, identifying and restituting the robbed goods of the
Senegalese residents.
</P>

In the agreement, the two sides promised to assure a "better
security along the frontier for impeding the incursion of armed

Waiting to brief leaders attending the Southern African

Masire said if Kabila had come, his SADC colleagues would have

</P>
<P>
"He would either have seen reason in what they told him, or he
would have shown them the reason why he doesn't want to go ahead
with the negotiations," he said.

Masire stressed that he would like to see a return to the
Lusaka peace agreement signed by the government of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and rebels in the country last July.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC)
has asked all the indicted members of the National Assembly
involved in the contract scandals to resign within 14 days, local
media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
NLC President Adams Oshiomhole was quoted as saying on Sunday
that the NLC would embark on industrial actions that would render
the "affected lawmakers irrelevant and unacceptable" if the
ultimatum failed to be exercised.
</P>
<P>
Oshiomhole warned that if the indicted senators fail to heed
the request, workers would "appropriately mobilize to ensure that
the people's wish prevails".
</P>
<P>
The panel probing the contracts scandals under the leadership

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government troops and
the armed rebels led by Jonas Savimbi entered into heavy fighting
at the weekend for the control of Gamba, a strategic point in the
Angolan central highland, the Angolan News Agency (Angop) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting began earlier last week when the rebels tried to
overrun Gamba, located some 40 kilometers southeast of the town of
Nharea in northwestern Bie Province. But the report did not
mention any casualties suffered so far by either side.
</P>
<P>
Gamba is considered a key point for the stabilization of the
military situation in Bie, where the long-standing rebel
strongholds of Andulo and Nharea were captured by government
forces last autumn.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the rebels staged the fighting to ease
pressure on its forces in central and southern Bie, where the
government has allegedly launched a major offensive against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports indicated that Jonas Savimbi, leader of the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
may have installed the rebel military command in southern Bie near
the border with Cuando Cubango Province.

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Eleven parliament members from
Kenya's North Eastern Province has urged the government to support
the on-going peace initiative in Somalia in order to curb
insecurity in their region, the East African Standard newspaper

The legislators made the remarks Sunday when they addressed a

</P>
<P>
They noted that the breakdown of law and order in Somalia was
the main cause of insecurity in the province, which borders
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"North Eastern Province will not have peace as long as there
are open-air firearm markets in neighboring Somalia." the
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to take a leading role in the Somali
peace talks that are being held in Djibouti, saying Kenya hosts
thousands of Somali refugees and should therefore pay attention to
the situation in its eastern neighbor.

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice President George
Saitoti has called on the country's politicians to stop
campaigning for seats and instead concentrate on national

"I urge those campaigning to concentrate on reviving our

"Kenyan politicians have taken politicking as if it is food.
This must stop if the country is to develop," the vice president

He also condemned some politicians for attempting to gain votes
by evoking tribalism, saying that it was a threat to peace.

LUSAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian central bank will try
to reduce the inflation rate from the current 25.9 percent to 19
percent by the end of this year to stimulate investor confidence,
Times of Zambia reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kabinga Pande, head of public relations of the Bank of Zambia,
was quoted by the paper as saying on Sunday that Zambia's broad
macro-economic objectives are to attain a real Gross Domestic

</P>
<P>
The key to bring down inflation is a firm control over the
growth of money supply and credit in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The bank will ensure that the growth in money supply and credit
is neither insufficient nor excessive, but adequate to facilitate
economic and financial transactions needed for a sound economic
growth, Pande said.

He said the bank will limit the domestic fiscal deficit to 2.3
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The bank will make concerted efforts to further lower and

LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) - Alex Allen, Britain's e-envoy, is
working on a plan to tempt up to 100,000 IT professionals back to

The Sunday Independent said.
</P>
<P>
Allen's plan follows a 4 million pounds Department for Trade

scientists back to the UK.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this year there is a 12 percent shortage -
22,0470 people. Concern is growing in the IT sector that a
shortage of computer professionals could harm the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Computer Software Services Association, whose
members include Microsoft and Oracle, the shortfall could cost UK
business 30 billion pounds by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of IT professionals has been triggered by the
rapidly expanding computer and dot com industry and recent tax
changes that prompted a drift of freelance computer professionals
to continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
A government source close to the Cabinet Office said: "We want

"What is the purpose of this policy?" asked Green Party

I don't think that needs to be demonstrated on the graves of one
million innocent Iraqi civilians."
</P>
<P>
Nader, one of about a dozen speakers at the rally, said that 5,
000 Iraqi children were dying each month from diseases and

Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio said that the
sanctions were wrong and did nothing but continued to "weaken and

<HEADLINE> Armed Zambian Policemen Surround Former Minister's Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Armed Zambian policemen started
early Sunday morning surrounding the residence of former
Environment Minister Ben Mwila in Lusaka in search of alleged
seditious material, Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
The policemen, launching the operation at 4:00 a.m. (local time)
, did not allow anyone to enter into the residence of Mwila, who
was also the National Treasurer of the country's ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Mwila, in a interview with Zambia National Broadcasting
Corporation Sunday evening, said that about 100 policemen left his
residence at 14:00 p.m. (local time) without taking anything from
his home.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said he has no
information on the reported police action and can not comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mwila lost his ministerial portfolio early last month days
after he was expelled from MMD on a charge of involvement in anti-
party activities.
</P>
<P>
Mwila announced his candidature for the MMD presidency on May
26 in a bid to run for the country's presidency in the general
elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest magnates, helped incumbent
President Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in the
1991 elections. He is seen as one of the leading candidates to
replace Chiluba in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba has indicated that he would ensue that Mwila does
not become the president and those who start the election campaign
for the MMD presidency prematurely will be punished.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Provide Fees for Pipeline Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
considering to pay local communities in the southern oil-producing
states to protect oil pipelines running through their villages.
</P>
<P>
Communities in the oil-producing areas should be encouraged to
guard the pipelines, even if they have to be paid, said Nigerian
Information Minister Jerry Gana in Enugu, capital of Enugu state
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last month pipeline explosions in the country's oil-producing
states, caused by vandalizations of local communities to steal
fuel after having punctured the pipelines, claimed several hundred
lives.
</P>
<P>
The government blamed the explosions on illegal activities of
corrupt officials in the state-run fuel companies, while the fuel
companies complained that local villagers tap into the pipelines
to siphon off fuel or crude oil to sell to the black market.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil-producing country in Africa, produces
more than 2 million barrels of crude oil daily, accounting for
more than 90 percent of the country's revenue.

NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen humanitarian groups in
Kenya Monday blamed the international community for responding
inadequately to the Kenyan government and the World Food Program's
appeal for 88-million U.S. dollars worth of relief food to over 3
million Kenyans facing starvation as a result of long drought.

<P>
The groups said in a statement that the food shortages are
becoming desperate in the country and so far only a third of the
requirements have been committed.

"There is a serious shortfall for August. There is neither the
food nor the money for us to meet the huge needs we face in the
worst affected regions," said Emma Naylor, emergency program
coordinator for Oxfam Great Britain, which is delivering food in
Wajir and Turkana districts in northeastern and northern Kenya.

Kenya's drought and food shortages are part of a wider problems
in the Horn of Africa, Naylor warned, "we can't wait until this
crisis becomes a catastrophe, and we have to act now to end this
vicious cycle of sufferings."

At the same time, the aid groups called for more support from
donors to long-term solutions .

"We need food to address the immediate needs, but we also need
a commitment to support recovery programs when the drought is over,
" said Edward Ontito, an official from the Adventist Development
and Relief Agency.
