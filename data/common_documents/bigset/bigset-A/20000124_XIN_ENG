<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Leader Turns down PM's  Offer of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Opposition Leader
Begum Khaleda Zia Sunday declined to sit across the table with the
Awami League government following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's
latest offer of dialogue to get over the present political impasse
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is no scope for talks. It can be held with a caretaker
government only after the resignation of the present government,"
Khaleda Zia told a big gathering held in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
pointed out that when the anti-government movement got momentum
across the country against what she termed "the misrule of the
Awami League government," the prime minister had given the offer
of talks when finding no other ways.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda Zia said that the Awami League government could escape
the public wrath if it immediately resign and transfer power to a
caretaker authority to hold fresh polls.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader announced a fresh anti-government program
including "democracy killing day" on January 25.
</P>
<P>
The BNP will also observe "resistance day" on January 27 to
protest against the proposed Public Safety (special provision) act.
The proposed act, she claimed, was aimed at repressing the
opposition leaders and activists.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina repeatedly offered to sit across
the table with the leader of the opposition for an amicable
settlement of the existing political standoff.
</P>
<P>
Her latest offer of an open-hearted dialogue with the
opposition came at a grand conference of business leaders held in
the capital on Saturday. The prime minister urged the opposition
to discuss all issues including opposition's "one point" demand
for resignation of her government.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Mario Matt achieved his first
career victory by winning a men's World Cup slalom in Kitzbuehel,
Austria on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian talent twisted his way down the Ganslern course in
a two-run combined time of one minute, 42.79 seconds, finishing
almost a second ahead of runner-up Matjaz Vrhovnik of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
"It's wicked," said Matt, who finished 10th in the opening leg
of a slalom in Wengen last week before going out in the second. "I
can't believe it. But I had a lot of self confidence."
</P>
<P>
Vrhovnik, who finished third in Chamonix earlier this month,
finished second in 1:43.77.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Raich, who led after the opening leg, had looked
poised to collect his first win of the season, but a slightly
under-par second run dropped him to third with 1:44.02.
</P>
<P>
"Even if I'd had an error-free run I still would not have won,"
said Raich. "Mario was just incredible in the second run."

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Council Meeting on Developing Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese leadership has
urged all localities to take every opportunity in accelerating
economic development in China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a State Council meeting on developing
China's western regions in Beijing from January 19-22.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Premier Zhu Rongji analyzed the current
favorable conditions and opportunities for China to further
develop its western regions.
</P>
<P>
The "western campaign" will among other things, increase
domestic consumption, improve social stability and narrow the gap
between different regions.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years of reform and opening-up has laid a strong
foundation and confidence for local and overseas investors to turn
their attention to expanding China's west.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, State Councilors Ismail Amat and Wang
Zhongyu were present at the meeting. Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
presided over the meeting, attended by ministry officials and
local provincial government officials.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the meeting said as China's entry into the WTO
draws closer, China's western regions will become more accessible
to overseas businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The meeting set five major tasks for the country in the current
and future periods.
</P>
<P>
First, developing infrastructure projects such as highways,
railways, airports, natural gas pipelines, water resources and
telecommunications;
</P>
<P>
Second, protecting and improving the environment;
</P>
<P>
Third, adjusting industrial structures and expanding the
tertiary industry, including tourism.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, developing undertakings of science, technology and
education, and speeding up the cultivation of trained personnel;
and
</P>
<P>
Fifth, making greater efforts in reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Speakers also said that developing the western regions is a
major issue which concerns not only the western regions, but also
the eastern regions and the whole country as well. The country
should appropriately concentrate its financial power to support
the western regions.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the importance of enhancing unity among
different ethnic groups, so as to ensure smooth development of the
western regions.

<HEADLINE> Asian Demand Drives Worldwide PC Market in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Healthy consumer demand and
record volume in Asia capped a strong close to the 1999 worldwide
PC market, which grew 23.3 percent, according to a study released
Monday by U.S. research firm International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from IDC's study show that 112.7 million
units were shipped in 1999. Worldwide volume increases in the
fourth quarter last year were led by strong results in the
Japanese and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) markets, which both
registered year-on-year growth of 38 percent. The Japanese market
in the whole year grew 36 percent, topping all regions.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that the Asian markets have made a complete turnaround
after an abysmal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained stable in 1999, growing 25 percent
over a year ago. Internet demand and lower PC prices also
continued to drive consumer sales in Western Europe. Elsewhere,
market expansion was led by the revitalized markets in Russia and
Brazil, coupled with positive results from Canada and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
According IDC, Compaq, with 15.7 million units shipped or 14
percent market share, held the top position in the worldwide 1999
PC market. However, in the United States, Dell managed to obtain
the number-one ranking for the year, with 7.5 million units and 16.
6 percent of market share.

<HEADLINE> EU Stresses Strategic Partnership With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday it stresses that a long-term strategic partnership between
the EU and Russia can only be developed successfully if it is
based on common values and shared objectives.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the 15-nation bloc called on the new
political leadership in Russia "to act to ensure that Russia lives
up to the standards expected from all members of the community of
free and democratic nations."
</P>
<P>
After their general affairs meeting in Brussels, the ministers
said in a statement that they welcomed the democratic conduct of
the recent Duma elections and "the smooth, constitutional
transition of power after the resignation of President Yeltsin."
The EU "looks forward to a free and fair campaign leading up to
the president election on March 26."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers underlined Russia's importance as a major
partner of the EU. "The EU would like to continue to build and
develop this long-term strategic partnership with a view to
enhancing security and stability in Europe and beyond."
</P>
<P>
"To this end, it is ready to continue its political dialogue
with Russia in order to address questions of mutual interest,
including issues of disagreement and concern such as the conflict
in Chechnya," they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers agreed to suspend part of the EU's
financial aid to Russia because of continued concerns over the
Russian military campaign in Chechnya. They also froze talks on
extending trade preferences to Russia. Observers here believe this
is only a political gesture and there would be little impact on
Russia.

<HEADLINE> EU Wants Play Full Role For Peace in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Monday
expressed its willingness to play a full role in the Middle East
peace process when its member states' foreign ministers met with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After their first-day session of the two-day general affairs
meeting of the EU Council of Ministers, the foreign ministers said
in a statement that the 15-nation bloc will set up examination of
issues in which "the EU is particularly suited to play a full role,
such as security, water and refugees, with a view to consideration
by the Council at the later stage."
</P>
<P>
The ministers welcomed the decision of the United States and
Russia as co-sponsors to hold a meeting of the Steering Group of
the multilateral track of the Middle East peace process by the end
of the month in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
They said there is a need to draft a vision paper on the future
of the region so that the "EU is well prepared to play its full
role once peace has been achieved."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers welcomed President Arafat as its guest
for an informal exchange of views on the peace process and
especially its Palestinian track. The EU "expressed its concerns
over the recent postponements in that track."
</P>
<P>
They also "regretted the hiatus in the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations and urged their early resumption. It agreed on the
importance also of resuming the Lebanese track."

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Deeply In Fear Of Higher Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 243.54 at 11,008.
17, extending its losses of 471.27 points in the past four
consecutive sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 39.83 at 1,401.53 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 139.32 at 4,096.08.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged at midday from a strong rally in the morning
session when Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Jack Guynn'
s comments sparked fears of higher rates. Guynn said he did not
see any evidence that three rate increases last year have reduced
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Guynn's words made before Greenspan's testimony Tuesday were
seen as an indication that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at
a meeting on February 1-2 and the rate increase will not be the
last this year.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year to cool
off the U.S. economy as pre-empty moves to keep inflation under
control. For all of 1999, consumer prices rose 2.7 percent,
compared with 1.6 percent in 1998, but core inflation, which
excludes volatile food and energy, slowed in 1999 with prices up
only 1.9 percent compared with 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
High rate worries dumped investors' optimism with strong
corporate earnings. Companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
are on track to report average profit growth of 20 percent for the
final quarter of 1999 but traders suspected these numbers will be
repeatable.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 14.34 at 625.24 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.13 at 905.49. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 10.99 at 522.95.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.10 billion shares from 1.21 billion
in the previous session.

Cortes, 73 years old, was director and shareholder of
television newscasts "NTC" and "Zero Hour," president of
independent football club Santa Fe and Colombian consul in Seville,
Spain, in 1998.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Assembly Rejects Policing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland Assembly
Monday passed a Democratic Unionist Party motion rejecting the
controversial Patten proposals on policing reform.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a day of heated debate in Northern Ireland
capital of Belfast, the DUP motion calling on the British
government to reject the Patten report was passed by 50 votes to
42.
</P>
<P>
The motion accuses the government of rewarding terrorists and
destroying the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
An amendment from the Alliance Party saying the report "offered
a new beginning for policing for all sections for the community"
was overwhelmingly defeated.
</P>
<P>
Unionists were angered last week when Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson announced that most elements of the
report compiled by an independent commission would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
The change to the Royal Ulster Constabulary's name and badge
were two of the most contentious issues for unionists.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Seeks Larger U.N. Role on Peace in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma was delivering her speech at a special Security
Council meeting on the situation of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa believes that the deployment of a U.N. peace-
keeping force is critical for a successful implementation of the
agreement and needs the support of the international community,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, parties involved in the DRC conflict signed
the Lusaka Peace Agreement, but there are many reported cease-fire
violations after the event.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC conflict is one of the most complex problems involving
six member states and rebel movements in our region," she said.
</P>
<P>
"A delay by the Security Council in carrying out its
fundamental duty may lead to the worsening of the situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the solution to the many-sided conflict, she said, "We still
believes that there is no other option to the resolution of the
conflict than within the framework which the parties, the United
Nations, the Organization of African Unity, and the leaders of the
Southern African Development Community decided upon when they
signed the Lusaka Agreement on July 10, 1999."
</P>
<P>
"The Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement must be successfully
implemented by all concerned," she said. "South Africa reaffirms
its neutral role in the search for lasting peace in the Congo and
in the Great Lake area."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia supported DRC President Laurent
Kabila in fighting rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The special meeting, taking the form of an open debate Monday,
came at a time when the 15-nation Security Council is considering
a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to deploy 5,
000 troops to protect 500 unarmed U.N. military observers, of whom
only 79 have been deployed on the ground.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Norway Encourage Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Norway and Egypt are keen on
enhancing cooperation in several domains, especially oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference jointly held by visiting Norwegian Minister
of Trade and Industry Lars Sponheim and Egyptian Economy Minister
Youssef Boutros Ghali Monday, Sponheim said that the Norwegian
companies operating in egypt would activate bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sponheim is on a three-day visit to Egypt. He pledged his
government's assistance to give the Egyptian goods access to the
Norwegian market.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian vegetables and fruit are the most preferable goods to
be imported to Norway, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the two ministers disclosed that an Egyptian-
Norwegian business council has been set up and will meet regularly
to enhance cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries in 1998 stood at 179
million Egyptian pounds (52 million U.S. dollars), with Norwegian
exports to Egypt accounting for 150 million pounds (44 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Norway pays around 50 million dollars annually in tolls for
the suez canal transit, Sponheim said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, the Norwegian minister met with
ministers of transport, the public enterprises, communications, oil
and electricity.

<HEADLINE> Oil Leaks From Sunken Ship off UAE Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is trying to stop the oil leak from a sunken ship off the coast of
Abu Dhabi, the UAE Federal Environmental Agency (FEA) said late
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 19:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT), some 200 to 300 tons of
fuel, covering an area of 600 meters long and 100 meters wide, has
leaked from the Honduran-flagged ship Al Jaziah 1, which sank seven
miles (about 11.2 kilometers) east of Abu Dhabi coast Monday
morning, the agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the leakage is still continuing while concerned
authorities are making utmost efforts to stop the leakage and tug
the ship to a secured area.
</P>
<P>
The sunken ship, owned by the Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaziah Company,
was sailing from Abu Dhabi to Somalia carrying about 980 tons of
heavy fuel, according to FEA Director General Salem Al Dhahiri, who
convened an emergency meeting to deal with the pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Agency was informed by the Coast Guards of the
incident, it immediately carried necessary contacts with the Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company and other companies with equipment to
fight pollution," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Coast Guards, who received a rescue message from the sunken
ship, also sent vessels and divers to examine the accident and
evaluate the volume of the leakage," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the cause of the accident was still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Baggage Handler Strike Delays Flights at Switzerland's Largest Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A strike by baggage handlers
Monday at Switzerland's largest airport, Zurich Kloten, delayed
flights and left passengers stranded for hours.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said at least 14 flights had been delayed by
up to four-and-a-half hours, following a strike by about 150
baggage handlers employed by the SAir subsidiary, Swissport,
according to a Swiss Radio International report.
</P>
<P>
Airport and fire service personnel have been drafted in to
handle baggage, but a backlog of around 1,500 pieces of luggage is
causing chaos to flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
SAir spokesman, Urs Peter Naef, said the disruption had
worsened as the day went on. "Passengers have had to carry their
bags to the aircraft themselves. That's not so bad in the morning
as we have a lot of business customers. But the problems got worse
later in the day,when the long-haul flights started leaving Zurich.
"
</P>
<P>
The strikers are protesting their transfer to a new company,
complaining that the arrangement will lead to poorer working
conditions and the loss of flight concessions. They are demanding
increased pay and protection from dismissal in case of strike
actions.
</P>
<P>
SAir said it had "started discussions aimed at normalizing the
situation", but gave no indication about how long the strike might
last.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Reaches Record Levels in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of meningitis cases
in Switzerland reached a record of 168 in 1999, an increase of 40
percent over 1998, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss Health Ministry was quoted Monday as saying
that the rise is no cause for alarm. The ministry claimed that the
reason for the sudden rise is unclear, but it is a Europe-wide
phenomenon. Nearly all European countries reported increased cases
of the deadly brain disease.
</P>
<P>
In an average year, 119 people in Switzerland succumb to
meningitis, said Swiss Radio International. Of those, an estimated
10 percent do not survive. The last record year was 1991 when 143
cases were diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is now analyzing the data to ascertain
which types of meningitis are most common. The disease manifests
in three different types, known as A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
More than half the recorded cases were meningitis B, for which
there is no vaccination, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Albright Sees Helms' Remarks at U.N. Quite Different From U.S. Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albright, who chaired a meeting on the peace process in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), used the opportunity to
distance both herself and the Clinton administration from Helms,
the consecutive senator, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and an inveterate critic of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Today, on behalf of the president, let me say that the Clinton
administration and I believe that most Americans see our role in
the world and our relationship to this Organization quite
differently than does Senator Helms," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks as she was chairing the Security
Council meeting as the United States is holding the presidency of
the 15-nation council for the month of January.
</P>
<P>
Departing from her prepared text at the start of a special
meeting on the DRC, Albright said, "So let me be clear: only the
president and the executive branch can speak for the United States.
"
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the United Nations Charter and the
Organization's purpose. We respect its rules, which we helped to
write. We want to strengthen it through continued reform and we
recognize its many contributions to our own interest in a more
secure, democratic and humane world," she said.
</P>
<P>
Helms, in his appearance at the Security Council last Thursday,
accused the United Nations of trying to usurp U.S. sovereignty by
setting itself up as "the central authority of a new international
order of global law and global governance."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected charges that the United States was a "deadbeat
nation" for not paying its U.N. back dues in time, threatening the
Security Council with "the U.S. withdrawal" if the world body
fails to follow the U.S. concept of reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Helms' remarks met with strong criticism from the 14 other
Security Council members, including the U.S. Western allies, who
said that the U.S. reluctance to pay its back dues has largely
blocked the U.N. reform process and prevented the world body from
carrying out its mandate.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott on Monday expressed optimism over the prospect of
relations between the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, in Tallinn to receive an award conferred by Estonia
for his contributions to the development of U.S. ties with the
Baltic state, said there is every chance for cooperation between
Washington and Moscow with Vladimir Putin as acting Russian
president, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said he and Putin developed a good relationship during
the Kosovo crisis and had their last meeting about a week before
Putin became acting president following Boris Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation on December 31.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said he would travel on to Helsinki for talks
on key issues with Russian officials. Talbott is scheduled to meet
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov, Interfax said,
citing the Russian Embassy in Tallinn.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said Washington will continue assisting Russia with its
reforms and that this assistance would come via international
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said Chechnya remains the main source of tension between
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said Washington regards Chechnya as part of Russia, but
he accused Moscow of departing from the standards of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in dealing
with terrorism and criticized Russia for causing civilian deaths
in Chechnya, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Biosafety Conference Opens in Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations-sponsored
conference on a Biosafety Protocol opened Monday in Montreal,
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 134 countries are meeting to conclude
rules in a course of five days to regulate the development of
genetically modified foodstuffs, which have been in dispute for
the past five years between the European Union and the United
States-led Miami group.
</P>
<P>
The European Union insists on its right to choose what it
considers safe in import of foodstuffs, while the United States,
Canada and other members of the Miami group demand their right to
export under the related international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The European countries are arguing that not enough long-term
testing is done before genetically altered foods hit the market.
They have proposed putting health and environmental concerns over
trade liberalization by imposing mandatory labeling on altered
foods.
</P>
<P>
In counter-arguments, the Miami group says there is a vast
amount of data that show these products are safe.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is also being staged outside the meeting place at
the city's United Nations International Civil Aviation
Organization office building.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 scientists Monday released a declaration in Montreal,
saying that "recombinant DNA techniques constitute powerful and
safe means for the modification of organisms and can contribute
substantially" to the improvement of agriculture, health care and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of others are moving to protest what they think
potentially adverse effects of genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
In one of the peaceful marches in the past few days, about 300
Greenpeace protesters Saturday walked to the venue of the informal
talks to express the fear that the international trade
considerations could weaken the proposed protocol.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, under the auspices of the United
Nations Biodiversity Secretariat, will be highlighted by a
ministerial meeting slated for Thursday and Friday.

<HEADLINE> Albright Disappointed by U.N. Council's Deadlock Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Monday that she was disappointed about
the United Nations Security Council's deadlock over nominating a
chairman for a new U.N. arms regime for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Albright, who is here presiding over a
United Nations Security Council debate on the situation in
Democratic Republic of the Congo, said " I was deeply disappointed
by some of the discussions last week in which the Security Council
did not honor the agreement made that Secretary-General would be
able to nominate a chairman."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted the Security Council
last week of his nomination of Sweden's Ambassador to the United
States, Rolf Ekeus, as the Executive Chairman of the United
Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission(UNMOVIC)
for Iraq created by a resolution last month to replace now defunct
the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has been barred from returning to Iraq since it withdrew
from the Iraq days before the U.S.-led military strikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she found it "mighty ironic" that, although
certain countries longed for Ambassador Ekeus when UNSCOM was
headed by Richard Butler, but they did not support him when the
opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council last month adopted a
resolution on Iraq which created UNMOVIC. The resolution also
requested the U.N. chief to nominate the chairman of UNMOVIC
within 30 days of the adoption of the resolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (
GEF) have recently launched a project to protect major wetlands in
China, the UNDP said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, valued at 34.6 million U.S. dollars, was launched
with the goal of conserving globally significant wetlands and
biodiversity, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 25 million hectares of natural wetlands
with large concentrations of biodiversity. The wetlands can offer
sustainable livelihoods to local communities and perform important
hydrological functions.
</P>
<P>
The project will promote sustainable development in and around
wetland sites, increase community participation, improve
environmental education and develop local and national capacities
to integrate conservation into the development process.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP said four representative wetland areas have been
selected as initial demonstration sites for the project: The
Sanjing Plain, The Ruoergai Marshes, the Yangcheng Coastal Marshes
and the Dongting Lakes.

Kabila, who read from a prepared French speech, told an open

Meanwhile, he also proposed the interpositioning of the U.N.

peace has not been quenched."
</P>
<P>
"I am here today once again to offer my hand of reconciliation
to those who have done us harm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila came to power after toppling the late dictator Monbuto
Sese Seko in 1997, and the conflict broke out in eastern DRC,
formerly known as Zaire, in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supported Kabila to fight against
rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The open debate came at a time when the Security Council is
considering the deployment of U.N. peace-keepers in the central
African country. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his report
to the Security Council last week, proposed the deployment of 5,
000 unarmed military observers, of which only 79 have been
deployed. He indicated that the initial intervention could set the
stage for a much larger, more costly operation.

<HEADLINE> WHO Chief Calls for Global Efforts to Fight Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland has called for
"unprecedented responses" from the world community in the fight
against HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Monday at the opening of WHO's 105th Executive
Board meeting, Brundtland said, "HIV/AIDS has never been higher on
the international agenda" as a development issue but also as a
crisis at the top of the world's security attention as reflected
by the unique discussion in the U.N. Security Council. We must
capitalize on the momentum provided by this renewed international
attention."
</P>
<P>
The WHO chief singled out the HIV/AIDS because it is now the
leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, and because it
threatens to become a devastating problem for other areas of the
world, especially the Indian Sub-Continent, WHO explained in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people in the Newly Independent States living
with HIV/AIDS has doubled in the last two years," Brundtland
warned. "In Asia more than 6 million people are infected. If the
epidemic is not controlled in the Indian Sub-Continent, the
consequences for that region will be truly appalling."
</P>
<P>
She said that lessons should be learned from those countries
where infection rates are falling such as in Uganda and Thailand.
"Countries that have shown how strong political leadership, an
openness to confront sensitive issues, and a multi-sectoral
response which links efforts across government and civil society
can start to turn the tide," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She outlined WHO's three-pronged attack against the AIDS
epidemic: care for the more than 30 million people currently
living with HIV/AIDS, reduction in mother-to-child transmission,
and access to HIV/AIDS-related drugs.

<HEADLINE> Iran Breaks Ground for Gas Refinery in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh on Monday broke ground for a gas refinery in the southern
Bushehr province as part of the giant project to develop the South
Pars gas field.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said gas will be the best fuel in the 21st century and
his ministry has decided to replace the oil products with gas in
domestic consumption and to export extra oil products, the Islamci
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Pars Oil and Gas Company Asadollah
Salehiforuz said at the ground-breaking ceremony that the gas
refinery will have the daily refining capacity of 1 billion cubic
feet (28.3 million cubic meters).
</P>
<P>
He said the South Korean Hyundai Engineering and Construction
Company has signed an agreement to set up all installations at the
refinery, including sweetening, separation and reinforcing liquid
gas plants, and a 360 megawatt power plant.
</P>
<P>
He said the Persian Gulf Shipbuilding Company of Iran and the N.
P.C.C. of Abu Dhabi have started to build two oil rigs to dig 20
wells.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 33 percent of the construction work will carried out
by Iranian companies, Salahiforuz said, adding that the reserves of
the South Pars gas field in the Persian Gulf is estimated at 436
trillion cubic feet (12.3 trillion cubic meters).
</P>
<P>
He said units of the refinery will become operational every four
months each as of 2001 and the refinery will come on stream totally
by March 2003.
</P>
<P>
A consortium formed by Total SA of France, Gazprom of Russia and
Petronas of Malaysia are involved in carrying out the second and
third phases of the South Pars gas project.

<HEADLINE> Net Private Capital Flows to Leading Emerging Markets to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Net private capital flows to
leading emerging market economies are forecast to rise to 190
billion U.S. dollars this year, from the range of 150 billion
dollars per year in both 1998 and 1999, according to a new study
released Monday by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).
</P>
<P>
"While private capital flows remain below the average levels
seen over the last five years, international investors and lenders
are showing increasing confidence in emerging markets," said IIF
Managing Director Charles Dallara.
</P>
<P>
The report said that foreign direct investment into emerging
market economies reached a record 140 billion dollars last year,
after 120 billion dollars in 1998, and a further strong
performance is anticipated this year.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio equity investments into emerging market countries are
expected to climb to 34 billion dollars after totaling 17 billion
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The IIF projected that total net private credit flows,
including lending by banks and investments in new bond issues,
will rebound to about 40 billion dollars this year, after a
negative 7 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Net new bond flows and other non-bank private credits are
forecast to increase from 30 billion dollars last year to around
40 billion dollars this year, which is still considerable below
the average of recent years.
</P>
<P>
Absent new crises and with repayments of official loans moving
ahead, the IIF projected that net official capital flows to the
leading emerging market countries will decline this year to about
9 billion dollar from almost 60 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report forecast that net private flows to Asia will
increase substantially to reach almost 60 billion dollars this
year, after rising to 40 billion dollars in 1999 from 6 billion
dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The increase reflects a significant moderation in the
withdrawal of commercial bank flows from the countries that were
hardest hit by the 1997 crisis. Furthermore, foreign direct
investment to Asia remains strong, with about 40 billion dollars
forecast to flow to China alone.
</P>
<P>
Net private capital flows to Latin America are also projected
to rise, reaching 85 billion dollars this year after amounting to
68 billion dollars in 1999. Brazil is expected to account for the
bulk of the increase in flows to the region.
</P>
<P>
The IIF projected that net private capital flows to the
emerging market economies of Europe to remain stable at just over
30 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Extension of UN Mission in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday recommended to extend the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)for a further period of six
months until July 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
while hostilities in south Lebanon over the past six months have
been at a "somewhat reduced level,' the situation in the area
remains volatile.
</P>
<P>
Noting the continuing importance of UNIFIL's contribution to
stability in the area and to the protection of civilians, the
Secretary-General recommended extending the mission's mandate,
which expires on January 31.
</P>
<P>
Fighting had continued during the July-December 1999 period,
but "armed elements initiated fewer large-scale operations and on
occasion refrained from retaliatory measures." There has also
been a decrease in civilian casualties, he report added.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged the parties to continue to exercise restraint and
respect the noncombatant status of civilians.
</P>
<P>
He also drew attention to the serious shortfall in the funding
of UNIFIl, with unpaid assessments now amounting to almost 109
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> 1,152 Federal Troops Killed in North Caucasus: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,152 Russian
servicemen have been killed and 3,246 others wounded since Russia'
s counter-terrorist operation was launched last fall in the North
Caucasus, the Interfax news agency reported Monday, citing
unofficial sources.
</P>
<P>
In Chechnya alone, 926 Defense Ministry servicemen, interior
troops and policemen have been killed and 2,432 others wounded
since 1999, Interfax said, quoting sources in the Russian law-
enforcement and defense agencies.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three interior troops are listed as missing, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred thirty-six Defense Ministry servicemen and interior
troops were killed and 814 were wounded during the operation to
repulse attacking rebels in August to September 1999, Interfax
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflecting total federal losses in the North
Caucasus have not yet been confirmed by the Defense Ministry or
the Interior Ministry, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The federal losses have increased considerably since a special
operation to liberate Grozny, the regional capital, was launched
about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Military experts estimated that the federal forces in Grozny
are being opposed by nearly 2,500 rebels, including many
mercenaries. In addition, 5,000 rebels are based in the mountains
in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Different sources have put rebel deaths at 4,000 to 7,000,
Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for U.N. Actions to Bring Peace to DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos told an open Security
Council debate here that "We ask that the United Nations act
expeditiously by sending the peace-keeping forces and by
increasing the logistic and financial support."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, besides guaranteeing the actions set up in
the accords, namely, the disarming and demilitarization of the
rebel forces, has the immediate and special responsibility of
interpositioning and separating the warring forces so as to uphold
the cease-fire and avoid new violations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The open debate came at a time as the 15-nation Security
Council is considering a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to deploy 5,000 troops to protect 500 unarmed U.N.
military observers in a bid to promote the peace process in DRC.
</P>
<P>
Angola joined Zimbabwe and Namibia in supporting President
Laurent Kabila in fighting against rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda. Kabila came to power in 1997 after he toppled the late
dictator Mobuto Sese Seko in what was then Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos raised a series of proposals to put an end to the
conflict in DRC: to accelerate the disarmament of the rebel forces
and form a single national army, to recognize the authority of the
present government as the government of transition that should
lead the country to legislative and presidential elections, to be
held under the supervision of the international community.
</P>
<P>
DRC is a country which shares borders with nine other countries
in the region, "Angola was once again forced to intervene in order
to avoid bloodshed and contain the threat of escalation of this
new war on its borders," he said, referring the Angolan decision
to send its troops to fight along with President Kabila after the
outbreak of conflict with Kabila in power for less than one year.
</P>
<P>
In July and August last year, parties involved in the conflict
signed a peace accord, called Lusaka Agreement. Since then,
however, there have been many cease-fire violations, which have
caused fresh suffering.

<P>
 NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the Food
 and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Jacques Diouf, on Monday
urged African countries to work towards marketing their
agro-products among themselves while they fight for a fair place
on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Accra, the Ghanaian capital,
he said lots of opportunities exist for Africans to trade among
themselves, adding that they should address the issues of
tariffs, standardization, transportation and other physical
barriers to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
 While urging African countries to defend their own interests,
the FAO chief said it was unfair for developed countries to ask
African countries to stop subsidizing farmers, according to Ghana
News Agency report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
 "It is a battle of interests and no one would offer you
things freely when you sit at home. African countries must
develop their own framework, make sound arguments backed with
figures and facts to defend their interests," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
 The press conference was called to throw more light on the
Agricola Medal presented to President Jerry John Rawlings for
his contribution towards improving Ghana's agricultural growth and
global food security.
</P>
<P>
 The Medal, FAO highest distinction award, was instituted in
1977 to honor individuals who dedicate themselves to fighting

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrived here Monday for aid
resumption talks with the Kenyan government, the government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team is a follow-up to a decision made by the IMF last
month for restarting talks with the Kenyan government on the
resumption of the loan which the IMF suspended in July, 1997 for
the reasons of corruption and poor governance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the suspension of the lending, Kenyan economy had
experienced recession for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Central Bank of Kenya said that the IMF
mission would meet the government officials from the Ministry of
Finance and central bank.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that there would be tough talks ahead
before the IMF agrees to the loan deal.
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts for economic reform and restructuring undertaken
by the Kenyan government have won praise from the IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi met with IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus in Libreville, Gabon, and they
reviewed how Kenya and the IMF could cooperate to eradicate
poverty in the country.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Urges Pressing Israel For Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday
urged the United States to press its Middle East ally Israel to
adhere to commitments and continue the promised peace talks with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
During the cabinet weekly session held in the western Saudi
port city of Jeddah, King Fahd Ibn Abdulaziz expressed hope the
next
round of negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track should make
tangible progress in order to achieve a just and lasting peace in
the
Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Fahd also reaffirmed his country's support for Syria in
regaining the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war. The return of Golan is also at the core of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed the peace talks in Washington on
December 15 last year, after nearly four years of deadlock. The two
sides have held two rounds of tough negotiations in the U.S. during
the past 40 days.
</P>
<P>
But the third round, which was scheduled to have start in
Washington on January 19, was postponed indefinitely due to the two
sides' differences over agenda.
</P>
<P>
Syria demands Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan be
discussed first in the coming while Israel wants to tackle the
security arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
Syria also required Israel to present a written commitment to
the pullback to the June 4, 1967 pre-Mideast-War border line near
the eastern edge of the Sea of Galilee, the main water source of
Israel. Israel, rejecting the request, voiced fear that such a
pullback will expose its strategic water resources to potential
Syrian attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Self-confessed former Nazi
concentration camp officer and suspected war criminal Alexander
Schweidler died in a British hospital on Monday, the Reuters
reported.
</P>
<P>
Schweidler, 78, died at Milton Keynes General Hospital, some 80
kilometers northwest of London early Monday after his wife called
the emergency services when he collapsed with chest pains.
</P>
<P>
Schweidler, who received a state pension until his death,moved
to London in 1948 from Germany and became a citizen in 1964. He
retired to Florida in 1984 but returned to Britain with his second
wife, Anna, after being expelled from the United States for
suspected war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Just last week, police said they would not investigate him.
They said they had already questioned him in 1996 and found
insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Schweidler had always maintained that he was a simple guard at
the Mauthausen concentration camp where more than 60,000 Jews were
killed in World War II.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Hails Raising of Military Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Monday welcomed the decision by
governments to raise from 15 to 18 years the age at which
participation in armed conflicts will be permitted and to
establish a ban on compulsory recruitment below 18 years.
</P>
<P>
"After six years of stalemate these decisions are a very
welcome breakthrough," said UNICEF's Executive Director Carol
Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
But she also said that the agreement reached on Friday by the U.
N. Working Group, established to raise the standards in the
Convention on the Rights of the Child for children in armed
conflict, leaves too much open to interpretation, particularly as
it regards governmental military forces and voluntary enlistment.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the accord falls short of the straight 18 ban that
UNICEF and others had sought.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF"s concern is for the best interest of the child,
regardless of where they live or on which side of the conflict
they are situated," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF had sought consistency on 18 years as marking the point
at which adulthood begins.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 300, 000 children -- some as young
as eight-- are involved in the 30 active conflicts around the
world, as soldiers, porters or sexual slaves. Many are forcibly
recruited.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- World Food Program (WFP) has
resumed its food assistance to Uganda's western district of
Bundibugyo after a suspension of several months.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting in the district chaired by
Uganda's Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Tom
Butime, Radio Uganda reported Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting also attended by Chief of Staff of Uganda

WFP suspended its food assistance to Bundibugyo last year
following a spate of rampant attacks in the district by ADF
rebels, saying that the rebel attacks had threatened the lives of

KAMPALA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni had held talks with regional leaders in New York, who
were also attending the U. N. Security Council's special session
on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Monday
evening said that Museveni met with President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President
Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, but did not mention the contents of
their talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. debate on the DRC opens later Monday, to be attended
by heads of state of Uganda, Rwanda, Namibia, Angola, the DRC,
Zimbabwe as well as the representatives of the 15 member countries
of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is said to have held the session on the
DRC before discussing issues of sending peace observers and
peacekeepers to the third largest African country where the civil
war has been going on for almost one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Soon after civil war's breakout, troops from Zimbabwe, Angola,
Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda were sucked in for different purposes.
In July last year, players in the conflict hammered out a peace
accord in Lusaka, Zambia. But it has not been substantially
implemented due to differences among the stakeholders and the
on-and-off fighting in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Cautious about Joining WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopian official
said here Monday that his country will not join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) before it is sure that this action is
supportive to its national economic development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on WTO and multilateral trade system, Vice
Trade and Industry Minister Brook Debebe said developing
countries needed to learn the various techniques of negotiations
and know the impact of WTO's measures on their economy before
they make any commitment to join the global body.
</P>
<P>
Brook said the key issue for Ethiopia was that the agreements
emanating from multilateral agenda for negotiations must be
supportive of Ethiopian strategy for national economic development
in general and trade growth in particular.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has set up a committee composed of various
governmental organizations and academic institutions to examine
WTO agreements and their impacts on the country's economic policy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar, organized by the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, was aimed at sharing experiences on the issue with the

NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Tea prices at Kenya's weekly
auction in Indian Ocean port Mombasa dropped after Egypt withdrew
from the market following a trade dispute with Kenya, brokers
said.
</P>
<P>
Worst hit were the grades in which Egyptians were traditionally
major buyers and their absence was felt across the market,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
A trade dispute between Kenya and Egypt has been rumbling since
last November after Kenya refused to allow Egyptian rice products
into the country at a preferential tariff, as required in a
regional trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt retaliated by not approving documents required to unload
Kenyan tea from ships at Port Said harbour.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the East Africa Tea Trade Association based in
Mombasa said the problems had arisen again and have warned that
the withdrawal of Egypt,
</P>
<P>
the third largest buyer of Kenyan tea, could cause prices at the
auction to collapse.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Energy officials of Turkey,
Georgia and Azerbaijan Monday failed to finalize an agreement on an
oil pipeline that links Azerbaijian's capital of Baku and Turkey's
Mediterranean port city of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The officials held three days of inconclusive consultations from
January 21 to 23 in Ankara, with the presence of the U.S. President
Bill Clinton's special envoy for Caspian Basin energy policies John
Wolf, the Anatolia News Agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Energy Ministry said the officials could not put
final signatures on the Baku-Ceyhan Pipeline Project Agreement, but
Georgian and Azerbaijani working groups have decided to convene in
February to finalize the articles of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Istanbul last December on the
sidelines of the summit of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, aiming at transporting Azerbaijani oil
through Georgia to Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
Disagreements between Azerbaijan and Georgia on environmental
protection, pipeline security, expropriation and tariffs have
delayed the construction of the pipeline that should have started
on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded meeting aimed to iron out differences so as
to start the project in February. But it seems that the project
will be delayed again because the sides have yet to reach
agreements on the articles.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiating Teams Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua)-- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams on interim issues held another meeting here
Monday, but nothing has been decided.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran told reporters after the
meeting that issues such as Israel's next troop withdrawal from the
West Bank, release of more Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli
jails and economic cooperation between the two sides were discussed
in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two teams addressed all these issues, but no progress was
made, Eran said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's next troop redeployment, he said that
Israel has never agreed to hand over Abu Dis, an Arab village hard
by East Jerusalem, to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He added that the maps on Israel's withdrawal has not been
finalized yet and the next troop redeployment could be further
delayed for some time.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September,
Israel had to carry out its third troop withdrawal from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank territories on January 20. But the
pullback has been postponed due to the differences over which areas
that Israelis have to transfer.
</P>
<P>
On the areas that Palestinian side wants Israel to hand over,
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat, who led the Palestinian
team at the meeting, said that Abu Dis is not a part of Jerusalem,
and Israel has to hand it over in the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Besides Abu Dis, the Palestinian side also wants Israel to
transfer several Arab villages north of Jerusalem to its control.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Keen to Participate in Gulf Privatization: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
here on Monday that the United States is keen to see the Gulf
countries go along the way of privatization, promising strong U.S.
participation in the process.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support privatization in the region. We would
anticipate that once privatization occurred, there is going to be a
strong bid for U.S. participation," said Robert Mallet, U.S. deputy
secretary of commerce, who began a two-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the U.S. official said the private sector
is the major force behind the longest peace time economic expansion
in his country.
</P>
<P>
He called on Gulf leaders to link their economies to the global
economy through the establishment of a strong private sector.
</P>
<P>
Mallet will deliver the keynote address at the Gulf and North
Africa Project Finance and Privatization Conference to be opened in
Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference will bring together participants from across the
Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mallet said the current U.S. Administration under President Bill
Clinton attaches great importance to the ever expanding commercial
and economic partnership between the U.S. and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
"I have come to the UAE on the heels of Commerce Secretary
William Daley's trade mission last October to encourage stronger,
more diversified commercial partnership between our two countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that discussions with the UAE on
finalizing a long-awaited F-16 jet fighters deal will be
successfully concluded.
</P>
<P>
The 7-billion-U.S.-dollar deal was originally expected to be
sealed at the end of 1998. But it was delayed by a row over U.S.
refusal to hand over source codes and master keys for weapons
systems of the most advanced F-16 jet fighters, built by Lockheed
Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both sides said last November that technical
aspects of the deal had been resolved, while price considerations
were still holding up the signing of the deal.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Not to Seek Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri announced on Monday that
he would not run in the forthcoming parliamentary elections so as
to "let newcomers enter the scene."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Nouri said he will work full time as head
of the Inspection Office of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
after he leaves office after the February 18 election.
</P>
<P>
He said that serving as a parliamentarian for five consecutive
terms and as speaker for two terms was enough for him and the
country needs new forces to come to the scene and acquire necessary
experiences, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Since Iranian president is limited to hold the post for two
consecutive terms, it would be good for a speaker to be in office
for two consecutive terms as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, 57, began his political activities in 1963 by making a
speech against the late Shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
After the 1979 Islamic revolution, he served as representative
of late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini in the
Construction Jihad, and as a Majlis deputy. He was interior
minister from 1981 to 1985, and Majlis speaker from 1992.
</P>
<P>
The well-known conservative leader did not register for the
coming parliamentary polling after former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani announced to run for a seat in the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, a moderate with close ties with the conservatives,
is expected to regain the post of Majlis speaker, which he had held
for 10 years from 1979 to 1989 before being elected president.
</P>
<P>
Following Rafsanjani's registration, the conservatives, who
dominate most of the state organs, declined to name their candidate
for the post of Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
However, political parties in the moderate camp supporting the
reformist policies of President Mohammad Khatami disputed with each
other over Rafsanjani's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The leftist reformist parties, isolated during Rafsanjani's
presidency, considered his nomination a hindrance for Khatami's
reform course because of his close links with the conservatives,
particularly his relations with Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Rafsanjani's followers, mainly in the
Party of Constructive Executives of Iran, may split from the
leftist May 23 Front, a political coalition formed in support of
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Both the moderates and conservatives have pinned their hopes on
the coming election to assert their power in the political sphere
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives tried to fortify their control over the Majlis
while the moderates anticipated a victory to unseat the
conservative domination to pave the way for political reforms
advocated by Khatami.

Industry and Tourism Nicos Rolandis announced Monday that more than
2.4 million foreigners visited the island in 1999, 9.5 percent more
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Rolandis said tourism revenues
reached 1.02 billion Cyprus pounds (1.77 billion U.S. dollars) last
year, compared to 878 million pounds (1.52 billion dollars) in
1998, an increase of 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourist industry is one of Cyprus' biggest cash earners,
providing more than 20 percent of the country's gross national
product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said the country's economy would not have recorded the
high growth rate it enjoys if tourism had been hit.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the growth rate of Cyprus'
economy reached 4.5 percent, exceeding the 4-percent target of the
Strategic Development Plan for 1999-2003.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government on Monday
called on the people to enhance energy-saving consciousness to mark
the 19th "Energy-Saving Week," reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the "Energy-Saving Week," President Suleyman
Demirel said the country has planned to invest 130 billion U.S.
dollars in the energy sector in the coming 30 years and utmost must
be done to make the people conscious of preventing energy wastes.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that Turkey wastes nearly 30 percent of the
energy it uses. "This is a huge amount for a country which produces
39 percent of the energy it consumes and which imports 60 percent
of it. We must be economical," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said Turkey's energy production is behind the average
level of the world. "We must undertake important investments in the
use of such source as nuclear, sun and wind," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president underlined the significant role of energy in
Turkey's struggle to keep pace with the development,
industrialization and prosperity of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources said in a statement
introducing the Week that there are nearly 3 billion dollars of
energy-saving potential in the country, but to make use of the
potential depends on raising the people's saving consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the grim energy situation, the ministry statement
said that Turkey's primary energy demand increases by nearly 7
percent each year and the country may have to import 70 percent of
its total energy needs in 2010.
</P>
<P>
It added that the demand for electricity power has increased 8
percent a year and by 2010, more than twice the current electricity
power will be required.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Team Inspections in Iraq Smooth: U.N. Sources  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of nuclear experts from
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have carried out
their mission smoothly with no problems reported in the process, U.
N. sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources told reporters on condition of anonymity that the
IAEA team led by Ahmad Abu Zahra of Egypt had inspected Iraq's sole
declared nuclear sites in Tuwaitha, 25 kilometers east of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors monitored the condition of quantities of natural
uranium, as well as 1.8 tons of low-enriched uranium left under
seal when U.N. arms inspectors withdrew from Iraq hours before the
U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Undersecretary Riyadh al-Qaisi also told reporters
on Monday that the Iraqi authorities had fully cooperated with this
IAEA team, which he said proved Iraq's credibility to honor its
commitment.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA team is expected to leave Iraq on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five-member IAEA team, which also includes two Yugoslavians,
a Mexican and a Russian, arrived here Friday with a mission to make
sure Iraq's nuclear stocks are not used for military purpose.
</P>
<P>
The inspections are part of world-wide monitoring of nuclear
facilities by the Vienna-based U.N. agency and are not directly
related to the stormy U.N. campaign to disarm Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to perform routine physical inventory checking for
nuclear material," Zahra told reporters on Saturday, adding the
inspection was part of the monitoring program imposed on all
signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed the treaty in 1972.
</P>
<P>
According to IAEA, all weapon-usable materials have been removed
from Iraq in accordance with U.N. resolutions adopted after the
Gulf War. But Iraq still has about 1.8 tons of low enriched uranium
as well as several tons of natural and depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, of which IAEA was in charge of
the nuclear file, have been suspended since the U.S.-British air
attack more than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's cooperation with IAEA had been smooth before the U.S.-
British air war against it. In a report to the U.N. Security
Council in October 1998, IAEA declared that Iraq no longer had the
ability to produce nuclear weapons, but said Baghdad still had to
answer questions about its past atomic program.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted resolution 1284 in December 1999
requiring Iraq to allow a new arms control body to return to the
country in exchange for possible suspension of the crippling
sanctions imposed on it following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has yet to be implemented amid rejection from
Iraq and differences within the Security Council over choosing the
head of the new regime - the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Assistant Minister
of Commerce Abdul Hussein Wahaji arrived here Monday to attend the
third round of meetings of the joint Kuwaiti-Iranian Trade
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Wahaji said the three-day meeting would discuss
the activation and development of trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the volume of trade between Kuwait and Iran witnessed an
apparent improvement last year, exceeding 33 million Kuwaiti dinars
(some 109 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He attributed the growth to the intense efforts of both the
public and private sectors in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official expressed hope that the committee meetings
will widen the horizon for new cooperation and expansion in the
economic, industrial and investment fields.
</P>
<P>
The joint Kuwaiti-Iranian committee meets every three months to
follow up on the implementation of bilateral agreements on trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwait News Agency, Wahaji and his delegation
visited the Kuwait Free Trade Zone (KFTZ) on Monday and were
briefed on the facilities provided for investors.
</P>
<P>
The KFTZ, opened last November, was aimed to promote and
facilitate trade between Kuwait and neighboring countries. It is
also designed to serve as a junction point of trade cooperation
between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Postpones Trial of Muslim Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's higher military court
decided on Monday to defer until January 30 the hearing of the case
of an attempt to revive the banned Muslim Brotherhood in which 20
people are detained, the official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decision after two open sessions during which
testimonies of seven witnesses were listened to.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses, police officers who searched the homes of some of
the accused, said they found religious books, booklets and slogans
of the dissolved Muslim Brotherhood in addition to a number of
cassette and video tapes and computer discs, a computer and emblems
of the radical Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were accused of belonging to a group which was
set up contrary to the law. They were also charged with obstructing
the rules of the constitution, harming social peace, planning to
revive the activities of the banned Muslim Brotherhood and inciting
hostility to the government and recruiting new members.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not say when the defendants were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's biggest fundamentalist group
established in 1928, advocates turning Egypt into a strict Muslim
state by political means, setting itself apart from militant groups
that took up arms in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt's secular government has accused the group of being a
front for militant groups whose violence abated in the past two
years after a tough government crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Annan Asks African Leaders to Honor Peace Accord on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday asked the African leaders, whose countries are
involved in the conflict of the Democratic Republic of Congo, to
reach consensus on the issue and translate the consensus into
action to bring peace into the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"Your challenge is to reach consensus with each other, and
transform the consensus into action," Annan said at the open
Security Council debate on the situation of Congo (K), formerly
known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"This will lay the groundwork for progress on your own," he
said. "Just as important, it will offer a convincing argument in
favor of the international support that Africa merits and which
can help bring about a decisive change for the better."
</P>
<P>
The open debate, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright whose country holds the presidency of the Security
Council for the month of January, has drawn presidents and foreign
ministers from 10 African countries.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Zambia, Mozambique, Congo (K), Angola, Zimbabwe,
Uganda and Rwanda are among 40 speakers at the debate, at which
Salim Ahamed Salim, the Secretary-General of the Organization of
African Unity, is also expected to speak.
</P>
<P>
"It is remarkable to see so many African leaders gathered in
this chamber," Annan said. "You have traveled long distance in an
effort to resolve a conflict that has brought so much suffering to
so many people for so long. the political distance still to be
traveled is even greater."
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is fragile," he said. "Leadership can
strengthen it. Millions of civilians are suffering grievously.
Leadership can inspire them and give them hope."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is here to help," he said. "But the United
Nations has also had bitter experience of help gone wrong."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, for its part, has been active involved in
the search for a peaceful solution since the start of the conflict,
" he said, voicing his support for the effort by African leaders
to bring peace to the central African country.
</P>
<P>
"If the United Nations is to make the right kind of difference
in the DRC, and avoid the wrong turns that have led to tragedies
elsewhere, we must be ready not only to act, but act in a way that
is commensurate with the gravity of this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether that means intense political engagement, a sustainable
commitment of resources, or decisive action in the face of
unforeseen circumstances, we must see this involvement through,"
he said. "At the same time, we must guard against creating
inflated expectations of what can be realistically expected from
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary Security Council session, to be followed by "
mini-summit" Tuesday, came as the 15-nation Security Council is
considering a peacekeeping force for the vast central African
country. The civil war involves some 10,000 troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia supporting President Laurent Kabila of Congo (K)
fight against rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>

of which only 79 have been deployed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Man Blinded by Medicine to Get $20 Million Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday upheld an earlier ruling that a pharmaceutical company have
to pay 22 million dollars in punitive damages to an Oregon man who
went blind after taking medicine for his heart.
</P>
<P>
The justices rejected an appeal by American Home product Corps.
which said a jury's award of 20 million dollars in punitive
damages violated the Constitution's ban on excessive fines.
</P>
<P>
Heart patient Douglas Axen, 56, lost his vision in 1994 after
taking the drug amiodarone, marketed under the brand name
Cordarone by American Home Products' pharmaceutical division,
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
He sued in a county court in Oregon and in 1997 won 407,000
dollars in economic damages, 1.5 million dollars for pain and
suffering, and 20 million dollars in punitive damages, aimed at
punishing and deterring misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The jury also awarded his wife, Sandra, 936,000 dollars in
damages but that amount later was reduced to 500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the ban on excessive
fines does not apply to punitive damages awarded to private
citizens, but under Oregon law nearly half of the 20 million
dollars in punitive damages won by Axen would go to the state.
</P>
<P>
The appeal challenged only the punitive-damages award, which
was first upheld by the state Court of Appeals and then left
intact by the Oregon Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the Eighth Amendment intended that if a state ...
chooses by statute to profit from money extracted by its courts as
punishment, it cannot escape the substantive protection against
excessive fines," the appeal argued.
</P>
<P>
Axen's lawyers, however, noted that Oregon's award-splitting
law has been struck down by a state trial judge for violating the
rights of the private citizens who win punitive-damages awards,
urging the Supreme Court justices to reject American Home Products
' appeal.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Urges U.N. Peace-keeping Deployment in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frederick Chiluba, Zambian president, told an open Security
Council debate that "We consider peace-keepers as allies, not
adversaries."
</P>
<P>
"There is no peace-keeping that does not involve some degree of
risk," he said. "We are involved in peace-keeping because peace is
an imperative for the survival of mankind. It is an imperative for
which we must be prepared to make the supreme sacrifice."
</P>
<P>
The debate, which has drawn presidents and foreign ministers
from 10 African countries, came as the 15-nation Security Council
is considering a peace-keeping force for the vast country, with
the United States, which would have to pay a third of the costs,
hesitating as long as fighting persists.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, we would like to see quick action in regard to the
deployment of the U.N. military observers and peace-keepers," the
president said, adding that he is in agreement with the latest
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the situation of
Congo (K), the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report to the Security Council last week,
proposed the deployment of more than 5,000 troops to protect 500
unarmed U.N. military observers, of which only 79 have been
deployed. He indicated that the initial intervention could set the
stage for a much larger, much costly operation.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, we would like to appeal to the international
community to make more resources available" to the Joint Military
Commission (JMC), which, a body coordinating peace efforts among
parties involved in the conflict, is short of necessary funds to
work for peace in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on the international community to "
provide necessary and adequate resources to support the National
Dialogue" in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
In July last year, a mediation effort led by President Chiluba
on behalf of the Southern Africa Development Community, and with
the support of the Organization of African Unity, resulted in the
signing of the Lusaka peace agreement. Since then, however, there
have been many cease-fire violations, which have caused fresh
suffering.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of U.N. military liaison officers has been
obstructed, undermining confidence in the implementation process,"
Annan said Monday at the debate. "The belligerents can and must do
better."
</P>
<P>
"According to the Calendar for the implementation of the Cease-
fire Agreement which the Parties had agreed upon, most of the
activities should have been completed by this time, including the
inter-Congolese national dialogue, establishment of new
institutions, exchange of prisoners and disarmament of armed
groups," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
"Deployment of the United Nations peace-keeping mission would
long have begun and the orderly withdrawal of foreign forces from
the Democratic Republic of Congo would be in its final stages of
completion," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov Blasts PACE Talk of Suspending Russian Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday sharply
criticized decision of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
of Europe (PACE) to discuss suspending Moscow's membership in the
organization over developments in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of thinking of sanctions, one should work
constructively," Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a
briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian delegation is going to Strasbourg as an equal
member of this organization to discuss the (Chechen) issue, and is
not in a confrontational mood," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the middle of a campaign against
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched last September following armed
Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a spate of
apartment bombings that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two
other cities.
</P>
<P>
Russian authorities have accused Chechen militants of
masterminding the blasts, citing evidences uncovered in areas
liberated by federal forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Western countries and organizations have exerted mounting
pressure on Moscow to suspend the military actions and seek a
political solution.

The PACE decision to discuss suspending Russian membership has

<P>
He described as "an open challenge to Russia" the PACE refusal

Strasbourg for a PACE session.
</P>
<P>
"This decision showed once again that human rights are viewed
there exclusively from the position of the Western countries'
interests and that Russia's interests are being disregarded,"
Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said that PACE has violated international law, which
prohibits interference in other countries' affairs. He called for"
diplomatic steps in response."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique President Calls for Quick U.N. Deployment in DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering a speech at an open Security Council debate,
President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique said that "The moment has
now come for the United Nations to assume its responsibility with
regard to the Democratic Republic of Congo," formerly known as
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who is current president of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), said, "In this regard, SADC member
states call on the Security Council to adopt concrete measures to
implement expeditiously the Lusaka Agreement," signed in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Time is of essence, because a lost opportunity may never be
recovered."
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka Agreement was brought into being by a mediation
effort led by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on behalf of
SADC.
</P>
<P>
"The cease-fire in the DRC is, like any other cease-fire,
fragile and sensitive, with difficulties inherent to its holding,"
he said. "However, these difficulties should not deter the
necessary actions to prevent its unraveling."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the international community should not wait for a
perfect cease-fire in the DRC to play a meaningful role in this
country's peace process, or sit idle and witness the collapse of
the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement as the 15-nation Security Council is
considering a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to deploy 5,000 peace-keepers to protect 500 unarmed U.N. military
observers, with the United Nations, which would have to pay a
third of the costs, hesitating as long as fighting persists.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the presence of the United Nations on
the ground will deter violations of the cease-fire, and restore
hope to the suffering Congolese people," he said. "The actions of
the United Nations must also be seen as supportive to the quick
confidence building necessary to the parties for a smooth
disengagement, demobilization, disarmament, and more importantly
for a successful internal dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"A durable solution to the conflict in the DRC requires strong
concerted action from the sub-region, the continent and the
international community as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only then the heavy loss of human lives will come to an end;
peace and political stability will be restored in that sisterly
country and in the region," he said. "Only then we will have a
united Democratic Republic of the Congo with common aspirations
shared by all legitimate political force in a peaceful environment,
a nation in peace with itself and its neighbors."

<HEADLINE> UK, US Music Giants Join Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) - Britain's record company EMI and
Time Warner announced Monday they were merging their music
businesses to create the World's largest music company, worth 20
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal follows the recent merger of Time Warner with the
world's biggest Internet company, America Online, to create a 300
billion US dollars media giant.
</P>
<P>
Under the merge plan, EMI and Warner Music will create a 50-50
joint venture including Warner's Madonna, Eric Clapton and Phil
Collins and EMI's Spice Girls, Beatles and Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
In compensation for ceding control, EMI shareholders will
receive a special cash payment of 100 pence per share, costing
Time Warner around 1.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal could still be blocked by competition
concerns. The new group would control 26.5 percent of the US
market, and officials in America and in Europe will be giving
close scrutiny to any merger plans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was reported that Germany's Bertelsmann, seen as
a potential rival bidder for EMI, said early Monday it would not
make a competing offer.

ADDIS ABABA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has responded to
the Organization of African Unity over its clarification of
technical arrangement aimed at ending the 20-month border conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a government spokesman said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin transferred a letter
from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to OAU Executive Chairman,

The technical arrangement is part of the OAU peace plan that

<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The current negotiations
towards a peaceful settlement in Burundi could produce the desired
results sooner than expected, former South African president
Nelson Mandela said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out...but I'm confident a settlement is likely
sooner than we think," he told South African Press Association at
his Houghton residence here.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was encouraged in Arusha, Tanzania on January 16
when he received promise from the Burundian leaders that they
would speed up the negotiations with the opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
"I can't speculate when we will reach an agreement, but I'm
confident that the leaders will find common ground soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also confirmed that he had invited a number of heads of
state from the United States, the Middle East, Europe and Africa
to participate in the peace talks due to be held in Arusha in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
US President Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac and
South African President Thabo Mbeki had pledged to play a personal
role in the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was appointed chief mediator following the death of
former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere last year to end the
seven-year Burundi civil war which has left 200,000 people dead.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Lagos Governor Ahmed Tinubu said
Sunday that his relationship with President Olusegun Obasanjo
remained "cordial", despite the exchange of words between him and
the President,
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Monday quoted Tinubu
as saying in Ile-Ife of Nigeria's southern Osun State that the
face-off was not a personal affair between him and the President.
</P>
<P>
Both the Federal and the Lagos State Government had in recent
weeks traded accusation over security lapses in Lagos which led
to the loss of several lives and property worth millions of
naira.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo even threatened to impose the state of emergency upon
Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and economic hub, if Tinubu failed
again to stop violence.
</P>
<P>
"The President as a person enjoys my distinguished respect and
he will continue to do so, but there is an institution here
because we must differentiate between the person and the
institution," stated the Lagos governor.
</P>
<P>
He also used this opportunity to advise all Yoruba descendants
to live for each other "so that we can be a better people in
Nigeria." Yoruba extreme group is believed to be behind the
violent scenes in the past months.
</P>
<P>
The governor said there was no other race that had "the
greatness, both biological and social background of Yoruba
anywhere in the world."
</P>
<P>
Yoruba is the dominant ethnic group in the country's southwest
region of the country including Lagos, which has frequently
conflicted with other minor immigrant community in Lagos.

 NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) awarded the ''AGRICOLA" medal to Ghanaian
President Jerry Rawlings on Monday for his contribution to
eradication of hunger and malnutrition in Ghana as well as in
Africa, according to a report from the Ghana News Agency.
</P>

distinguished efforts at eradicating hunger and malnutrition
through increased food production in developing countries.

</P>
<P>
President Rawlings received the award from Jacques Diouf,
Director- General of the FAO who flew to Accra Sunday for the
presentation.
</P>
<P>
Diouf, a Senegalese, said Ghana's increased output in food
production " has been a source of inspiration for other
countries. and Ghana is a shining example for others to follow in
terms of food security."
</P>
<P>
Receiving it the President said it is ironical that the world
still suffers hunger and poverty when there is enough knowledge
and resources to combat them.
</P>
<P>

intensify our efforts in this new century at making hunger and
starvation a thing of the past," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Expects Corn Harvest This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Angola is expected to have a
corn harvest in the coming year after the government troops have
gradually got control of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Merchants and Producers of Corn of Angola
(EPUNGO) predicted in a report on Monday that corn production in
the southwestern African country will reach 542,000 tons in the
current agricultural year 2000/2001.
</P>
<P>
Such predictions were rarely seen for many years since the
country fell into civil war 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the previous year, the total grain output of Angola, which
was once considered as an agripower in the region, stood at only
560,000 tons, and the government imported some 505,000 tons of
food to meet the need of its 13 million people, according to
statistics from the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
With the harvest ahead, farmers began to worry about the
transportation problems. Most roads and highways around the rural
areas were heavily mined and destroyed in the bloody civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The 10 Karen gunmen who stormed
a provincial hospital in Thailand earlier on Monday had asked the
Thai government to provide them with two helicopters and send one
person as hostage with them to the Thai-Myanmar border, the local
ITV news network reported.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen also asked for communication facilities in order to
get in touch with their group.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are believed to be from a Karen splinter group known
as "God's Army," a band of about 100 fighters which broke away
from Myanmar's Karen National Union ethnic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Thai government is considering the
gunmen's new demands.
</P>
<P>
A group of about 10 armed men, wearing camouflage and masks and
carrying assault rifles and hand grenades, attacked Rachaburi
Hospital in the western Rachaburi province, some 120 kilometers
west of Bangkok and 48 kilometers east of the border to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people were in the hospital when the incident
occurred at 7:30 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people had escaped from the hospital while about
15 had been released by the gunmen, some in exchange for food, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The armed guerrillas demanded that Thailand send doctors and
nurses to treat their wounded and open the border to allow God's
Army to seek refuge in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the Thai government not support Yangon
on its current crackdown on the ethnic Karen rebels along the Thai-
Myanmar border, and asked the Thai government and the United
Nations to put pressure on the Myanmar government to stop the
fighting and allow the Karen refugees to return home.

Japan's right-wing forces are deliberately tampering with

<HEADLINE> HK's Exchange Fund Grows by 3.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced today that the total assets of the
Exchange Fund increased by 3.2 percent to 1,003 billion HK dollars
(128.6 billion U.S. dollars) as at December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figure is included in the unaudited Exchange Fund Abridged
Balance Sheet, which is released on a monthly basis together with
the Currency Board Account.
</P>
<P>
The audit of the Exchange Fund's annual accounts by the
Director of Audit is in progress, said a spokesman for the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
increased, by 31.2 billion HK dollars (four billion U.S. dollars)
and 3.5 billion HK dollars (449 million U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign currency assets was mainly due to the
issue of additional currency notes, which are backed by U.S.
dollars deposited by the note issuing banks with the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Hong Kong dollar assets was due largely to the
increase in the market value of Hong Kong equities held by the
Exchange Fund, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the Currency Board Account show that the Monetary
Base at the end of December was 234.4 billion HK dollars (30
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 15.72 percent from the end
of November 1999.
</P>
<P>
The rise was mainly attributable to the increases in
Certificates of Indebtedness and the Aggregate Balance, by 26.5
billion HK dollars (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) and 4.7 billion HK
dollars (603 million U.S. dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The former reflects the seasonal demand for cash around
Christmas and New Year as well as increased cash holdings during
the Year 2000 critical period.
</P>
<P>
The backing assets increased by 14.37 percent to 257 billion HK
dollars (33 billion U.S. dollars). The rise was mainly driven by
the corresponding increases in Certificates of Indebtedness and
the Aggregate Balance in the Monetary Base, together with net
income and revaluation gains.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December, the backing ratio stood at 109.64
percent, compared with 110.93 percent at the end of November.

<P>
With the fulfillment of the contract, the public will be able
to enjoy round-the-clock on-line services delivered by 10
government departments and public agencies in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
The services to be delivered under the first phase of the
scheme include payment of government bills, submission of tax
returns, purchase of tax reserve certificates, job searches,
renewal of driving and vehicle licenses, voter registration, as
well as information look-up for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives undertaken by the government to promote e-
commerce include the launching of the Interactive Government
Services Directory, a website offering a directory of telephone
numbers and website addresses for public services in a citizen-
centric manner.
</P>
<P>
Lau said the government, in conjunction with non-government
organizations, would continue to hold seminars and exhibitions on
e-commerce for Hong Kong companies to enable them, especially
small and medium-sized enterprises, to embark on e-commerce to
explore new markets and to strengthen their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The potential market that electronic commerce can tap in
cyberspace is enormous.
</P>
<P>
Based on industry forecast, the total value of global
electronic transactions will rise to over 400 billion U.S. dollars
annually by 2002. The projected growth is 40 times that of the
global gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is particularly significant for Hong Kong's economic
development as it enables small and medium-sized enterprises, the
vast majority of Hong Kong's business, to carry out transactions
across geographical and time barriers.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of e-commerce for the small and medium-sized
enterprises include the development of new markets, reduction in
operating costs, improvement in management of business processes
and provision of better quality customer service.

Hong Kong Post will act as the public Certification Authority (
CA), which is responsible for the issuance, renewal and revocation
of digital certificates, from January 31.
</P>
<P>
To enable the large scale deployment of the PKI technology
which in turn facilitates the development of e-commerce, the
government does not impose any ceiling and mandatory licensing
requirements for the private sector to set up its CAs to meet
different demands from the community.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Electronic Transactions Ordinance by
the Legislative Council on January 5, a clear and supportive legal
framework for the conduct of e-commerce in Hong Kong has been
established.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ordinance, electronic records and digital signatures
are given the same legal status as that of their paper-based
counterparts and a legal backing is established to promote and
facilitate the operation of CAs.
</P>
<P>
The government is also working to develop a common Chinese
language interface that is open and common for users in the
community who prefer to communicate electronically in Chinese so
that e-commerce can reach out to all potential customers.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of multiple coding standards of Chinese
characters in electronic communications, the government is taking
an active part in the ongoing discussions with the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) on the development of the
ISO 10646 standard.
</P>
<P>
The ISO 10646 standard is intended to encompass all written
scripts, including the Chinese characters commonly used in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the government is going to adopt the ISO 10646
standard as the open and common Chinese language interface in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the government signed a contract with
Timbo Star Investment Limited on implementing the first phase of
the Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) scheme, a major initiative
under the "Digital 21" IT Strategy.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is determined to
promote electronic commerce to maintain Hong Kong's status as a
major business center in the digital world of the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a business forum on e-commerce today, Director of
Information Technology Services of the HKSAR Lau Kam-hung said the
government "is fully committed to encouraging the development of e-
commerce to maintain Hong Kong's competitive edge and to drive our
overall economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong already has a world-class telecommunications
infrastructure, with broadband network covering practically all
business buildings and expected to be able to cover 85 percent of
residential buildings this year.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance the telecommunications systems for the
development of e-commerce in Hong Kong, the government will
introduce more competitions and encourage innovations in the
telecommunications market, said Lau.
</P>
<P>
The government will make efforts in building a high quality and
high capacity telecommunications infrastructure in Hong Kong to
provide bandwidth and services at affordable prices to ensure that
electronic transactions can be performed effectively and
efficiently over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Information Technology Services Department is
working with Hong Kong Post on the development of the Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) to provide a secure environment for
electronic transactions in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The PKI covers the use of public key cryptography and digital
certificates to enable us to authenticate the identity of the
parties involved, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of
the messages exchanged, and to make sure that the transactions
cannot be repudiated," Lau said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Industry said today that the country's total income from the
telecom business is expected to reach 300 billion yuan this year,
based on a hefty increase gained last year
</P>
<P>
In 1999 telecom business income jumped 24.6 percent year on
year to 280.3 billion yuan, Minister Wu Jichuan said on the final
day of a national information industry working conference in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wu said this year the ministry will make more efforts to
restructure the industry, enlarge its business volume, increase
exports and continue exploiting and making use of information
resources.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset investment in telecommunications this year is
expected to rise to 200 billion yuan from last year's 151.8
billion yuan, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministry's plan for this year, new switchboards with
a combined capacity of 20 million lines of fixed telephones will

subscribers and an extra 25 million mobile phone subscribers, and
85 percent villages of the country will have telephone services.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that he hopes the sales of the industry's
manufacturing sector will reach 490 billion U.S. dollars while
exports reach 45 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 22 percent

<HEADLINE> Freed French Couple to Finish Honeymoon in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The newly-married French couple,
who were taken hostage by tribesmen last week during their
honeymoon trip in Yemen, decided to complete their honeymoon here
after their release on January 19.
</P>
<P>
Nisan Barakat and Franck Bernard, together with their Yemeni
driver and guide, were abducted from their car by armed tribesman
near Amran town, about 50 kilometers northwest of capital Sanaa,
and were taken to the remote Jawf region in the north on January
17.
</P>
<P>
The government refused to meet any of the demands of the
tribesmen, some of whom were arrested and will be brought to trial,
a Yemeni security official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh stressed the role
of the police in maintaining security and stability and combatting
crimes.
</P>
<P>
On top of the most serious crimes is the abduction of
foreigners, Saleh told the opening session of the annual meeting of
Yemeni security leaders recently.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni leader recently issued decrees to establish a special
police for airports and seaports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen, who control large parts of Yemen, frequently
kidnap foreigner workers or tourists to press for economic or
political concessions, like better infrastructure and release of
jailed tribesmen, from their government. Hostages are mostly
released unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
But in December 1998, Islamic extremists seized 16 westerners in
a kidnapping that ended with three Britons and an Australian being
killed in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
As its tourism industry was increasingly hit by kidnappings,
Yemen set up special courts to try kidnappers and introduce the
death penalty for the offenders.
</P>
<P>
A special security unit was established last November to combat
terrorism.

<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- France will soon resume civil and
military cooperation with Niger following the December election of
civilian President Mamadou Tandja, a spokesman for the French
Foreign Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The transition program has been carried out in conditions
considered satisfactory. We are studying the methods for the
resumption of cooperation with Niger," said French Foreign
Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau.
</P>
<P>
Tandja is due to visit France on Tuesday, during which time he
will meet with French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin as well as National Assembly Speaker Laurent Fabius
and Senate President Christian Poncelet.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to appeal to French enterprises to invest

</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said France will compensate Niger for the
loss it suffered from a cancellation of the Dakar-Paris-Cairo Auto
Rally scheduled for January in the western African country, due to
the threat of terrorist attacks from Algerian Islamic militants.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Further Reform For China's Insurance Sector in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance sector will
further carry out reforms aimed at improving management, services
and contributing more to the social and economic development of
the nation, said Chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission Ma Yongwei today.
</P>
<P>
Ma told reporters in Beijing that China's state-owned
insurance firms will undergo reforms such as training personnel
and job positions according to the requirements of modern
enterprise systems. Supervisors will be sent to these firms to
improve the management of state-owned properties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stock holding insurance firms will have to further improve
their corporate governance structure and diversify their ownership.
State-owned insurance firms might be allowed to have foreign stock
holders or become publicly-listed firms.
</P>
<P>
Ma disclosed that the Commission would grant licenses to more
domestically-owned insurance firms and new brokers. Stock-holding
firms with sound management will be allowed to open more branches,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission will encourage competition in the re-insurance
market by approving new reinsurance firms in China. Ma urged
insurance firms to keep developing new products and improving
their services to satisfy the needs of customers.
</P>
<P>
"Insurance firms should further improve their in-house control
system and put their investment activities under stricter
supervision. We are looking into ways of providing more investment
channels for insurance firms," said Ma.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks have initially
established credit registration networks providing consultation
services in 300-plus cities, according to sources from the People'
s Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The networks, which connect all Chinese and overseas financial
institutions in these cities and provide access to the credit
records of more than one million bank debtors across the country,
enable the financial institutions to inquire about the financial
position and credit information of their debtors, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They are of great help for banks to guard against financial
risks and provide necessary information for policy-makers with the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said the central bank aims to connect all local
networks to form a national one by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the central bank has conducted research on
potential financial risks that may take place as some enterprises
concealed their bad credit records and opened accounts with more
than one commercial bank. It also set up an archive and credit
system for enterprises seeking loans.
</P>
<P>
In late 1997, the central bank focused its attention on
building a nationwide computer network that would provide all
required services.

<HEADLINE> National Plan to Improve Public Science Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The China Association for
Science and Technology (CAST) said today that a national plan will
be implemented to improve the general public's science awareness
by the middle of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yutai, CAST's vice-president, said at an annual working
conference today that the association has submitted to the State
Council a working plan to increase Chinese citizens' level of
scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in the economy since the
late 1970s. However, science has lagged behind economic growth,
which has proved to be a major obstacle in China's further
development.
</P>
<P>
Although the lifestyles and incomes of Chinese have improved,
many are still superstitious. Improvement in public scientific
awareness will have a great impact on China's social stability and
development, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese should also foster a scientific world outlook in
dealing with various problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that CAST will promote the spreading of a
scientific spirit among the Chinese populace and train more
professionals in the 21st century.

handed over 48 Ugandan children abducted by rebels of Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) to the United Nations Children's Fund

<HEADLINE> 67 Politicians Banned by South Korea NGOs from Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An alliance of over 460 Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in South Korean Monday announced
a list of 67 people it opposes who are running in the
parliamentary election scheduled for April 13.
</P>
<P>
The list, which was drawn up by the Citizen's Solidarity for
the 2000 General Elections, names 16 people from the ruling
Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), 16 from the ruling coalition
partner United Liberal Democrats (ULD), 30 from opposition Grand
National Party (GNP) and five independents.
</P>
<P>
The 67 incumbent legislators, leading political figures and
former lawmakers on the list, include former Prime Minister Kim
Jong-pil, National Assembly (Parliament) Speaker Park jyun-kyu,
Vice National Assembly Speaker Kim Bong-ho, Kwon Roh-jap, one of
closest aids to South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Chung Mong-
joon, chairman of the South Korean Football Association.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Dae-jung, who is also the MDP president, said the
list is the outcome of the loss of public trust for politicians,
and the increasing public support for non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Although shocked by the size of the list, both the MDP and the
GNP said they will check the list for references in their
nomination for candidates, while the ULD fiercely protested
against the inclusion of its founder and honorary chairman Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The ULD Secretary General Kim Hyun-uk blasted the list as "
dangerous and a revolutionary act to destroy law and order in a
law-governing country."
</P>
<P>
"The ULD believes (the list) is illegal and calls for an
immediate probe into this clear-cut violation," said the secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people on the list have vowed to take legal action
against the non-governmental alliance and they have asked for an
explanation on the criteria for the list.
</P>
<P>
The alliance said it named the 67 people based on their
involvement in corruption scandals and past military coups, as
well as their violations of election law or human rights.
</P>
<P>
It also said it will join forces with more social
organizations to press the government to repeal Clause 87 of the
Election Law, which bans civic bodies from engaging in any
political activities.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by increasing public support, the non-governmental
alliance also proclaimed that political parties be responsible if
they nominate those named 67 people as their candidates for the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will enter into campaigns against them if the outcome turns
out to shun demand of the list," a spokesman for the alliance said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Syria will sign
an agreement in Damascus on Tuesday to prevent double taxation on
income and capital.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was aimed at boosting bilateral economic,
commercial and financial cooperation, maintaining bilateral trade
balance, as well as facilitating the establishment of joint
ventures, said UAE Minister of State for Financial and Industrial
Affairs Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- French Telecom and the Jordanian telecommunications
company on Sunday signed a 508 million U.S. dollars worth deal
under which French Telecom will take over 35.2 percent of the
stakes of its Jordanian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
French Telecom planned to invest more than 400 million dollars
in the next few years to upgrade and renovate the Jordanian
company.
</P>
<P>
French Telecom is currently regarded as the largest
telecommunications company working in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Iraq and Jordan have agreed to renew their annual oil
agreement under which Iraq will supply Jordan with some 4.8 million
tons of crude oil and oil derivatives this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to increase the volume of bilateral
trade from 200 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to 300 million dollars
this year.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) is considering
extending the period of repayment of loans due for the bank, said
bank sources.
</P>
<P>
The idea is among the projects to be discussed by the bank's
board of executive directors at a session which will tackle the
financing of a number of development projects and offering some
donations.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based bank groups 53 Islamic member states and 653
Islamic nationals in the non-member countries. The bank,
established
25 years ago, has provided its members with loans totalling 22
billion U.S. dollars until the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Rules out Dialogue with Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Monday ruled out the possibility of opening dialogue
with the U.S., but he welcomed American companies to do business in
Iran to improve trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has been advocating talks with all countries on the basis
of mutual respect and equal footing, Kharrazi said, "but the
conditions between Iran and the U.S. are not the same, the issue of
holding bilateral talks could not be considered."
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a seminar on the Persian Gulf, Kharrazi
underlined that if state-to-state relations are not based on mutual
respect and equality, there will be no reason for talks.
</P>
<P>
Experts from 22 countries attended the two-day seminar
entitled "Persian Gulf toward the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recently-held Iran-U.S. football match in
Pasadena, California, he said that in a football match the two
sides enjoy an equal status and no one is superior to the other,
but unfortunately in the scene of politics it is not the case.
</P>
<P>
Iranian national football team drew 1-1 with the U.S. national
team in a friendly match last week. The match, the first of its
kind since the 1979 Islamic revolution, was seen by public opinions
as a "football diplomacy" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic ties in 1980 after the U.S.
embassy in Tehran was occupied by Iranian students in the heyday of
the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
After Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power
in 1997, Tehran and Washington lowed down their hostile tune
against each other and some U.S. officials have called for
unconditional talks between the two sides for normal ties.
</P>
<P>
If equality prevailed in the scene of politics, we would have
been ready for negotiations (with the U.S.), Kharrazi said,
adding "If the U.S. were sincere and sought cooperation and
friendship, we would have reached more understanding."
</P>
<P>
He denied earlier reports that Iran welcomes the U.S. to open a
consulate in the Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, saying that Iran
has no intention to talk about the opening of a U.S. consulate in
any part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Kish free trade zone Mohammdreza Yazdanpanah
recently said that he welcomes the idea if the U.S. is willing to
open its consulate on the island and he will forward the issue to
the Foreign Ministry with "positive attitude."
</P>
<P>
However, he said in an interview with a local daily that only
the Foreign Ministry is in the position to decide whether to allow
the U.S. to open its consulate on the island.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also welcomed U.S. companies to do business in Iran,
but voiced Iran's opposition to the U.S. military presence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in the region, which is a sign of
military rivalry, is more detrimental to regional peace and
security than the security problems incurred from the two
devastating wars in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The region will not enjoy sustainable security without
commitments by regional countries to safeguarding it, said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Striking Teachers Stage Street Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Several thousand Israeli
teachers held a mass demonstration in front of Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's office in Jerusalem Monday morning as their strike for
salary hike entered its ninth day.
</P>
<P>
They were asking for Barak's intervention in the wage
negotiations between the Teachers Union and the Finance Ministry,
according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
The teachers' strike has affected more than a million students
and 100,000 teachers in kindergartens, elementary schools and most
junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
These teachers are demanding 15 percent compensation for erosion
of their salaries since 1994, but the Treasury has stuck to its
plan for a 1.2 percent increase plus a one-time NIS 900 (about 225
U.S.dollars) payment.
</P>
<P>
Barak tried to get involved in the disputes last Wednesday and
invited Education Minister Yossi Sarid and Finance Minister Avraham
Shohat to a trilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Shohat declined to attend, saying that meeting the teachers'
demand will cost billions and lead to a collapse in the nation's
wage system.
</P>
<P>
Union head Avraham Ben-Shabbat and Finance Ministry wage
director Yuval Rachlevsky continued talks on Monday to find ways to
end the strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, university students also held protests at
intersections on the main way in Jerusalem Monday morning,
demanding reduction of tuition fee.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) is set on Monday to hear a motion of
non-confidence sponsored by the opposition Likud bloc in Barak over
the teachers' strike and his "failure to meet his election promises
to university students."

<HEADLINE> India Bans Industrial Discharges Into Major River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of India
banned on Monday discharges of untreated industrial effluent into
the Yamuna River, which flows through the northern part of the
country and plays a major role in water supply for the capital New
Delhi and its neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
"We direct every industry in Delhi not to discharge their
effluents either into the river or into drains leading to the
river which have the effect of polluting the river," the Press
Trust of India (PTI) quoted a court order as saying.
</P>
<P>
The order also prohibits discharges of "contaminated effluent"
into the river in the state of Haryana neighboring Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Describing the order as a "significant" one, the PTI said it
would affect thousands of local industries in Delhi and Haryana,
especially some breweries.
</P>
<P>
A report filed by the Central Pollution Control Board of India
indicated that water in the Yamuna River was not fit for drinking
as it contained much more pollutant than required by the national
standard for drinking water quality.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Supreme Court deemed that the situation was "
certainly alarming" and the Yamuna River appeared to "have been
ruined."
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately public health has to be given top priority even at
the cost of a few jobs," said the court.

<HEADLINE> IOR-ARC Meeting Highly Successful: Bangladeshi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister
Abdus Samad Azad Monday described the extraordinary Ministerial
Meeting of the Indian Ocean Rim Association of Regional
Cooperation (IOR-ARC), which has just ended in Muscat, Oman as "
highly successful."
</P>
<P>
It is expected to pave the way for greater interaction among
the member states for mutual benefit in a variety of fields, said
Azad.
</P>
<P>
Five new members, including Bangladesh, were formally admitted
to the regional body formed in March 1997. The other new entrants
are Iran, Seychelles, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Azad said the IOR-ARC is basically an economic group whose main
objectives are to promote sustained growth and balanced
development of the region, create common ground for regional
economic cooperation and facilitate trade and investment in the
member states through lowering trade barriers and promoting close
interaction among the business communities and academic groups in
the member states.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Bangladesh participated in the meeting
for the first time, it had made active and effective contribution
to the conference.

<HEADLINE> 25 Pct of Philippine Villages Have No Power: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A staggering 25 percent of the
Philippines' villages still live in the "dark ages" due to the non-
availability of power services in these places, Philippine Speaker
Manny Villar said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Villar vowed to push the passage of the Omnibus Power Bill,
currently being tackled in the House of Representatives, that will
help provide electric services in even the remotest regions in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Electrification is a vital component of development as this is
one of the necessary infrastructure requirements that will help
create jobs and growth opportunities for Filipinos," he said.
</P>
<P>
Villar said one of the features of the Omnibus Power Bill is
that it will require new players to put up facilities even in
rural areas as a pre-requisite to awarding them concessions to
operate in more profitable locations.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to lower the electric bill of the ordinary
Filipino by heightening competition with the entry of new players.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes the privatization of the state-owned National
Power Corporation which has been suffering billions of pesos in
yearly losses, Villar said.
</P>
<P>
Villar vowed to support the government's full electrification
program for the country, adding that the high cost of energizing
unviable areas and the inadequacy of government financing for
rural infrastructure continues to impede the program.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to ensuring that the benefits of electric
services will reach down to even the remotest regions of our
country as can be seen by our efforts to pass the Omnibus Power
Bill," Villar said.

<HEADLINE> India to Impose 15 Pct Duty on Milk Powder Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government said
Monday it has successfully concluded a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ)
deal with the United States, the European Union and Australia on
imposing a customs duty of 15 percent on imports of skimmed and
whole milk powder up to 10,000 tons from these countries.
</P>
<P>
The deal also enables India to impose a duty of 60 percent on
imports above 10,000 tons, said S.K. Sinha, secretary of the
Department of Dairying and Animal Husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Describing the deal as the first TRQ deal ever reached by India
since its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Sinha
said the new duty would come into effect only in a few months.
</P>
<P>
Skimmed milk powder is currently freely importable at nil
import duty for manufacturing various value-added milk products in
India.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the new duty, Sinha said, India would have to
provide greater market access on other commodities by cutting
their import duties.
</P>
<P>
TRQ is a trade policy under the WTO that is applied to help a
country to protect its domestically-produced goods from cheap
imports.

<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo left his country's capital Abuja for New Delhi early
Monday morning on a five- day state visit to India.
</P>
<P>
The president's Special Assistant on Media and Publicity Doyin
Okupe said at the weekend that the visit would be an opportunity
for Nigeria to open discussions on ways of establishing greater
cooperation with India, The Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the discussions would center on vital areas of
national development like agriculture, small and medium scale
industries, and machine tools production.
</P>
<P>
Okupe noted that India has the highest number of viable small
scale businesses in the world while it has been able to maximize
its agricultural potential to feed its huge population.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this area that Nigeria intends to explore
opportunities for collaboration," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also envisaged to stimulate an influx of
prospective investors from India, apart from strengthening the
Indo-Nigerian Joint Commission and promoting useful cooperation
between the vibrant private sectors of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Indian Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria Debraj Pradhan told
local reporters that President Obasanjo would be the guest of
honour at India's Republic Day celebrations on January 26.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Obasanjo "has led the Nigerian people in their
struggles for the restoration of democracy, and has thus become a
symbol of hope for the Nigerian people."
</P>
<P>
According to him, India has attached great importance to its
relations with Nigeria, which is India's second largest trading
partner in Africa after South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Mining, Energy Sectors Identified as Economic Pillar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The mining and energy
sectors will become Tanzania's leading foreign exchange earners
and contribute to up to 40 percent of the country's economy within
the next two decades, the African newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a five-year development plan issued recently by
the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC), the two sectors have been
identified as the core catalyst sectors to enable Tanzania to
achieve higher economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the mining sector alone could earn
Tanzania some 300 million U.S. dollars a year, equivalent to 40
percent of the government current annual expenditure.
</P>
<P>
However, to achieve this goal, the government must take efforts
to create an attractive investment environment through lowering
taxes, building infrastructure and streamlining legal requirement
for investors, TIC said.
</P>
<P>
Mineral potentials cited include precious stones, gems, nickel,
cooper, cobalt, iron and coal.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, the mining sector grew by 27.4 percent
in 1998 as compared to 17.1 percent in 1997, accounting for two
percent and 1.7 percent of GDP respectively.
</P>
<P>
As for the energy sector, TIC highlights its huge gas reserves
which are already the subject of substantial development plan.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors expected to become major contributors to
Tanzania's GDP in the next two decades are tourism, manufacturing,
transport, communication, banking and finance, the center added.

<HEADLINE> Pre-Historic Culture Found in South China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The well-known anthropologist Han Kangxin confirmed after
making investigations on the spot that this was the first instance
on record of the burial of dismembered bodies, and the reason is
currently a mystery.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered at Dingshi Mountain are the remains of the
dwellings for primitive men living there 5,000 years to 10,000
years ago. The well-arranged post holes discovered in the
dwellings certify them as dwelling structure for pre-historic
human beings living in the region.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the array and formations of the post holes,
specialists conclude that the architecture of that period must
have been rectangular.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 pieces of pottery have also been found at the site,
and only four pieces of pottery from the same period have been
found previously in Guangxi, and these four were all found in
caves.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 1,000 pieces of pre-historic tools,
including stone implements, bone objects, clam articles, and the
remains of aquatic products and other animals.
</P>
<P>
Research fellow Jiang Tingyu, curator of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Regional Museum, told reporters that the excavations at
Dingshi Mountain made it possible to link up the ruins of human
beings living in the Old Stone Age previously found in Liuzhou and
Guilin, both in Guangxi, and the early New Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
"The excavation has provided researchers with valuable
materials to study the origin of the ancient Zhuang ethnic people
living in Guangxi, and the ways of subsistence and life of pre-
historic people living in south China," said the curator.
</P>
<P>
An archeologist with the Chinese University of Hong Kong
believes that the Dingshi Mountain Culture, as it is known, has
filled in the blank in research on pre-historic humans in the
Pearl River valley, and will change the emphasis of research on
pre-historic archeology that was formerly given to the Yellow and
Yangtze river valleys.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A culture that has lain hidden
in the valley of the Pearl River Delta for 5,000 years is being
brought to light out of the mysterious past and put onto the world
stage.
</P>
<P>
These are the ruins at Dingshi Mountain in Yongning County of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign archeologists are amazed at the unique
burial method, the special architecture, intact pottery, and other
cultural artifacts found at the ruins as the third phase of
excavations at the pre-historic site came to an end today.
</P>
<P>
Fu Jianguo, an associate research fellow of the Archeology
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said, " These
ruins demonstrate an ancient way of living that is entirely
different from the life of other ancient human beings whose
remains have been found in the Yellow River valley and in the
Yangtze River valley, and these are of irreplaceable significance
for understanding the formation of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
The Dingshi Mountain ruins, covering an area of 5,000 sq m, are
believed to be those of human beings living during the early New
Stone Age, some 5,000 years ago. The site has been under
excavation since April 1997, and was listed as one of the ten
major archeological finds that year. Three stages of excavation
have by now been carried out at the site.
</P>
<P>
As a legacy of the early New Stone Age, the Dingshi Mountain
ruins are at a higher elevation along the riverside than those of
previous similar archeological finds, which are mostly in cave
dwellings. Fu said this site provides new information for
researchers to better understand the way of life and activity of
mankind during the early New Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, 331 ancient tombs have been found
in the 950 sq m excavated section of the ruins. Judging from
previous finds at other ruins from the same period, it is very
rare to find so many tombs at a New Stone Age ruin.
</P>
<P>
Inside the tombs, the dismembered bodies were buried in a style
quite different from the bent-limbs style commonly seen in tombs
belonging to the New Stone Age found elsewhere in Guangxi. One-
third of the remains of more than 400 ancient human beings
excavated at the ruins were buried with their bodies dismembered.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
said today its brisk business last year had resulted in sharp
rises in both deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the bank's deposits increased by 226.7 billion yuan,
with the outstanding amount of deposits exceeding 1.6 trillion
yuan. Loans increased 174.4 billion yuan, including 21 billion
yuan extended for poverty-relief projects.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Li Dianjun of the bank said that most of the

record as well as a selective clientele, which ensured a much
higher interest recovery rate than the previous year.

<P>
Li said that the bank's card business also experienced rapid
development in 1999 with 11 million cards being issued.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila Refocuses Investment Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
keen to refocus its approaches and strategies on how to make the
country as a stable haven for foreign investments in the region,
Trade and Industry Secretary Mar Roxas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said in a press release that the government has already
set its plans "to use the laser targeted approach rather than the
broad-based approach of enticing investors to come to the
Philippines."
</P>
<P>
He noted that his department will initiate a program wherein
the government will meet big investors already in the Philippines
to discuss ways of maximizing their investments or expand their
operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed allegations that the government is
renewing its stance on attracting more investments by talking to
those who are already in the country rather than invite those who
are not here yet.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said the word-of-mouth approach would be the strongest
mechanism to attract investors into the country.
</P>
<P>
He explained that foreign investors who have good experiences
in terms of doing business here are the same people who will tell
others as to what type of business environment is there in the
Philippines that other countries in the region do not have.
</P>
<P>
Roxas admitted that foreign investment inflows into the country
did poorly last year, amounting only to 290 billion pesos (7.25
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But he expressed confidence that the government will be able to
increase the figure to between 300 to 350 billion pesos (7.5 to 8.
75 billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said he will initiate moves to talk with other concerned
agencies like the Philippine Economic Zone Authority and the Board
of Investments to find out the problems and introduce solutions.

Industry Jean Saolona and Minister for Transport and
Communications Odatta Etoa, was in the country exploring business
opportunities.

<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Monday that he knew nothing about the allegation that
French oil group Elf-Aquitaine financed the election campaign of
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During a dinner with the press in Brussels, Vedrine said he
does not have any information on this subject, Agence France-

"This is a German affair of financing political party, and
Helmut was a great chancellor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German television ARD and French television France 2 quoted
an unnamed acquaintance of former French President Francois
Mitterrand as saying that Mitterrand wanted to help his friend
Kohl win the election and ordered Elf to pay part of his campaign
costs.
</P>
<P>
The report said Elf paid Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
43.6 million euros (about 43.6 million U.S. dollars) in commission
when it bought the Leuna Oil and Chemical Refinery company in
former East Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The CDU used 15.4 million euros of the commission in its 1994
election campaign, said the report.

The new regulations are meant to prepare China for imminent
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), Ma said.

The company also has access to trust accounts for other
financial institutions, and is allowed to sell stock and creditor

<HEADLINE> Farmers Enter Beijing to Sell Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- To help farmers sell their
agricultural and sideline products, the government of the city of
Changchun has launched a massive exhibition campaign in the
national capital to promote the sales of local farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Changchun is the capital of northeast China's Jilin Province,
and has long been known as a major agricultural production base.
About 20 of local manufacturing enterprises dealing in
agricultural and sideline products participated in the exhibition
held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Feng, deputy director of the Committee of Rural Economy of
Changchun City, said that the local government should be a bridge
between farmers and the market, and help farmers learn how to face
the challenges of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that as China needs to adjust its crop mix before
entering the World Trade Organization (WTO), both farmers and
local governments must be aware of the challenges and heavy
pressure from market forces.
</P>
<P>
The farmers need to know what the market demands, so as to
decide what to plant, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that Chinese farmers can not increase their
income until they have learned to dance to the tempo of the market
economy.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat, Clinton Summit Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua)-- The summit meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton this weekend will probably not take
place, said the Prime Minister's Office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
All three leaders will attend the World Economic Forum in the
Swiss resort of Davos this weekend, but the summit meeting might be
rendered impossible due to schedule problem, said the office.
</P>
<P>
The summit had never been definitely set, and Barak might only
arrive at Davos late Saturday evening after Clinton has left, the
office added.
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes to the proposal to convene such a three-way
summit in Davos, due to concerns that it will be pressured into
softening its positions, and about the possible failure of such a
summit due to the wide gaps between the parties' respective
positions, such as on the framework for the final-status agreement,
foreign diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September,
Israel and the Palestinians have to reach a framework agreement on
final-status talks on February 13 and a final peace treaty by
September.
</P>
<P>
But due to slow progress made in the negotiations, it is
impossible for the two sides to work out such a framework agreement
by the February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Planning and International Cooperation Minister
of the Palestinian National Authority, said Sunday that he expected
the three-way summit to be held on Saturday in Davos, and that the
three leaders would focus on reaching a framework agreement as
close as possible to the original February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly proposed to Arafat during their third secret
meeting inside Israel last Monday to postpone by two months for the
two sides to work out the framework agreement.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Australia Move to Improve Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Australia agreed
on Monday to improve their bilateral relationship which has
fallen to an all-time low last year due to the East Timor crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I have a very good meeting with President Wahid and Foreign
Minister Alwi Shihab. We want now to look for the future ... and
we are optimistic that a wider relationship is moving ahead,"
Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that President Abdurrahman Wahid also would visit
his country but there was not a schedule yet.
</P>
<P>
Australia also supports Indonesia's economic process and the
government of Australia has decided to increase its aid for
Indonesia by 31 percent to boost Indonesia's economic recovery
process, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia will also provide assistance particularly for
some of the provinces (in Indonesia) where violence is taking
place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said that
Indonesia would not rush in improving relations with Australia.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Australia changes its attitude, we are ready to
normalize (the ties). But we want that Australia will not repeat
what it did in the past, that is the condition we have proposed to
Australia," Shihab told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, Shihab declined to say when the normalization will
take place.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, of course the normalization (of diplomatic ties between
the two countries) will take a time, I don't think that it (the
relations) will be normal within a short time," Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries strained after Australia led a
multinational force into East Timor in September last year to stop
the violence in the wake of East Timor's vote for independence,
prompting Indonesia to break off a four-year security pact with
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Downer arrived here on Sunday for a two-day visit and
become the first top Australian officials to visit Indonesia after
the deterioration of the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Downer met with President Wahid, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab
Monday morning. He is expected to meet House Speaker Akbar
Tandjung Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Likely to Be Tough on Hospital Attackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is likely
to take tough actions against the armed men who stormed a hospital
in the western Thai province of Rachaburi, Pasong Sonsiri, the
prime minister's national security adviser, told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
A group of some 10 gunmen believed to be from an ethnic Karen
guerrilla splinter group from Myanmar stormed the hospital earlier
Monday and took 500-600 people as hostages.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10 people were freed by the gunmen and another 40
people hiding inside managed to escape from the hospital, which is
located in Rachaburi town, some 120 kilometers west of Bangkok and
48 kilometers east of the border with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Pasong said after meeting with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
that he had suggested the prime minister take tougher actions
against the armed men.
</P>
<P>
Pasong strongly condemned the hospital incident as an "
international terrorist action," saying it is against both Thai
and international laws and violates the sovereignty of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
A national security meeting on the hospital siege is expected
to be held later Monday at the Government House. Interior Minister
Sanan Kachornprasart will be back to Bangkok from the spot to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, wearing camouflage and black ski masks and armed
with assault rifles and hand grenades, were believed to seize a
van on the road and then drove to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
They planted bombs near the entrance to the hospital and fired
guns in the air.
</P>
<P>
Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Surayut Chulanont has agreed to an
initial demand by the gunmen for the army to stop shelling the
Karen rebels who fled to the Thai soil following fighting between
the Myanmar government troops and the ethnic rebels.
</P>
<P>
Thailand tightened border surveillance after the Myanmar
government troops began a drive against the ethnic Karen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The armed guerrillas also demanded that the Thai government not
support Rangoon on its current crack-down on the ethnic Karen
rebels along the Thai-Myanmar border and asked the Thai government
and the United Nations to put pressure on the Myanmar government
to stop the fighting and allow the Karen refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
They had also demanded Thailand send doctors and nurses to
treat their casualties and open the border to allow their fighters
to seek refuge in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had demanded the release of all women and children
from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen are believed to be from a Karen splinter group known
as "God's Army," a band of about 100 fighters which broke away
from Myanmar's Karen National Union ethnic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that God's Army has been providing refuge for
the five students who staged the October embassy attack.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Attracts More Investment Commitment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore attracted a total
of 9.6 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.7 billion U.S. dollars)
investment commitment in manufacturing and services sectors,
Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) announced Monday in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 8.0 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars) were manufacturing fixed asset investments (FAI), 0.
2 billion Singapore dollars (about 0.1 billion U.S. dollars) more
than the amount of FAI attained in 1998, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The services total business spending (TBS), which attracted the
remaining 1.6 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.0 billion U.S.
dollars), was similar to 1998's and exceeded the 1.5 billion (
about 0.9 billion U.S. dollars) target.
</P>
<P>
The higher numbers reflected the strength of Singapore's
economic recovery, the EDB press release said.
</P>
<P>
When fully realized, these investments would generate a
combined value-added of 7.7 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.6
billion U.S. dollars) and create about 20,900 jobs, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster was the major contributor of 1999 FAI
commitments at 3.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 2 billion U.S.
dollars), representing 42 percent of total manufacturing
commitments.
</P>
<P>
Investments from the United States, at about 3.6 billion
Singapore dollars (about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars), made up of 45
percent of manufacturing FAI, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The other three major FAI contributors were Singapore itself,
22 percent, Japan 15 percent, and Europe, 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the services sector, communications and media, and
headquarters clusters were the main contributors of the 1999 TBS,
of which the United States was the largest source of investments,
comprising 45 percent of the TBS, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Arrests 37,000 Drug Pushers in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
arrested 37,000 drug pushers in 1999 as it intensified the fight
against drug trafficking and drug use, a ranking official said
Monday in a radio program.
</P>
<P>
Jewel Canson, head of the National Drug Enforcement, Prevention
and Coordinating Center also said the government seized 902 kilos
of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) during the past year.
</P>
<P>
Canson said these numbers are nearly doubled from the arrests
made and volume of drugs seized in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he said, the government organized local anti-drug
abuse councils in 37,900 of 42,000 villages nationwide in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
The local anti-drug councils would serve as the focal points
where local government officials, police, and non-government
organizations would coordinate in the fight against drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Canson also noted that residents and local officials are now
taking the initiatives to report incidents of drug use and
peddling in their respective neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
"we can now highlight the fact that the community is actively
involved in the fight against drugs," Canson said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Philippine President Joseph Estrada ordered
the law enforcement community to intensify their anti-drug
campaign while asking the citizens to continue giving their full
cooperation to the government.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Economy Looks Promising in 2000: EDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The general outlook for the
Singapore economy in 2000 is promising, provided that cost
increases are kept in check and new capabilities continue to be
built for the Knowledge-based economy, the Economic Development
Board (EDB) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This optimism is backed by a stable, buoyant outlook in the
developed economies, with the continued, albeit slower, expansion
of the U.S. economy and the pickup in Japan," the EDB said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's V-shaped economic recovery has been largely led by
manufacturing, driven by strong performance in the electronics and
chemicals sectors, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the electronics sector will be driven by trends
such as the semiconductor upswing, which would in turn bring more
equipment manufacturers to the engineering sector, the EDB press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said that more engineering centers of competence will
be set up as Singapore boosts its capabilities in infrastructure,
research and innovation.
</P>
<P>
It said that the chemicals sector will see new opportunities
for expansion as the regional economies recover and the life
sciences cluster also anticipates strong growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
As for the services, e-business will present enormous
opportunities in the information, communications and media cluster,
as the logistics sector is re-oriented towards a more knowledge-
intensive model, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> Swisscom to Massively Cut Fixed Telephone Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Swisscom will reduce fixed-
network charges by up to 70 percent from March 1, announced
Switzerland's leading telecommunications company Monday.
</P>
<P>
Swisscom will also simplify its charge structure for
international calls. Consequently, a call to bordering countries
and to North America will cost just 0.10 Swiss franc (about 0.0625
U.S. dollar) per minute at the weekend, up to 70 percent less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
To attract customers, Swisscom will launch "Weekend Call" on
March 1: one-hour call time for one Swiss franc (about 0.625
dollar) at weekends.
</P>
<P>
With "Weekend Call", any call in Switzerland will cost a
maximum of just one Swiss franc per hour. This means that
customers can make calls for up to an hour on the fixed network
and pay a maximum of one Swiss franc regardless of whether the
call is local or long-distance or whether it's at the off-peak or
night-time rate. "Weekend Call" means that 50 minutes of each hour
are "free" for long-distance calls.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Intervene in Market Over Interest Rate Jitters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Korea will intervene
in the financial market if interest rate jitters arise after
February 8 this year when investors are allowed to redeem up to 95
percent of Daewoo bonds.
</P>
<P>
The decision to intervene the market was made at a meeting of
the Finance and Economy, Bank of Korea and the Financial
Supervisory Commission Monday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government will also help secure cash
liquidity of some 36 trillion won (about 32 billion U.S. dollars)
to cope with a possible rush in redemption influencing investment-
trust companies following February 8, said a spokesman of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
If redemption calls converge on investment-trust companies,
banks will be first required to take over state, public and other
bonds held by investment and trust companies.
</P>
<P>
Relying on the situation thereafter, the central bank will
supply liquidity support to investment-trust companies through a
repurchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
The proposed liquidity of 36 trillion won in cash includes 11
trillion won (about 9.8 billion dollars) from the government and
25 trillion won (about 22.2 billion dollars) in cash from the
investment-trust companies.
</P>
<P>
After six months of negotiations, the South Korean government
and leading foreign creditor banks of Daewoo Group have agreed on
a 40-percent recovery ratio for Daewoo's foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The government will pay foreign banks 1.94 billion U.S. dollars
in cash, which is 40 percent of the 4.84 billion U.S. dollars
which 200 creditors extended to Daewoo without collateral while
foreign lenders will shoulder the remaining 60 percent, or 2.90
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> International Antidrug Conferences Start in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A series of U.N.-led antidrug
conferences opened here Monday, with representatives from some 20
Asia-Pacific countries participating to discuss ways to stem the
flow of illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, in a speech read at the
meeting, urged the governments in Asia to join hands to combat
drug trafficking and drug abuse which he said threaten human
dignity and human lives.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the drug problem, it is necessary for countries to
join hands in stopping illicit drug transactions, and in promoting
education to prevent the public from using drugs," Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day anti-drug conferences are sponsored by the
Japanese government, the U.N. International Drug Control Program (
UNDCP), and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, UNDCP Secretary General Pino Arlacchi
said about 40 percent of stimulant drugs in the world are consumed
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tokyo gathering will provide the international
community with the opportunity to share information on methods of
fighting illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Authorities believe that most stimulant drugs entering
the country come from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The amount of stimulant drugs confiscated last year in Japan
exceeded one ton for the first time, an increase of some 350
kilograms from the previous record in 1996, according to Japan's
National Police Agency.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Hit by Cold Front, Losses Total 5.5 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A cold front that has been
sweeping southwest China's Yunnan Province since late last month
has caused direct economic losses totaling 5.5 billion yuan (662
million U.S. dollars), the heaviest since 1974.
</P>
<P>
The cold front from Siberia drove the mercury down to minus 3.5
degrees centigrade, a record low for Yunnan, as 90 percent of the
provincial counties suffered their lowest temperatures in a decade,
with frost affecting 820,000 hectares of crops, said Gao Zuxing,
director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The sugar in Yunnan, one of the country's major sugarcane-
growing areas, is expected to drop by 100,000 tons this year as a
result of the frost.
</P>
<P>
It is also anticipated that one-third of province's coffee-
growing area will be without a harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices for flowers and vegetables have soared in Kunming, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
The local government has allocated 30 million yuan (3.6 million
U.S. dollars) to help disaster-stricken areas resume production,
as temperatures have risen over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Located in the subtropical zone, Yunnan usually has a warm and
favorable climate all year around, and cold fronts from Siberia
are normally blocked by the province's northern mountains.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Sector Reports 139.3 Billion Yuan in Premiums in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance sector
reported a premium income of 139.3 billion yuan in 1999, up 10
percent from 1998, the head of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Among these premiums, 52.1 billion yuan was from property
insurance, up nearly three percent from 1998, and 87.2 billion
yuan from life and health insurance, up 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Insurers paid out 28 billion yuan in liabilities on property
policies and 23 billion yuan for life and health policies.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the CIRC, attributed the stable growth
of the insurance sector to the regulators' efforts to improve
market order.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 19 foreign and domestic insurance firms and brokers
received sanctions from the CIRC, and illegal brokerages were shut
down. At the same time, 58,000 part-time agents were re-registered
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The legal framework for insurance regulation was further
improved in 1999. The CIRC issued new regulations on the
administration of insurance firms, a regulatory index on solvency
capacity, and guidelines for in-house control by insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
After consecutive interest-rate cuts by the central bank, the
CIRC stopped sales of life insurance policies with high interest
kick-backs, and promoted the development of new products with
fewer interest-rate risks.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC also gave approval to insurance firms to buy bonds of
selected state-owned enterprises and to invest in securities
investment funds, thus opening new investment channels for
insurance companies.

The 160 deaths in the first week this year were also more than
double the 10-year average of 60 for the same week.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were the elderly and people suffering from
chronic diseases, whose immune systems were already weakened. Their
pneumonia symptoms were often the results of a common complication
of flu, which has reached epidemic levels in Israel in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The flu laboratory at the Central Laboratory for Viruses has
found that the current flu viruses are being spread at a rate five
times higher than the norm and this year's flu conditions in Israel
are extreme and unprecedented.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Resume Fish Export to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Lake Victoria fish
processors will resume fish export to the European Union (EU) next
week, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has been losing 78.1 million Tanzanian shillings
(97,600 U.S. dollars) daily since the EU imposed the ban last
March citing rampant poison fishing.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of the Lake Victoria Fish Processors
Association Harko Bhagat as saying that they expect to resume
exporting fresh and frozen fish fillets to the EU towards the end
of next week.
</P>
<P>
Fish processors expect to export between 250 to 400 tons of
fresh Nile Perch fillets to the EU market a week, said the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said the industry was full of optimism that the EU would
speed up the documentation process and complete the work before
the end of the month to ensure fish processors start exporting to
the EU.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of people on the Tanzanian side of Lake Victoria,
the resumption of the fish exports to the single largest market
comes as a relief from months of economic hardship stemming from
the ban, the Guardian said.
</P>
<P>
The EU lifted the ban last month after strong recommendations
from its standing veterinary committee (SVC).
</P>
<P>
But as Tanzanian fishermen bask in the promising prospects of
resumed exports to the EU, Kenya and Uganda fish processors still
face the embargo as the EU standing veterinary committee has not
been convinced on the safety of fish catch from the two countries
both sharing Africa's largest lake with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The lake is one of East Africa's most important shared
resource, supporting 25 million people in the area with a gross
domestic product of about 3.5 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- While Shimon Peres is still the most likely candidate for
Israel's presidency, support is growing for former Supreme Court
president Meir Shamgar to replace Ezer Weizman, should the
incumbent president announce his resignation due to the ongoing
investigation of his alleged financial improprieties.
</P>
<P>
Most politicians believe that Shamgar would be an ideal
compromise candidate, who would rally the support of the left and
the right, while also being acceptable to new immigrants and the
religious community.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An overwhelming majority of Knesset (Parliament) members from
across the political spectrum is opposed to starting the process of
impeachment against President Ezer Weizman, according to a Ha'aretz
poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law on the President, a minimum of 20 MKs
are necessary to submit a complaint to the Knesset House Committee
against the President, at which point the committee must deliberate
the merits of the demand for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
For the impeachment request to be brought to the Knesset plenum
for approval, a 75 percent majority is necessary on the committee.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Addressing the nation for the first time since the revelation
of the money he received was made more than three weeks ago,
President Ezer Weizman reiterated Sunday night that he would not
resign, but for the first time suggested that his actions may have
been mistaken.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In a revised request for security aid from the United States
in connection with a Golan Heights withdrawal, Israel is asking for
nearly twice as many Tomahawk cruise missiles as it had in its
original request.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli request for Tomahawks touched off a controversy and
generated resistance among U.S. policy makers.

committed murder, kidnapping and blackmail.
</P>

Milliyet (National):

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement Guidelines on Unit Trusts Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement
the Guidelines for Registration of Institutional Agents for the
Marketing and Distribution of Unit Trusts and the Disciplinary
Proceedings effective from February 1, it was officially announced
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines prescribed, among others, the pre-requisite for
an Institutional Unit Trust Agent (IUTA), procedure for
registration, applicable fees, the basic requirement of IUTA,
pricing and dealing, consequences for non-conformity with laws and
regulations, Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi, president of the Federation
Of Malaysian Unit Trust Managers (FMUTM), said at a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
These guidelines are formulated and issued by FMUTM as a guide
for those interested to register as an institutional agents for
the purpose of marketing and distribution of unit trusts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Securities Commission had approved
the guidelines which is the first set of guidelines developed by
FMUTM for the unit trust industry. The final guidelines were
submitted some five months ago for approval, he added.
</P>
<P>
These guidelines enable eligible institutions to become third
party distributors for unit trust funds, Abdul Azim said, adding
that the unit trust industry has been pushing for the guidelines
for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He expected the agents who sell products of just one unit trust
management company to evolve in the next five years towards
forming their own little financial planning group.
</P>
<P>
He said the guidelines would increase professionalism in the
industry and provide additional avenue for marketing and
distribution with the main objective to govern the conduct of IUTA.
</P>
<P>
To be an IUTA, he said the eligible institutions must first
become Associate Members of FMUTM.
</P>
<P>
He said that as by December 31, 1999, FMUTM has 35 ordinary
members and eight associate members with the number of persons
involved in unit trusts totaling 11,293.
</P>
<P>
As by October 31, 1999, there were 33 unit trust management
companies in Malaysia with a total of 105 funds, comprising 30
government-sponsored funds and 75 private funds.
</P>
<P>
The approved fund size amount to 70.401 billion units including
those yet to be launched, according to Abdul Azim who said there
were 8.873 million accounts with units in circulation amounting to
48.714 billion units with total net asset value of 39.04 billion
ringgit (about 10.273 billion U.S. dollars), sharing 7.8 percent

KATHMANDU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Hotel industry has

"Even though the high voltage hijacking drama seems to have
been resolved, it has entailed a number of unforeseen problems in
the tourism industry," said the press release.
</P>

declined arrivals of Indian visitors and third country tourists
arriving here via Indian cities.

As a result, hotels are having occupancy between 30 and 35
percent comparing with 85 percent during this time in previous
years, they said.

she would be meeting relevant authorities to discuss and find

<HEADLINE> Somali Bandits Ambush Officials in Northern Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Heavily armed Somali
bandits have ambushed a group of local officials in Tanzania's
northern Arusha region and robbed them of their money.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Monday quoted a senior police officer as
saying that the incident occurred last Friday at Engaruka Village
in Monduli District.
</P>
<P>
The Arusha Regional Police Commissioner Juma Ng'wanang'waka
said 12 land officers and two councilors of Monduli District were
visiting the area to assess a dispute over farm allocation when
they met the Somalis armed with sub-machine guns.
</P>
<P>
He said full information would be given when his policemen came
back from the scene to track down the Somali bandits who have been
threatening peace in Ngorongoro and Monduli districts for a long
time.

Crossing from Kenya, the Somali bandits last year killed
Ngorongoro Police Commander Isaya Kong'oa and 11 other people in
one of their attacks against local villagers.
</P>

Tanzanian and Kenyan police have since launched joint
operations on both sides of the common border to flush out the
bandits.

dysfunctional family in the suburbs, was named the best dramatic
film of 1999 at the Golden Globe Awards Sunday.
</P>
<P>

The best dramatic film actress Globe was given to Hilary Swank
for her breakout role in "Boys Don't Cry," in which she played a
young woman who was killed after her masquerade as a man was
discovered.

<P>
The best dramatic film actor Globe went to Denzel Washington
for his role in "The Hurricane" Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globes, given out each year by the Hollywood Foreign

<HEADLINE> South China's Hainan Sets Economic Growth Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province in south China
expects an 8.5 percent economic growth this year, Governor Wang
Xiaofeng announced at the province's on-going people's congress.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting was the third session of the second Hainan
Provincial People's Congress, and the five-day meeting will last
until January 26.
</P>
<P>
While delivering a government work report on Saturday, Wang
said the province will make greater efforts to select good
projects to secure more state financing, including the
establishment of a special fund for development of tropical high-
efficiency agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will work out measures to
encourage domestic and overseas companies to participate in asset
reorganization of local enterprises in the form of buying equities.
</P>
<P>
The province's oversupply of open-market housing will be
reduced this year to free up capital in the real estate sector,
and investors will be welcome in a group of carefully selected
projects ranging from high-efficiency agriculture, high-tech
industry, and ecological and environmental protection, to
electronics and information in Hainan, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, Hainan had a gross domestic product of 47.2
billion yuan in 1999, up 8.6 percent from 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Translation of Living Pictographs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dongba classics were first discovered by an American
botanist in 1922. With over 2,100 characters, they are considered
more primitive than the inscriptions on tortoise shells and animal
bones discovered in central China.
</P>
<P>
However, the American failed to decipher the Dongba writing
despite a lifetime effort.
</P>
<P>
One factor making the Dongba language difficult to read is the
lack of complete sentences, only juxtaposed single words,
according to Li Jingsheng, a scholar on Dongba culture.
</P>
<P>
Several characters may tell a complete story, and sometimes, a
character in one script might not have the same meaning in another
script.
</P>
<P>
Only with the help of native Dongba masters was it possible to
understand the Dongba classics, also known as "book from the
heaven."
</P>
<P>
Some 14,000 volumes of Dongba classics can be found in Naxi
communities, and another 10,000 volumes are scattered in libraries
and museums in the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain, all of which have
researched the characters.
</P>
<P>
Dongba classics have been translated over the past years
covering the philosophy, religion, history, folk customs, music,
dance, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, geography, biology, dress,
farming, and weapons of Naxi society over the past millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Dongba Culture, which was set up in 1981 in
Lijiang County, has employed Dongba masters as senior advisors to
aid in the complete translation.

<HEADLINE> China Completes Translation of Living Pictographs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- With the help of ethnic masters,
Chinese scholars have successfully translated the world's only
living pictographs into modern languages.
</P>
<P>
Scholars announced this week that the Dongba characters which
were developed by the Naxi ethnic group in southwest China 3,000
years ago have been translated into modern Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
A set of 100 books recording the full translation of the Dongba
classic has been compiled and 20 of them have been published, at a
price of 50,000 yuan (some 6,000 U.S. dollars) per set. The
remaining 80 books are expected to be off the press at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
This was the country's largest project ever for collecting and
collating the ancient books of ethnic groups. The cooperative
project involving Chinese Naxi culture scholars and Dongba shamans
began in the early 1980s and cost four million yuan (about 500,000
U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
The Naxi ethnic group, numbering only about 240,000 people in
the rugged snow-capped mountains of southwestern China's Yunnan
Province, is facing the challenge of protecting its unique and
rich spiritual and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The Dongba characters were developed by copying animals and
other objects found in nature and are regarded as a "living fossil,
" and the only purely hieroglyphic characters are still in use.
</P>
<P>
Dongba writing was handed down by shamans from generation to
generation, but there are now only three remaining in Lijiang,
home of the Naxi and a UN World Heritage site.

</P>
<P>
He further disclosed that the ministry intends to focus on
sending more Chinese performing arts troupes to other countries
for both economic and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is now making preparations for the performance of

</P>
<P>
China's arts and cultural exchanges with foreign countries have

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Oman have agreed to implement a proposal allowing tourists to
visit the two neighboring countries on a single visa issued by
either country.
</P>
<P>
The single tourist visa scheme will come into force on November
1, 2000 and it is expected to give a big fillip to tourist inflow
to both countries, the local Khaleej Times daily reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the agreement was reached in Muscat on Sunday at
the end of a meeting of the UAE-Oman Joint Economic Committee. The
meeting was aimed at achieving further economic integration between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Oman, both members of the regional alliance Gulf
Cooperation Council, have taken a number of steps in the last
couple of years to further strengthen bilateral ties, according to
Ahmed bin Abdulnabi Macki, minister of national economy of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Considerable progress have been achieved on the issue of
employment of surplus national manpower in each other's country,
the official was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a memorandum of understanding will be signed in March by
the two countries to deal with the issue of recruiting surplus
Omani labor in the UAE and grant equal treatment for Omani and UAE
citizens in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have also agreed that telephone calls between
the two countries in some of the border areas are to be considered
as local calls.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also being made to establish a single office for
Oman and the UAE in Geneva to follow up negotiations with the World
Trade Organization (WTO) for their common benefit, the official
said. The UAE has pledged to help Oman in its bid to join the WTO.

<HEADLINE> 8 More People Released from Besieged Thai Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Another eight people, mostly
women, children and people seriously ill, were released by the
armed men, who stormed a hospital in western Thai province of
Rachaburi earlier Monday after the Thai government sent food and
drinks to them.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two men were released and a woman escaped from the
hospital in the province bordering Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The armed men also raised two new demands for the release of
more than 200 hostages who were still trapped in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the Thai government and armed forces promise
not to support or coordinate with the Myanmar government on its
current attack on the ethnic Karen rebels near the Thai-Myanmar
border.
</P>
<P>
The armed men are believed to be from the ethnic Karen rebel
group "God's Army," who fled to Thailand after the Myanmar
government troops began a drive against the separatist group.
</P>
<P>
They are believed to be dissatisfied with Thailand's tightened
border control to prevent the fightings from spilling over to the
Thai territory.
</P>
<P>
They had asked the Thai army not to fire at Karens who fled to
the Thai territory as a result of the fighting at home.

<P>
Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Surayut Chulanont, who has been
officially assigned by Thai Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Chuan Leekpai as commander of the negotiations, told reporters
that the army is willing to accept this demand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had also demanded the release of all women and
children from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Staff of the army-run television station, Channel 7, had
entered the hospital at the request of the armed men.
</P>
<P>
Pictures showed that two armed men wearing black ski masks and
holding rifles in their hands are closely watching about 40 people
trapped in the hospital's emergency unit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the armed men had also demanded the Thai
government provide medical treatment for 200 to 300 fellowmen
wounded in recent fightings between Myanmar government troops and
ethnic Karen rebels, and open the border to allow the entry of
Karen refugees into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It is reported earlier that about 1,000 Myanmar refugees had
already fled to Thailand due to the heavy fightings.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra had said
that the Myanmar government had been informed of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government later called on the international
community to recognize the armed men as "terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Thai Government Spokesman Akapol Sorasuchart had labeled the
armed men as "international terrorists."
</P>
<P>
The incident aroused Thai people's recent memory of a similar
incident last October when five armed Myanmar dissident students
stormed the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok, holding 38 people hostage
and trapping 96 people in the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
The incident ended peacefully after the Thai government agreed
to send the students to the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that "God's Army," the Karen rebel group, has
been providing refuge for the five students since the October
embassy siege incident.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Review Coffee Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
announced plans to review the Coffee Act and revise the policy on
the coffee industry,
</P>
<P>
the East African Standard newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The major change in the Act will be the separation of the
Coffee Board of Kenya's current function of regulation and
research from that of product marketing, Minister for Agriculture
and Rural Development Chris Obure said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In consultation with all the stake holders, Obure said the
government will take on the review process in the coming months
in a bid to harmonize and rationalize the operation of the
industry which is currently in dispute.
</P>
<P>
Obure noted that the electoral process will also be reviewed to
ensure equitable representation of all the stake holders.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to total liberalization and
restructuring of the industry for the benefit of all the stake
holders," Obure said.
</P>
<P>
The sales by the Central Auction System will remain, and the
system will ensure transparency and enable the best quality
product to fetch high prices at the world market, Obure added.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that the selling of coffee to unauthorized
middlemen is termed the move a contravention of the law.
</P>
<P>
Coffee production in Kenya had declined since 1988 with
harvest plummeting from 128,000 tons in 1988/1989 to 56,000 tons
in 1997/1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed optimism that coffee production will
improve with a projected growth to 85,000 tons in 1999/2000.

<HEADLINE> Debt-Equity Swap Makes New Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Five of China's state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) signed a framework agreement here today with
their creditor, the Great Wall Asset Management Corporation of
China, to swap some one billion yuan of debt for equities.
</P>
<P>
The five loss-making SOEs include the Heilongjiang Jia Xing
Floatation Plate Glass Co. Ltd., the Dalian Cement Group Company,
and three others from Hunan and Yunnan provinces and the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region. Their combined assets are valued at two
billion yuan, with debts totaling 1.8 billion yuan, and the
average asset to liability ratio is as high as 99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Heavy debt burden has caused serious losses in these
enterprises, despite their advantages of high technologies and
market shares. When the debt-equity swap plan is implemented, the
asset to liability ratio of these enterprises will be lowered to
34.3 percent on average, and they are expected to realize profits
within a year.
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall Asset Management Corporation, which will become
a major shareholder of these enterprises, will supervise and
participate in restructuring and reforming them in order to
establish modern enterprise systems.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Great Wall Asset Management Corporation has signed
debt-equity swap agreements with 18 SOEs.

<HEADLINE> 2 Released from Besieged Hospital in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Two men were released and a
woman escaped from the besieged hospital in Thailand's western
province of Rachaburi which was stormed by a group of armed men
earlier Monday, local television stations reported.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 200 people were trapped in the
hospital in the province bordering Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thai Army Commander-in-Chief Surayut Chulanont told reporters
that the army is willing to accept the armed men's demand of not
firing at the ethnic Karen rebels who were reportedly under the
attacks by the Myanmar government troops.
</P>
<P>
People from the army-run television station, Channel 7, had
entered the hospital as a response to the demand by the armed men
to deliver a speech in local television stations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the armed men had also demanded the Thai
government provide medical treatment for their fellowmen wounded
in recent fightings between Myanmar government troops and ethnic
Karen rebels and open the border to allow the entry of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Thai Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart is on the spot and
heads the negotiations with the armed men, believed to be from the
ethnic Karen rebel group "God's Army," who fled to Thailand after
the Myanmar government troops began a drive against the separatist
group.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had tightened border surveillance to prevent the
fightings from spilling over into the Thai territory.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 1,000 Myanmar refugees had fled to
Thailand due to the heavy fightings.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra told
reporters that the Myanmar government has been informed of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government declared that it has nothing to do with
the incident and told the Thai government to solve the problem by
its own way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Witness said the armed men fired to the air after they rushed
in the hospital and put bombs at the entrance to the hospital's
emergency units.
</P>
<P>
People living within the 200-meter range from the hospital have
been evacuated while all roads leading to the hospital have been
sealed off.

set victory over Barbara Schett at the Australian Open at

</P>
<P>
Williams, 18, was knocked out by Russian Elena Likhovtseva in
straight sets 6-3, 6-3.
</P>

Likhovtseva, from Moscow, was a finalist at Strasbourg last
year but this will be her first grand slam quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
She now plays former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez for a
spot in the semi-finals.
</P>

Martinez was a finalist at Australian Open in 1998 and Monday
powered her way past American Kristina Brandi 6-1, 6-1.

BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- About half of the Internet
users in China surf the 'net from their homes, according to the
latest survey by the China Internet Network Information Center (
CINIC).
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven percent of the country's Internet users are on-

Internet cafes.
</P>
<P>
This represents a big change from previous surveys, which found
that most of China's Internet users went on-line at work.
</P>
<P>
However, as more and more Chinese families have their own
computers, many of the Internet users chose to access from home
for information, entertainment, and making new friends.
</P>
<P>
The latest CINIC survey also found that 59 percent of the
Internet users access at their own expense, while 21 percent use
the service provided by their employers.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users in China has skyrocketed to nearly
nine million, according to the latest figures from the CINIC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Doctors Report Link Between Heart Disease, Baldness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. study found that
among men with high cholesterol levels, those with crown-balding
are almost three times more vulnerable to heart disease than those
without it.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be published in Monday's edition of the Archives
of Internal Medicine, was conducted by several doctors at
Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
During the eleven years covered by the study, the researchers
analyzed balding patterns and body conditions of 22,000 male
doctors between ages 40 and 84.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 of the total reported a heart disease event, of
whom 62 percent were bald.
</P>
<P>
The researchers explained that the increased heart disease risk
for the bald men is possibly connected with their elevated levels
of testosterone and a special kind of hormone.
</P>
<P>
However, men with a receding hairline are not at increased risk.
Only those going bald at the crown should pay special attention to
their blood pressure and cholesterol levels and lead a healthy
lifestyle, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Airlines To Start Major Expansion Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Airlines, the island
country's national carrier, is to embark on a massive 530 million
U.S.dollar expansion program this year to make Colombo South Asia'
s regional aviation hub, press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the airline S.K. Wickremasinghe told the state-run
Daily News that the program envisages supplementing the current
fleet by five more A330-200 aircraft together with spares and
equipment at a cost of 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft will be delivered from January to November
this year on a staggered basis.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a modernization project will be undertaken to
improve inflight kitchen services of its subsidiary Air Lanka
Catering Services Ltd. at a cost of 30 million dollars, said
Wickremasinghe.
</P>
<P>
He said the expansion program is in keeping with the demands of
the industry and with the expansion of routes as envisaged by the
airline.
</P>
<P>
The idea of expansion was not only to ensure direct inflow and
outflow from Colombo but also to increase transit traffic and
stopover holidays, Wickremasinghe said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, Sri Lanka sold a 40 percent stake in Air Lanka
and handed over its management to Dubai's Emirate Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka, established in 1979, was renamed as Sri Lankan
Airlines last July in a bid to strengthen the projection of Sri
Lanka in the international marketplace and the linkage of the
airline as the country's international airline.

<HEADLINE> Another 5-Billion-Baht Govt Bonds Sold Out in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Another five-billion-baht (135.
1-million-U.S. dollar) government saving bonds were sold out in a
few hours after being issued Monday morning, Thailand's
Independent Television Station (ITV) reported.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand issued five billion baht government bonds last
Thursday, which were sold out almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 people who had failed to buy Thursday's bonds showed
great disappointment, leading the central bank to issue the new
batch of bonds carrying the same rate of return and terms.
</P>
<P>
The five-year government bonds will offer an interest rate of 6.
4 percent, paid every six months. After-tax returns are 5.44
percent, still considerably favorable given that bank deposit
rates are now between 2.75 and 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials said last Thursday that they did not
expect the bonds would attract such frantic interest from the
public. A previous batch worth 10 billion baht (270.2 million
dollars) took 17 days to sell out.
</P>
<P>
But with interest rates on bank deposits falling to their
lowest level in Thai banking history and the stock market volatile,
depositors crave safe investments with higher returns to guard
their hard-earned savings, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Investors can sell the bonds to local financial institutions
after six months.
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be used to help finance the 110-billion-baht (2.
9-billion-dollar) budget deficit of the Thai government expected
for the fiscal year 2000, which runs from October 1999 to
September 2000.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Offers Reward for Information on Assassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's police on Monday
issued a public notice offering a cash reward of 2 million rupees
(28,000 U.S. dollars) for any information relating to the
attempted assassin of President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The notice carrying two photographs of the female suicide
bomber seeks information on details such as her antecedents,
associates and accomplices, police said.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga was blinded in her right eye when a
suicide bomber exploded herself in an assassination attempt on the
president at an election rally on December 18, 1999 in central
Colombo. 24 persons including several security personnel died in
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The police want to know whether the bomber was in Colombo or in
the suburbs, what her haunts were, whom she associated with, who
harbored her and who brought her and the suicide kit to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Although over a month has elapsed since the incident and
American experts were brought in to help with the investigations,
no major breakthrough has been made despite several hundred
persons being interrogated.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the suicide bombing on the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels who are fighting for independence for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Meet EU Foreign Ministers on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat is due to meet with foreign ministers of the European Union
(EU) on Monday to discuss the latest development in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers, who will examine how the Middle East
peace process is progressing during their first General Affairs
Council meeting this year, are scheduled to meet with Arafat at a
lunch session of the council meeting.
</P>
<P>
During their debate on the Middle East peace process, foreign
ministers from the 15 EU member states will hear reports by Jaime
Gama and Javier Solana, president- in-office of the EU Council of
Ministers and the EU's high representative for Common Foreign and
Security Policy respectively, about their visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Gama, who has just returned from
the Middle East with Solana, described the peace process as "
broadly favorable."
</P>
<P>
He told a European Parliament meeting that there is still one
or two bottlenecks: the delay in the timetable for starting the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank and the delay in
the Israel-Syria talks.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for External Relations Chris Patten also said
in parliament last week that the EU has to press on in joint
efforts with the United States, Russia and other interested
parties so as to achieve lasting peace in the region, adding that
the EU has a key role to play in the peace process, as has been
recognized by both the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also to help find a solution to the problem posed by
the 5 million Palestinian refugees, the biggest group of refugees
in the world, Patten said.

WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Grant Hill couldn't play in
the Detroit Pistons' game against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday
with a bruised hip and back.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who leads the Pistons in scoring (27.3) and assists (5.7),
was injured in Saturday's 98-92 loss at Chicago when he fell hard
while trying for a steal.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to miss Tuesday's game at Cleveland, but
the Pistons are hoping to have him in the lineup Thursday in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
The only significant injury of Hill's career came during his
rookie season of 1994-95, when he missed 12 games with plantar
fascitis. In the four-plus seasons since, he had played in 330 of
Detroit's 335 games before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It feels a little better today, but not good enough," Hill
said before the game. "If it feels good Tuesday, I'll be out there.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks' Bad Loans Rise in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Continuing the previous month's
reversal, nonperforming loans (NPLs) of the Philippines'
commercial banking system increased to 14.61 percent of total
loans in the first 11 months of 1999, Business World reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources from the Central Bank of the
Philippines as saying that the NPL figure of last November was the
highest level ever posted since the outbreak of the East Asia
financial crisis over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs as a percentage of total loans of the 53 commercial
banks as of end-Novenmber was a 0.11 percent deterioration from
the 14.5 percent recorded in last October when the trend began and
saw NPLs rise from 13.36 percent, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura attributed the rising
NPLs to the sluggish growth of the total loans.
</P>
<P>
He explained that higher NPLs for last November stemmed from a
4.2 percent increase in bad loans that offset the 3.4 percent
increase in total loan portfolio.
</P>
<P>
As of end-November, NPLs stood at 226.7 billion pesos (5.67
billion U.S. dollars), while total loans, inclusive of short-term
interbank loans, stood at 1.55 trillion pesos (38.7 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura predicted that the December 1999 NPL figure will
decline due to higher loan takeouts and less bad loans due to
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the governor said the NPL level was not a major
concern as long as it remained capped within the 15 percent range.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 18 people were killed
in renewed communal clashes in Central Maluku, Indonesia, on
Sunday on the eve of a visit by Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 people were injured in the clash, according to reports
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-Christian violence took place in Haruku Island,
about 16 km east of the island of Ambon or more than 2,000 km from
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer quoted a lawyer for a Christian support
group as saying that the latest bloodshed occurred when a group of
Muslims attacked three villages in Haruku.
</P>
<P>
"Three Christian villages were attacked this morning (Sunday
morning) by a Muslim mob," said Semmy Waileruny, who represents
the Communion of Indonesian Churches for Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the escalating violence is unknown but many feel
it is a continuation of the religious clashes which have been
taking place on the Maluku islands for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The latest outbreak came less than 24 hours before Megawati's
arrival in Tual, southeast Maluku, and Ambon, capital of Maluku,
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Megawati has been placed in charge of restoring peace in Maluku,
where over 1,000 people have been killed since January last year
when first communal fighting in the territory erupted.
</P>
<P>
In her two-day visit, Megawati is scheduled to hold a series of
meetings with various circles including community and religious
leaders from the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Her last visit to Maluku in December last year was followed by
the outbreak of more clashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has reduced the bank's overnight lending rate to 11
percent, effective Monday, from 12 percent to improve liquidity in
the monetary system and facilitate faster growth in credit, local
newspaper Today reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the rate cut approved last Friday by the
central bank would bring its overnight lending rate back to its
level before December 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Central Bank Governor Rafael Buenaventura as
saying that the bank reduced its overnight lending rate also
because it believed that the Y2K bug has already been crushed.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said that with the Y2K fear over and demand for
liquidity down, the central bank felt that it would now be safe to
bring down the overnight lending rate.

The central bank on December 16 last year increased the
overnight interest rate, unchanged at 11 percent for about five
months, by one percentage point to 12 percent to discourage banks
from going to the central bank for their Y2K-related liquidity
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the cut in the central bank's overnight
lending rate is expected to reinforce the signal that interest
rates of the country should remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper noted, it also indicates the strong
confidence of the monetary authorities that the exchange rate will
remain steady despite a possible hike in U.S. interest rates next
month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's overnight borrowing rate remains unchanged
at the two-tiered rate system paying 8.75 percent for the first
500 million pesos (12.5 million U.S. dollars) lent to the bank and
8.5 percent for amounts in excess.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers to Discuss Ties with Russia, Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the 15-
nation European Union (EU) will discuss the organization's
relations with Russia and the Balkans at their first General
Affairs Council meeting under Portugal's presidency on Monday in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Security and defense as well as institutional reform issues are
expected to be priorities at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said some decisions are expected on Russia and the
Balkans. On Russia, the Council of EU ministers will have to take
a very delicate decision on how to balance the spirit of the
Helsinki Summit last December on Chechnya-related sanctions and
the longer-term interests of building relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
On the Balkans, decisions to be taken include setting up new
links with Croatia, defining a desirable path towards a Stability
and Association Agreement with Albania, and giving the European
Commission a mandate to negotiate with the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the ministers must decide how far, in the new,
post-Yeltsin context, it makes sense to damage long-term EU
interests by stifling its relations with Russia at the start of
what could be a new era.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who takes over the six-month rotating EU presidency
this January, made it clear in the run-up to this meeting that the
EU has "to take note of the democratic conduct of the recent Duma
elections and of the smooth, constitutional transition of power
after the resignation of President Yeltsin," and that the EU wants
to do everything it can to boost the chances of a free and fair
campaign for the Russian presidential elections scheduled for
March 26.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the EU General Affairs Council is likely to
underline the importance it attaches to Russia as a major partner
of the EU.

opportunity to accelerate the economic development in China's
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji analyzed the current favorable conditions

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Successful but Still Challenging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to fulfill
its commitment to helping 80 million poor people out of poverty by
the end of a seven-year period that will end with the close of
2000, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
But official sources said the country still cannot relent in
its anti-poverty efforts.
</P>
<P>
Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was quoted as
saying that despite significant achievements in its campaign to
eliminate abject poverty, the country faces an arduous task as it
addresses relative poverty and works to keep those already lifted
from destitution from falling back.
</P>
<P>
Yang made the remarks yesterday at a national meeting of the "
Foundation for Undeveloped Regions in China" (FURC), an
organization created 10 years ago to "encourage all walks of
society to combat poverty in China".
</P>
<P>
Yang said even though the overwhelming majority of poor have
been raised above the poverty line, people with low incomes and
unfavorable development opportunities continue to encounter
difficulties in their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
He said these people are very vulnerable and could decline into
relative poverty. He then listed that rural inhabitants who have
escaped poverty may fall back into destitution if they become
victims of cut-throat market competition or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Urban poverty is also in the category, he said, because many
redundant workers of State-owned enterprises have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
He added that though the country's efforts have eliminated
poverty in major parts of China, poverty-alleviation is extremely
challenging in remote regions such as parts of Yunnan, Sichuan and
dry areas of the northwestern Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
He urged non-governmental organizations such as the FURC to
help overcome obstacles to combating destitution.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Egypt Win Openers of African Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- African soccer giants South
Africa and Egypt both took their opening matches on Sunday at the
22nd African Cups of Nations being co-hosted by Nigeria and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa fell behind to a first half goal scored by
Gabon's 16-year-old Chiva Star Nzighou, the youngest player ever
to take part in the tournament, before hitting back to win 3-1 in
group B with Shaun Bartlett scoring twice
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Kumasi, a Ghanaian
northern city, where the match took place, Gabon kept the lead by
Nzighou's goal 20 minutes after the match's opening, until the
42nd minute when Dumisa Ngobe equalised with a header from Quinton
Fortune's free kick.
</P>
<P>
In the fist group C match held in Nigeria's northern city Kano,
Egypt got off their defense of the African Cup of Nations in 1998
to a perfect start with a straight victory over Zambia in the
opening Group C match.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian stars Yasser Radwan and Hossam Hassan scored either
side of half-time, beating Zambia by 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Radwan fired the defending champions ahead with a diving header
after 37 minutes. And veteran striker Hassan, Egypt's key player
in their cup triumph two years ago, wrapped up the victory five
minutes after the break.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who scored seven goals during his side's victorious
campaign in Burkina Faso, claimed his first of the 2000 tournament
when he finished off good work from Ahmed Salah Hosni.

<HEADLINE> Fast Food Brings Northwest China Modern Touch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Tasting hamburgers, French
fries, and fried chicken, just like in the foreign song "Right
Here Waiting," is really something special for the people in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. fast-food restaurant Hawaii Express Inc., the first of
its kind, came to the region two months ago and has become very
popular among the locals.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, other fast-food restaurants like Happy
Tom, and Mkmu, have also taken their places on the streets. No
alcoholic drinks and no smoking in these restaurants may bring
some discomfort, but the "fast" food and clean and cozy
atmosphere make up for it.
</P>
<P>
"Fast food is more than just a different taste, for us, it is a
taste of a new life style," said Xu Long as he enjoyed his Hawaii
hamburgers. The region is the last in northwest China to introduce
foreign fast food.
</P>
<P>
Hamburgers and fried chicken, brought by the opening to the
outside world, have resulted in a "revolution" to the local people,
starting from what they eat, and extending its influence to how
they live and what they think.
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing at all that a meal with friends will last for
several hours," said Xu, adding that sometimes it may even occupy
working hours, as the Chinese have traditionally held a strong
belief that people can become more intimate, and any dispute or
conflict can be solved at the dining table.
</P>
<P>
But what a modern society really needs is also a rapid rhythm
of life, not just a leisurely and easy pace.
</P>
<P>
" It is a positive phenomenon that so many fast food
restaurants have sprung up," said one local official, "a change of
mind in the long run will enable us to grasp the opportunities for
developing western China."
</P>
<P>
China is now giving more importance to the economic development
of its western region, which have been slow to economic growth. In
the past few years, 8.31 million U.S. dollars of foreign funds
have been used to create 40 entertainment centers and restaurants
in the western region, bringing a modern touch to the local people.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Leader Arrives in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao,
leader of the independence movements of East Timor and chairman of
CNRT, arrived here this morning for a four-day visit to China.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao and Vice-
Premier Qian Qichen will meet with Gusmao, and Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan will hold talks with him, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said at a press conference last week.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to discuss the situation in East
Timor and the future China-East Timor relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China respects the choice of the people of East Timor, and
believes that relevant issues should be properly solved under the
framework of the United Nations, Zhu said, adding that an early
restoration of stability in East Timor is in the interests of all
the countries in the region, and China will continue to take a
responsible attitude, and closely cooperate with relevant parties,
so as to contribute to a stable transition in East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Super Eagles Make Flying Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Super Eagles made an
excellent debut on Sunday in the African Cup of Nations tournament
with a 4-2 victory here over Tunisia to the content of their home
fans.
</P>
<P>
Austin Okocha and Victor Ikpeba both scored double goals for
Nigeria while Aziez Walid and Adel Sellimi netted in for Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
With 28 minutes into the game, Okocha collected a neat through-
ball on the right flank from England-based African Footballer of
the Year, Nwankwo Kanu, to slot home a powerful shot through the
legs of two Tunisian defenders and past their goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes into the second half, the Tunisians netted in an
equaliser through a header off Azaiez Walid.
</P>
<P>
However, the Super Eagles gave their counterparts no time to
respire as Okocha scored his second in the 58th minute, and Victor
Ikpeba increased Nigeria's lead several minutes later with two
more goals in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian Striker Adel Sellimi also netted his shot later, which
was in vain to turn over the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, co-hosts of this year's tournament with Ghana, was
pinning high expectations upon its team, which had won the
championship in 1980 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nigerians are also enthusiastic with the biennial event. Lagos
police Saturday had a rough time dispersing angry soccer fans, who
stormed the National Stadium here to either buy tickets or watch
Super Eagles in their last workout ahead of Sunday's fight in
Group D with Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian team has only recently reached Lagos led by its Dutch
coach Johanese Bonfrere from its training camp in Malaga, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Bonfrere has been managing to keep his team away from the
fanfare of the public to make his men concentrate on the matches.

<HEADLINE> Owen Called in for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Michael Owen was called in for
intensive treatment less than 24 hours after his fifth hamstring
problem in nine months.
</P>
<P>
The Liverpool star spent this morning with the club's physios
and medical experts at the Merseysiders' Mellwood training ground.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool spokesman Ian Cotton said: "Michael has had treatment,
but we still believe that the problem is not a serious one. We do
not have a game for a fortnight now, and we are hoping he will be
fit for the next match at home to Leeds on Saturday week."
</P>
<P>
Owen will have further treatment on Monday when his teammates
are on a day off, but there are no plans at the moment for him to
return to see his German specialist.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Roy Evans, the man Gerard Houllier replaced as
Liverpool manager, has warned that Owen should not be rushed back
until the problem has been cured.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It's not right from Michael's point of view to miss a
couple of games and then to play again.
</P>
<P>
"Liverpool need to find out the source of the injury, Michael
needs for it to be cleared up and get on with his career," he said.

<HEADLINE> Leeds United Move Clear at Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Leeds staked their claim for
title glory as they put their off-field problems to one side and
registered an impressive 2-1 victory at high-flying Sunderland on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Premiership front-runners stretched their lead to four
points and sent a timely message to Manchester United and Arsenal -
who meet on Monday - that the championship is no two-horse race.
</P>
<P>
But for Sunderland, who are normally so strong at the Stadium
of Light, the defeat is a major blow to their own Champions'
League hopes.
</P>
<P>
Much of the pre-match build-up had been overshadowed by non-
footballing matters, with Leeds players Jonathan Woodgate and Lee
Bowyer questioned by police over an alleged assault in Leeds city
center.
</P>
<P>
The pair were given the public backing of manager David O'Leary
when they were included in the Leeds starting line-up.
</P>
<P>
But it was two other visiting players, Jason Wilcox and Michael
Bridges, who stole the headlines for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
Wilcox fired Leeds in front with a fine individual strike in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
And Bridges, who was given a hostile reception on his return to
his former club, effectively settled matters at the start of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland's prolific goalscorer Kevin Phillips, who was
deprived of his injured strike partner Niall Quinn, made a game of
it - but the home side could find no back despite a late rally.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, who had lost their previous two league games, now have
47 points from 22 games with Manchester United on 43 but from only
19 games.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal also have 43 points from 22 games. Liverpool are fourth
on 41 after drawing 0-0 in Middlesbrough on Saturday while
Sunderland, who have now lost five and drawn one of their last six
games, remain fifth on 38.

ROME, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Fabio Carta of Italy took his
second title by triumphing in the 3,000-meter event at the
European Short Track Speedskating Championship in Bormio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After his victory on Saturday in the 500 meters, the Italian
finished Sunday's race in 4 minutes 50.37 seconds, ahead of
Britain's Nicky Gooch and Italy's Michele Antonioli.
